"A patient receives Covid care in Tunisia Covid has severely affected healthcare staff and may have killed between 80,000 and 180,000, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Healthcare workers must be prioritised for vaccines, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, and he criticised unfairness in the distribution of jabs. The deaths occurred between January 2020 and May of this year. Earlier, another senior WHO official warned a lack of jabs could see the pandemic continue well into next year. There are an estimated 135 million healthcare workers globally. ""Data from 119 countries suggest that on average, two in five healthcare workers globally are fully vaccinated,"" Dr Tedros said. ""But of course, that average masks huge differences across regions and economic groupings."" Fewer than one in 10 healthcare workers were fully vaccinated in Africa, he said, compared with eight in 10 in high-income countries. A failure to provide poorer countries with enough vaccines was highlighted earlier by Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior leader at the WHO, who said it meant the Covid crisis could ""easily drag on deep into 2022"". Less than 5% of Africa's population have been vaccinated, compared with 40% on most other continents. The vast majority of Covid vaccines overall have been used in high-income or upper middle-income countries. Africa accounts for just 2.6% of doses administered globally. More than 50 countries missing Covid vaccine target Covax: How many Covid vaccines have the US and the other G7 countries pledged? Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? The original idea behind Covax, the UN-backed global programme to distribute vaccines fairly, was that all countries would be able to acquire vaccines from its pool, including wealthy ones, writes BBC Global Affairs correspondent Naomi Grimley. But most G7 countries decided to hold back once they started making their own one-to-one deals with pharmaceutical companies. This video can not be played Ros Atkins looks at the ethics of Western countries rolling out Covid booster jabs while millions globally remain unvaccinated Dr Aylward appealed to wealthy countries to give up their places in the queue for vaccines so that pharmaceutical companies can prioritise the lowest-income countries instead. He said wealthy countries needed to ""stocktake"" where they were with their donation commitments made at summits such as the G7 meeting in St Ives this summer. ""I can tell you we're not on track,"" he said. ""We really need to speed it up or you know what? This pandemic is going to go on for a year longer than it needs to."" The People's Vaccine - an alliance of charities - has released new figures suggesting just one in seven of the doses promised by pharmaceutical companies and wealthy countries are actually reaching their destinations in poorer countries. The alliance, which includes Oxfam and UNAids, also criticised Canada and the UK for procuring vaccines for their own populations via Covax. Official figures show that earlier this year the UK received 539,370 Pfizer doses from Covax while Canada took just under a million AstraZeneca doses. Oxfam's Global Health Adviser, Rohit Malpani, acknowledged that Canada and the UK were technically entitled to get vaccines via this route having paid into the Covax mechanism, but he said it was still ""morally indefensible"" given that they had both obtained millions of doses through their own bilateral agreements. The UK government pointed out it was one of the countries which had ""kick-started"" Covax last year with a donation of Â£548m. The UK has also delivered more than 10 million vaccines to countries in need, and has pledged a total of 100 million. The Canadian government was keen to stress that it had now stopped using Covax vaccines. The country's International Development Minister, Karina Gould, said: ""As soon as it became clear that the supply we had secured through our bilateral deals would be sufficient for the Canadian population, we pivoted the doses which we had procured from Covax back to Covax, so they could be redistributed to developing countries."" Covax originally aimed to deliver two billion doses of vaccines by the end of this year, but so far it has shipped 371m doses.

"The report pays tribute to care workers' professionalism and resilience There will be ""a tsunami"" of people without the care they need this winter unless staff shortages are tackled, England's care watchdog is warning. Social care staff are ""exhausted and depleted,"" says Care Quality Commission (CQC) chief executive, Ian Trenholm. In a report, the CQC urges immediate work to address the problem of rising numbers of unfilled care sector jobs. On Thursday, the government announced an extra Â£162.5m to boost the adult social care workforce. This is in addition to Â£5.4bn earmarked for social care over the next three years from the government's health and social care levy, which already includes Â£500m to be spent on the workforce. The CQC welcomes the money but has a warning: ""It must be used to enable new ways of working that recognise the interdependency of all health and care settings, not just to prop up existing approaches and to plug demand in acute care."" Care staff shortage harming services, say managers Care staff shortages pile pressure on NHS Social care changes at-a-glance In its latest State of Health and Social Care in England report, the CQC confirms fears that social care providers are facing a staffing crisis, losing staff to better paid jobs in retail and hospitality, and unable to recruit replacements. Across England, numbers of unfilled jobs are rising month on month, the researchers found, from 6% in April to more than 10% in September. London is worst affected with 11% of jobs vacant, followed by the East Midlands at 9.4% and the South West at 9.2%. This means care providers are having to limit their services, the researchers found. This video can not be played Care minister Gillian Keegan: ""We want to get more hours in the system"" In Devon, Rebecca Marks, director of Ark Care Homes, says more than one in five of their beds are empty, because they cannot afford to staff them. She says current staff are exhausted after the pandemic, and despite the company offering funding for training and qualifications, and paying joining bonuses, ""they are saying: 'You know, I'm going to go and work in a supermarket'"". ""We need help and we need it fast... whether it's funding to be able to pay our staff higher wages to represent the responsibility and the amazing job that they do, or something different. ""It's a very difficult place for care providers and care staff, and ultimately our residents."" Oona Goldsworthy, who oversees five care homes in the south-west of England, told BBC Breakfast she was ""literally throwing everything"" at the problem to try and fill vacancies - including increasing wages. ""We have to recognise paying carers the minimum wage is just not acceptable any more,"" she said. By Alison Holt, social affairs editor In the measured tones of a regulator, this report makes it clear that a staffing crisis in the long overlooked care system has much broader consequences. A ""tsunami of unmet need"" is more than a striking phrase. It represents a lack of support that can leave someone who is disabled or in the later years of their life struggling - alone or with family, facing grinding daily difficulties and too often deterioration that ends in crisis. It is distressing for those at the heart of it and pressure on an overstretched NHS that with the right support might have been avoided. The extra money the government has announced will help, but councils and care organisations have been quick to say it won't be enough. And the suggestion it could lead to tens of thousands of new care staff is likely to be greeted with a wry smile coming just 18 months after the last government recruitment campaign failed to do that. Unpaid carers who look after relatives at home are among those hit hard by the staffing squeeze. Dorothy Cook cares for her husband Melvin, at home in Bristol. Melvin is in the advanced stages of a degenerative brain disease which has left him unable to wash, dress, shower or feed himself without her help. Dorothy Cook cares full-time for her husband Melvin Following a fall in February, he was in hospital for six weeks, and then spent four months in a rehabilitation unit. Melvin is meant to have a care package at home but the provider ended it after five weeks, as his condition was too complex for them to manage. That was 12 weeks ago, and Dorothy is struggling. ""It all falls on my shoulders, and I'm on my knees with exhaustion,"" she told the BBC. ""We both feel completely and utterly alone. We feel that nobody cares."" Carers UK, which represents unpaid people like Dorothy, saysa survey of 8,000 of its members,externalsuggests more than half (55%) have lost some or all of the support they need, since the pandemic. The government says it will take steps to ensure that unpaid carers have the support, advice and respite they need, with more detail to be published later this year. Care companies say the main factors making it hard to find and keep staff are: burnout from the pandemic compulsory vaccinations in care homes higher pay available in other sectors as the economy picks up post-Brexit immigration rule changes In its report, the CQC pays tribute ""to the professionalism and resilience of everyone that works in social care"", but according to chief executive Ian Trenholm: ""Those people cannot be expected to work any harder. ""If we're to get safely through this winter, there needs to be urgent action."" He says local leaders of health and social care services will need ""to make maximum use of everything they have at their disposal to get safely through the winter... If these things don't happen there is the genuine risk of a tsunami of unmet need, with many people not getting the care that they so desperately need this winter."" He believes the key is more collaboration between services and urges a rapid overhaul: ""We can't be in this position in a year's time. We need to be thinking about what systems will look like in the future. ""We are really clear, there are no silver bullets, there are no simple answers to what is a very, very complex problem."" A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""We appreciate the dedication and tireless work of health and social care staff throughout the pandemic. ""We have provided record levels of investment to support them and will provide Â£36bn over the next three years for health and social care across the UK. ""We are working on health and social care reform to ensure we can provide world-leading services and are committed to learning lessons from the pandemic, with a full public inquiry in the spring."" Shadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, called the report ""devastating"", saying the government's recentsocial care announcementwould not help. ""Labour is calling for a ten-year plan of investment and reform,"" to include a new deal to transform pay, training and conditions for care staff, and a shift in focus towards prevention and early intervention, said Ms Kendall.

"The Queen spent Wednesday night in hospital for preliminary medical checks and is now back at Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace has said. The 95-year-old monarch returned from the private hospital in central London at lunchtime on Thursday and is ""in good spirits"", the palace added. The Queen had cancelled a visit to Northern Ireland on Wednesday. She was given medical advice to rest for a few days aftera busy schedule of public engagements. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""everybody sends Her Majesty our very very best wishes"". He added he was ""given to understand that actually Her Majesty is characteristically back at her desk at Windsor as we speak"". In a statement on Thursday night, Buckingham Palace said: ""Following medical advice to rest for a few days, the Queen attended hospital on Wednesday afternoon for some preliminary investigations, returning to Windsor Castle at lunchtime today, and remains in good spirits."" In pictures: The Queen's busy October schedule Royal Family tree Queen cancels Northern Ireland trip on medical advice Queen declines Oldie of the Year award The Queen travelled by car to the King Edward VII's Hospital in Marylebone, about 19 miles (32km) from Windsor, where she was seen by specialists. Her admittance is understood not to be related to coronavirus. The overnight stay was said to be for practical reasons and the Queen was undertaking light duties back at Windsor on Thursday afternoon. It is the first time the Queen has stayed in hospital since 2013, when she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis. The King Edward VII's is a private hospital used by senior royals - including the Queen's husband, the late Duke of Edinburgh, who received treatment there earlier this year. The news on Wednesday that the Queen would have to cancel a trip to Northern Ireland was always going to cause concern. Despite looking very well and happy at the numerous events she has attended over the past week, it cannot be forgotten that she is 95 years old. It is a tricky balance for the palace to release enough details about the Queen's health to keep the public informed while maintaining the privacy to which she is entitled. It was for this reason that the news that she had been taken to hospital for tests was not announced, until a report on the Sun newspaper's front page forced the palace's hand. People will be concerned, but the reassuring guidance remains that she is in ""good spirits"" on her return from hospital and is well enough to undertake some light duties. It has been a busy period of official engagements for the Queen. An official record of the Queen's diary showed at least 16 formal events during October, and there had been the plans for her to embark on the two-day trip to Northern Ireland this week. She was pictured hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening alongside Mr Johnson. However, on Wednesday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said the monarch had ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"". He said the Queen was ""disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland"" - which would have involved an overnight stay. The Queen began the month in Scotland, planting a tree with the Prince of Wales at the Balmoral Estate on1 Octoberandattending the opening of the sixth session of the Scottish Parliamentin Edinburghthe following day. Prince Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland, planted a tree with his mother to launch a tree-planting initiative The following week, she met members of the Canadian military at Windsor Castle on6 Octoberand attended the launch of the Commonwealth Games baton relay at Buckingham Palace on7 October. Last week, on12 October, she attended a church service to mark the centenary of The Royal British Legion at Westminster Abbey. She then travelled to Wales toopen the sixth term of the SeneddonThursday. BySaturdayshe was back in England - attending Champions Day at Ascot racecourse in Berkshire. And onTuesday eveningshe was back at Windsor Castle hosting the Global Investment Summit. The Queen was pictured alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday The Queen is expected to lead a royal delegation to the Glasgow COP26 climate change summit in two weeks' time. In reported remarks overheard at an event last week, sheappeared to suggest she was irritatedby people who ""talk"" but ""don't do"" when it came to protecting the environment. Earlier this week, the Queen declined a magazine's award of Oldie of the Year,saying ""you are only as old as you feel"". She ""politely but firmly"" turned down the award, but sent the Oldie magazine a message with her ""warmest best wishes"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Covid: ""We are sticking with our plan."" More than 50,000 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK for the first time since 17 July. Amid calls for more restrictions, Boris Johnson urged people to come forward for booster jabs when their time comes. The prime minister said those who become eligible for a third dose of vaccine should organise an appointment straight away. The UK recorded 52,009 new Covid cases on Thursday - alongside 115 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Mr Johnson said, despite high cases, the government was ""continuing with its plan"" and that things were much better now than a year ago. He said that was in large part thanks to the rollout of the vaccine, which has weakened the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths. Reported cases on 17 July were 54,674 and came several weeks after more households could mix together and indoor hospitality resumed. Doctors are demanding ministers trigger England's ""Plan B"" - which would reimpose rules such as mandatory face masks and working from home advice. Why are UK Covid cases so high? When will I get a booster jab? Are people wearing masks less often? Speaking in Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson said that the numbers of infections and deaths being seen were ""within the parameters of what the predictions were... given the steps we've taken"". It was also because the country was in an ""incomparably better position than last year because of vaccines"" that there was more confidence around the current plan in place,"" he said. He also insisted that the ""most important thing people can do is get that booster jab"" and that ""when you get the call, get the jab"". The PM appealed for 12 to 15-years-old to get their first vaccination because there was ""no shortage of supply"" and there were ""huge quantities"" of vaccine available. An estimated 4.7 million booster doses - which come at least six months after second jabs - have now been delivered in the UK. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ministers were letting the ""security wall against the virus... crumble"" and the booster programme was ""stalling"". But Prof Jeremy Brown, an adviser to the government on vaccines, said Sir Keir's criticism was ""not an accurate description of what's going on"". ""The problem at the moment [is] the people coming to hospital with severe Covid and ending up in intensive care and dying are those who've not had any vaccines,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. Under the government's plan for tackling Covid in England over the winter, the strategy currently in operation is Plan A. It involves offering booster jabs to about 30 million people and offering a single vaccine dose to healthy 12 to 15-year-olds, as well as encouraging ventilation for indoor gatherings, hand-washing and face masks in crowded places. Daily UK infections have been above 40,000 for nine days in a row. Analysis by BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby Daily cases of coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen slightly. Cases last went above 50,000 in mid-July and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being introduced. It's possible that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening. The current strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable, and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to increase protection among the population. Free testing is also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid rates in Europe. In 10-19 year olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections could leak into other age groups. A change in people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on the NHS ahead of winter. Scientists say it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination programme hadn't even started yet. Case rates are rising in all but one region of England, the UK Health Security Agency said, with the lowest rates in London. Rates of Covid were highest in those aged 10 to 19-years-old, with the lowest seen in those over 80. There were 8,142 patients with Covid in hospital as of Wednesday, the latest data showed, with 872 patients with Covid in beds equipped with ventilators. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the doctors' union the British Medical Association, said it can ""categorically"" say that the ""time is now"" for starting Plan B. He stressed that case numbers were comparable to March, when England was in lockdown, and were ""unheard of in similar European nations"". ""It is therefore incredibly concerning that [Mr Javid] is not willing to take immediate action to save lives and to protect the NHS,"" he said. Across the UK, booster jabs are being offered to: Over-50s Frontline health and social care workers Older adults in residential care homes People aged 16-49 years old with underlying health conditions which put them at greater risk of severe Covid Adults who share a household with vulnerable people The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination, and will typically be either Pfizer or Moderna. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that ""at this point"" the government would not introduce itsPlan B measures. However, he also warned insufficient vaccine uptake would make restrictions in England more likely. And he said infections could soon rise to around 100,000 per day.

"This video can not be played Robyn says she went from having a few drinks to being dragged to the toilet A woman who said she had her drink spiked in a pub felt ""gaslighted"" by police officers after trying to find a way to verify it. Robyn, 26, blacked out after just a few drinks with friends in Caerphilly county and said she was ""sent round in circles"" trying to be taken seriously. It comes as aboycott of clubsin some cities will take place, including Cardiff, on 29 October. Gwent Police said anyone dissatisfied with their service could contact them. Ch Supt Mark Hobrough added: ""Across the organisation, officers and staff are committed to providing a high quality of service to all those they come into contact with."" Police concern over drink spiking at house parties Students call for club boycott over drink spiking Do men know enough about drink spiking? Robyn was out when she said she ""just blacked out"" after only having a few drinks. She has no recollection of her fiancÃ©e picking her up and was told the next morning she was ""a mess"", having collapsed on the floor. She said she knew she had been spiked and called 101 and 111. She was sent to A&E, where she was told they could not perform the test. Robyn's fiancÃ©e (left) picked her up from the pub and thought she was drunk because of the way she was acting She then contacted the police again and said she was ""treated like a criminal"" and described the experience as ""just awful"". She felt officers were ""accusatory"" towards her for drinking and said the ""mental gymnastics"" she went through ""took its toll"". Gaslighting is defined as manipulating someone into thinking they are wrong even when they are right. Police closed the case as ""no offences were identified"". Tests can be done to see if drugs are in a person's system, but it needs to be within 12 to 72 hours. Robyn said the processes were not there to allow this and even though she ""pushed hard"", she would be put off reporting again as she does not think it is taken seriously. She said: ""It happened in a place I really did not expect it to happen and that is what scared me. ""It isn't about me, it is about other people and I feel really worried for women who have got to go through the same thing. ""They don't seem to take it seriously unless something really bad has happened, but people getting spiked against their will is bad in itself. ""There needs to be intervention to stop something worse happening."" A campaign in Cardiff called Girls' Night In  is encouraging people to boycott clubs in order to have drink spiking taken more seriously. Similar events are also happening in Leeds, Edinburgh and Nottingham. Organiser Sophie - not her real name -  said the Instagram page got daily messages of people's experiences being spiked and the support was ""overwhelming"". The stories vary from being safely taken home by friends to being injected with needles or sexually assaulted, she said. ""It's all well and good telling people it's not good enough but actually doing something to make clubs change is something else. ""As victims I don't think you should be expected to protect yourselves."" She added that training needs to implemented in bars ""so it can be spotted"", as well as tests and bottle caps being available in every bar as a temporary measure. Katie Snaith said she lost control of her body and was worried what reaction spiking could have had with her anti-depressants Katie Snaith, 20, is a second year history student at Cardiff University. When she had her drink spiked, she ""blacked out"" for the whole night and lost control of her body, becoming ""violently ill"". She reported it to the police and students' union the next day but said she was told not much could come of it as she did not take a test. Katie takes anti-depressants and said people on medication could be given something that could kill them. She said: ""I'm always very careful, so I think my friends were a bit confused as to why I was behaving in a way they've never seen me like before. ""It's not my fault I'm on medication and it's not my fault that I got spiked but you then kind of internalise it and feel like it was your mistake and think 'I should have done more, this, that or the other'. ""I think it's quite scary. You're always taught to be safe but even within your own union, with students who study at same place as you, you're not safe with them. ""It's hard to feel safe anywhere."" Source: Drinkaware Figures obtained by the BBC in 2019 revealeda rise in recorded cases of drink spiking, with more than 2,600 reported incidents in England and Wales since 2015. Helena Conibear, CEO of theAlcohol Education Trust,external, said the reported numbers were not reflective as many people did not report it or even know they have been spiked. She said spiking happened at festivals or house parties, which meant it was not always strangers that people need to be wary of. Lat week, the charity opened a survey and had almost 800 responses in five days. Out of the respondents, 16% of women, 8% of men and 17% of people identifying as other said they had been spiked. Of these, 91% did not report it to police, which Ms Conibear said could be down to embarrassment or fear of not being believed. Ms Conibear said: ""This is not something that is not funny or a joke. It can be life changing for the person who's been spiked."" She said it was important to report it as quickly as possible to prevent it happening to others.

"The Queen spent Wednesday night in hospital for preliminary medical checks and is now back at Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace has said. The 95-year-old monarch returned from the private hospital in central London at lunchtime on Thursday and is ""in good spirits"", the palace added. The Queen had cancelled a visit to Northern Ireland on Wednesday. She was given medical advice to rest for a few days aftera busy schedule of public engagements. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""everybody sends Her Majesty our very very best wishes"". He added he was ""given to understand that actually Her Majesty is characteristically back at her desk at Windsor as we speak"". In a statement on Thursday night, Buckingham Palace said: ""Following medical advice to rest for a few days, the Queen attended hospital on Wednesday afternoon for some preliminary investigations, returning to Windsor Castle at lunchtime today, and remains in good spirits."" In pictures: The Queen's busy October schedule Royal Family tree Queen cancels Northern Ireland trip on medical advice Queen declines Oldie of the Year award The Queen travelled by car to the King Edward VII's Hospital in Marylebone, about 19 miles (32km) from Windsor, where she was seen by specialists. Her admittance is understood not to be related to coronavirus. The overnight stay was said to be for practical reasons and the Queen was undertaking light duties back at Windsor on Thursday afternoon. It is the first time the Queen has stayed in hospital since 2013, when she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis. The King Edward VII's is a private hospital used by senior royals - including the Queen's husband, the late Duke of Edinburgh, who received treatment there earlier this year. The news on Wednesday that the Queen would have to cancel a trip to Northern Ireland was always going to cause concern. Despite looking very well and happy at the numerous events she has attended over the past week, it cannot be forgotten that she is 95 years old. It is a tricky balance for the palace to release enough details about the Queen's health to keep the public informed while maintaining the privacy to which she is entitled. It was for this reason that the news that she had been taken to hospital for tests was not announced, until a report on the Sun newspaper's front page forced the palace's hand. People will be concerned, but the reassuring guidance remains that she is in ""good spirits"" on her return from hospital and is well enough to undertake some light duties. It has been a busy period of official engagements for the Queen. An official record of the Queen's diary showed at least 16 formal events during October, and there had been the plans for her to embark on the two-day trip to Northern Ireland this week. She was pictured hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening alongside Mr Johnson. However, on Wednesday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said the monarch had ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"". He said the Queen was ""disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland"" - which would have involved an overnight stay. The Queen began the month in Scotland, planting a tree with the Prince of Wales at the Balmoral Estate on1 Octoberandattending the opening of the sixth session of the Scottish Parliamentin Edinburghthe following day. Prince Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland, planted a tree with his mother to launch a tree-planting initiative The following week, she met members of the Canadian military at Windsor Castle on6 Octoberand attended the launch of the Commonwealth Games baton relay at Buckingham Palace on7 October. Last week, on12 October, she attended a church service to mark the centenary of The Royal British Legion at Westminster Abbey. She then travelled to Wales toopen the sixth term of the SeneddonThursday. BySaturdayshe was back in England - attending Champions Day at Ascot racecourse in Berkshire. And onTuesday eveningshe was back at Windsor Castle hosting the Global Investment Summit. The Queen was pictured alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday The Queen is expected to lead a royal delegation to the Glasgow COP26 climate change summit in two weeks' time. In reported remarks overheard at an event last week, sheappeared to suggest she was irritatedby people who ""talk"" but ""don't do"" when it came to protecting the environment. Earlier this week, the Queen declined a magazine's award of Oldie of the Year,saying ""you are only as old as you feel"". She ""politely but firmly"" turned down the award, but sent the Oldie magazine a message with her ""warmest best wishes"".

"A huge leak of documents seen by BBC News shows how countries are trying to change a crucial scientific report on how to tackle climate change. The leak reveals Saudi Arabia, Japan and Australia are among countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels. It also shows some wealthy nations are questioning paying more to poorer states to move to greener technologies. This ""lobbying"" raises questions for the COP26 climate summit in November. The leak reveals countries pushing back on UN recommendations for action and comes just days before they will be asked at the summit to make significant commitments to slow down climate change and keep global warming to 1.5 degrees. The leaked documents consist of more than 32,000 submissions made by governments, companies and other interested parties to the team of scientists compiling a UN report designed to bring together the best scientific evidence on how to tackle climate change. These ""assessment reports"" are produced every six to seven years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN body tasked with evaluating the science of climate change. These reports are used by governments to decide what action is needed to tackle climate change, and the latest will be a crucial input to negotiations at the Glasgow conference. A really simple guide to climate change What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all The authority of these reports derives in part from the fact that virtually all the governments of the world participate in the process to reach consensus. The comments from governments the BBC has read are overwhelmingly designed to be constructive and to improve the quality of the final report. The cache of comments and the latest draft of the report were released to Greenpeace UK's team of investigative journalists, Unearthed, which passed it on to BBC News. The leak shows a number of countries and organisations arguing that the world does not need to reduce the use of fossil fuels as quickly as the current draft of the report recommends. An adviser to the Saudi oil ministry demands ""phrases like 'the need for urgent and accelerated mitigation actions at all scalesâ¦' should be eliminated from the report"". One senior Australian government official rejects the conclusion that closing coal-fired power plants is necessary, even though ending the use of coal is one of the stated objectives the COP26 conference. Saudi Arabia is the one of the largest oil producers in the world and Australia is a major coal exporter. A senior scientist from India's Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research, which has strong links to the Indian government, warns coal is likely to remain the mainstay of energy production for decades because of what they describe as the ""tremendous challenges"" of providing affordable electricity. India is already the world's second biggest consumer of coal. A number of countries argue in favour of emerging and currently expensive technologies designed to capture and permanently store carbon dioxide underground. Saudi Arabia, China, Australia and Japan - all big producers or users of fossil fuels - as well as the organisation of oil producing nations, Opec, all support carbon capture and storage (CCS). It is claimed these CCS technologies could dramatically cut fossil fuel emissions from power plants and some industrial sectors. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, requests the UN scientists delete their conclusion that ""the focus of decarbonisation efforts in the energy systems sector needs to be on rapidly shifting to zero-carbon sources and actively phasing out fossil fuels"". Argentina, Norway and Opec also take issue with the statement. Norway argues the UN scientists should allow the possibility of CCS as a potential tool for reducing emissions from fossil fuels. The draft report accepts CCS could play a role in the future but says there are uncertainties about its feasibility. It says ""there is large ambiguity in the extent to which fossil fuels with CCS would be compatible with the 2C and 1.5C targets"" as set out by the Paris Agreement. The offshore Sleipner gas field in Norway has been using CCS since 1996 Australia asks IPCC scientists to delete a reference to analysis of the role played by fossil fuel lobbyists in watering down action on climate in Australia and the US. Opec also asks the IPCC to ""delete 'lobby activism, protecting rent extracting business models, prevent political action'."" When approached about its comments to the draft report, Opec told the BBC: ""The challenge of tackling emissions has many paths, as evidenced by the IPCC report, and we need to explore them all. We need to utilise all available energies, as well as clean and more efficient technological solutions to help reduce emissions, ensuring no one is left behind."" This video can not be played Tony Blair on climate change: ""Even though the challenge is immense, there really isn't an alternative to dealing with it"" The IPCC says comments from governments are central to its scientific review process and that its authors have no obligation to incorporate them into the reports. ""Our processes are designed to guard against lobbying - from all quarters"", the IPCC told the BBC. ""The review process is (and always has been) absolutely fundamental to the IPCC's work and is a major source of the strength and credibility of our reports. Professor Corinne le QuÃ©rÃ© of the University of East Anglia, a leading climate scientist who has helped compile three major reports for the IPCC, has no doubts about the impartiality of the IPCC's reports. She says all comments are judged solely on scientific evidence regardless of where they come from. ""There is absolutely no pressure on scientists to accept the comments,"" she told the BBC. ""If the comments are lobbying, if they're not justified by the science, they will not be integrated in the IPCC reports."" She says it is important that experts of all kinds - including governments - have a chance to review the science. ""The more the reports are scrutinised"", says Professor le QuÃ©rÃ©, ""the more solid the evidence is going to be in the end, because the more the arguments are brought and articulated forward in a way that is leaning on the best available science"". Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who oversaw the landmark UN climate conference in Paris in 2015, agrees it is crucial that governments are part of the IPCC process. ""Everybody's voice has to be there. That's the whole purpose. This is not a single thread. This is a tapestry woven by many, many threads."" The United Nations was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2007 for the IPCC's work on climate science and the crucial role it has played in the effort to tackle climate change. Brazil and Argentina, two of the biggest producers of beef products and animal feed crops in the world, argue strongly against evidence in the draft report that reducing meat consumption is necessary to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The draft report states ""plant-based diets can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% compared to the average emission intensive Western diet"". Brazil says this is incorrect. Both countries call on the authors to delete or change some passages in the text referring to ""plant-based diets"" playing a role in tackling climate change, or which describe beef as a ""high carbon"" food. Argentina also asked that references to taxes on red meat and to the international ""Meatless Monday"" campaign, which urges people to forgo meat for a day, be removed from the report. The South American nation recommends ""avoiding generalisation on the impacts of meat-based diets on low-carbon options"", arguing there is evidence that meat-based diets can also reduce carbon emissions. On the same theme, Brazil says ""plant-based diets do not for themselves guarantee the reduction or control of related emissions"" and maintains the focus of debate should be on the levels of emissions from different production systems, rather than types of food. Brazil, which has seen significant increases in the rate of deforestation in the Amazon and some other forest areas, also disputes a reference to this being a result of changes in government regulations, claiming this is incorrect. A significant number of Switzerland's comments are directed at amending parts of the report that argue developing countries will need support, particularly financial support, from rich countries in order to meet emission reduction targets. It was agreed at the climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009 that developed nations would provide $100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, a target that has yet to be met. Australia makes a similar case to Switzerland. It says developing countries' climate pledges do not all depend on receiving outside financial support. It also describes a mention in the draft report of the lack of credible public commitments on finance as ""subjective commentary"". The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment told the BBC: ""While climate finance is a critical tool to increase climate ambition, it is not the only relevant tool. ""Switzerland takes the view that all Parties to the Paris Agreement with the capacity to do so should provide support to those who need such support."" A number of mostly eastern European countries argue the draft report should be more positive about the role nuclear power can play in meeting the UN's climate targets. India goes even further, arguing ""almost all the chapters contain a bias against nuclear energy"". It argues it is an ""established technology"" with ""good political backing except in a few countries"". The Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia criticise a table in the report which finds nuclear power only has a positive role in delivering one of 17 UN Sustainable Development goals. They argue it can play a positive role in delivering most of the UN's development agenda. Do you have any questions about the leak of climate documents? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"A patient receives Covid care in Tunisia Covid has severely affected healthcare staff and may have killed between 80,000 and 180,000, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Healthcare workers must be prioritised for vaccines, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, and he criticised unfairness in the distribution of jabs. The deaths occurred between January 2020 and May of this year. Earlier, another senior WHO official warned a lack of jabs could see the pandemic continue well into next year. There are an estimated 135 million healthcare workers globally. ""Data from 119 countries suggest that on average, two in five healthcare workers globally are fully vaccinated,"" Dr Tedros said. ""But of course, that average masks huge differences across regions and economic groupings."" Fewer than one in 10 healthcare workers were fully vaccinated in Africa, he said, compared with eight in 10 in high-income countries. A failure to provide poorer countries with enough vaccines was highlighted earlier by Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior leader at the WHO, who said it meant the Covid crisis could ""easily drag on deep into 2022"". Less than 5% of Africa's population have been vaccinated, compared with 40% on most other continents. The vast majority of Covid vaccines overall have been used in high-income or upper middle-income countries. Africa accounts for just 2.6% of doses administered globally. More than 50 countries missing Covid vaccine target Covax: How many Covid vaccines have the US and the other G7 countries pledged? Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? The original idea behind Covax, the UN-backed global programme to distribute vaccines fairly, was that all countries would be able to acquire vaccines from its pool, including wealthy ones, writes BBC Global Affairs correspondent Naomi Grimley. But most G7 countries decided to hold back once they started making their own one-to-one deals with pharmaceutical companies. This video can not be played Ros Atkins looks at the ethics of Western countries rolling out Covid booster jabs while millions globally remain unvaccinated Dr Aylward appealed to wealthy countries to give up their places in the queue for vaccines so that pharmaceutical companies can prioritise the lowest-income countries instead. He said wealthy countries needed to ""stocktake"" where they were with their donation commitments made at summits such as the G7 meeting in St Ives this summer. ""I can tell you we're not on track,"" he said. ""We really need to speed it up or you know what? This pandemic is going to go on for a year longer than it needs to."" The People's Vaccine - an alliance of charities - has released new figures suggesting just one in seven of the doses promised by pharmaceutical companies and wealthy countries are actually reaching their destinations in poorer countries. The alliance, which includes Oxfam and UNAids, also criticised Canada and the UK for procuring vaccines for their own populations via Covax. Official figures show that earlier this year the UK received 539,370 Pfizer doses from Covax while Canada took just under a million AstraZeneca doses. Oxfam's Global Health Adviser, Rohit Malpani, acknowledged that Canada and the UK were technically entitled to get vaccines via this route having paid into the Covax mechanism, but he said it was still ""morally indefensible"" given that they had both obtained millions of doses through their own bilateral agreements. The UK government pointed out it was one of the countries which had ""kick-started"" Covax last year with a donation of Â£548m. The UK has also delivered more than 10 million vaccines to countries in need, and has pledged a total of 100 million. The Canadian government was keen to stress that it had now stopped using Covax vaccines. The country's International Development Minister, Karina Gould, said: ""As soon as it became clear that the supply we had secured through our bilateral deals would be sufficient for the Canadian population, we pivoted the doses which we had procured from Covax back to Covax, so they could be redistributed to developing countries."" Covax originally aimed to deliver two billion doses of vaccines by the end of this year, but so far it has shipped 371m doses.

"With coronavirus case numbers high, people must go and take up their booster jab, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says It's offered to frontline medical staff, those over-50 and the clinically vulnerable across the UK His comments come as the number of new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK tops 50,000 for the first time since July Earlier, Health Minister Edward Argar acknowledged the NHS is under huge pressure but said it's sustainable But doctors say an unacceptable level of Covid cases means ministers should trigger their Plan B for the pandemic this winter The British Medical Association says the government is being ""wilfully negligent"" for not reimposing Covid rules such as mandatory face masks The pandemic will last a year longer than it needs to because poorer countries are not getting the vaccines they need, the WHO says Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for joining us today - here's a recap of some of the day's top lines. Thursday's live page was edited by Claire Heald and Holly Wallis. It was written by Malu Cursino, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Joshua Nevitt, Mary O'Connor and Lauren Turner. As ever, it's been a team effort with contributions from our colleagues across the BBC.  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Daily case of
coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital
admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen
slightly. The last time we
saw that level was in mid-July, a few weeks after the 2m social distancing rule
was scrapped and soon after pubs and restaurants reopened in England. Cases peaked at
that point and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being
introduced. It's possible
that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening. The current
strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable,
and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to
increase protection among the population. Free testing is
also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid
rates in Europe. In 10-19 year
olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections
could leak into other age groups. A change in
people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on
the NHS ahead of winter. Scientists say
it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the
UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination
programme hadn't even started yet. This video can not be played Johnson on Covid lockdown and restrictions in England Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the number of Covid infections in the UK was ""high"" but in line with predictions. Amid speculation of moves to stricter Plan B measures in England to combat rising cases, Boris Johnson appeared to rule this out for now, saying: ""We are sticking with our plan."" We've also been hearing from people who say the government should not enact stricter Covid measures due to the impact on the economy and mental health. Phil Hadleysays: ""I think we just have to get on with life... we cannot keep shutting the economy down because the NHS is busy, I've had enough of my personal liberties being taken away from me just to protect the NHS, it's supposed to be there for us not the other way around."" Katie from Southamptonsays: ""Further restrictions, especially further lockdowns will be extraordinarily damaging to society, especially to the mental health of many. ""Since there is no more that can be done given the success of the vaccination roll out, a further lockdown sets the extremely dangerous precedent that lockdowns will become an unquestionable staple whenever cases of COVID, or any further spreadable disease puts pressure on the NHS."" In Wales, the NHS has just recorded its worst ever performance figures - with nearly 250,000 people waiting more than nine months for treatment, a 10-fold increase from the start of the pandemic. Its chief executive Andrew Goodall says the system is running ""at the hottest we've ever seen"". There's more on thathere. And in Northern Ireland, the health service is facing ""its worst winter ever"". That's the warning from the NI chair of the British Medical Association. Read morehere. You can see how cases are shifting in Scotland,here. Passengers wear face masks whilst travelling on a bus in London We've been hearing from people about their thoughts on the increase in Covid cases and whether the government should invoke itsPlan B measures- including compulsory face coverings in public, Covid passports and advising people to work from home. On Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid ruled it out at this point. But some readers think it should happen. Matt from Oxfordsays: ""I probably travel into London once a month, and yesterday I
saw a marked difference in people's behaviour. No more than 50% of people on
the Tube were wearing face masks. Nobody had masks on in the restaurant I ate
at, including staff. ""The scientists say that quite small restrictions (eg masks and
vaccine passports) have been shown to keep numbers down, so there seems
to be no reason why we aren't doing that, just to make the country a safer
place to go about our business..."" Phyllis Williamson says: ""I donât see the problem with making the wearing of face
masks mandatory on public transport and in busy, crowded areas â particularly
indoors. Itâs not pleasant but we had to do it for months and it didnât kill
us. It actually benefited us. ""I donât
want to go back to not being able to safely see my family and having to worry
about passing something on to them when I did. Reality Check Whether or not people should wear face masks has been a hot topic today, as cases rise. From 19 July in England, face
masks stopped being mandatory in most public places. They are still required in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Lots of studies have shown face
coverings can help stop the virus from being passed between people. But itâs much harder to prove how
much mask wearing reduces the amount of Covid circulating in a whole
population. That's
because it's hard to untangle it from all the other things going on at the same
time, like how much people choose to mix with each other. You
can read more about this and what could be causing the high number of
infections currently,here.  The daily government data also shows how many first and second vaccine doses have been given. It shows another 49,080 first doses have been given and 26,365 second doses. It means 45,460,122 people have now had two doses. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said four million third doses, or boosters, had now been given as well. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A medical worker collects a swab from a resident in Lanzhou's Chengguan district, Gansu province, on 20 October. An outbreak of
Covid-19 in China has led to swift restrictions being imposed in multiple
Chinese provinces over the last week. Since 16
October, cases of Covid-19 linked to travel and tourism in Chinaâs north have
reached at least nine provincial-level regions. Parts of Inner
Mongolia and Gansu province have gone into tight lockdown. Many schools have
closed in both regions; a school has also closed in China's capital, Beijing. Tourist sites
have closed in parts of Xiâan â the home of the Terracotta Warriors â and some
cities have cancelled large-scale exhibitions and closed venues like cinemas. The number of
cases in China is still relatively low â only in the double digits â however,
it is common for the country to tackle outbreaks by swiftly locking down
communities when even one resident tests positive. Citywide testing drives are ordered, and people are prohibited from leaving affected areas
unless they can show a negative test within days of travel. Given many of
the affected regions in this latest outbreak are in Chinaâs north, the National
Health Commission has urged enhanced measures to ensure that Covid-19
prevention work can be carried out safely. It has
particularly emphasised protecting female medical workers from the cold in the
coming months, and has urged limiting the amount of time people spend outdoors. Currently, it is common for large-scale testing drives to take place outside. As we reported just now, there have been more than 50,000 new Covid cases reported - with the total of 52,009 the highest since 17 July. On that day, there were 54,674 cases. It comes as levels have been progressively climbing in the UK. The previous eight days have all seen cases at more than 40,000. Cases over the last three months have been roughly the same as they were over a three-month period last winter, meaning we can compare them. Between July and October this year, there were just over three million cases, with 79,000 people ending up in hospital. Between October and January last year, there were just over 2.7 million cases, but more than 185,000 people needed hospital treatment. This was before vaccines were widely available. So why are cases so high - is it the looser rules, waning immunity or to do with issues with the vaccine rollout? We've taken a closer look at some of those questionshere. Dozens of ambulances remain outside the emergency department on Thursday afternoon A health minister said earlier that the current pressure on the NHS was manageable and sustainable aftera doctor's union called formore restrictions to return in England to tackle ""unacceptable"" Covid case rates. Now, the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust (RCHT) has declareda critical incident due to the pressures it is facing. The trust reported up to 100 people in the emergency department waiting to be seen on Wednesday, with 25 ambulances waiting to transfer patients. It prompted managers to contact staff to ask them to work extra hours to help handle ""intense pressures"". In September, all planned and urgent surgeries were temporarily suspended due to the pressure the hospital is under. Routine surgeries remain suspended, with urgent procedures reviewed daily and continuing where possible. The trust said on Thursday it was treating 44 patients with Covid-19 - 10 more than the previous week. RCHT medical director Dr Allister Grant said there was ""unprecedented demand"" on the NHS in Cornwall, ""more so this week than at any point during the pandemic"". You can read morehere. The number of new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK has topped 50,000 for the first time since July. A total of 52,009 were recorded, according to the government statistics.

Doctors have called on the government to reimpose some rules in England, including face masks, because of the high number of new daily infections in the UK. The rules are different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where face coverings are required in certain places, including on public transport. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg says a ""convivial fraternal spirit"" means the Conservatives do not need to wear masks in the Commons.

The minister says that Tory MPs can make their own choice on face masks. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Mask-wearing is patchy in Poland and vaccination take-up has flat-lined The UK is not the only European country seeing a surge in
Covid cases. Several countries in Central and Eastern Europe are also
experiencing a dramatic rise in infections. Here in Poland, weâve had more than
double the amount of cases compared with last week, and Health Minister Adam
Niedzielski has called it an âexplosionâ. The number of new daily infections
exceeds 5,000 and the amount of people in hospital with Covid is the
highest since the start of June. Mr Niedzielski said some of the highest
infection rates were in regions in eastern Poland with the lowest vaccination take-up. Overall, 63% of adults here are fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 74%,
and take-up has flat-lined since August. The health minister says
heâs instructed police to impose fines on people flouting the rules. Itâs increasingly common here to see people in shops and on public transport without facemasks. The rising number of cases at home is also having an impact outside the country, with Morocco banning direct flights to and from the UK because of the rising number of cases. But on the upside, fully vaccinated travellers from 33 countries - including the UK - will now be able to travel to the US from
8 November. It's all explained here:  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News As we've been reporting, cases of coronavirus are rising sharply, frontline doctors say they are under huge pressure and some healthcare staff report being burnt out. But the government in England says there's no reason to change tack right now. Moving to Plan B on tackling the pandemic would involve relatively small changes to people's lives. It would mean compulsory face masks on public transport and in shops, and/or advice to work from home. So what's stopping the move? Ministers say the NHS is extremely busy but they don't believe the pressure is unsustainable. There is still headroom and the country is in a much more positive place than it was last autumn. Even as cases rise, the Covid vaccination programme is keeping a lid on hospital admissions and deaths - and that's why speeding up access to booster vaccines for the over 50s and jabs for young teens is a priority, as well as targeting the five million people who've so far refused a vaccine. This will increase protection for the majority of the population over the next few months. And with infections rising, natural immunity from the virus is also helping that process. Predicting what will happen to cases is tricky. Cases could still flatten and come down or continue to rise to 100,000 as Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned on Wednesday. In many countries in Europe, the picture is much rosier and that's causing some concern in the UK as a whole. There is no precise trigger for Plan B - it's a wait-and-see judgement call, and the government in England is still biding its time. Earlier today, the health minister said the
pressure on the NHS from Covid was âmanageableâ and sustainable. However, Dr Chris Gibbons,
clinical director of medicine at Newcastle Hospitals Trust, paintsa worrying picture. Newcastleâs Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) is in a similar
situation to other hospitals across the UK. The hospital has seen record numbers of
patients coming through its A&E, as well as a rise in patients with Covid
and flu. The backlog in surgery and treatments due to the pandemic
has also significantly contributed to current pressures. Dr Gibbons tells the BBC the current number of admissions is higher than âanything
weâd see in the worst wintersâ. The current picture at Newcastleâs RVI emergency department
is difficult. Dr Gibbons says they are starting most days with patients waiting for
beds and the waiting times can be âfor eight or nine hoursâ. In some cases, patients will only be seen âfour, five or six hoursâ after arriving at A&E. He says the pressures on emergency care staff are âlike
nothing weâve seen beforeâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Petrol station stock levels have recovered after a recent surge in demand for fuel, new figures suggest. Filling station storage tanks in Great Britain were 45% full on average at the end of the day on Sunday,statistics from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy show.,external That was the highest level seen since May. A few weeks ago, many forecourts had run dry after people queued to fill up due to supply chain concerns. Panic-buying was sparked in late September after warnings that some petrol stations were having delivery problems due to a shortage of lorry drivers. Stock levels dropped to a low of 15% on 25 September, after demand peaked the day before. It led to military drivers being deployed to help deliver fuel to forecourts. A total of 151 personnel are still driving tankers to transport fuel. Supermarket chainAsda saidon 13 October that it had not had any petrol supply problems for a week after demand eased, while the Petrol Retailers Association said supplies in London and the South East had improved. Petrol and diesel prices nearing a record high Asda reports no petrol supply issues for a week IEA: Green energy needed to avoid turbulent prices London and the South East were the slowest regions to recover from the shortage, but petrol station storage tanks in these areas were an average of 42% and 45% full on Sunday, according to the Department for Business. The situation in the most populous parts of the country had been described as ""serious"" at one point. But the latest numbers also show that UK sales of fuel have slowed from an average of 35,900 litres per filling station on 24 September to 11,800 litres on Sunday. During the supply crisis, motorway service stations were prioritised for deliveries. Many parts of the UK economy, including supermarkets, retailers, and ports, have been affected by shortage of HGV drivers. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? A Road Haulage Association (RHA) survey of its members estimated there was now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. The industry believes the existing shortage has been exacerbated by the pandemic, Brexit, tax changes, and a slowdown in driver testing. In response, the government has introduced temporary visas for 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden. A government statement said: ""Thanks to our interventions and the continuing deliveries made by the military, fuel levels across all regions returned to normal earlier this month. ""As the industry has said, we have ample fuel reserves and the return of normal buying habits by the public has reduced the exceptional demand seen in previous weeks.""

"Ricky Gervais has filmed the third series of his Netflix production After Life in Hemel Hempstead A council has received about Â£100,000 in the past six months as a result of a town being used for the filming of major TV series. Hemel Hempstead has been the setting for shows including ITV's Grantchester, Ricky Gervais' After Life on Netflix and Apple TV+'s Masters of the Air. Some of the revenue will fund a new role to coordinate filming activities. Dacorum Borough Council said it wanted to demonstrate it was a ""filming positive"" authority. So far this year, locals have seen Marlowes in the town centre transformed into 1970s Huddersfield for a Sex Pistols biopic. In September, Hemel Hempstead's Old Town wastransformed into the setting for Masters of the Air, a new World War Two series from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. Robson Green was spotted in the Old Town in August whilefilming the latest series of detective drama Grantchester. In May, Gervais was seenfilming in Hemel Hempsteadfor the third series of After Life, when a funfair appeared in Gadebridge Park. Robson Green was seen filming episodes of the latest series of 1950s detective drama Grantchester A funfair appeared in Gadebridge Park for the filming of After Life At the time of Gervais' filming, a council spokesman said crews were ""taking advantage of the many great filming locations that Dacorum has to offer"". He said it had become more popular due to its proximity to London. A Freedom of Information request from theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicefound that between April and October this year, Â£99,500 was brought in from filming charges on council-owned or managed land. This compares to Â£64,660 for the whole of the financial year of 2018/2019, the last full year not affected by lockdowns. The authority could not reveal a breakdown for each project for commercial reasons, but confirmed Grantchester, After Life, Masters of the Air and BBC Three's Ladhood collectively generated Â£71,765 in 2021/22. Parking was suspended and roads closed in the Old Town during filming for Master of the Air The council has now employed an officer to facilitate filming projects and work with businesses to co-ordinate activities and develop filming protocols to address any local concerns. ""We want to demonstrate that Dacorum is a filming-positive council,"" a spokesman said. ""Having one point of contact to manage these relationships will ensure that residents and businesses can be better informed going forward."" The council added that there were a ""range of benefits"" in supporting filming.

"With coronavirus case numbers high, people must go and take up their booster jab, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says It's offered to frontline medical staff, those over-50 and the clinically vulnerable across the UK His comments come as the number of new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK tops 50,000 for the first time since July Earlier, Health Minister Edward Argar acknowledged the NHS is under huge pressure but said it's sustainable But doctors say an unacceptable level of Covid cases means ministers should trigger their Plan B for the pandemic this winter The British Medical Association says the government is being ""wilfully negligent"" for not reimposing Covid rules such as mandatory face masks The pandemic will last a year longer than it needs to because poorer countries are not getting the vaccines they need, the WHO says Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for joining us today - here's a recap of some of the day's top lines. Thursday's live page was edited by Claire Heald and Holly Wallis. It was written by Malu Cursino, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Joshua Nevitt, Mary O'Connor and Lauren Turner. As ever, it's been a team effort with contributions from our colleagues across the BBC.  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Daily case of
coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital
admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen
slightly. The last time we
saw that level was in mid-July, a few weeks after the 2m social distancing rule
was scrapped and soon after pubs and restaurants reopened in England. Cases peaked at
that point and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being
introduced. It's possible
that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening. The current
strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable,
and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to
increase protection among the population. Free testing is
also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid
rates in Europe. In 10-19 year
olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections
could leak into other age groups. A change in
people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on
the NHS ahead of winter. Scientists say
it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the
UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination
programme hadn't even started yet. This video can not be played Johnson on Covid lockdown and restrictions in England Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the number of Covid infections in the UK was ""high"" but in line with predictions. Amid speculation of moves to stricter Plan B measures in England to combat rising cases, Boris Johnson appeared to rule this out for now, saying: ""We are sticking with our plan."" We've also been hearing from people who say the government should not enact stricter Covid measures due to the impact on the economy and mental health. Phil Hadleysays: ""I think we just have to get on with life... we cannot keep shutting the economy down because the NHS is busy, I've had enough of my personal liberties being taken away from me just to protect the NHS, it's supposed to be there for us not the other way around."" Katie from Southamptonsays: ""Further restrictions, especially further lockdowns will be extraordinarily damaging to society, especially to the mental health of many. ""Since there is no more that can be done given the success of the vaccination roll out, a further lockdown sets the extremely dangerous precedent that lockdowns will become an unquestionable staple whenever cases of COVID, or any further spreadable disease puts pressure on the NHS."" In Wales, the NHS has just recorded its worst ever performance figures - with nearly 250,000 people waiting more than nine months for treatment, a 10-fold increase from the start of the pandemic. Its chief executive Andrew Goodall says the system is running ""at the hottest we've ever seen"". There's more on thathere. And in Northern Ireland, the health service is facing ""its worst winter ever"". That's the warning from the NI chair of the British Medical Association. Read morehere. You can see how cases are shifting in Scotland,here. Passengers wear face masks whilst travelling on a bus in London We've been hearing from people about their thoughts on the increase in Covid cases and whether the government should invoke itsPlan B measures- including compulsory face coverings in public, Covid passports and advising people to work from home. On Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid ruled it out at this point. But some readers think it should happen. Matt from Oxfordsays: ""I probably travel into London once a month, and yesterday I
saw a marked difference in people's behaviour. No more than 50% of people on
the Tube were wearing face masks. Nobody had masks on in the restaurant I ate
at, including staff. ""The scientists say that quite small restrictions (eg masks and
vaccine passports) have been shown to keep numbers down, so there seems
to be no reason why we aren't doing that, just to make the country a safer
place to go about our business..."" Phyllis Williamson says: ""I donât see the problem with making the wearing of face
masks mandatory on public transport and in busy, crowded areas â particularly
indoors. Itâs not pleasant but we had to do it for months and it didnât kill
us. It actually benefited us. ""I donât
want to go back to not being able to safely see my family and having to worry
about passing something on to them when I did. Reality Check Whether or not people should wear face masks has been a hot topic today, as cases rise. From 19 July in England, face
masks stopped being mandatory in most public places. They are still required in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Lots of studies have shown face
coverings can help stop the virus from being passed between people. But itâs much harder to prove how
much mask wearing reduces the amount of Covid circulating in a whole
population. That's
because it's hard to untangle it from all the other things going on at the same
time, like how much people choose to mix with each other. You
can read more about this and what could be causing the high number of
infections currently,here.  The daily government data also shows how many first and second vaccine doses have been given. It shows another 49,080 first doses have been given and 26,365 second doses. It means 45,460,122 people have now had two doses. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said four million third doses, or boosters, had now been given as well. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A medical worker collects a swab from a resident in Lanzhou's Chengguan district, Gansu province, on 20 October. An outbreak of
Covid-19 in China has led to swift restrictions being imposed in multiple
Chinese provinces over the last week. Since 16
October, cases of Covid-19 linked to travel and tourism in Chinaâs north have
reached at least nine provincial-level regions. Parts of Inner
Mongolia and Gansu province have gone into tight lockdown. Many schools have
closed in both regions; a school has also closed in China's capital, Beijing. Tourist sites
have closed in parts of Xiâan â the home of the Terracotta Warriors â and some
cities have cancelled large-scale exhibitions and closed venues like cinemas. The number of
cases in China is still relatively low â only in the double digits â however,
it is common for the country to tackle outbreaks by swiftly locking down
communities when even one resident tests positive. Citywide testing drives are ordered, and people are prohibited from leaving affected areas
unless they can show a negative test within days of travel. Given many of
the affected regions in this latest outbreak are in Chinaâs north, the National
Health Commission has urged enhanced measures to ensure that Covid-19
prevention work can be carried out safely. It has
particularly emphasised protecting female medical workers from the cold in the
coming months, and has urged limiting the amount of time people spend outdoors. Currently, it is common for large-scale testing drives to take place outside. As we reported just now, there have been more than 50,000 new Covid cases reported - with the total of 52,009 the highest since 17 July. On that day, there were 54,674 cases. It comes as levels have been progressively climbing in the UK. The previous eight days have all seen cases at more than 40,000. Cases over the last three months have been roughly the same as they were over a three-month period last winter, meaning we can compare them. Between July and October this year, there were just over three million cases, with 79,000 people ending up in hospital. Between October and January last year, there were just over 2.7 million cases, but more than 185,000 people needed hospital treatment. This was before vaccines were widely available. So why are cases so high - is it the looser rules, waning immunity or to do with issues with the vaccine rollout? We've taken a closer look at some of those questionshere. Dozens of ambulances remain outside the emergency department on Thursday afternoon A health minister said earlier that the current pressure on the NHS was manageable and sustainable aftera doctor's union called formore restrictions to return in England to tackle ""unacceptable"" Covid case rates. Now, the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust (RCHT) has declareda critical incident due to the pressures it is facing. The trust reported up to 100 people in the emergency department waiting to be seen on Wednesday, with 25 ambulances waiting to transfer patients. It prompted managers to contact staff to ask them to work extra hours to help handle ""intense pressures"". In September, all planned and urgent surgeries were temporarily suspended due to the pressure the hospital is under. Routine surgeries remain suspended, with urgent procedures reviewed daily and continuing where possible. The trust said on Thursday it was treating 44 patients with Covid-19 - 10 more than the previous week. RCHT medical director Dr Allister Grant said there was ""unprecedented demand"" on the NHS in Cornwall, ""more so this week than at any point during the pandemic"". You can read morehere. The number of new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK has topped 50,000 for the first time since July. A total of 52,009 were recorded, according to the government statistics. And there have been another 115 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

is difficult. Dr Gibbons says they are starting most days with patients waiting for
beds and the waiting times can be âfor eight or nine hoursâ. In some cases, patients will only be seen âfour, five or six hoursâ after arriving at A&E. He says the pressures on emergency care staff are âlike
nothing weâve seen beforeâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9931056
"This video can not be played ""Our past has shaped and scarred us"" The head of the Irish Catholic Church has said partition causes him ""a deep sense of loss and sadness"". Archbishop Eamon Martin was addressing a service to mark the centenary of Ireland being divided and the formation of Northern Ireland. In 1921, the island was divided into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State. Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined 150 guests from both sides of the border at the event on Thursday. Archbishop Martin said for the past 100 years, partition had ""polarised people on this island"". ""It has institutionalised difference, and it remains a symbol of cultural, political and religious division between our communities,"" he said. He told the service in Armagh's Church of Ireland Cathedral that he also felt churches could have gone further. NI Secretary Brandon Lewis and Prime Minister Boris Johnson were among those attending the centenary church service ""I have to face the difficult truth that, perhaps, we in the churches could have done more to deepen our understanding of each other and to bring healing and peace to our divided and wounded communities,"" he said. Speaking afterwards, the prime minister said: ""It has been very moving to be here today and see the way in which people from very different perspectives have come together."" Mr Johnson said Northern Ireland was ""an incredible part of the country"" and had ""an amazing future"". The prime minister added: ""I am a passionate unionist and, of course, I believe the future is within the United Kingdom."" The Queen had been due to attend the service but wasunable to travel for medical reasons. Irish president Michael D Higginsdeclined an invitation. The Armagh church service was organised to ""mark the centenaries of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland"". President Higgins said the title of the service made it ""inappropriate"" for him to attend as head of state. Sinn FÃ©in, including Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, also decided not to attend. A children's choir sang during the church service marking Northern Ireland's centenary However, Colum Eastwood, the leader of Northern Ireland's other nationalist party, the SDLP, was present. Among others at the service were Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP); DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson; Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie; Alliance leader Naomi Long; Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride. Two representatives from the Irish government were also present- Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, from the Fine Gael party, and chief whip Jack Chambers, from Fianna FÃ¡il. With Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey, a Sinn FÃ©in member, not attending, deputy speaker Roy Beggs formally represented the Northern Ireland Assembly. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney arriving at the service The event, titled ""A Service of Reflection and Hope"", was organised by the leaders of the main Protestant and Catholic Churches. It began with the ringing of the cathedral bell before the Dean of Armagh, Rev Shane Forster, sent his good wishes to the Queen. Welcoming the congregation in both English and Irish, he said: ""Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has divided us. And, yet, it has also, on occasion, brought us together."" The leaders of Ireland's main churches delivered their personal reflections on the creation of Northern Ireland. This video can not be played Church leaders reflect on NI's centenary The Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr David Bruce, said: ""I grieve the times when fear has held us back from building relationships with those with whom we differ. ""If we are to build a better future, then we must recognise our own woundedness and our responsibility to care for the wounds of one another."" Dr Ivan Patterson, the president of the Irish Council of Churches, said ""we need to learn"" from the example of young people. ""They are a generation who want to build peace, a generation who respect and care for this planet in solidarity with the poorest and most vulnerable here and around the world."" Church of Ireland Primate Rev John McDowell said:  ""I am hopeful. Hopeful in a new generation who know that the big problems we've landed them with, especially climate change and economic inequality, can only be tackled together. ""I think there are already signs that the next generation will see the things that we obsessed about as secondary and place their priorities elsewhere. ""As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light-filled, prosperous and peaceful future."" The main sermon was given by Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu, the president of the Methodist Church in Ireland The main sermon was given by the president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu, who told the congregation: ""We have come a long way - not just a century but centuries. ""During that time people have cared for one another and made efforts to build community."" But he added: ""We have also been blighted by sectarian divisions, terrible injustices, destructive violence, and by win-lose political attitudes. And for this, we have cause to lament."" African-born leader to give centenary sermon Queen cancels Northern Ireland trip on medical advice Church leaders hope for 'healing' centenary events Dr Yambasu said Thursday's service was an opportunity ""to give thanks and, also, lament; to imagine what could be, and to choose the way forward that can be mutually beneficial"". The service included an opening prayer in Irish led by Linda Ervine and SeÃ¡n Coll. Intercessions were offered by Prof Mary Hannon-Fletcher and Robert Barfoot, both of whom were injured in the Troubles. Children carried a lantern to the altar, a symbol of light and hope for the future. Northern Ireland was established inMay 1921 after the partition of Ireland. It followed decades of turmoil between nationalists, who wanted independence from British rule, and unionists, who wanted to remain in the United Kingdom. The border divided the 32-county island into two separate jurisdictions - six counties in the north-east became Northern Ireland, which is still part of the UK. The other 26-county territory became the Irish Free State, but is now the Republic of Ireland. Nationalists, north and south of the border, were infuriated by partition and continued to campaign for independence for the whole island. Many unionists were also bitterly disappointed, especially those who lived on the southern side and woke up to find themselves in a new state on 3 May 1921. The BBC News NI website has a dedicated section marking the 100th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland and partition of the island. There are special reports on the major figures of the time and the events that shaped modern Ireland available atbbc.co.uk/ni100.

"A huge leak of documents seen by BBC News shows how countries are trying to change a crucial scientific report on how to tackle climate change. The leak reveals Saudi Arabia, Japan and Australia are among countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels. It also shows some wealthy nations are questioning paying more to poorer states to move to greener technologies. This ""lobbying"" raises questions for the COP26 climate summit in November. The leak reveals countries pushing back on UN recommendations for action and comes just days before they will be asked at the summit to make significant commitments to slow down climate change and keep global warming to 1.5 degrees. The leaked documents consist of more than 32,000 submissions made by governments, companies and other interested parties to the team of scientists compiling a UN report designed to bring together the best scientific evidence on how to tackle climate change. These ""assessment reports"" are produced every six to seven years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN body tasked with evaluating the science of climate change. These reports are used by governments to decide what action is needed to tackle climate change, and the latest will be a crucial input to negotiations at the Glasgow conference. A really simple guide to climate change What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all The authority of these reports derives in part from the fact that virtually all the governments of the world participate in the process to reach consensus. The comments from governments the BBC has read are overwhelmingly designed to be constructive and to improve the quality of the final report. The cache of comments and the latest draft of the report were released to Greenpeace UK's team of investigative journalists, Unearthed, which passed it on to BBC News. The leak shows a number of countries and organisations arguing that the world does not need to reduce the use of fossil fuels as quickly as the current draft of the report recommends. An adviser to the Saudi oil ministry demands ""phrases like 'the need for urgent and accelerated mitigation actions at all scalesâ¦' should be eliminated from the report"". One senior Australian government official rejects the conclusion that closing coal-fired power plants is necessary, even though ending the use of coal is one of the stated objectives the COP26 conference. Saudi Arabia is the one of the largest oil producers in the world and Australia is a major coal exporter. A senior scientist from India's Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research, which has strong links to the Indian government, warns coal is likely to remain the mainstay of energy production for decades because of what they describe as the ""tremendous challenges"" of providing affordable electricity. India is already the world's second biggest consumer of coal. A number of countries argue in favour of emerging and currently expensive technologies designed to capture and permanently store carbon dioxide underground. Saudi Arabia, China, Australia and Japan - all big producers or users of fossil fuels - as well as the organisation of oil producing nations, Opec, all support carbon capture and storage (CCS). It is claimed these CCS technologies could dramatically cut fossil fuel emissions from power plants and some industrial sectors. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, requests the UN scientists delete their conclusion that ""the focus of decarbonisation efforts in the energy systems sector needs to be on rapidly shifting to zero-carbon sources and actively phasing out fossil fuels"". Argentina, Norway and Opec also take issue with the statement. Norway argues the UN scientists should allow the possibility of CCS as a potential tool for reducing emissions from fossil fuels. The draft report accepts CCS could play a role in the future but says there are uncertainties about its feasibility. It says ""there is large ambiguity in the extent to which fossil fuels with CCS would be compatible with the 2C and 1.5C targets"" as set out by the Paris Agreement. The offshore Sleipner gas field in Norway has been using CCS since 1996 Australia asks IPCC scientists to delete a reference to analysis of the role played by fossil fuel lobbyists in watering down action on climate in Australia and the US. Opec also asks the IPCC to ""delete 'lobby activism, protecting rent extracting business models, prevent political action'."" When approached about its comments to the draft report, Opec told the BBC: ""The challenge of tackling emissions has many paths, as evidenced by the IPCC report, and we need to explore them all. We need to utilise all available energies, as well as clean and more efficient technological solutions to help reduce emissions, ensuring no one is left behind."" This video can not be played Tony Blair on climate change: ""Even though the challenge is immense, there really isn't an alternative to dealing with it"" The IPCC says comments from governments are central to its scientific review process and that its authors have no obligation to incorporate them into the reports. ""Our processes are designed to guard against lobbying - from all quarters"", the IPCC told the BBC. ""The review process is (and always has been) absolutely fundamental to the IPCC's work and is a major source of the strength and credibility of our reports. Professor Corinne le QuÃ©rÃ© of the University of East Anglia, a leading climate scientist who has helped compile three major reports for the IPCC, has no doubts about the impartiality of the IPCC's reports. She says all comments are judged solely on scientific evidence regardless of where they come from. ""There is absolutely no pressure on scientists to accept the comments,"" she told the BBC. ""If the comments are lobbying, if they're not justified by the science, they will not be integrated in the IPCC reports."" She says it is important that experts of all kinds - including governments - have a chance to review the science. ""The more the reports are scrutinised"", says Professor le QuÃ©rÃ©, ""the more solid the evidence is going to be in the end, because the more the arguments are brought and articulated forward in a way that is leaning on the best available science"". Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who oversaw the landmark UN climate conference in Paris in 2015, agrees it is crucial that governments are part of the IPCC process. ""Everybody's voice has to be there. That's the whole purpose. This is not a single thread. This is a tapestry woven by many, many threads."" The United Nations was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2007 for the IPCC's work on climate science and the crucial role it has played in the effort to tackle climate change. Brazil and Argentina, two of the biggest producers of beef products and animal feed crops in the world, argue strongly against evidence in the draft report that reducing meat consumption is necessary to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The draft report states ""plant-based diets can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% compared to the average emission intensive Western diet"". Brazil says this is incorrect. Both countries call on the authors to delete or change some passages in the text referring to ""plant-based diets"" playing a role in tackling climate change, or which describe beef as a ""high carbon"" food. Argentina also asked that references to taxes on red meat and to the international ""Meatless Monday"" campaign, which urges people to forgo meat for a day, be removed from the report. The South American nation recommends ""avoiding generalisation on the impacts of meat-based diets on low-carbon options"", arguing there is evidence that meat-based diets can also reduce carbon emissions. On the same theme, Brazil says ""plant-based diets do not for themselves guarantee the reduction or control of related emissions"" and maintains the focus of debate should be on the levels of emissions from different production systems, rather than types of food. Brazil, which has seen significant increases in the rate of deforestation in the Amazon and some other forest areas, also disputes a reference to this being a result of changes in government regulations, claiming this is incorrect. A significant number of Switzerland's comments are directed at amending parts of the report that argue developing countries will need support, particularly financial support, from rich countries in order to meet emission reduction targets. It was agreed at the climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009 that developed nations would provide $100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, a target that has yet to be met. Australia makes a similar case to Switzerland. It says developing countries' climate pledges do not all depend on receiving outside financial support. It also describes a mention in the draft report of the lack of credible public commitments on finance as ""subjective commentary"". The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment told the BBC: ""While climate finance is a critical tool to increase climate ambition, it is not the only relevant tool. ""Switzerland takes the view that all Parties to the Paris Agreement with the capacity to do so should provide support to those who need such support."" A number of mostly eastern European countries argue the draft report should be more positive about the role nuclear power can play in meeting the UN's climate targets. India goes even further, arguing ""almost all the chapters contain a bias against nuclear energy"". It argues it is an ""established technology"" with ""good political backing except in a few countries"". The Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia criticise a table in the report which finds nuclear power only has a positive role in delivering one of 17 UN Sustainable Development goals. They argue it can play a positive role in delivering most of the UN's development agenda. Do you have any questions about the leak of climate documents? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Covid: ""We are sticking with our plan."" More than 50,000 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK for the first time since 17 July. Amid calls for more restrictions, Boris Johnson urged people to come forward for booster jabs when their time comes. The prime minister said those who become eligible for a third dose of vaccine should organise an appointment straight away. The UK recorded 52,009 new Covid cases on Thursday - alongside 115 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Mr Johnson said, despite high cases, the government was ""continuing with its plan"" and that things were much better now than a year ago. He said that was in large part thanks to the rollout of the vaccine, which has weakened the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths. Reported cases on 17 July were 54,674 and came several weeks after more households could mix together and indoor hospitality resumed. Doctors are demanding ministers trigger England's ""Plan B"" - which would reimpose rules such as mandatory face masks and working from home advice. Why are UK Covid cases so high? When will I get a booster jab? Are people wearing masks less often? Speaking in Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson said that the numbers of infections and deaths being seen were ""within the parameters of what the predictions were... given the steps we've taken"". It was also because the country was in an ""incomparably better position than last year because of vaccines"" that there was more confidence around the current plan in place,"" he said. He also insisted that the ""most important thing people can do is get that booster jab"" and that ""when you get the call, get the jab"". The PM appealed for 12 to 15-years-old to get their first vaccination because there was ""no shortage of supply"" and there were ""huge quantities"" of vaccine available. An estimated 4.7 million booster doses - which come at least six months after second jabs - have now been delivered in the UK. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ministers were letting the ""security wall against the virus... crumble"" and the booster programme was ""stalling"". But Prof Jeremy Brown, an adviser to the government on vaccines, said Sir Keir's criticism was ""not an accurate description of what's going on"". ""The problem at the moment [is] the people coming to hospital with severe Covid and ending up in intensive care and dying are those who've not had any vaccines,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. Under the government's plan for tackling Covid in England over the winter, the strategy currently in operation is Plan A. It involves offering booster jabs to about 30 million people and offering a single vaccine dose to healthy 12 to 15-year-olds, as well as encouraging ventilation for indoor gatherings, hand-washing and face masks in crowded places. Daily UK infections have been above 40,000 for nine days in a row. Analysis by BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby Daily cases of coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen slightly. Cases last went above 50,000 in mid-July and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being introduced. It's possible that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening. The current strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable, and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to increase protection among the population. Free testing is also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid rates in Europe. In 10-19 year olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections could leak into other age groups. A change in people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on the NHS ahead of winter. Scientists say it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination programme hadn't even started yet. Case rates are rising in all but one region of England, the UK Health Security Agency said, with the lowest rates in London. Rates of Covid were highest in those aged 10 to 19-years-old, with the lowest seen in those over 80. There were 8,142 patients with Covid in hospital as of Wednesday, the latest data showed, with 872 patients with Covid in beds equipped with ventilators. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the doctors' union the British Medical Association, said it can ""categorically"" say that the ""time is now"" for starting Plan B. He stressed that case numbers were comparable to March, when England was in lockdown, and were ""unheard of in similar European nations"". ""It is therefore incredibly concerning that [Mr Javid] is not willing to take immediate action to save lives and to protect the NHS,"" he said. Across the UK, booster jabs are being offered to: Over-50s Frontline health and social care workers Older adults in residential care homes People aged 16-49 years old with underlying health conditions which put them at greater risk of severe Covid Adults who share a household with vulnerable people The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination, and will typically be either Pfizer or Moderna. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that ""at this point"" the government would not introduce itsPlan B measures. However, he also warned insufficient vaccine uptake would make restrictions in England more likely. And he said infections could soon rise to around 100,000 per day.

The draft report states ""plant-based diets can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% compared to the average emission intensive Western diet"". Brazil says this is incorrect. Both countries call on the authors to delete or change some passages in the text referring to ""plant-based diets"" playing a role in tackling climate change, or which describe beef as a ""high carbon"" food. Argentina also asked that references to taxes on red meat and to the international ""Meatless Monday"" campaign, which urges people to forgo meat for a day, be removed from the report. The South American nation recommends ""avoiding generalisation on the impacts of meat-based diets on low-carbon options"", arguing there is evidence that meat-based diets can also reduce carbon emissions. On the same theme, Brazil says ""plant-based diets do not for themselves guarantee the reduction or control of related emissions"" and maintains the focus of debate should be on the levels of emissions from different production systems, rather than types of food. Brazil, which has seen significant increases in the rate of deforestation in the Amazon and some other forest areas, also disputes a reference to this being a result of changes in government regulations, claiming this is incorrect. A significant number of Switzerland's comments are directed at amending parts of the report that argue developing countries will need support, particularly financial support, from rich countries in order to meet emission reduction targets. It was agreed at the climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009 that developed nations would provide $100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, a target that has yet to be met. Australia makes a similar case to Switzerland. It says developing countries' climate pledges do not all depend on receiving outside financial support. It also describes a mention in the draft report of the lack of credible public commitments on finance as ""subjective commentary"". The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment told the BBC: ""While climate finance is a critical tool to increase climate ambition, it is not the only relevant tool. ""Switzerland takes the view that all Parties to the Paris Agreement with the capacity to do so should provide support to those who need such support."" A number of mostly eastern European countries argue the draft report should be more positive about the role nuclear power can play in meeting the UN's climate targets. India goes even further, arguing ""almost all the chapters contain a bias against nuclear energy"". It argues it is an ""established technology"" with ""good political backing except in a few countries"". The Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia criticise a table in the report which finds nuclear power only has a positive role in delivering one of 17 UN Sustainable Development goals. They argue it can play a positive role in delivering most of the UN's development agenda. Do you have any questions about the leak of climate documents? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Thursday's live page was edited by Claire Heald and Holly Wallis. It was written by Malu Cursino, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Joshua Nevitt, Mary O'Connor and Lauren Turner. As ever, it's been a team effort with contributions from our colleagues across the BBC.  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Daily case of
coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital
admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen
slightly. The last time we
saw that level was in mid-July, a few weeks after the 2m social distancing rule
was scrapped and soon after pubs and restaurants reopened in England. Cases peaked at
that point and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being
introduced. It's possible
that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening. The current
strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable,
and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to
increase protection among the population. Free testing is
also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid
rates in Europe. In 10-19 year
olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections
could leak into other age groups. A change in
people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on
the NHS ahead of winter. Scientists say
it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the
UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination
programme hadn't even started yet. This video can not be played Johnson on Covid lockdown and restrictions in England Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the number of Covid infections in the UK was ""high"" but in line with predictions. Amid speculation of moves to stricter Plan B measures in England to combat rising cases, Boris Johnson appeared to rule this out for now, saying: ""We are sticking with our plan."" We've also been hearing from people who say the government should not enact stricter Covid measures due to the impact on the economy and mental health. Phil Hadleysays: ""I think we just have to get on with life... we cannot keep shutting the economy down because the NHS is busy, I've had enough of my personal liberties being taken away from me just to protect the NHS, it's supposed to be there for us not the other way around."" Katie from Southamptonsays: ""Further restrictions, especially further lockdowns will be extraordinarily damaging to society, especially to the mental health of many. ""Since there is no more that can be done given the success of the vaccination roll out, a further lockdown sets the extremely dangerous precedent that lockdowns will become an unquestionable staple whenever cases of COVID, or any further spreadable disease puts pressure on the NHS."" In Wales, the NHS has just recorded its worst ever performance figures - with nearly 250,000 people waiting more than nine months for treatment, a 10-fold increase from the start of the pandemic. Its chief executive Andrew Goodall says the system is running ""at the hottest we've ever seen"". There's more on thathere. And in Northern Ireland, the health service is facing ""its worst winter ever"". That's the warning from the NI chair of the British Medical Association. Read morehere. You can see how cases are shifting in Scotland,here. Passengers wear face masks whilst travelling on a bus in London We've been hearing from people about their thoughts on the increase in Covid cases and whether the government should invoke itsPlan B measures- including compulsory face coverings in public, Covid passports and advising people to work from home. On Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid ruled it out at this point. But some readers think it should happen. Matt from Oxfordsays: ""I probably travel into London once a month, and yesterday I
saw a marked difference in people's behaviour. No more than 50% of people on
the Tube were wearing face masks. Nobody had masks on in the restaurant I ate
at, including staff. ""The scientists say that quite small restrictions (eg masks and
vaccine passports) have been shown to keep numbers down, so there seems
to be no reason why we aren't doing that, just to make the country a safer
place to go about our business..."" Phyllis Williamson says: ""I donât see the problem with making the wearing of face
masks mandatory on public transport and in busy, crowded areas â particularly
indoors. Itâs not pleasant but we had to do it for months and it didnât kill
us. It actually benefited us. ""I donât
want to go back to not being able to safely see my family and having to worry
about passing something on to them when I did. Reality Check Whether or not people should wear face masks has been a hot topic today, as cases rise. From 19 July in England, face
masks stopped being mandatory in most public places. They are still required in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Lots of studies have shown face
coverings can help stop the virus from being passed between people. But itâs much harder to prove how
much mask wearing reduces the amount of Covid circulating in a whole
population. That's
because it's hard to untangle it from all the other things going on at the same
time, like how much people choose to mix with each other. You
can read more about this and what could be causing the high number of
infections currently,here.  The daily government data also shows how many first and second vaccine doses have been given. It shows another 49,080 first doses have been given and 26,365 second doses. It means 45,460,122 people have now had two doses. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said four million third doses, or boosters, had now been given as well. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A medical worker collects a swab from a resident in Lanzhou's Chengguan district, Gansu province, on 20 October. An outbreak of
Covid-19 in China has led to swift restrictions being imposed in multiple
Chinese provinces over the last week. Since 16
October, cases of Covid-19 linked to travel and tourism in Chinaâs north have
reached at least nine provincial-level regions. Parts of Inner
Mongolia and Gansu province have gone into tight lockdown. Many schools have
closed in both regions; a school has also closed in China's capital, Beijing. Tourist sites
have closed in parts of Xiâan â the home of the Terracotta Warriors â and some
cities have cancelled large-scale exhibitions and closed venues like cinemas. The number of
cases in China is still relatively low â only in the double digits â however,
it is common for the country to tackle outbreaks by swiftly locking down
communities when even one resident tests positive. Citywide testing drives are ordered, and people are prohibited from leaving affected areas
unless they can show a negative test within days of travel. Given many of
the affected regions in this latest outbreak are in Chinaâs north, the National
Health Commission has urged enhanced measures to ensure that Covid-19
prevention work can be carried out safely. It has
particularly emphasised protecting female medical workers from the cold in the
coming months, and has urged limiting the amount of time people spend outdoors. Currently, it is common for large-scale testing drives to take place outside. As we reported just now, there have been more than 50,000 new Covid cases reported - with the total of 52,009 the highest since 17 July. On that day, there were 54,674 cases. It comes as levels have been progressively climbing in the UK. The previous eight days have all seen cases at more than 40,000. Cases over the last three months have been roughly the same as they were over a three-month period last winter, meaning we can compare them. Between July and October this year, there were just over three million cases, with 79,000 people ending up in hospital. Between October and January last year, there were just over 2.7 million cases, but more than 185,000 people needed hospital treatment. This was before vaccines were widely available. So why are cases so high - is it the looser rules, waning immunity or to do with issues with the vaccine rollout? We've taken a closer look at some of those questionshere. Dozens of ambulances remain outside the emergency department on Thursday afternoon A health minister said earlier that the current pressure on the NHS was manageable and sustainable aftera doctor's union called formore restrictions to return in England to tackle ""unacceptable"" Covid case rates. Now, the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust (RCHT) has declareda critical incident due to the pressures it is facing. The trust reported up to 100 people in the emergency department waiting to be seen on Wednesday, with 25 ambulances waiting to transfer patients. It prompted managers to contact staff to ask them to work extra hours to help handle ""intense pressures"". In September, all planned and urgent surgeries were temporarily suspended due to the pressure the hospital is under. Routine surgeries remain suspended, with urgent procedures reviewed daily and continuing where possible. The trust said on Thursday it was treating 44 patients with Covid-19 - 10 more than the previous week. RCHT medical director Dr Allister Grant said there was ""unprecedented demand"" on the NHS in Cornwall, ""more so this week than at any point during the pandemic"". You can read morehere. The number of new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK has topped 50,000 for the first time since July. A total of 52,009 were recorded, according to the government statistics. And there have been another 115 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. As the debate over masks and face coverings rumbles on,Jacob Rees-Mogg says that Tories don't wear them in the Commons, but he follows Health Secretay Sajid Javid yesterday, saying MPs
should, to âset an exampleâ. MPs would indeed be effective in that if they did wear masks, Professor Robert West, a health psychologist advising the government as
part of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), tells the BBC Radio 4âs World at One. He says that for people who have
mixed feelings about mask-wearing, seeing MPs without them gives them an excuse
to say âif theyâre not doing it, why should I do itâ. Prof West adds that âitâs about
leadershipâ and âit behoves them to do the same thingâ. Jim ReedHealth reporter, BBC News Paul Carter, 75 and from Leeds, was one of the first to get a Covid booster jab on the high street at end of September Covid booster jabs will eventually be available toeveryone over 50,younger
adults with some chronic health conditions, frontline health and social care staff and adults who share a household with vulnerable people. But to be eligible, it has to be
182 days, or roughly six months, since that person received a second
vaccine dose. In all parts of the UK those eligible should be contacted
and invited to book a booster. Some care homes may have other
arrangements, with elderly residents visited by mobile units. In England, the health secretary has said that if you still
havenât been contactedandit is six months plus one extra week after
that second dose,then you can now go online,externalor phone 119 and book yourself in without an invite. For Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the advice for
over 50s and those with underlying health conditions is still to wait to be
contacted â either by phone, letter or text. The UK is in a ""much better position"" going into autumn and winter than it was 12 months ago - but ""we must fortify ourselves further"", says PM Boris Johnson. Speaking on a visit to Armagh, he says the government is ""watching the numbers very carefully every day"" - but that the situation is as predicted, so the government is ""sticking with our plan"". Johnson says that now, ""the most important thing people can do is just get that booster jab - when you get the call, get the jab"". It's because of vaccines that we're better off now than this time a year ago, he says, adding: ""But we must fortify ourselves further. ""The numbers are high, we see can see what's happening, we can see the increase, now is the time to get those booster jabs, and to vaccinate the 12-15 year olds as well."" We've got a storyhereon the PM's comments if you want to read more. This video can not be played Masks in Commons: Jacob Rees-Mogg and Pete Wishart Whether MPs, and indeed, the broader public in England should be back wearing masks has been strongly debated today. Doctors have called on the government to reimpose some rules in England, including face masks, because of the high number of new daily infections in the UK. The rules are different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where face coverings are required in certain places, including on public transport. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg says a ""convivial fraternal spirit"" means the Conservatives do not need to wear masks in the Commons. The Commons leader said those on government benches knew each other, and teased Pete Wishart that he may not want to mix with SNP MPs who sat with him in the Commons. The minister says that Tory MPs can make their own choice on face masks. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Mask-wearing is patchy in Poland and vaccination take-up has flat-lined The UK is not the only European country seeing a surge in
Covid cases. Several countries in Central and Eastern Europe are also
experiencing a dramatic rise in infections. Here in Poland, weâve had more than
double the amount of cases compared with last week, and Health Minister Adam
Niedzielski has called it an âexplosionâ. The number of new daily infections
exceeds 5,000 and the amount of people in hospital with Covid is the
highest since the start of June. Mr Niedzielski said some of the highest
infection rates were in regions in eastern Poland with the lowest vaccination take-up. Overall, 63% of adults here are fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 74%,
and take-up has flat-lined since August. The health minister says
heâs instructed police to impose fines on people flouting the rules. Itâs increasingly common here to see people in shops and on public transport without facemasks. The rising number of cases at home is also having an impact outside the country, with Morocco banning direct flights to and from the UK because of the rising number of cases. But on the upside, fully vaccinated travellers from 33 countries - including the UK - will now be able to travel to the US from
8 November. It's all explained here:  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News As we've been reporting, cases of coronavirus are rising sharply, frontline doctors say they are under huge pressure and some healthcare staff report being burnt out. But the government in England says there's no reason to change tack right now. Moving to Plan B on tackling the pandemic would involve relatively small changes to people's lives. It would mean compulsory face masks on public transport and in shops, and/or advice to work from home. So what's stopping the move? Ministers say the NHS is extremely busy but they don't believe the pressure is unsustainable. There is still headroom and the country is in a much more positive place than it was last autumn. Even as cases rise, the Covid vaccination programme is keeping a lid on hospital admissions and deaths - and that's why speeding up access to booster vaccines for the over 50s and jabs for young teens is a priority, as well as targeting the five million people who've so far refused a vaccine. This will increase protection for the majority of the population over the next few months. And with infections rising, natural immunity from the virus is also helping that process. Predicting what will happen to cases is tricky. Cases could still flatten and come down or continue to rise to 100,000 as Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned on Wednesday. In many countries in Europe, the picture is much rosier and that's causing some concern in the UK as a whole. There is no precise trigger for Plan B - it's a wait-and-see judgement call, and the government in England is still biding its time. Earlier today, the health minister said the
pressure on the NHS from Covid was âmanageableâ and sustainable. However, Dr Chris Gibbons,
clinical director of medicine at Newcastle Hospitals Trust, paintsa worrying picture. Newcastleâs Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) is in a similar
situation to other hospitals across the UK. The hospital has seen record numbers of
patients coming through its A&E, as well as a rise in patients with Covid
and flu. The backlog in surgery and treatments due to the pandemic
has also significantly contributed to current pressures. Dr Gibbons tells the BBC the current number of admissions is higher than âanything
weâd see in the worst wintersâ. The current picture at Newcastleâs RVI emergency department
is difficult. Dr Gibbons says they are starting most days with patients waiting for
beds and the waiting times can be âfor eight or nine hoursâ. In some cases, patients will only be seen âfour, five or six hoursâ after arriving at A&E. He says the pressures on emergency care staff are âlike
nothing weâve seen beforeâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99998546
"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Covid: ""We are sticking with our plan."" More than 50,000 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK for the first time since 17 July. Amid calls for more restrictions, Boris Johnson urged people to come forward for booster jabs when their time comes. The prime minister said those who become eligible for a third dose of vaccine should organise an appointment straight away. The UK recorded 52,009 new Covid cases on Thursday - alongside 115 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Mr Johnson said, despite high cases, the government was ""continuing with its plan"" and that things were much better now than a year ago. He said that was in large part thanks to the rollout of the vaccine, which has weakened the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths. Reported cases on 17 July were 54,674 and came several weeks after more households could mix together and indoor hospitality resumed. Doctors are demanding ministers trigger England's ""Plan B"" - which would reimpose rules such as mandatory face masks and working from home advice. Why are UK Covid cases so high? When will I get a booster jab? Are people wearing masks less often? Speaking in Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson said that the numbers of infections and deaths being seen were ""within the parameters of what the predictions were... given the steps we've taken"". It was also because the country was in an ""incomparably better position than last year because of vaccines"" that there was more confidence around the current plan in place,"" he said. He also insisted that the ""most important thing people can do is get that booster jab"" and that ""when you get the call, get the jab"". The PM appealed for 12 to 15-years-old to get their first vaccination because there was ""no shortage of supply"" and there were ""huge quantities"" of vaccine available. An estimated 4.7 million booster doses - which come at least six months after second jabs - have now been delivered in the UK. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ministers were letting the ""security wall against the virus... crumble"" and the booster programme was ""stalling"". But Prof Jeremy Brown, an adviser to the government on vaccines, said Sir Keir's criticism was ""not an accurate description of what's going on"". ""The problem at the moment [is] the people coming to hospital with severe Covid and ending up in intensive care and dying are those who've not had any vaccines,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. Under the government's plan for tackling Covid in England over the winter, the strategy currently in operation is Plan A. It involves offering booster jabs to about 30 million people and offering a single vaccine dose to healthy 12 to 15-year-olds, as well as encouraging ventilation for indoor gatherings, hand-washing and face masks in crowded places. Daily UK infections have been above 40,000 for nine days in a row. Analysis by BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby Daily cases of coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen slightly. Cases last went above 50,000 in mid-July and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being introduced. It's possible that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening. The current strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable, and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to increase protection among the population. Free testing is also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid rates in Europe. In 10-19 year olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections could leak into other age groups. A change in people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on the NHS ahead of winter. Scientists say it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination programme hadn't even started yet. Case rates are rising in all but one region of England, the UK Health Security Agency said, with the lowest rates in London. Rates of Covid were highest in those aged 10 to 19-years-old, with the lowest seen in those over 80. There were 8,142 patients with Covid in hospital as of Wednesday, the latest data showed, with 872 patients with Covid in beds equipped with ventilators. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the doctors' union the British Medical Association, said it can ""categorically"" say that the ""time is now"" for starting Plan B. He stressed that case numbers were comparable to March, when England was in lockdown, and were ""unheard of in similar European nations"". ""It is therefore incredibly concerning that [Mr Javid] is not willing to take immediate action to save lives and to protect the NHS,"" he said. Across the UK, booster jabs are being offered to: Over-50s Frontline health and social care workers Older adults in residential care homes People aged 16-49 years old with underlying health conditions which put them at greater risk of severe Covid Adults who share a household with vulnerable people The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination, and will typically be either Pfizer or Moderna. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that ""at this point"" the government would not introduce itsPlan B measures. However, he also warned insufficient vaccine uptake would make restrictions in England more likely. And he said infections could soon rise to around 100,000 per day.

Amid speculation of moves to stricter Plan B measures in England to combat rising cases, Boris Johnson appeared to rule this out for now, saying: ""We are sticking with our plan."" We've also been hearing from people who say the government should not enact stricter Covid measures due to the impact on the economy and mental health. Phil Hadleysays: ""I think we just have to get on with life... we cannot keep shutting the economy down because the NHS is busy, I've had enough of my personal liberties being taken away from me just to protect the NHS, it's supposed to be there for us not the other way around."" Katie from Southamptonsays: ""Further restrictions, especially further lockdowns will be extraordinarily damaging to society, especially to the mental health of many. ""Since there is no more that can be done given the success of the vaccination roll out, a further lockdown sets the extremely dangerous precedent that lockdowns will become an unquestionable staple whenever cases of COVID, or any further spreadable disease puts pressure on the NHS."" In Wales, the NHS has just recorded its worst ever performance figures - with nearly 250,000 people waiting more than nine months for treatment, a 10-fold increase from the start of the pandemic. Its chief executive Andrew Goodall says the system is running ""at the hottest we've ever seen"". There's more on thathere. And in Northern Ireland, the health service is facing ""its worst winter ever"". That's the warning from the NI chair of the British Medical Association. Read morehere. You can see how cases are shifting in Scotland,here. Passengers wear face masks whilst travelling on a bus in London We've been hearing from people about their thoughts on the increase in Covid cases and whether the government should invoke itsPlan B measures- including compulsory face coverings in public, Covid passports and advising people to work from home. On Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid ruled it out at this point. But some readers think it should happen. Matt from Oxfordsays: ""I probably travel into London once a month, and yesterday I
saw a marked difference in people's behaviour. No more than 50% of people on
the Tube were wearing face masks. Nobody had masks on in the restaurant I ate
at, including staff. ""The scientists say that quite small restrictions (eg masks and
vaccine passports) have been shown to keep numbers down, so there seems
to be no reason why we aren't doing that, just to make the country a safer
place to go about our business..."" Phyllis Williamson says: ""I donât see the problem with making the wearing of face
masks mandatory on public transport and in busy, crowded areas â particularly
indoors. Itâs not pleasant but we had to do it for months and it didnât kill
us. It actually benefited us. ""I donât
want to go back to not being able to safely see my family and having to worry
about passing something on to them when I did. Reality Check Whether or not people should wear face masks has been a hot topic today, as cases rise. From 19 July in England, face
masks stopped being mandatory in most public places. They are still required in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Lots of studies have shown face
coverings can help stop the virus from being passed between people. But itâs much harder to prove how
much mask wearing reduces the amount of Covid circulating in a whole
population. That's
because it's hard to untangle it from all the other things going on at the same
time, like how much people choose to mix with each other. You
can read more about this and what could be causing the high number of
infections currently,here.  The daily government data also shows how many first and second vaccine doses have been given. It shows another 49,080 first doses have been given and 26,365 second doses. It means 45,460,122 people have now had two doses. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said four million third doses, or boosters, had now been given as well. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A medical worker collects a swab from a resident in Lanzhou's Chengguan district, Gansu province, on 20 October. An outbreak of
Covid-19 in China has led to swift restrictions being imposed in multiple
Chinese provinces over the last week. Since 16
October, cases of Covid-19 linked to travel and tourism in Chinaâs north have
reached at least nine provincial-level regions. Parts of Inner
Mongolia and Gansu province have gone into tight lockdown. Many schools have
closed in both regions; a school has also closed in China's capital, Beijing. Tourist sites
have closed in parts of Xiâan â the home of the Terracotta Warriors â and some
cities have cancelled large-scale exhibitions and closed venues like cinemas. The number of
cases in China is still relatively low â only in the double digits â however,
it is common for the country to tackle outbreaks by swiftly locking down
communities when even one resident tests positive. Citywide testing drives are ordered, and people are prohibited from leaving affected areas
unless they can show a negative test within days of travel. Given many of
the affected regions in this latest outbreak are in Chinaâs north, the National
Health Commission has urged enhanced measures to ensure that Covid-19
prevention work can be carried out safely. It has
particularly emphasised protecting female medical workers from the cold in the
coming months, and has urged limiting the amount of time people spend outdoors. Currently, it is common for large-scale testing drives to take place outside. As we reported just now, there have been more than 50,000 new Covid cases reported - with the total of 52,009 the highest since 17 July. On that day, there were 54,674 cases. It comes as levels have been progressively climbing in the UK. The previous eight days have all seen cases at more than 40,000. Cases over the last three months have been roughly the same as they were over a three-month period last winter, meaning we can compare them. Between July and October this year, there were just over three million cases, with 79,000 people ending up in hospital. Between October and January last year, there were just over 2.7 million cases, but more than 185,000 people needed hospital treatment. This was before vaccines were widely available. So why are cases so high - is it the looser rules, waning immunity or to do with issues with the vaccine rollout? We've taken a closer look at some of those questionshere. Dozens of ambulances remain outside the emergency department on Thursday afternoon A health minister said earlier that the current pressure on the NHS was manageable and sustainable aftera doctor's union called formore restrictions to return in England to tackle ""unacceptable"" Covid case rates. Now, the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust (RCHT) has declareda critical incident due to the pressures it is facing. The trust reported up to 100 people in the emergency department waiting to be seen on Wednesday, with 25 ambulances waiting to transfer patients. It prompted managers to contact staff to ask them to work extra hours to help handle ""intense pressures"". In September, all planned and urgent surgeries were temporarily suspended due to the pressure the hospital is under. Routine surgeries remain suspended, with urgent procedures reviewed daily and continuing where possible. The trust said on Thursday it was treating 44 patients with Covid-19 - 10 more than the previous week. RCHT medical director Dr Allister Grant said there was ""unprecedented demand"" on the NHS in Cornwall, ""more so this week than at any point during the pandemic"". You can read morehere. The number of new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK has topped 50,000 for the first time since July. A total of 52,009 were recorded, according to the government statistics. And there have been another 115 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. As the debate over masks and face coverings rumbles on,Jacob Rees-Mogg says that Tories don't wear them in the Commons, but he follows Health Secretay Sajid Javid yesterday, saying MPs
should, to âset an exampleâ. MPs would indeed be effective in that if they did wear masks, Professor Robert West, a health psychologist advising the government as
part of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), tells the BBC Radio 4âs World at One. He says that for people who have
mixed feelings about mask-wearing, seeing MPs without them gives them an excuse
to say âif theyâre not doing it, why should I do itâ. Prof West adds that âitâs about
leadershipâ and âit behoves them to do the same thingâ. Jim ReedHealth reporter, BBC News Paul Carter, 75 and from Leeds, was one of the first to get a Covid booster jab on the high street at end of September Covid booster jabs will eventually be available toeveryone over 50,younger
adults with some chronic health conditions, frontline health and social care staff and adults who share a household with vulnerable people. But to be eligible, it has to be
182 days, or roughly six months, since that person received a second
vaccine dose. In all parts of the UK those eligible should be contacted
and invited to book a booster. Some care homes may have other
arrangements, with elderly residents visited by mobile units. In England, the health secretary has said that if you still
havenât been contactedandit is six months plus one extra week after
that second dose,then you can now go online,externalor phone 119 and book yourself in without an invite. For Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the advice for
over 50s and those with underlying health conditions is still to wait to be
contacted â either by phone, letter or text. The UK is in a ""much better position"" going into autumn and winter than it was 12 months ago - but ""we must fortify ourselves further"", says PM Boris Johnson. Speaking on a visit to Armagh, he says the government is ""watching the numbers very carefully every day"" - but that the situation is as predicted, so the government is ""sticking with our plan"". Johnson says that now, ""the most important thing people can do is just get that booster jab - when you get the call, get the jab"". It's because of vaccines that we're better off now than this time a year ago, he says, adding: ""But we must fortify ourselves further. ""The numbers are high, we see can see what's happening, we can see the increase, now is the time to get those booster jabs, and to vaccinate the 12-15 year olds as well."" We've got a storyhereon the PM's comments if you want to read more. This video can not be played Masks in Commons: Jacob Rees-Mogg and Pete Wishart Whether MPs, and indeed, the broader public in England should be back wearing masks has been strongly debated today. Doctors have called on the government to reimpose some rules in England, including face masks, because of the high number of new daily infections in the UK. The rules are different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where face coverings are required in certain places, including on public transport. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg says a ""convivial fraternal spirit"" means the Conservatives do not need to wear masks in the Commons. The Commons leader said those on government benches knew each other, and teased Pete Wishart that he may not want to mix with SNP MPs who sat with him in the Commons. The minister says that Tory MPs can make their own choice on face masks. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Mask-wearing is patchy in Poland and vaccination take-up has flat-lined The UK is not the only European country seeing a surge in
Covid cases. Several countries in Central and Eastern Europe are also
experiencing a dramatic rise in infections. Here in Poland, weâve had more than
double the amount of cases compared with last week, and Health Minister Adam
Niedzielski has called it an âexplosionâ. The number of new daily infections
exceeds 5,000 and the amount of people in hospital with Covid is the
highest since the start of June. Mr Niedzielski said some of the highest
infection rates were in regions in eastern Poland with the lowest vaccination take-up. Overall, 63% of adults here are fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 74%,
and take-up has flat-lined since August. The health minister says
heâs instructed police to impose fines on people flouting the rules. Itâs increasingly common here to see people in shops and on public transport without facemasks. The rising number of cases at home is also having an impact outside the country, with Morocco banning direct flights to and from the UK because of the rising number of cases. But on the upside, fully vaccinated travellers from 33 countries - including the UK - will now be able to travel to the US from
8 November. It's all explained here:  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News As we've been reporting, cases of coronavirus are rising sharply, frontline doctors say they are under huge pressure and some healthcare staff report being burnt out. But the government in England says there's no reason to change tack right now. Moving to Plan B on tackling the pandemic would involve relatively small changes to people's lives. It would mean compulsory face masks on public transport and in shops, and/or advice to work from home. So what's stopping the move? Ministers say the NHS is extremely busy but they don't believe the pressure is unsustainable. There is still headroom and the country is in a much more positive place than it was last autumn. Even as cases rise, the Covid vaccination programme is keeping a lid on hospital admissions and deaths - and that's why speeding up access to booster vaccines for the over 50s and jabs for young teens is a priority, as well as targeting the five million people who've so far refused a vaccine. This will increase protection for the majority of the population over the next few months. And with infections rising, natural immunity from the virus is also helping that process. Predicting what will happen to cases is tricky. Cases could still flatten and come down or continue to rise to 100,000 as Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned on Wednesday. In many countries in Europe, the picture is much rosier and that's causing some concern in the UK as a whole. There is no precise trigger for Plan B - it's a wait-and-see judgement call, and the government in England is still biding its time. Earlier today, the health minister said the
pressure on the NHS from Covid was âmanageableâ and sustainable. However, Dr Chris Gibbons,
clinical director of medicine at Newcastle Hospitals Trust, paintsa worrying picture. Newcastleâs Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) is in a similar
situation to other hospitals across the UK. The hospital has seen record numbers of
patients coming through its A&E, as well as a rise in patients with Covid
and flu. The backlog in surgery and treatments due to the pandemic
has also significantly contributed to current pressures. Dr Gibbons tells the BBC the current number of admissions is higher than âanything
weâd see in the worst wintersâ. The current picture at Newcastleâs RVI emergency department
is difficult. Dr Gibbons says they are starting most days with patients waiting for
beds and the waiting times can be âfor eight or nine hoursâ. In some cases, patients will only be seen âfour, five or six hoursâ after arriving at A&E. He says the pressures on emergency care staff are âlike
nothing weâve seen beforeâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99854726

"Major tax evasion and avoidance schemes have cost governments an estimated â¬150bn (Â£127bn) in lost revenues, research shows. So-called cum-cum and cum-ex schemes are designed to exploit weaknesses in national tax laws. They apply to the payments, or dividends, firms make to shareholders. The new figures have been calculated by a team of experts at the University of Mannheim, in partnership with the German not-for-profit group Correctiv. Evidence from leaked documents and people involved in the schemes suggests UK taxpayers have also lost out, potentially to the tune of billions of pounds. The tax fraud merry-go-round that cost billions The research forms part of a joint investigation carried out by newsrooms worldwide, co-ordinated by Correctiv, known as the CumEx Files 2.0. It casts new light on a growing scandal which first came to public attention in 2018. So-called cum-ex trades were transactions where shares were sold from one investor to another immediately before the payment of a dividend (cum, or with, dividend) but delivered afterwards (ex-dividend). This tactic effectively created confusion over who owned the shares at the moment when the dividend was paid. It allowed both parties to claim rebates on withholding tax - a levy which had only been paid once, when the dividend was issued. This practice became popular in Germany in the early years of the century and continued until 2012, when the law was changed. It also spread to other countries, notably Denmark, but also France, Belgium, Italy and Austria. In Germany, prosecutors have launched a wave of criminal inquiries. Several individuals have already been found guilty of tax evasion. Some 1,000 people are currently under investigation, including junior and senior banking staff, lawyers and brokers. A list acquired by German broadcaster ARD's investigative programme Panorama contains the names of more than 700 of those under scrutiny, of whom 134 are known to be UK citizens. Although London has been widely identified as the place where many cum-ex trading strategies were conceived, the UK exchequer was not a target - because dividends here are not subject to withholding tax. But documents show that bankers were able to carry out related trades to ""recycle"" otherwise unusable German tax credits and generate profits at UK taxpayers' expense. The complex system relied on so-called ""manufactured overseas dividends"" (MODs), payments made between parties involved in so-called short sales of borrowed shares in foreign companies. It allowed investors to generate liabilities which could be offset against German tax credits and at the same time, generate a credit against UK tax. Estimates vary as to how much this scheme actually cost the UK taxpayer. One individual who was involved in these kinds of trades in the past suggested it would have been several hundred million pounds a year until 2005 - and more than Â£100m per year thereafter. Another whistleblower told the BBC that ""these were not small trades"", and that the practice ""must have been used on a significant scale"". In 2014, HMRC changed the rules on taxation of MODs. It says this was done for a variety of reason, including to ""reduce the potential for tax avoidance"". While the fallout from the cum-ex affair has dominated media attention and prosecutor interest so far, the latest findings from Correctiv's investigation suggest an even bigger scandal may be brewing. Cum-ex is understood to have cost governments nearly â¬10bn. But according to researchers at the University of Mannheim, that figure is dwarfed by losses stemming from another long-standing form of dividend arbitrage, known as cum-cum. This strategy comes into play in countries where domestic and foreign investors are treated differently for tax purposes. A foreign investor will sell or loan shares just ahead of the dividend payment to a second investor resident in the country where the company is listed. The second party is able to claim a dividend tax credit that would not have been available to the foreign investor. The shares can then be passed back to the original owner, and the benefits shared. The Mannheim team has calculated that between 2000 and 2020, this practice cost 10 governments, including those of Germany, Spain, France and the US, a total of â¬141bn. It describes this estimate as ""very conservative"". Whether these losses will lead to prosecutions is less clear, however. While cum-ex involved generating multiple claims for withholding tax that had only been paid once, and its use has been described as a ""criminal act of tax fraud"" by Germany's Federal Court of Justice, experts say cum-cum sits in a legally grey area. ""It's not against the law,"" explains Christoph Spengel, a professor of international taxation and the leader of the Mannheim team. ""But in individual cases, in Germany it is against the law if the sole purpose of buying and repurchasing shares is to have a tax benefit.""

"The government has laid out its plans to reduce emissions sharply by 2035 and take the UK towards being a zero carbon economy by 2050. These including more electric cars, planting trees and moving away from gas-powered central heating. But what potential hazards are there ahead for ministers? UK sets out net zero plans for greenhouse gases Households to get Â£5,000 to replace gas boilers What does net zero mean? Six ways the UK could tackle climate change Some in the prime minister's own party doubt the economic arguments in favour of moving towards what they consider an over-reliance on renewable energy sources. Conservative MP John Redwood asked in the House of Commons what would happen when the sun stopped shining and the wind stopped blowing. Another, Steve Baker, said a lot of ""assumptions"" were involved and asked that ministers carry out a ""comprehensive audit"" of their plans. Tory MP: What happens when the wind doesn't blow? Others are concerned about the cost to the general public, particularly those on lower incomes, and the impact that, in turn, may have on their chances at the next election. Craig Mackinlay said it could become ""electorally difficult"" once people realised the plans ""cost them money"" or mean ""a lifestyle that's not as convenient"". Given that the Conservatives have an 80-seat majority, this is unlikely to stop any plans becoming law, but if some of Mr Johnson's backbenchers are not persuaded, there could be some political turbulence. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband was scathing in his response to the government's announcement, saying there was nothing like ""the commitment we believe is required"", in terms of investment, to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Labour'scommitment to borrow and invest Â£28bn per yearin tackling climate change is a markedly different approach to the Conservatives. The Treasury has said borrowing heavily to cut greenhouse gases goes against the ""polluter pays"" principle and passes the costs on to future taxpayers. It's not certain how this will play out in Parliament or whether this could become an important dividing line between the parties - and how it would play with voters. The Treasury accepts there will be an overall cost to achieving net zero emissions in the short term, but sources stress the cost of inaction would also be significant. No overall figure is given but officials admit new taxes will be needed to recoup the revenue lost from the move away from petrol and diesel fuelled cars, for example. The government raised Â£37bn from fuel duty and vehicle excise duty in the 2019-20 financial year, or about 1.7% of GDP. A carbon tax could plug some of this, but the takings would dwindle as emissions fall, leaving a big shortfall. How will voters feel if their bills go up to cover the costs? In an assessment to go with the government's carbon-cutting plans, the Treasury said that ""as with all economic transitions, ultimately the costs and benefits of the transition will pass through to households through the labour market, prices and asset values"". There is evidence of public support for stronger measures to tackle climate change, but if households end up having to spend a lot more money to go greener, there could be increased unease among voters that the government will not want ahead of a likely general election in the next couple of years. In particular, it is feared this could go down badly in some of the former industrial areas of the the Midlands and northern England where the Conservatives made large gains from Labour in 2019. ""Any policies we bring in will be designed to be fair across the board,"" the PM's spokesman said. One thing most governments agree on is that any effort to reduce emissions must be international if it is to succeed in limiting temperature rises. With the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow fast approaching, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hope his plan prompts other countries to make similar commitments and boost the chances of the UK brokering a renewed global effort to cut greenhouse gases. If the world's biggest CO2 producers - including the US, China and India - reach an agreement it could ease domestic political pressures and allow him to claim more of an environmental ""legacy"". US President Jo Biden and Indian PM Narendra Modi are attending COP26, but China's Xi Jinping isnot thought likely to do the same.

"The company behind brands such as PG Tips, Cornetto and Dove has said it will raise prices to cope with ""elevated levels"" of cost inflation which it expects to continue next year. Consumer goods giant Unilever said that it had already lifted its pricing. Unilever said this would continue across its global operations and within each of its product divisions. The company reported a 2.5% rise in sales for the third quarter to 30 September. Growth was supported by a 4.1% increase in prices while the volume of goods sold fell by 1.5%. On Wednesday, the Office for National Statistics said that the UK consumer prices index (CPI) measure ofinflation slowed to 3.1% in the year to September. However, inflation is expected to accelerate in the coming months due to a rise in energy costs as well as continuing disruption to UK and global supply chains. Unilever's chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, said: ""We expect inflation to be higher next year than this year."" It is not yet clear how Unilever's price rises will affect consumers. The company sells to businesses such as retailers, supermarkets and wholesalers who may or may not pass on higher costs to shoppers. But Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said Unilever was facing a ""balancing act of not increasing prices so much that its products are no longer competitive"". ""It is a real test of the strength of the company's brands,"" she said. ""After all, will we really stick with branded soap at a materially higher price when there's an unbranded alternative sitting next to it on the shelf which is an order of magnitude cheaper? ""If enough consumers decide they can put up with a cheaper alternative then it would become a big problem for Unilever."" Unilever's brands include Simple skin care, Sure deodorant and Vaseline. It also produces Marmite, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr stocks among many others. Unilever said it expected its full-year sales to grow between 3% and 5%, but that its profit margin would be unchanged. Earlier this week, the boss of the Food & Drink Federation warned that the hospitality industry, which includes restaurants and pubs,was seeing ""terrifying"" price inflationof between 14% and 18%. Mark Derry, executive chairman of Brasserie Bar Co, which owns the Brasserie Blanc chain of restaurants and whose chef patron is Raymond Blanc, told the BBC that while trading was holding up well, costs were rising which means it would have to raise prices for diners. Raymond Blanc, who holds two Michelin stars, is chef patron of Brasserie Bar Co ""There is an inevitable effect of all of this inflation and that is that we will have to try and put prices up,"" he said ""At the moment, we've tried very hard to hold them because obviously we've come out of a very, very serious problem over the last year and a half and doing our best to control it, but I cannot see how it is possible not to put prices up, frankly."" Kraft Heinz, known for its tomato ketchup and baked beans, recently warned thatpeople will have to get used to higher food prices. On Wednesday, food giant Nestle revealed that it had also increased prices, which rose by 2.1% in the third quarter. The maker of Kit-Kats, NescafÃ© and Purina pet products, said prices had risen on the back of higher energy and raw materials costs as well as transport. The Financial Times reported that,externalNestle's chief executive, Mark Schneider, said ""inflation costs are rising faster than we can roll forward through pricing. The situation has not improved. If anything we are seeing further downsides compared to what we told you in the summer"". Why are prices rising in the UK?

"The COP26 climate summit is under way in Glasgow - one of the biggest ever world meetings on how to tackle global warming. BBC News Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris answers some of your questions. You can send a question using the form at the bottom of this page. How is the average family going to find the extra Â£20,000 needed to buy an electric vehicle?  Nicola Hippisley, London You don't necessarily need an extra Â£20,000 to buy an electric vehicle. Overall, electric cars have been more expensive than petrol or diesel ones for some time, but the difference has been narrowing. The average cost of an electric car in the UK is about Â£44,000, but you can buy a basic one for less than Â£20,000. That's partly because the price of the batteries which electric cars use has fallen sharply in recent years. At the moment, the price of raw materials is threatening to push battery prices up again, but the industry expects that as electric car sales increase, economies of scale will kick in. Experts predict that new electric and petrol/diesel cars will cost the same within the next five years. It is also possible to lease an electric vehicle, and there's a growing second-hand market as well, where vehicles are much cheaper. The UK government currently offersa grant of up to Â£2,500 as a discount on the price of certain brand new low-emission vehicles,externalincluding some electric models. You can also claima grant of up to Â£350 to help meet the cost of installing a chargepoint,externalat your house if you have dedicated off-street parking. This is available whether you lease your car or own it outright. Separately, the Scottish government offers interest-free loans to help people buybrand new,externalorused,externalelectric vehicles. Why electric cars will take over sooner than you think Video: Should I buy an electric car? How will the decisions made at COP26 change our day-to-day lives? I want to know what I can do to help move these policies forward. Matthew Hadley, Harpenden The decisions made at COP26 are part of the wider ambition to decarbonise our economies - and that will certainly have an impact on daily life. The cars we drive and the way we heat our homes are going to change. Buying an electric vehicle, or getting a heat pump installed at home, is going to become more and more common. The hope - and for many the expectation - is that as these technologies become more established, the costs will come down. There are also personal choices to be made about what we eat (the Climate Change Committee which advises the government recommends a 20% reduction per person by 2050 in the amount of beef, lamb and dairy we consume), and how often we fly. Then there are practical issues like recycling and cutting down on waste as much as possible. Why are we still referring to 2050 as some sort of end goal, since very little has changed in the last two decades? Wouldn't 2040 or perhaps even 2030 put a little more urgency into every little step humanity takes? Jake Kettmann, Bega, NSW, Australia The year 2050 is the target date set by many countries for reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. But you're not alone in thinking that 2050 is much too far in the future to force some politicians or companies to take action now. That's why there are also plenty of interim targets, and the 2020s have been identified as a critical decade for climate action - it can't all be delayed until the 10 years leading up to 2050. Many of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases have now set targets for 2030, and the UN says overall emissions need to fall by 45% [by that date]compared to 2010 levels, if the aim of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is to remain realistic. At the moment, though, the world is nowhere near achieving that, even with the new pledges made at COP26. If scientists have already considered a 1.5C reduction goal will not be achieved, why don't we set up a new goal, which we may able to achieve? Ana, Vietnam Quite a few scientists think it may already be too late to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but they'd rather have an ambitious target to aim for. The Paris Agreement in 2015 set the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C. So ""well below 2C"" is already written into law as a secondary target. There's also a growing awareness of the need to take action which will make a difference in the next five to 10 years. That's why many of the agreements made at COP26 - to reverse deforestation, for example, or to cut global methane emissions by 30% - set 2030 as their target date. The challenge now of course is to turn those promises into practice, and to deliver urgent change. How can we be sure the claims made about greenhouse gas emissions can be verified? What independent observer is measuring different countries' attempts to reduce their fossil fuel usage? Lee Gary, Spain Checking claims made about greenhouse gas emissions is one of the biggest issues for negotiators at COP26. At the moment, countries only have to review and update their pledges for cutting emissions every five years. Many people argue that's not often enough, and some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change want to turn it into an annual process to keep the pressure on. The role of independent observer is supposed to be filled by UN scientists. Buta recent investigation by The Washington Post,externalfound multiple examples of flawed or inaccurate data submitted to the UN by individual countries. It is another example of climate promises falling short of what is required, as a process which relies so heavily on data needs to ensure that the data is accurate. Last month,a UN-backed body launched a scheme,externalto verify net zero claims made by big companies, to ensure that corporate pledges can be easily compared and properly scrutinised. Is there a way to force countries in the UN, especially China and India, to cut back to net zero by 2050? Can sanctions or similar trade restrictions be used against them? Diana Butungi, Kampala Only a few countries have made their net zero pledges legally binding. Many of the national pledges are non-binding targets, but there is a hope that as momentum towards net zero begins to accelerate it will provide an incentive for others to follow. It would be possible in theory to impose trade or other sanctions on countries that are moving more slowly, but that could be counter-productive. The focus of meetings like COP26 is to try to encourage international cooperation. It's also unfair to put all the blame on countries like India and China for the majority of carbon emissions, even though China is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world today and India is the third largest. China and India have huge populations, and much lower emissions per person than more developed countries. In any case, it's important to consider the historical role played by European countries and the United States which are responsible for far more cumulative emissions than China or India. The damaging effects of emitting CO2 into the atmosphere linger for hundreds of years, and the rich world has acknowledged that it has the primary responsibility for tackling climate change. What does net zero mean? Are there plans for governments and countries to invest in carbon-capture technologies on a very large scale? If not, why? Bernath Bence, Netherlands The trouble with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is that the technology that does exist, won't be rolled out fast enough to make any significant difference this decade, when greenhouse gas emissions need to fall significantly. In 2020, for example, the UK allocated Â£1bn to a CCS infrastructure fund, with the ambition of capturing the equivalent of 10m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030. That target has already been increased to capturing 20-30m metric tonnes by 2030. But, to put that in perspective, the UK is estimated to have produced the net equivalent of more than 450m metric tonnes of CO2 in 2019. Government investment varies hugely around the world. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia are relying very heavily on CCS to allow them to continue producing fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, but that means scaling up the technology in a way which has not yet been proven to work effectively. How do agricultural products like rice and sugar contribute to the increase of CO2? What can we do to help reduce emissions? Ng Wee Meng, Singapore Most forms of agriculture produce CO2 emissions in one way or another. Beef is widely agreed to be the most carbon-intensive food to produce globally, but there are emissions from sugar and rice - these are connected with factors such as deforestation, animal feed, energy used in processing and transport, and packaging. One study estimates that rice, for example,produces the equivalent of 4kg of CO2 emissions for every 1kg of rice produced,external. Given that 755 million tonnes of rice are produced every year around the world, that is a lot of CO2. On the other hand, rice is an essential staple food feeding billions around the world. The best way to help reduce emissions is to try to ensure you eat food which is produced as sustainably as possible - although many people may not have the luxury of that choice. Would enforcing quotas for meat consumption and flight travels be efficient and feasible? Anonymous, Geneva Meat eating (especially beef) and travelling by air both have a sizeable environmental impact. Eating one or two hamburgers a week for a yearcreates the same amount of greenhouse gasesas heating a UK home for 95 days. And a return economy flight from London to New Yorkemits about 0.67 tonnes of CO2.That's 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK. In theory, enforced quotas for meat consumption or flying would make a difference, but there's little political appetite or support for that to happen. Instead, the focus is on encouraging behavioural change. The UK Climate Change Committee - which advises the government - has recommended that people should consume 20% less meat and dairy by 2030, and 35% less by 2050. People are also being urged to think about flying less. Using taxation to make certain things more expensive would probably be a more realistic solution than trying to enforce quotas. What's your diet's carbon footprint? Will I still be able to fly in a net zero world? Why can't we have an international fund to help poorer countries attain zero carbon emissions? Robert Patterson, Darlington That is partly what the current debate on climate finance is all about. In 2009, rich countries said they would provide $100bn (Â£73bn) every year to the developing world by 2020. But they have been unable to live up to their promise, and they are now suggesting they will only meet that target in 2023. Poorer countries need this money to help tackle the effects of climate change that they are already facing. But they also need it to make sure their economies become greener as they develop, on a path to net zero carbon emissions. What does net zero mean? If it is people causing climate change, what is being done to stop over-population ? Gaye Schmidt, Perth, Australia Overpopulation isn't the root cause of climate change. Rather, it's the excessive emission of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet up. And the richest one per cent of the world's population is responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest fifty per cent. It is true to say the population of the planet can't keep increasing indefinitely, because there is a finite number of resources available. But excessive consumption has played a larger role in climate change than a growing global population. Can your sex life be eco-friendly? The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. A really simple guide to climate change Why the COP26 climate summit is important What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change Is the global capitalist model not at odds with climate change and the need for a greener way of life? Andrew, Exeter Matt McGrath writes: According to some experts, such as the economist Lord Stern, climate change can be seen as the great failure of the market. This is because businesses have not generally had to pay for the damage they have caused to the environment. Global efforts to tackle climate change over the past two decades have focused more on harnessing capitalism to limit warming - for instance, putting a price on carbon and making the polluter pay, to ensure that emissions are ultimately restricted. Meanwhile, it's also the case that if there's consumer demand for greener products and services, capitalism will try to meet that demand. But there's evidently still a lot of work to be done to make these approaches work. Does COP26 really need 25,000 people there? They will generate a lot of CO2, so why can't many elements be online? David, Birmingham Matt McGrath writes: The pandemic might be seen as the perfect moment for the UN to use technology for negotiations, and it was attempted during a preparatory meeting for COP in June, which ran for three weeks. Unfortunately, it didn't go well - time-zone and technology challenges made it almost impossible for countries with limited resources, progress was limited and decisions were put off. As a result, many developing nations have insisted on having an in-person COP. They feel that it is far easier for their voices to be ignored on a dodgy Zoom connection. They also bring a lived experience of climate change that it is critical for rich countries to hear first-hand. There's some evidence that this works. In 2015, the presence of island states and vulnerable nations was key to securing the commitment to limit temperature changes to 1.5C in the Paris Agreement.

"This video can not be played ""Our past has shaped and scarred us"" The head of the Irish Catholic Church has said partition causes him ""a deep sense of loss and sadness"". Archbishop Eamon Martin was addressing a service to mark the centenary of Ireland being divided and the formation of Northern Ireland. In 1921, the island was divided into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State. Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined 150 guests from both sides of the border at the event on Thursday. Archbishop Martin said for the past 100 years, partition had ""polarised people on this island"". ""It has institutionalised difference, and it remains a symbol of cultural, political and religious division between our communities,"" he said. He told the service in Armagh's Church of Ireland Cathedral that he also felt churches could have gone further. NI Secretary Brandon Lewis and Prime Minister Boris Johnson were among those attending the centenary church service ""I have to face the difficult truth that, perhaps, we in the churches could have done more to deepen our understanding of each other and to bring healing and peace to our divided and wounded communities,"" he said. Speaking afterwards, the prime minister said: ""It has been very moving to be here today and see the way in which people from very different perspectives have come together."" Mr Johnson said Northern Ireland was ""an incredible part of the country"" and had ""an amazing future"". The prime minister added: ""I am a passionate unionist and, of course, I believe the future is within the United Kingdom."" The Queen had been due to attend the service but wasunable to travel for medical reasons. Irish president Michael D Higginsdeclined an invitation. The Armagh church service was organised to ""mark the centenaries of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland"". President Higgins said the title of the service made it ""inappropriate"" for him to attend as head of state. Sinn FÃ©in, including Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, also decided not to attend. A children's choir sang during the church service marking Northern Ireland's centenary However, Colum Eastwood, the leader of Northern Ireland's other nationalist party, the SDLP, was present. Among others at the service were Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP); DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson; Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie; Alliance leader Naomi Long; Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride. Two representatives from the Irish government were also present- Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, from the Fine Gael party, and chief whip Jack Chambers, from Fianna FÃ¡il. With Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey, a Sinn FÃ©in member, not attending, deputy speaker Roy Beggs formally represented the Northern Ireland Assembly. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney arriving at the service The event, titled ""A Service of Reflection and Hope"", was organised by the leaders of the main Protestant and Catholic Churches. It began with the ringing of the cathedral bell before the Dean of Armagh, Rev Shane Forster, sent his good wishes to the Queen. Welcoming the congregation in both English and Irish, he said: ""Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has divided us. And, yet, it has also, on occasion, brought us together."" The leaders of Ireland's main churches delivered their personal reflections on the creation of Northern Ireland. This video can not be played Church leaders reflect on NI's centenary The Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr David Bruce, said: ""I grieve the times when fear has held us back from building relationships with those with whom we differ. ""If we are to build a better future, then we must recognise our own woundedness and our responsibility to care for the wounds of one another."" Dr Ivan Patterson, the president of the Irish Council of Churches, said ""we need to learn"" from the example of young people. ""They are a generation who want to build peace, a generation who respect and care for this planet in solidarity with the poorest and most vulnerable here and around the world."" Church of Ireland Primate Rev John McDowell said:  ""I am hopeful. Hopeful in a new generation who know that the big problems we've landed them with, especially climate change and economic inequality, can only be tackled together. ""I think there are already signs that the next generation will see the things that we obsessed about as secondary and place their priorities elsewhere. ""As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light-filled, prosperous and peaceful future."" The main sermon was given by Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu, the president of the Methodist Church in Ireland The main sermon was given by the president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu, who told the congregation: ""We have come a long way - not just a century but centuries. ""During that time people have cared for one another and made efforts to build community."" But he added: ""We have also been blighted by sectarian divisions, terrible injustices, destructive violence, and by win-lose political attitudes. And for this, we have cause to lament."" African-born leader to give centenary sermon Queen cancels Northern Ireland trip on medical advice Church leaders hope for 'healing' centenary events Dr Yambasu said Thursday's service was an opportunity ""to give thanks and, also, lament; to imagine what could be, and to choose the way forward that can be mutually beneficial"". The service included an opening prayer in Irish led by Linda Ervine and SeÃ¡n Coll. Intercessions were offered by Prof Mary Hannon-Fletcher and Robert Barfoot, both of whom were injured in the Troubles. Children carried a lantern to the altar, a symbol of light and hope for the future. Northern Ireland was established inMay 1921 after the partition of Ireland. It followed decades of turmoil between nationalists, who wanted independence from British rule, and unionists, who wanted to remain in the United Kingdom. The border divided the 32-county island into two separate jurisdictions - six counties in the north-east became Northern Ireland, which is still part of the UK. The other 26-county territory became the Irish Free State, but is now the Republic of Ireland. Nationalists, north and south of the border, were infuriated by partition and continued to campaign for independence for the whole island. Many unionists were also bitterly disappointed, especially those who lived on the southern side and woke up to find themselves in a new state on 3 May 1921. The BBC News NI website has a dedicated section marking the 100th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland and partition of the island. There are special reports on the major figures of the time and the events that shaped modern Ireland available atbbc.co.uk/ni100.

"Vaccination is 90% effective at preventing deaths from the Delta variant of Covid-19, researchers say. The data, released by the University of Edinburgh, was gathered using a Scotland-wide Covid surveillance tool. Figures suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 90% effective and the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab 91% effective at preventing deaths. It looked at people who have been double-vaccinated but who have tested positive for Covid in the community. What is the Delta variant? When will I get a booster jab? The study is the first to show across an entire country how effective vaccines are at preventing death from the Delta variant, which is the most dominant form of Covid in the UK. Researchers defined death from Covid as anyone who died within 28 days of a positive PCR test, or with Covid recorded as a cause of death on their death certificate. The study analysed data from 5.4 million people in Scotland between 1 April and 27 September this year. During this period, 115,000 people tested positive for Covid using a PCR test in the community, rather than in hospital, and there were 201 Covid-related deaths recorded. No deaths have been recorded in those who have been double-vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine in Scotland, according to the data. Researchers said it is therefore not possible to estimate this particular vaccine's effectiveness in preventing Covid-related deaths. The research team from the University of Edinburgh, University of Strathclyde and Public Health Scotland analysed the dataset as part of the EAVE II project - Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of Covid-19. It uses anonymised, linked-patient data to track the pandemic and the vaccine rollout in real time. So far, 87.1% of adults in Scotland have taken a second dose of the Covid vaccine. Third ""booster"" doses are being offered to everyone over 50, along with frontline medical staff and younger adults with some underlying health conditions. Prof Aziz Sheikh, director of the University of Edinburgh's Usher Institute and EAVE II study lead, said: ""With the Delta variant now the dominant strain in many places worldwide, and posing a higher risk of hospitalisation than previous variants seen in the UK, it is reassuring to see that vaccination offers such high protection from death very shortly after the second dose. ""If you still have not taken up your offer to be vaccinated, I would encourage you to do so based on the clear benefits it offers."" Prof Chris Robertson, of the University of Strathclyde and Public Health Scotland, said: ""This study shows the value of carrying out analyses of routine healthcare data available in near real-time. ""Our findings are encouraging in showing that the vaccine remains an effective measure in protecting both ourselves and others from death from the most dominant variant of Covid-19."" He added that it was important to validate these early results with follow-up studies. The team behind the study said due to the observational nature of the figures, data about vaccine effectiveness should be interpreted with caution and said it was not possible to make a direct comparison between both vaccines.

"This video can not be played Robyn says she went from having a few drinks to being dragged to the toilet A woman who said she had her drink spiked in a pub felt ""gaslighted"" by police officers after trying to find a way to verify it. Robyn, 26, blacked out after just a few drinks with friends in Caerphilly county and said she was ""sent round in circles"" trying to be taken seriously. It comes as aboycott of clubsin some cities will take place, including Cardiff, on 29 October. Gwent Police said anyone dissatisfied with their service could contact them. Ch Supt Mark Hobrough added: ""Across the organisation, officers and staff are committed to providing a high quality of service to all those they come into contact with."" Police concern over drink spiking at house parties Students call for club boycott over drink spiking Do men know enough about drink spiking? Robyn was out when she said she ""just blacked out"" after only having a few drinks. She has no recollection of her fiancÃ©e picking her up and was told the next morning she was ""a mess"", having collapsed on the floor. She said she knew she had been spiked and called 101 and 111. She was sent to A&E, where she was told they could not perform the test. Robyn's fiancÃ©e (left) picked her up from the pub and thought she was drunk because of the way she was acting She then contacted the police again and said she was ""treated like a criminal"" and described the experience as ""just awful"". She felt officers were ""accusatory"" towards her for drinking and said the ""mental gymnastics"" she went through ""took its toll"". Gaslighting is defined as manipulating someone into thinking they are wrong even when they are right. Police closed the case as ""no offences were identified"". Tests can be done to see if drugs are in a person's system, but it needs to be within 12 to 72 hours. Robyn said the processes were not there to allow this and even though she ""pushed hard"", she would be put off reporting again as she does not think it is taken seriously. She said: ""It happened in a place I really did not expect it to happen and that is what scared me. ""It isn't about me, it is about other people and I feel really worried for women who have got to go through the same thing. ""They don't seem to take it seriously unless something really bad has happened, but people getting spiked against their will is bad in itself. ""There needs to be intervention to stop something worse happening."" A campaign in Cardiff called Girls' Night In  is encouraging people to boycott clubs in order to have drink spiking taken more seriously. Similar events are also happening in Leeds, Edinburgh and Nottingham. Organiser Sophie - not her real name -  said the Instagram page got daily messages of people's experiences being spiked and the support was ""overwhelming"". The stories vary from being safely taken home by friends to being injected with needles or sexually assaulted, she said. ""It's all well and good telling people it's not good enough but actually doing something to make clubs change is something else. ""As victims I don't think you should be expected to protect yourselves."" She added that training needs to implemented in bars ""so it can be spotted"", as well as tests and bottle caps being available in every bar as a temporary measure. Katie Snaith said she lost control of her body and was worried what reaction spiking could have had with her anti-depressants Katie Snaith, 20, is a second year history student at Cardiff University. When she had her drink spiked, she ""blacked out"" for the whole night and lost control of her body, becoming ""violently ill"". She reported it to the police and students' union the next day but said she was told not much could come of it as she did not take a test. Katie takes anti-depressants and said people on medication could be given something that could kill them. She said: ""I'm always very careful, so I think my friends were a bit confused as to why I was behaving in a way they've never seen me like before. ""It's not my fault I'm on medication and it's not my fault that I got spiked but you then kind of internalise it and feel like it was your mistake and think 'I should have done more, this, that or the other'. ""I think it's quite scary. You're always taught to be safe but even within your own union, with students who study at same place as you, you're not safe with them. ""It's hard to feel safe anywhere."" Source: Drinkaware Figures obtained by the BBC in 2019 revealeda rise in recorded cases of drink spiking, with more than 2,600 reported incidents in England and Wales since 2015. Helena Conibear, CEO of theAlcohol Education Trust,external, said the reported numbers were not reflective as many people did not report it or even know they have been spiked. She said spiking happened at festivals or house parties, which meant it was not always strangers that people need to be wary of. Lat week, the charity opened a survey and had almost 800 responses in five days. Out of the respondents, 16% of women, 8% of men and 17% of people identifying as other said they had been spiked. Of these, 91% did not report it to police, which Ms Conibear said could be down to embarrassment or fear of not being believed. Ms Conibear said: ""This is not something that is not funny or a joke. It can be life changing for the person who's been spiked."" She said it was important to report it as quickly as possible to prevent it happening to others.

"St Helena, pictured here is its capital Jamestown, has remained free of coronavirus Alasdair and Gill Maclean say they felt a bit guilty having spent much of the past year happily living on a beautiful, tropical island, untouched by Covid-19. The English couple had been sailing around the world prior to the start of the pandemic, when they arrived at the British Overseas Territory island of St Helena, in the middle of the south Atlantic. ""We had been due to leave 10 days later, and we ended up spending just over eight months,"" says Mr Maclean. He adds that he and his wife were conflicted about updating friends back in the UK about their good fortune. ""How do you tell them you're having a lovely time, freely going to restaurants, and partying when they're all in lockdown?"" Alasdair and Gill Maclean say they were very happy indeed on St Helena Located some 1,200 miles (2,000 km) west of the African nation of Angola, and 2,500 miles east of Brazil, St Helena has a population of around 4,500 people, and is 47 sq miles (121 sq km) in size. To put that into context, it has about the same landmass as Jersey in the Channel Islands. St Helena's claim to fame since March 2020, is that it remains one of only a handful of places on Planet Earth to have not reported a single case of coronavirus. Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? This meant that when the UK government introduced its Covid traffic light system back in May, for countries (and overseas territories) that people could visit, St Helena was always one of the few on the green list - meaning you wouldn't have to quarantine upon your return. The island hopes that this spotlight has encouraged more potential tourists to visit. Matthew Joshua, the St Helena Government's head of visitor information services, says this already appears to be the case. ""We're getting an increase in inquiries. It has put St Helena on the map."" St Helena is part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, while South Georgia is the largest constituent of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands But how exactly do you get to St Helena? Prior to the opening of the island's airport in 2016 the only way to reach the island was by sea. Then for the first year of the airport's operationit was unusable due to safety concerns about high winds over the approach to the runway.This led to the facility, which cost the UK government Â£285m, being dubbed ""the world's most useless"" airport. However, after a number of trial flights, the airport was eventually passed as safe to use,with the first commercial flights starting in October, 2017. Mr Joshua says the issue got unfair press coverage. ""We don't have tropical storms like you do in the Caribbean, but there is wind."" Before the pandemic, St Helena was served by weekly flights from Johannesburg and Cape Town. But these routes are still on hold due to coronavirus restrictions in South Africa. Instead, St Helena is currently served by Titan Airways charter flights every three weeks to and from London Stansted Airport. St Helena Airport had a bumpy start to operations For many people, St Helena is best-known as the place where French military and political leader Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled to, and where he died in 1821. Visitors to the rocky, steep-sided island can see the house where he lived, which is now a museum. Other attractions include sea fishing, diving, hiking, the colonial era streets of the capital Jamestown, the warm weather, and exploring the fauna and flora -the island is home to more than 500 species of plants and animals not found anywhere else.,external New Economyis a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast. Back in 2019, St Helena had 5,135 overnight visitors, plus the odd day-visit by cruise ships. This number then fell to 2,071 in 2020, mostly before the end of March, and then down to 696 from January to July of this year. Currently all visitors have to quarantine for 10 days. The island has just two hotels, which remain closed. Sasha Ella, communications manager for the largest - Mantis St Helena Hotel - says that times have been tough, and they will only return to normal when the world puts coronavirus behind it. ""It is our feeling that when access and frequency of the flights to the island, and relaxation to the quarantine restrictions, take place, only then will a positive effect be felt on the island,"" she says. St Helena also has a number of private guest houses. St Helena enjoys tropical weather Another very remote, and Covid-19 free British island that was permanently on the UK government's green list, is South Georgia. Located in the south Atlantic, some 800 miles south east of the Falkland Islands, it is 1,362 sq miles (3,528 sq km) in size. Only accessible by sea, the island has no permanent human population. Instead there are two government officers, and two dozen or so staff from the British Antarctic Survey, the UK's polar research institute. Like St Helena, South Georgia is now waiting for tourists to return. Prior to the pandemic, it would be visited by cruise ships going to and from the coast of Antarctica. In the summer of 2019/2020 (its summer is during winter in the UK) it had 12,568 visitors, but this fell to just two people in 2020/21. ""In a normal year, tourism accounts for around 20% of our income,"" says Ross James, visitor management & bio-security officer for the Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands. South Georgia offers dramatic, snowy vistas The island has no overnight accommodation available for visitors, who instead only stay for a few hours, and have to follow strict rules during their visit designed to safeguard the natural habitat. Prior to their arrival people are also encouraged to watch a video guide to the region, narrated by David Attenborough. All cruise firms that travel to South Georgia are members of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators. Amanda Lynnes, the organisation's director of environment & science coordination, has this advice for visitors: ""Use your experience to be an ambassador for South Georgia's continued protection."" South Georgia has dramatic snow-topped mountains for visitors to see amid cold temperatures - even in its summer months it struggles to go above 6C. By contrast, St Helena enjoys highs of 34C. Yet Mr Maclean says it is not just the pleasant weather that makes it special. ""St Helena is up there as one of the friendliest communities in the world,"" he says.

"The company behind brands such as PG Tips, Cornetto and Dove has said it will raise prices to cope with ""elevated levels"" of cost inflation which it expects to continue next year. Consumer goods giant Unilever said that it had already lifted its pricing. Unilever said this would continue across its global operations and within each of its product divisions. The company reported a 2.5% rise in sales for the third quarter to 30 September. Growth was supported by a 4.1% increase in prices while the volume of goods sold fell by 1.5%. On Wednesday, the Office for National Statistics said that the UK consumer prices index (CPI) measure ofinflation slowed to 3.1% in the year to September. However, inflation is expected to accelerate in the coming months due to a rise in energy costs as well as continuing disruption to UK and global supply chains. Unilever's chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, said: ""We expect inflation to be higher next year than this year."" It is not yet clear how Unilever's price rises will affect consumers. The company sells to businesses such as retailers, supermarkets and wholesalers who may or may not pass on higher costs to shoppers. But Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said Unilever was facing a ""balancing act of not increasing prices so much that its products are no longer competitive"". ""It is a real test of the strength of the company's brands,"" she said. ""After all, will we really stick with branded soap at a materially higher price when there's an unbranded alternative sitting next to it on the shelf which is an order of magnitude cheaper? ""If enough consumers decide they can put up with a cheaper alternative then it would become a big problem for Unilever."" Unilever's brands include Simple skin care, Sure deodorant and Vaseline. It also produces Marmite, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr stocks among many others. Unilever said it expected its full-year sales to grow between 3% and 5%, but that its profit margin would be unchanged. Earlier this week, the boss of the Food & Drink Federation warned that the hospitality industry, which includes restaurants and pubs,was seeing ""terrifying"" price inflationof between 14% and 18%. Mark Derry, executive chairman of Brasserie Bar Co, which owns the Brasserie Blanc chain of restaurants and whose chef patron is Raymond Blanc, told the BBC that while trading was holding up well, costs were rising which means it would have to raise prices for diners. Raymond Blanc, who holds two Michelin stars, is chef patron of Brasserie Bar Co ""There is an inevitable effect of all of this inflation and that is that we will have to try and put prices up,"" he said ""At the moment, we've tried very hard to hold them because obviously we've come out of a very, very serious problem over the last year and a half and doing our best to control it, but I cannot see how it is possible not to put prices up, frankly."" Kraft Heinz, known for its tomato ketchup and baked beans, recently warned thatpeople will have to get used to higher food prices. On Wednesday, food giant Nestle revealed that it had also increased prices, which rose by 2.1% in the third quarter.

"Government borrowing fell in September compared with a year earlier as the economy continued to recover from coronavirus lockdowns. Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - stood at Â£21.8bn, which was Â£7bn less than in September 2020. But the figure was still the second-highest for September since monthly records began in 1993. Borrowing hit record levels during the pandemic. The government spent billions of pounds on emergency measures to protect wages, such as the furlough scheme, which wrapped up last month. As a result, government debt has been pushed up to more than Â£2.2 trillion at the end of September this year - about 95.5% of the UK's gross domestic product (GDP), and the highest level recorded since the early 1960s. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalestimates that the government has borrowed a total of Â£108.1bn so far in the current financial year (April to September), although this is Â£101.2bn less than in the same period last year. Where does the government borrow billions from? Bank of England says it will act on inflation As well as higher spending on Covid measures, the government has collected less in tax receipts during the pandemic, having given some badly-affected firms tax holidays from VAT, for example. As a result of a lower income from taxes and higher spending, the ONS now estimates that in the 2020-21 financial year the government borrowed Â£319.9bn. That amounted to 14.9% of GDP, the highest rate seen since the end of World War Two. Some government sources of income have started to recover more recently. In September, the amount it collected through Value Added Tax (VAT) rose by 4.5% in comparison with the same month a year earlier. Fuel duty payments were also up by 6%, although alcohol and tobacco tax takes fell by 12.7% and 7% respectively. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is due to deliver a new Budget and growth forecasts on 27 October, as well as new multi-year spending limits for individual government departments. The monthly borrowing figure for September was lower than economists had expected. However, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the picture had improved for the government ahead of next week's Budget, he did not expect a ""major fiscal giveaway"". ""Borrowing has fallen much more quickly than almost everyone expected,"" he said. ""That said, the rumours are that the chancellor will still keep a very tight grip on the public finances in next Wednesday's Budget to try and bring down borrowing even quicker and build a fiscal war chest to deploy ahead of the 2024 election."" In response to the latest official figures, the chancellor said that although debt levels have risen, ""our recovery is well underway - with more employees on payrolls than ever before and the fastest forecast growth in the G7 this year"". ""At the Budget and Spending Review next week, I will set out how we will continue to support public services, businesses and jobs while keeping our public finances fit for the future."" Andrew Bailey has warned the Bank of England ""will have to act"" over rising inflation Prof David Miles, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee and professor of financial economics at Imperial College, warned that there could be ""a long struggle ahead"" for the chancellor. He told the BBC's Today programme: ""The debt came down very rapidly after the end of the Napoleonic wars, the First World War, the Second World War. ""All those people who had been in the army and the other armed forces came back into employment, tax revenue went up, the government was spending less on armaments - that's not going to happen now, so I think it is considerably more difficult to bring down the stock of debt to GDP than it was in the aftermath of those earlier wars."" In recent years, the government has been able to borrow easily at very low interest rates, which makes its debt more affordable. But rising inflation means that the Bank of England may increase interest rates soon, in an attempt to ensure the cost of living does not increase too quickly. The Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, warned on Sunday that it ""will have to act"" over rising inflation soon. Although he did not give any indication as to when it might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%, investors are expecting rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022. What's striking in the public sector finance figures is not how big the borrowing or debt is in the financial year to date. That's the same story we've known for months: the second-highest borrowing in peacetime, second only to last year's even more extraordinary amounts. What's newer, and more eyebrow-raising, is what the figures show about how rapidly borrowing can fall, before any spending cuts or tax rises have taken effect, simply because the economy is growing. With expected growth this year of 7% or more, tax money is flowing into the Exchequer far faster than was anticipated at the last Budget. And much of the emergency spending required in the more severe lockdown last year no longer has to be spent because the economy has, mostly, reopened. Public sector borrowing (the amount government has to borrow to plug the gap between its income and its spending) has nearly halved, dropping by more than Â£100bn. Not only that: all the borrowing accumulated over the years, also known as net debt, is also falling, down two percentage points, from 97.6% of gross domestic product in August to 95.5% in September. Both borrowing and debt are falling, not because of any economic hairshirt the chancellor is requiring us all to wear, but because a successful vaccination programme has helped the economy to recover.

"This video can not be played Teenager Sarah Buckle woke up in hospital after a suspected spiking incident A police force is investigating 15 reports of spiking where the victims believe they were injected with a needle. Nottinghamshire Police said victims reported effects that were ""consistent with a substance being administered"". In one case an injury was also sustained ""which could be consistent with a needle"", the force said. It is planning to deploy more police officers to the city centre over the next few weekends. Nottinghamshire Police said the majority of reports had been made by young women Nottinghamshire Police said the first report of a person being spiked with ""something sharp"" was made on 2 October. There have also been 32 reports of people being spiked by having their drink contaminated since 4 September. ""These figures have increased throughout October with the largest number of reports being made last weekend,"" the force added. Police said the offences were believed to have happened on different days and at different venues. The majority of reports are being made by young women, particularly students, but there have also been reports of young men being potentially spiked too, police said. Call for club searches after needle attack reports Reports of needle attacks prompt investigation A 20-year-old man was arrested as part of a wider investigation into spiking. It followed a report of suspicious activity on Lower Parliament Street on 16 October. He has been released on conditional bail. Nottinghamshire Police said a meeting had been held to discuss a response to the issue. It involved the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham City Council, East Midlands Ambulance Service and hospital trusts. This video can not be played Zara Owen told BBC Breakfast about her spiking experience The force said it would be deploying more officers to the city centre over the next few weekends. There will be a planned operation with the force's police dogs on Saturday. Supt Kathryn Craner, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ""I understand that these reports and those from other cities are concerning but want to reassure people that we have been working with our partner agencies and licensed premises throughout the city to help tackle any reports of spiking."" Sarah Buckle woke up in hospital after a suspected spiking incident in a Nottingham nightclub in September. The 19-year-old told BBC Radio Nottingham she had to have a hepatitis test after a pin prick wound was found on her hand. She said since she spoke about her experience, others have got in touch to share what happened to them, and said she still feels ""incredibly nervous"" when out at night. ""I've had numerous people reach out to me essentially saying 'this happened to me the week [before], but I thought I was going crazy because I hadn't heard of it',"" she said. ""This wasn't how I thought you got spiked - I thought it was just through your drink. ""I've been out a few times since and I haven't had much to drink at all, or I've been completely sober, and it actually hasn't made me feel any better. ""[Clubbing] is quite a physical experience, so you can't have eyes everywhere. ""There are people suspecting they've been spiked in so many different parts of their body - you can't look out for that, whether you're sober or not, and it's just really terrifying having no clue what's going on."" Miss Buckle said she was left shaking for two days People in other parts of the country have come forward to report similar incidents in recent weeks, including a second-year Loughborough University student who said she was injected in the elbow at a student union bar. ""I don't remember actually getting spiked, I just remember going dizzy and collapsing in the smoking area,"" she said. The student said a doctor later confirmed that she had been injected, and she went to hospital for monitoring after experiencing heart palpitations. However, she added she did not report the incident to police as she was not confident it would be properly looked into. Police encouraged anyone who has been the victim of a similar offence to report it, while the university urged the student to come forward ""so we can fully investigate"". Meanwhile, Devon and Cornwall Police say they are investigating reports of a woman being attacked with a needle in Fever and Boutique in Exeter on Saturday. Hannah Thomson's petition, which calls for compulsory nightclub searches, has been signed by more than 150,000 people More than 150,000 have signed a petition calling for nightclubs to ""thoroughly"" search customers on entry, and Home Secretary Priti Patel has asked police forces to examine the issue. Mike Kill, chairman of the Night Time Industries Association, said the government should hold an inquiry into spiking. He said his members have ""definitely seen more cases"" being reported, adding clubs are ""taking our responsibilities here very seriously"" and are working to raise awareness about efforts to train staff and keep people safe. ""Without a doubt we're going to see a step up on people being searched on entry,"" he said. ""There is no [specific criminal] categorisation in terms of spiking, so I think there's some work that needs to be done in terms of the Home Office, the policing and the collaboration with the industry to ensure that we're starting to get convictions to send a very clear message to people who feel they can carry out this heinous crime."" Meanwhile, Nottingham City Council said it would hold talks with door staff and nightclub managers to see what more can be done to keep customers safe. Councillor Toby Neal, chairman of the authority's licensing committee,told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""There is clearly a matter of concern here and we need to understand what is going on. ""It is really worrying. Are a group of blokes going around doing this stuff and what are we going to do to protect people?"" Yvette Cooper has suggested police are not taking the matter seriously enough Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, urged police forces to work closer with hospitals, student groups and nightclubs to get a fuller picture of the scale of spiking. ""My concern is that they just don't have a proper assessment of the scale of the problem,"" she said. ""Partly it's because there's not proper work being done between police forces and A&Es, for example, to try and identify the scale of the problem, or proper work being done with nightclubs or with student groups and organisations. ""I think there's a big problem here that we don't even know or have the accurate figures, and that also is contributing to the police not, I think, taking this seriously enough.""

"Vaccination is 90% effective at preventing deaths from the Delta variant of Covid-19, researchers say. The data, released by the University of Edinburgh, was gathered using a Scotland-wide Covid surveillance tool. Figures suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 90% effective and the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab 91% effective at preventing deaths. It looked at people who have been double-vaccinated but who have tested positive for Covid in the community. What is the Delta variant? When will I get a booster jab? The study is the first to show across an entire country how effective vaccines are at preventing death from the Delta variant, which is the most dominant form of Covid in the UK. Researchers defined death from Covid as anyone who died within 28 days of a positive PCR test, or with Covid recorded as a cause of death on their death certificate. The study analysed data from 5.4 million people in Scotland between 1 April and 27 September this year. During this period, 115,000 people tested positive for Covid using a PCR test in the community, rather than in hospital, and there were 201 Covid-related deaths recorded. No deaths have been recorded in those who have been double-vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine in Scotland, according to the data. Researchers said it is therefore not possible to estimate this particular vaccine's effectiveness in preventing Covid-related deaths. The research team from the University of Edinburgh, University of Strathclyde and Public Health Scotland analysed the dataset as part of the EAVE II project - Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of Covid-19. It uses anonymised, linked-patient data to track the pandemic and the vaccine rollout in real time. So far, 87.1% of adults in Scotland have taken a second dose of the Covid vaccine. Third ""booster"" doses are being offered to everyone over 50, along with frontline medical staff and younger adults with some underlying health conditions. Prof Aziz Sheikh, director of the University of Edinburgh's Usher Institute and EAVE II study lead, said: ""With the Delta variant now the dominant strain in many places worldwide, and posing a higher risk of hospitalisation than previous variants seen in the UK, it is reassuring to see that vaccination offers such high protection from death very shortly after the second dose. ""If you still have not taken up your offer to be vaccinated, I would encourage you to do so based on the clear benefits it offers."" Prof Chris Robertson, of the University of Strathclyde and Public Health Scotland, said: ""This study shows the value of carrying out analyses of routine healthcare data available in near real-time. ""Our findings are encouraging in showing that the vaccine remains an effective measure in protecting both ourselves and others from death from the most dominant variant of Covid-19."" He added that it was important to validate these early results with follow-up studies. The team behind the study said due to the observational nature of the figures, data about vaccine effectiveness should be interpreted with caution and said it was not possible to make a direct comparison between both vaccines.

"A patient receives Covid care in Tunisia Covid has severely affected healthcare staff and may have killed between 80,000 and 180,000, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Healthcare workers must be prioritised for vaccines, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, and he criticised unfairness in the distribution of jabs. The deaths occurred between January 2020 and May of this year. Earlier, another senior WHO official warned a lack of jabs could see the pandemic continue well into next year. There are an estimated 135 million healthcare workers globally. ""Data from 119 countries suggest that on average, two in five healthcare workers globally are fully vaccinated,"" Dr Tedros said. ""But of course, that average masks huge differences across regions and economic groupings."" Fewer than one in 10 healthcare workers were fully vaccinated in Africa, he said, compared with eight in 10 in high-income countries. A failure to provide poorer countries with enough vaccines was highlighted earlier by Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior leader at the WHO, who said it meant the Covid crisis could ""easily drag on deep into 2022"". Less than 5% of Africa's population have been vaccinated, compared with 40% on most other continents. The vast majority of Covid vaccines overall have been used in high-income or upper middle-income countries. Africa accounts for just 2.6% of doses administered globally. More than 50 countries missing Covid vaccine target Covax: How many Covid vaccines have the US and the other G7 countries pledged? Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? The original idea behind Covax, the UN-backed global programme to distribute vaccines fairly, was that all countries would be able to acquire vaccines from its pool, including wealthy ones, writes BBC Global Affairs correspondent Naomi Grimley. But most G7 countries decided to hold back once they started making their own one-to-one deals with pharmaceutical companies. This video can not be played Ros Atkins looks at the ethics of Western countries rolling out Covid booster jabs while millions globally remain unvaccinated Dr Aylward appealed to wealthy countries to give up their places in the queue for vaccines so that pharmaceutical companies can prioritise the lowest-income countries instead. He said wealthy countries needed to ""stocktake"" where they were with their donation commitments made at summits such as the G7 meeting in St Ives this summer. ""I can tell you we're not on track,"" he said. ""We really need to speed it up or you know what? This pandemic is going to go on for a year longer than it needs to."" The People's Vaccine - an alliance of charities - has released new figures suggesting just one in seven of the doses promised by pharmaceutical companies and wealthy countries are actually reaching their destinations in poorer countries. The alliance, which includes Oxfam and UNAids, also criticised Canada and the UK for procuring vaccines for their own populations via Covax. Official figures show that earlier this year the UK received 539,370 Pfizer doses from Covax while Canada took just under a million AstraZeneca doses. Oxfam's Global Health Adviser, Rohit Malpani, acknowledged that Canada and the UK were technically entitled to get vaccines via this route having paid into the Covax mechanism, but he said it was still ""morally indefensible"" given that they had both obtained millions of doses through their own bilateral agreements. The UK government pointed out it was one of the countries which had ""kick-started"" Covax last year with a donation of Â£548m. The UK has also delivered more than 10 million vaccines to countries in need, and has pledged a total of 100 million. The Canadian government was keen to stress that it had now stopped using Covax vaccines. The country's International Development Minister, Karina Gould, said: ""As soon as it became clear that the supply we had secured through our bilateral deals would be sufficient for the Canadian population, we pivoted the doses which we had procured from Covax back to Covax, so they could be redistributed to developing countries."" Covax originally aimed to deliver two billion doses of vaccines by the end of this year, but so far it has shipped 371m doses.

"A huge leak of documents seen by BBC News shows how countries are trying to change a crucial scientific report on how to tackle climate change. The leak reveals Saudi Arabia, Japan and Australia are among countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels. It also shows some wealthy nations are questioning paying more to poorer states to move to greener technologies. This ""lobbying"" raises questions for the COP26 climate summit in November. The leak reveals countries pushing back on UN recommendations for action and comes just days before they will be asked at the summit to make significant commitments to slow down climate change and keep global warming to 1.5 degrees. The leaked documents consist of more than 32,000 submissions made by governments, companies and other interested parties to the team of scientists compiling a UN report designed to bring together the best scientific evidence on how to tackle climate change. These ""assessment reports"" are produced every six to seven years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN body tasked with evaluating the science of climate change. These reports are used by governments to decide what action is needed to tackle climate change, and the latest will be a crucial input to negotiations at the Glasgow conference. A really simple guide to climate change What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all The authority of these reports derives in part from the fact that virtually all the governments of the world participate in the process to reach consensus. The comments from governments the BBC has read are overwhelmingly designed to be constructive and to improve the quality of the final report. The cache of comments and the latest draft of the report were released to Greenpeace UK's team of investigative journalists, Unearthed, which passed it on to BBC News. The leak shows a number of countries and organisations arguing that the world does not need to reduce the use of fossil fuels as quickly as the current draft of the report recommends. An adviser to the Saudi oil ministry demands ""phrases like 'the need for urgent and accelerated mitigation actions at all scalesâ¦' should be eliminated from the report"". One senior Australian government official rejects the conclusion that closing coal-fired power plants is necessary, even though ending the use of coal is one of the stated objectives the COP26 conference. Saudi Arabia is the one of the largest oil producers in the world and Australia is a major coal exporter. A senior scientist from India's Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research, which has strong links to the Indian government, warns coal is likely to remain the mainstay of energy production for decades because of what they describe as the ""tremendous challenges"" of providing affordable electricity. India is already the world's second biggest consumer of coal. A number of countries argue in favour of emerging and currently expensive technologies designed to capture and permanently store carbon dioxide underground. Saudi Arabia, China, Australia and Japan - all big producers or users of fossil fuels - as well as the organisation of oil producing nations, Opec, all support carbon capture and storage (CCS). It is claimed these CCS technologies could dramatically cut fossil fuel emissions from power plants and some industrial sectors. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, requests the UN scientists delete their conclusion that ""the focus of decarbonisation efforts in the energy systems sector needs to be on rapidly shifting to zero-carbon sources and actively phasing out fossil fuels"". Argentina, Norway and Opec also take issue with the statement. Norway argues the UN scientists should allow the possibility of CCS as a potential tool for reducing emissions from fossil fuels. The draft report accepts CCS could play a role in the future but says there are uncertainties about its feasibility. It says ""there is large ambiguity in the extent to which fossil fuels with CCS would be compatible with the 2C and 1.5C targets"" as set out by the Paris Agreement. The offshore Sleipner gas field in Norway has been using CCS since 1996 Australia asks IPCC scientists to delete a reference to analysis of the role played by fossil fuel lobbyists in watering down action on climate in Australia and the US. Opec also asks the IPCC to ""delete 'lobby activism, protecting rent extracting business models, prevent political action'."" When approached about its comments to the draft report, Opec told the BBC: ""The challenge of tackling emissions has many paths, as evidenced by the IPCC report, and we need to explore them all. We need to utilise all available energies, as well as clean and more efficient technological solutions to help reduce emissions, ensuring no one is left behind."" This video can not be played Tony Blair on climate change: ""Even though the challenge is immense, there really isn't an alternative to dealing with it"" The IPCC says comments from governments are central to its scientific review process and that its authors have no obligation to incorporate them into the reports. ""Our processes are designed to guard against lobbying - from all quarters"", the IPCC told the BBC. ""The review process is (and always has been) absolutely fundamental to the IPCC's work and is a major source of the strength and credibility of our reports. Professor Corinne le QuÃ©rÃ© of the University of East Anglia, a leading climate scientist who has helped compile three major reports for the IPCC, has no doubts about the impartiality of the IPCC's reports. She says all comments are judged solely on scientific evidence regardless of where they come from. ""There is absolutely no pressure on scientists to accept the comments,"" she told the BBC. ""If the comments are lobbying, if they're not justified by the science, they will not be integrated in the IPCC reports."" She says it is important that experts of all kinds - including governments - have a chance to review the science. ""The more the reports are scrutinised"", says Professor le QuÃ©rÃ©, ""the more solid the evidence is going to be in the end, because the more the arguments are brought and articulated forward in a way that is leaning on the best available science"". Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who oversaw the landmark UN climate conference in Paris in 2015, agrees it is crucial that governments are part of the IPCC process. ""Everybody's voice has to be there. That's the whole purpose. This is not a single thread. This is a tapestry woven by many, many threads."" The United Nations was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2007 for the IPCC's work on climate science and the crucial role it has played in the effort to tackle climate change. Brazil and Argentina, two of the biggest producers of beef products and animal feed crops in the world, argue strongly against evidence in the draft report that reducing meat consumption is necessary to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The draft report states ""plant-based diets can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% compared to the average emission intensive Western diet"". Brazil says this is incorrect. Both countries call on the authors to delete or change some passages in the text referring to ""plant-based diets"" playing a role in tackling climate change, or which describe beef as a ""high carbon"" food. Argentina also asked that references to taxes on red meat and to the international ""Meatless Monday"" campaign, which urges people to forgo meat for a day, be removed from the report. The South American nation recommends ""avoiding generalisation on the impacts of meat-based diets on low-carbon options"", arguing there is evidence that meat-based diets can also reduce carbon emissions. On the same theme, Brazil says ""plant-based diets do not for themselves guarantee the reduction or control of related emissions"" and maintains the focus of debate should be on the levels of emissions from different production systems, rather than types of food. Brazil, which has seen significant increases in the rate of deforestation in the Amazon and some other forest areas, also disputes a reference to this being a result of changes in government regulations, claiming this is incorrect. A significant number of Switzerland's comments are directed at amending parts of the report that argue developing countries will need support, particularly financial support, from rich countries in order to meet emission reduction targets. It was agreed at the climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009 that developed nations would provide $100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, a target that has yet to be met. Australia makes a similar case to Switzerland. It says developing countries' climate pledges do not all depend on receiving outside financial support. It also describes a mention in the draft report of the lack of credible public commitments on finance as ""subjective commentary"". The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment told the BBC: ""While climate finance is a critical tool to increase climate ambition, it is not the only relevant tool. ""Switzerland takes the view that all Parties to the Paris Agreement with the capacity to do so should provide support to those who need such support."" A number of mostly eastern European countries argue the draft report should be more positive about the role nuclear power can play in meeting the UN's climate targets. India goes even further, arguing ""almost all the chapters contain a bias against nuclear energy"". It argues it is an ""established technology"" with ""good political backing except in a few countries"". The Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia criticise a table in the report which finds nuclear power only has a positive role in delivering one of 17 UN Sustainable Development goals. They argue it can play a positive role in delivering most of the UN's development agenda. Do you have any questions about the leak of climate documents? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"With coronavirus case numbers high, people must go and take up their booster jab, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says It's offered to frontline medical staff, those over-50 and the clinically vulnerable across the UK His comments come as the number of new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK tops 50,000 for the first time since July Earlier, Health Minister Edward Argar acknowledged the NHS is under huge pressure but said it's sustainable But doctors say an unacceptable level of Covid cases means ministers should trigger their Plan B for the pandemic this winter The British Medical Association says the government is being ""wilfully negligent"" for not reimposing Covid rules such as mandatory face masks The pandemic will last a year longer than it needs to because poorer countries are not getting the vaccines they need, the WHO says Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for joining us today - here's a recap of some of the day's top lines. Thursday's live page was edited by Claire Heald and Holly Wallis. It was written by Malu Cursino, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Joshua Nevitt, Mary O'Connor and Lauren Turner. As ever, it's been a team effort with contributions from our colleagues across the BBC.  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Daily case of
coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital
admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen
slightly. The last time we
saw that level was in mid-July, a few weeks after the 2m social distancing rule
was scrapped and soon after pubs and restaurants reopened in England. Cases peaked at
that point and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being
introduced. It's possible
that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening. The current
strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable,
and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to
increase protection among the population. Free testing is
also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid
rates in Europe. In 10-19 year
olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections
could leak into other age groups. A change in
people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on
the NHS ahead of winter. Scientists say
it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the
UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination
programme hadn't even started yet. This video can not be played Johnson on Covid lockdown and restrictions in England Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the number of Covid infections in the UK was ""high"" but in line with predictions. Amid speculation of moves to stricter Plan B measures in England to combat rising cases, Boris Johnson appeared to rule this out for now, saying: ""We are sticking with our plan."" We've also been hearing from people who say the government should not enact stricter Covid measures due to the impact on the economy and mental health. Phil Hadleysays: ""I think we just have to get on with life... we cannot keep shutting the economy down because the NHS is busy, I've had enough of my personal liberties being taken away from me just to protect the NHS, it's supposed to be there for us not the other way around."" Katie from Southamptonsays: ""Further restrictions, especially further lockdowns will be extraordinarily damaging to society, especially to the mental health of many. ""Since there is no more that can be done given the success of the vaccination roll out, a further lockdown sets the extremely dangerous precedent that lockdowns will become an unquestionable staple whenever cases of COVID, or any further spreadable disease puts pressure on the NHS."" In Wales, the NHS has just recorded its worst ever performance figures - with nearly 250,000 people waiting more than nine months for treatment, a 10-fold increase from the start of the pandemic. Its chief executive Andrew Goodall says the system is running ""at the hottest we've ever seen"". There's more on thathere. And in Northern Ireland, the health service is facing ""its worst winter ever"". That's the warning from the NI chair of the British Medical Association. Read morehere. You can see how cases are shifting in Scotland,here. Passengers wear face masks whilst travelling on a bus in London We've been hearing from people about their thoughts on the increase in Covid cases and whether the government should invoke itsPlan B measures- including compulsory face coverings in public, Covid passports and advising people to work from home. On Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid ruled it out at this point. But some readers think it should happen. Matt from Oxfordsays: ""I probably travel into London once a month, and yesterday I
saw a marked difference in people's behaviour. No more than 50% of people on
the Tube were wearing face masks. Nobody had masks on in the restaurant I ate
at, including staff. ""The scientists say that quite small restrictions (eg masks and
vaccine passports) have been shown to keep numbers down, so there seems
to be no reason why we aren't doing that, just to make the country a safer
place to go about our business..."" Phyllis Williamson says: ""I donât see the problem with making the wearing of face
masks mandatory on public transport and in busy, crowded areas â particularly
indoors. Itâs not pleasant but we had to do it for months and it didnât kill
us. It actually benefited us. ""I donât
want to go back to not being able to safely see my family and having to worry
about passing something on to them when I did. Reality Check Whether or not people should wear face masks has been a hot topic today, as cases rise. From 19 July in England, face
masks stopped being mandatory in most public places. They are still required in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Lots of studies have shown face
coverings can help stop the virus from being passed between people. But itâs much harder to prove how
much mask wearing reduces the amount of Covid circulating in a whole
population. That's
because it's hard to untangle it from all the other things going on at the same
time, like how much people choose to mix with each other. You
can read more about this and what could be causing the high number of
infections currently,here.  The daily government data also shows how many first and second vaccine doses have been given. It shows another 49,080 first doses have been given and 26,365 second doses. It means 45,460,122 people have now had two doses. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said four million third doses, or boosters, had now been given as well. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A medical worker collects a swab from a resident in Lanzhou's Chengguan district, Gansu province, on 20 October. An outbreak of
Covid-19 in China has led to swift restrictions being imposed in multiple
Chinese provinces over the last week. Since 16
October, cases of Covid-19 linked to travel and tourism in Chinaâs north have
reached at least nine provincial-level regions. Parts of Inner
Mongolia and Gansu province have gone into tight lockdown. Many schools have
closed in both regions; a school has also closed in China's capital, Beijing. Tourist sites
have closed in parts of Xiâan â the home of the Terracotta Warriors â and some
cities have cancelled large-scale exhibitions and closed venues like cinemas. The number of
cases in China is still relatively low â only in the double digits â however,
it is common for the country to tackle outbreaks by swiftly locking down
communities when even one resident tests positive. Citywide testing drives are ordered, and people are prohibited from leaving affected areas
unless they can show a negative test within days of travel. Given many of
the affected regions in this latest outbreak are in Chinaâs north, the National
Health Commission has urged enhanced measures to ensure that Covid-19
prevention work can be carried out safely. It has
particularly emphasised protecting female medical workers from the cold in the
coming months, and has urged limiting the amount of time people spend outdoors. Currently, it is common for large-scale testing drives to take place outside. As we reported just now, there have been more than 50,000 new Covid cases reported - with the total of 52,009 the highest since 17 July. On that day, there were 54,674 cases. It comes as levels have been progressively climbing in the UK. The previous eight days have all seen cases at more than 40,000. Cases over the last three months have been roughly the same as they were over a three-month period last winter, meaning we can compare them. Between July and October this year, there were just over three million cases, with 79,000 people ending up in hospital. Between October and January last year, there were just over 2.7 million cases, but more than 185,000 people needed hospital treatment. This was before vaccines were widely available. So why are cases so high - is it the looser rules, waning immunity or to do with issues with the vaccine rollout? We've taken a closer look at some of those questionshere. Dozens of ambulances remain outside the emergency department on Thursday afternoon A health minister said earlier that the current pressure on the NHS was manageable and sustainable aftera doctor's union called formore restrictions to return in England to tackle ""unacceptable"" Covid case rates. Now, the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust (RCHT) has declareda critical incident due to the pressures it is facing. The trust reported up to 100 people in the emergency department waiting to be seen on Wednesday, with 25 ambulances waiting to transfer patients. It prompted managers to contact staff to ask them to work extra hours to help handle ""intense pressures"". In September, all planned and urgent surgeries were temporarily suspended due to the pressure the hospital is under. Routine surgeries remain suspended, with urgent procedures reviewed daily and continuing where possible. The trust said on Thursday it was treating 44 patients with Covid-19 - 10 more than the previous week. RCHT medical director Dr Allister Grant said there was ""unprecedented demand"" on the NHS in Cornwall, ""more so this week than at any point during the pandemic"". You can read morehere. The number of new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK has topped 50,000 for the first time since July. A total of 52,009 were recorded, according to the government statistics. And there have been another 115 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. As the debate over masks and face coverings rumbles on,Jacob Rees-Mogg says that Tories don't wear them in the Commons, but he follows Health Secretay Sajid Javid yesterday, saying MPs
should, to âset an exampleâ. MPs would indeed be effective in that if they did wear masks, Professor Robert West, a health psychologist advising the government as
part of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), tells the BBC Radio 4âs World at One. He says that for people who have
mixed feelings about mask-wearing, seeing MPs without them gives them an excuse
to say âif theyâre not doing it, why should I do itâ. Prof West adds that âitâs about
leadershipâ and âit behoves them to do the same thingâ. Jim ReedHealth reporter, BBC News Paul Carter, 75 and from Leeds, was one of the first to get a Covid booster jab on the high street at end of September Covid booster jabs will eventually be available toeveryone over 50,younger
adults with some chronic health conditions, frontline health and social care staff and adults who share a household with vulnerable people. But to be eligible, it has to be
182 days, or roughly six months, since that person received a second
vaccine dose. In all parts of the UK those eligible should be contacted
and invited to book a booster. Some care homes may have other
arrangements, with elderly residents visited by mobile units. In England, the health secretary has said that if you still
havenât been contactedandit is six months plus one extra week after
that second dose,then you can now go online,externalor phone 119 and book yourself in without an invite. For Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the advice for
over 50s and those with underlying health conditions is still to wait to be
contacted â either by phone, letter or text. The UK is in a ""much better position"" going into autumn and winter than it was 12 months ago - but ""we must fortify ourselves further"", says PM Boris Johnson. Speaking on a visit to Armagh, he says the government is ""watching the numbers very carefully every day"" - but that the situation is as predicted, so the government is ""sticking with our plan"". Johnson says that now, ""the most important thing people can do is just get that booster jab - when you get the call, get the jab"". It's because of vaccines that we're better off now than this time a year ago, he says, adding: ""But we must fortify ourselves further. ""The numbers are high, we see can see what's happening, we can see the increase, now is the time to get those booster jabs, and to vaccinate the 12-15 year olds as well.""

This video can not be played Masks in Commons: Jacob Rees-Mogg and Pete Wishart Whether MPs, and indeed, the broader public in England should be back wearing masks has been strongly debated today. Doctors have called on the government to reimpose some rules in England, including face masks, because of the high number of new daily infections in the UK. The rules are different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where face coverings are required in certain places, including on public transport. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg says a ""convivial fraternal spirit"" means the Conservatives do not need to wear masks in the Commons. The Commons leader said those on government benches knew each other, and teased Pete Wishart that he may not want to mix with SNP MPs who sat with him in the Commons. The minister says that Tory MPs can make their own choice on face masks. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Mask-wearing is patchy in Poland and vaccination take-up has flat-lined The UK is not the only European country seeing a surge in
Covid cases. Several countries in Central and Eastern Europe are also
experiencing a dramatic rise in infections. Here in Poland, weâve had more than
double the amount of cases compared with last week, and Health Minister Adam
Niedzielski has called it an âexplosionâ. The number of new daily infections
exceeds 5,000 and the amount of people in hospital with Covid is the
highest since the start of June. Mr Niedzielski said some of the highest
infection rates were in regions in eastern Poland with the lowest vaccination take-up. Overall, 63% of adults here are fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 74%,
and take-up has flat-lined since August. The health minister says
heâs instructed police to impose fines on people flouting the rules. Itâs increasingly common here to see people in shops and on public transport without facemasks. The rising number of cases at home is also having an impact outside the country, with Morocco banning direct flights to and from the UK because of the rising number of cases. But on the upside, fully vaccinated travellers from 33 countries - including the UK - will now be able to travel to the US from
8 November. It's all explained here:  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News As we've been reporting, cases of coronavirus are rising sharply, frontline doctors say they are under huge pressure and some healthcare staff report being burnt out. But the government in England says there's no reason to change tack right now. Moving to Plan B on tackling the pandemic would involve relatively small changes to people's lives. It would mean compulsory face masks on public transport and in shops, and/or advice to work from home. So what's stopping the move? Ministers say the NHS is extremely busy but they don't believe the pressure is unsustainable. There is still headroom and the country is in a much more positive place than it was last autumn. Even as cases rise, the Covid vaccination programme is keeping a lid on hospital admissions and deaths - and that's why speeding up access to booster vaccines for the over 50s and jabs for young teens is a priority, as well as targeting the five million people who've so far refused a vaccine. This will increase protection for the majority of the population over the next few months. And with infections rising, natural immunity from the virus is also helping that process. Predicting what will happen to cases is tricky. Cases could still flatten and come down or continue to rise to 100,000 as Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned on Wednesday. In many countries in Europe, the picture is much rosier and that's causing some concern in the UK as a whole. There is no precise trigger for Plan B - it's a wait-and-see judgement call, and the government in England is still biding its time. Earlier today, the health minister said the
pressure on the NHS from Covid was âmanageableâ and sustainable. However, Dr Chris Gibbons,
clinical director of medicine at Newcastle Hospitals Trust, paintsa worrying picture. Newcastleâs Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) is in a similar
situation to other hospitals across the UK. The hospital has seen record numbers of
patients coming through its A&E, as well as a rise in patients with Covid
and flu. The backlog in surgery and treatments due to the pandemic
has also significantly contributed to current pressures. Dr Gibbons tells the BBC the current number of admissions is higher than âanything
weâd see in the worst wintersâ. The current picture at Newcastleâs RVI emergency department
is difficult. Dr Gibbons says they are starting most days with patients waiting for
beds and the waiting times can be âfor eight or nine hoursâ. In some cases, patients will only be seen âfour, five or six hoursâ after arriving at A&E. He says the pressures on emergency care staff are âlike
nothing weâve seen beforeâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999535
"A patient receives Covid care in Tunisia Covid has severely affected healthcare staff and may have killed between 80,000 and 180,000, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Healthcare workers must be prioritised for vaccines, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, and he criticised unfairness in the distribution of jabs. The deaths occurred between January 2020 and May of this year. Earlier, another senior WHO official warned a lack of jabs could see the pandemic continue well into next year. There are an estimated 135 million healthcare workers globally. ""Data from 119 countries suggest that on average, two in five healthcare workers globally are fully vaccinated,"" Dr Tedros said. ""But of course, that average masks huge differences across regions and economic groupings."" Fewer than one in 10 healthcare workers were fully vaccinated in Africa, he said, compared with eight in 10 in high-income countries. A failure to provide poorer countries with enough vaccines was highlighted earlier by Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior leader at the WHO, who said it meant the Covid crisis could ""easily drag on deep into 2022"". Less than 5% of Africa's population have been vaccinated, compared with 40% on most other continents. The vast majority of Covid vaccines overall have been used in high-income or upper middle-income countries. Africa accounts for just 2.6% of doses administered globally. More than 50 countries missing Covid vaccine target Covax: How many Covid vaccines have the US and the other G7 countries pledged? Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? The original idea behind Covax, the UN-backed global programme to distribute vaccines fairly, was that all countries would be able to acquire vaccines from its pool, including wealthy ones, writes BBC Global Affairs correspondent Naomi Grimley. But most G7 countries decided to hold back once they started making their own one-to-one deals with pharmaceutical companies. This video can not be played Ros Atkins looks at the ethics of Western countries rolling out Covid booster jabs while millions globally remain unvaccinated Dr Aylward appealed to wealthy countries to give up their places in the queue for vaccines so that pharmaceutical companies can prioritise the lowest-income countries instead. He said wealthy countries needed to ""stocktake"" where they were with their donation commitments made at summits such as the G7 meeting in St Ives this summer. ""I can tell you we're not on track,"" he said. ""We really need to speed it up or you know what? This pandemic is going to go on for a year longer than it needs to."" The People's Vaccine - an alliance of charities - has released new figures suggesting just one in seven of the doses promised by pharmaceutical companies and wealthy countries are actually reaching their destinations in poorer countries. The alliance, which includes Oxfam and UNAids, also criticised Canada and the UK for procuring vaccines for their own populations via Covax. Official figures show that earlier this year the UK received 539,370 Pfizer doses from Covax while Canada took just under a million AstraZeneca doses. Oxfam's Global Health Adviser, Rohit Malpani, acknowledged that Canada and the UK were technically entitled to get vaccines via this route having paid into the Covax mechanism, but he said it was still ""morally indefensible"" given that they had both obtained millions of doses through their own bilateral agreements. The UK government pointed out it was one of the countries which had ""kick-started"" Covax last year with a donation of Â£548m. The UK has also delivered more than 10 million vaccines to countries in need, and has pledged a total of 100 million. The Canadian government was keen to stress that it had now stopped using Covax vaccines. The country's International Development Minister, Karina Gould, said: ""As soon as it became clear that the supply we had secured through our bilateral deals would be sufficient for the Canadian population, we pivoted the doses which we had procured from Covax back to Covax, so they could be redistributed to developing countries."" Covax originally aimed to deliver two billion doses of vaccines by the end of this year, but so far it has shipped 371m doses.

Thursday's live page was edited by Claire Heald and Holly Wallis. It was written by Malu Cursino, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Joshua Nevitt, Mary O'Connor and Lauren Turner. As ever, it's been a team effort with contributions from our colleagues across the BBC.  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Daily case of
coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital
admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen
slightly. The last time we
saw that level was in mid-July, a few weeks after the 2m social distancing rule
was scrapped and soon after pubs and restaurants reopened in England. Cases peaked at
that point and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being
introduced. It's possible
that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening. The current
strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable,
and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to
increase protection among the population. Free testing is
also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid
rates in Europe. In 10-19 year
olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections
could leak into other age groups. A change in
people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on
the NHS ahead of winter. Scientists say
it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the
UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination
programme hadn't even started yet. This video can not be played Johnson on Covid lockdown and restrictions in England Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the number of Covid infections in the UK was ""high"" but in line with predictions. Amid speculation of moves to stricter Plan B measures in England to combat rising cases, Boris Johnson appeared to rule this out for now, saying: ""We are sticking with our plan."" We've also been hearing from people who say the government should not enact stricter Covid measures due to the impact on the economy and mental health. Phil Hadleysays: ""I think we just have to get on with life... we cannot keep shutting the economy down because the NHS is busy, I've had enough of my personal liberties being taken away from me just to protect the NHS, it's supposed to be there for us not the other way around."" Katie from Southamptonsays: ""Further restrictions, especially further lockdowns will be extraordinarily damaging to society, especially to the mental health of many. ""Since there is no more that can be done given the success of the vaccination roll out, a further lockdown sets the extremely dangerous precedent that lockdowns will become an unquestionable staple whenever cases of COVID, or any further spreadable disease puts pressure on the NHS."" In Wales, the NHS has just recorded its worst ever performance figures - with nearly 250,000 people waiting more than nine months for treatment, a 10-fold increase from the start of the pandemic. Its chief executive Andrew Goodall says the system is running ""at the hottest we've ever seen"". There's more on thathere. And in Northern Ireland, the health service is facing ""its worst winter ever"". That's the warning from the NI chair of the British Medical Association. Read morehere. You can see how cases are shifting in Scotland,here. Passengers wear face masks whilst travelling on a bus in London We've been hearing from people about their thoughts on the increase in Covid cases and whether the government should invoke itsPlan B measures- including compulsory face coverings in public, Covid passports and advising people to work from home. On Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid ruled it out at this point. But some readers think it should happen. Matt from Oxfordsays: ""I probably travel into London once a month, and yesterday I
saw a marked difference in people's behaviour. No more than 50% of people on
the Tube were wearing face masks. Nobody had masks on in the restaurant I ate
at, including staff. ""The scientists say that quite small restrictions (eg masks and
vaccine passports) have been shown to keep numbers down, so there seems
to be no reason why we aren't doing that, just to make the country a safer
place to go about our business..."" Phyllis Williamson says: ""I donât see the problem with making the wearing of face
masks mandatory on public transport and in busy, crowded areas â particularly
indoors. Itâs not pleasant but we had to do it for months and it didnât kill
us. It actually benefited us. ""I donât
want to go back to not being able to safely see my family and having to worry
about passing something on to them when I did. Reality Check Whether or not people should wear face masks has been a hot topic today, as cases rise. From 19 July in England, face
masks stopped being mandatory in most public places. They are still required in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Lots of studies have shown face
coverings can help stop the virus from being passed between people. But itâs much harder to prove how
much mask wearing reduces the amount of Covid circulating in a whole
population. That's
because it's hard to untangle it from all the other things going on at the same
time, like how much people choose to mix with each other. You
can read more about this and what could be causing the high number of
infections currently,here.  The daily government data also shows how many first and second vaccine doses have been given. It shows another 49,080 first doses have been given and 26,365 second doses. It means 45,460,122 people have now had two doses. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said four million third doses, or boosters, had now been given as well. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A medical worker collects a swab from a resident in Lanzhou's Chengguan district, Gansu province, on 20 October. An outbreak of
Covid-19 in China has led to swift restrictions being imposed in multiple
Chinese provinces over the last week. Since 16
October, cases of Covid-19 linked to travel and tourism in Chinaâs north have
reached at least nine provincial-level regions. Parts of Inner
Mongolia and Gansu province have gone into tight lockdown. Many schools have
closed in both regions; a school has also closed in China's capital, Beijing. Tourist sites
have closed in parts of Xiâan â the home of the Terracotta Warriors â and some
cities have cancelled large-scale exhibitions and closed venues like cinemas. The number of
cases in China is still relatively low â only in the double digits â however,
it is common for the country to tackle outbreaks by swiftly locking down
communities when even one resident tests positive. Citywide testing drives are ordered, and people are prohibited from leaving affected areas
unless they can show a negative test within days of travel. Given many of
the affected regions in this latest outbreak are in Chinaâs north, the National
Health Commission has urged enhanced measures to ensure that Covid-19
prevention work can be carried out safely. It has
particularly emphasised protecting female medical workers from the cold in the
coming months, and has urged limiting the amount of time people spend outdoors. Currently, it is common for large-scale testing drives to take place outside. As we reported just now, there have been more than 50,000 new Covid cases reported - with the total of 52,009 the highest since 17 July. On that day, there were 54,674 cases. It comes as levels have been progressively climbing in the UK. The previous eight days have all seen cases at more than 40,000. Cases over the last three months have been roughly the same as they were over a three-month period last winter, meaning we can compare them. Between July and October this year, there were just over three million cases, with 79,000 people ending up in hospital. Between October and January last year, there were just over 2.7 million cases, but more than 185,000 people needed hospital treatment. This was before vaccines were widely available. So why are cases so high - is it the looser rules, waning immunity or to do with issues with the vaccine rollout? We've taken a closer look at some of those questionshere.

As ever, it's been a team effort with contributions from our colleagues across the BBC.  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Daily case of
coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital
admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen
slightly. The last time we
saw that level was in mid-July, a few weeks after the 2m social distancing rule
was scrapped and soon after pubs and restaurants reopened in England. Cases peaked at
that point and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being
introduced. It's possible
that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening. The current
strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable,
and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to
increase protection among the population. Free testing is
also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid
rates in Europe. In 10-19 year
olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections
could leak into other age groups. A change in
people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on
the NHS ahead of winter. Scientists say
it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the
UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination
programme hadn't even started yet. This video can not be played Johnson on Covid lockdown and restrictions in England Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the number of Covid infections in the UK was ""high"" but in line with predictions. Amid speculation of moves to stricter Plan B measures in England to combat rising cases, Boris Johnson appeared to rule this out for now, saying: ""We are sticking with our plan."" We've also been hearing from people who say the government should not enact stricter Covid measures due to the impact on the economy and mental health. Phil Hadleysays: ""I think we just have to get on with life... we cannot keep shutting the economy down because the NHS is busy, I've had enough of my personal liberties being taken away from me just to protect the NHS, it's supposed to be there for us not the other way around."" Katie from Southamptonsays: ""Further restrictions, especially further lockdowns will be extraordinarily damaging to society, especially to the mental health of many. ""Since there is no more that can be done given the success of the vaccination roll out, a further lockdown sets the extremely dangerous precedent that lockdowns will become an unquestionable staple whenever cases of COVID, or any further spreadable disease puts pressure on the NHS."" In Wales, the NHS has just recorded its worst ever performance figures - with nearly 250,000 people waiting more than nine months for treatment, a 10-fold increase from the start of the pandemic. Its chief executive Andrew Goodall says the system is running ""at the hottest we've ever seen"". There's more on thathere. And in Northern Ireland, the health service is facing ""its worst winter ever"". That's the warning from the NI chair of the British Medical Association. Read morehere. You can see how cases are shifting in Scotland,here. Passengers wear face masks whilst travelling on a bus in London We've been hearing from people about their thoughts on the increase in Covid cases and whether the government should invoke itsPlan B measures- including compulsory face coverings in public, Covid passports and advising people to work from home. On Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid ruled it out at this point. But some readers think it should happen. Matt from Oxfordsays: ""I probably travel into London once a month, and yesterday I
saw a marked difference in people's behaviour. No more than 50% of people on
the Tube were wearing face masks. Nobody had masks on in the restaurant I ate
at, including staff. ""The scientists say that quite small restrictions (eg masks and
vaccine passports) have been shown to keep numbers down, so there seems
to be no reason why we aren't doing that, just to make the country a safer
place to go about our business..."" Phyllis Williamson says: ""I donât see the problem with making the wearing of face
masks mandatory on public transport and in busy, crowded areas â particularly
indoors. Itâs not pleasant but we had to do it for months and it didnât kill
us. It actually benefited us. ""I donât
want to go back to not being able to safely see my family and having to worry
about passing something on to them when I did. Reality Check Whether or not people should wear face masks has been a hot topic today, as cases rise. From 19 July in England, face
masks stopped being mandatory in most public places. They are still required in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Lots of studies have shown face
coverings can help stop the virus from being passed between people. But itâs much harder to prove how
much mask wearing reduces the amount of Covid circulating in a whole
population. That's
because it's hard to untangle it from all the other things going on at the same
time, like how much people choose to mix with each other. You
can read more about this and what could be causing the high number of
infections currently,here.  The daily government data also shows how many first and second vaccine doses have been given. It shows another 49,080 first doses have been given and 26,365 second doses. It means 45,460,122 people have now had two doses. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said four million third doses, or boosters, had now been given as well. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst A medical worker collects a swab from a resident in Lanzhou's Chengguan district, Gansu province, on 20 October. An outbreak of
Covid-19 in China has led to swift restrictions being imposed in multiple
Chinese provinces over the last week. Since 16
October, cases of Covid-19 linked to travel and tourism in Chinaâs north have
reached at least nine provincial-level regions. Parts of Inner
Mongolia and Gansu province have gone into tight lockdown. Many schools have
closed in both regions; a school has also closed in China's capital, Beijing. Tourist sites
have closed in parts of Xiâan â the home of the Terracotta Warriors â and some
cities have cancelled large-scale exhibitions and closed venues like cinemas. The number of
cases in China is still relatively low â only in the double digits â however,
it is common for the country to tackle outbreaks by swiftly locking down
communities when even one resident tests positive. Citywide testing drives are ordered, and people are prohibited from leaving affected areas
unless they can show a negative test within days of travel. Given many of
the affected regions in this latest outbreak are in Chinaâs north, the National
Health Commission has urged enhanced measures to ensure that Covid-19
prevention work can be carried out safely. It has
particularly emphasised protecting female medical workers from the cold in the
coming months, and has urged limiting the amount of time people spend outdoors. Currently, it is common for large-scale testing drives to take place outside. As we reported just now, there have been more than 50,000 new Covid cases reported - with the total of 52,009 the highest since 17 July. On that day, there were 54,674 cases. It comes as levels have been progressively climbing in the UK. The previous eight days have all seen cases at more than 40,000. Cases over the last three months have been roughly the same as they were over a three-month period last winter, meaning we can compare them. Between July and October this year, there were just over three million cases, with 79,000 people ending up in hospital. Between October and January last year, there were just over 2.7 million cases, but more than 185,000 people needed hospital treatment. This was before vaccines were widely available. So why are cases so high - is it the looser rules, waning immunity or to do with issues with the vaccine rollout? We've taken a closer look at some of those questionshere. Dozens of ambulances remain outside the emergency department on Thursday afternoon A health minister said earlier that the current pressure on the NHS was manageable and sustainable aftera doctor's union called formore restrictions to return in England to tackle ""unacceptable"" Covid case rates. Now, the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust (RCHT) has declareda critical incident due to the pressures it is facing. The trust reported up to 100 people in the emergency department waiting to be seen on Wednesday, with 25 ambulances waiting to transfer patients. It prompted managers to contact staff to ask them to work extra hours to help handle ""intense pressures"". In September, all planned and urgent surgeries were temporarily suspended due to the pressure the hospital is under. Routine surgeries remain suspended, with urgent procedures reviewed daily and continuing where possible. The trust said on Thursday it was treating 44 patients with Covid-19 - 10 more than the previous week. RCHT medical director Dr Allister Grant said there was ""unprecedented demand"" on the NHS in Cornwall, ""more so this week than at any point during the pandemic"". You can read morehere. The number of new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK has topped 50,000 for the first time since July. A total of 52,009 were recorded, according to the government statistics. And there have been another 115 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. As the debate over masks and face coverings rumbles on,Jacob Rees-Mogg says that Tories don't wear them in the Commons, but he follows Health Secretay Sajid Javid yesterday, saying MPs
should, to âset an exampleâ. MPs would indeed be effective in that if they did wear masks, Professor Robert West, a health psychologist advising the government as
part of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), tells the BBC Radio 4âs World at One. He says that for people who have
mixed feelings about mask-wearing, seeing MPs without them gives them an excuse
to say âif theyâre not doing it, why should I do itâ. Prof West adds that âitâs about
leadershipâ and âit behoves them to do the same thingâ. Jim ReedHealth reporter, BBC News Paul Carter, 75 and from Leeds, was one of the first to get a Covid booster jab on the high street at end of September Covid booster jabs will eventually be available toeveryone over 50,younger
adults with some chronic health conditions, frontline health and social care staff and adults who share a household with vulnerable people. But to be eligible, it has to be
182 days, or roughly six months, since that person received a second
vaccine dose. In all parts of the UK those eligible should be contacted
and invited to book a booster. Some care homes may have other
arrangements, with elderly residents visited by mobile units. In England, the health secretary has said that if you still
havenât been contactedandit is six months plus one extra week after
that second dose,then you can now go online,externalor phone 119 and book yourself in without an invite. For Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the advice for
over 50s and those with underlying health conditions is still to wait to be
contacted â either by phone, letter or text. The UK is in a ""much better position"" going into autumn and winter than it was 12 months ago - but ""we must fortify ourselves further"", says PM Boris Johnson. Speaking on a visit to Armagh, he says the government is ""watching the numbers very carefully every day"" - but that the situation is as predicted, so the government is ""sticking with our plan"". Johnson says that now, ""the most important thing people can do is just get that booster jab - when you get the call, get the jab"". It's because of vaccines that we're better off now than this time a year ago, he says, adding: ""But we must fortify ourselves further. ""The numbers are high, we see can see what's happening, we can see the increase, now is the time to get those booster jabs, and to vaccinate the 12-15 year olds as well."" We've got a storyhereon the PM's comments if you want to read more. This video can not be played Masks in Commons: Jacob Rees-Mogg and Pete Wishart Whether MPs, and indeed, the broader public in England should be back wearing masks has been strongly debated today. Doctors have called on the government to reimpose some rules in England, including face masks, because of the high number of new daily infections in the UK. The rules are different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where face coverings are required in certain places, including on public transport. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg says a ""convivial fraternal spirit"" means the Conservatives do not need to wear masks in the Commons. The Commons leader said those on government benches knew each other, and teased Pete Wishart that he may not want to mix with SNP MPs who sat with him in the Commons. The minister says that Tory MPs can make their own choice on face masks. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Mask-wearing is patchy in Poland and vaccination take-up has flat-lined The UK is not the only European country seeing a surge in
Covid cases. Several countries in Central and Eastern Europe are also
experiencing a dramatic rise in infections. Here in Poland, weâve had more than
double the amount of cases compared with last week, and Health Minister Adam
Niedzielski has called it an âexplosionâ. The number of new daily infections
exceeds 5,000 and the amount of people in hospital with Covid is the
highest since the start of June. Mr Niedzielski said some of the highest
infection rates were in regions in eastern Poland with the lowest vaccination take-up. Overall, 63% of adults here are fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 74%,
and take-up has flat-lined since August. The health minister says
heâs instructed police to impose fines on people flouting the rules. Itâs increasingly common here to see people in shops and on public transport without facemasks. The rising number of cases at home is also having an impact outside the country, with Morocco banning direct flights to and from the UK because of the rising number of cases. But on the upside, fully vaccinated travellers from 33 countries - including the UK - will now be able to travel to the US from
8 November. It's all explained here:  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News As we've been reporting, cases of coronavirus are rising sharply, frontline doctors say they are under huge pressure and some healthcare staff report being burnt out. But the government in England says there's no reason to change tack right now. Moving to Plan B on tackling the pandemic would involve relatively small changes to people's lives. It would mean compulsory face masks on public transport and in shops, and/or advice to work from home. So what's stopping the move? Ministers say the NHS is extremely busy but they don't believe the pressure is unsustainable. There is still headroom and the country is in a much more positive place than it was last autumn. Even as cases rise, the Covid vaccination programme is keeping a lid on hospital admissions and deaths - and that's why speeding up access to booster vaccines for the over 50s and jabs for young teens is a priority, as well as targeting the five million people who've so far refused a vaccine. This will increase protection for the majority of the population over the next few months. And with infections rising, natural immunity from the virus is also helping that process. Predicting what will happen to cases is tricky. Cases could still flatten and come down or continue to rise to 100,000 as Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned on Wednesday. In many countries in Europe, the picture is much rosier and that's causing some concern in the UK as a whole. There is no precise trigger for Plan B - it's a wait-and-see judgement call, and the government in England is still biding its time. Earlier today, the health minister said the
pressure on the NHS from Covid was âmanageableâ and sustainable. However, Dr Chris Gibbons,
clinical director of medicine at Newcastle Hospitals Trust, paintsa worrying picture. Newcastleâs Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) is in a similar
situation to other hospitals across the UK. The hospital has seen record numbers of
patients coming through its A&E, as well as a rise in patients with Covid
and flu. The backlog in surgery and treatments due to the pandemic
has also significantly contributed to current pressures. Dr Gibbons tells the BBC the current number of admissions is higher than âanything
weâd see in the worst wintersâ. The current picture at Newcastleâs RVI emergency department
is difficult. Dr Gibbons says they are starting most days with patients waiting for
beds and the waiting times can be âfor eight or nine hoursâ. In some cases, patients will only be seen âfour, five or six hoursâ after arriving at A&E. He says the pressures on emergency care staff are âlike
nothing weâve seen beforeâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999995
"A patient receives Covid care in Tunisia Covid has severely affected healthcare staff and may have killed between 80,000 and 180,000, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Healthcare workers must be prioritised for vaccines, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, and he criticised unfairness in the distribution of jabs. The deaths occurred between January 2020 and May of this year. Earlier, another senior WHO official warned a lack of jabs could see the pandemic continue well into next year. There are an estimated 135 million healthcare workers globally. ""Data from 119 countries suggest that on average, two in five healthcare workers globally are fully vaccinated,"" Dr Tedros said. ""But of course, that average masks huge differences across regions and economic groupings."" Fewer than one in 10 healthcare workers were fully vaccinated in Africa, he said, compared with eight in 10 in high-income countries. A failure to provide poorer countries with enough vaccines was highlighted earlier by Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior leader at the WHO, who said it meant the Covid crisis could ""easily drag on deep into 2022"". Less than 5% of Africa's population have been vaccinated, compared with 40% on most other continents. The vast majority of Covid vaccines overall have been used in high-income or upper middle-income countries. Africa accounts for just 2.6% of doses administered globally. More than 50 countries missing Covid vaccine target Covax: How many Covid vaccines have the US and the other G7 countries pledged? Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? The original idea behind Covax, the UN-backed global programme to distribute vaccines fairly, was that all countries would be able to acquire vaccines from its pool, including wealthy ones, writes BBC Global Affairs correspondent Naomi Grimley. But most G7 countries decided to hold back once they started making their own one-to-one deals with pharmaceutical companies. This video can not be played Ros Atkins looks at the ethics of Western countries rolling out Covid booster jabs while millions globally remain unvaccinated Dr Aylward appealed to wealthy countries to give up their places in the queue for vaccines so that pharmaceutical companies can prioritise the lowest-income countries instead. He said wealthy countries needed to ""stocktake"" where they were with their donation commitments made at summits such as the G7 meeting in St Ives this summer. ""I can tell you we're not on track,"" he said. ""We really need to speed it up or you know what? This pandemic is going to go on for a year longer than it needs to."" The People's Vaccine - an alliance of charities - has released new figures suggesting just one in seven of the doses promised by pharmaceutical companies and wealthy countries are actually reaching their destinations in poorer countries. The alliance, which includes Oxfam and UNAids, also criticised Canada and the UK for procuring vaccines for their own populations via Covax. Official figures show that earlier this year the UK received 539,370 Pfizer doses from Covax while Canada took just under a million AstraZeneca doses. Oxfam's Global Health Adviser, Rohit Malpani, acknowledged that Canada and the UK were technically entitled to get vaccines via this route having paid into the Covax mechanism, but he said it was still ""morally indefensible"" given that they had both obtained millions of doses through their own bilateral agreements. The UK government pointed out it was one of the countries which had ""kick-started"" Covax last year with a donation of Â£548m. The UK has also delivered more than 10 million vaccines to countries in need, and has pledged a total of 100 million. The Canadian government was keen to stress that it had now stopped using Covax vaccines. The country's International Development Minister, Karina Gould, said: ""As soon as it became clear that the supply we had secured through our bilateral deals would be sufficient for the Canadian population, we pivoted the doses which we had procured from Covax back to Covax, so they could be redistributed to developing countries."" Covax originally aimed to deliver two billion doses of vaccines by the end of this year, but so far it has shipped 371m doses.

"Former US President Donald Trump said the new platform would ""stand up to the tyranny of big tech"" Former US President Donald Trump has announced plans to launch a new social media network, called TRUTH Social. He said the platform would ""stand up to the tyranny of big tech"", accusing them of silencing opposing voices in the US. Social media played a pivotal role in Mr Trump's bid for the White House and was his favourite means of communication as president. But Mr Trump was banned from Twitter and suspended from Facebook after his supporters stormed the US Capitol. Social media firms were under pressure throughout Mr Trump's presidency to ban him, with his posts criticised as insulting, inflammatory or peddling outright falsehoods. Last year Twitter and Facebook began deleting some of his posts or labelling them as misleading,such as one in which he said Covid was ""less lethal"" than the flu. They took the decision to ban or suspend Mr Trump after the January riots, which followed a speech in which he made baseless claims of electoral fraud. Responding to the riots, Mr Trump called those at the Capitol ""patriots"" and showed no sign of accepting the result of the election, prompting Twitter and Facebook to rule that it was too risky to allow him to continue to use their sites. Since then he and his advisers have hinted that they were planning to create a rival social media site. Earlier this year, he launched From the Desk of Donald J Trump, which was often referred to as a blog. The website was permanently shut down less than a month after it launched after attracting only a fraction of the audience he would have expected through established sites. His senior aide Jason Miller said it was ""just auxiliary to the broader efforts we have and are working on"". An early version of his latest venture, TRUTH Social, will be open to invited guests next month, and will have a ""nationwide rollout"" within the first three months of 2022, according to a statement by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). ""We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favourite American President has been silenced,"" wrote Mr Trump. ""Everyone asks me why doesn't someone stand up to Big Tech? Well, we will be soon!"" he added. Donald Trump's team is making a big deal of this.  Yet there's no indication that the new company has a working platform yet. The new site is just a registration page. He wants to create a platform that rivals Twitter or Facebook, but that simply won't happen. By its very nature the platform is overtly politicised. It is not going to be a talking shop of ideas like Twitter, or a place the whole family is on like Facebook. What it could be is a more successful version of other 'free speech' social media platforms like Parler or Gab. Donald Trump clearly wants his megaphone back. He thinks this might be his ticket. But if he's really going to be heard, he needs the Big Tech platforms to let him back on - and that's not going to happen anytime soon. TMTG, which he chairs, also intends to launch a subscription video-on-demand service. TMTG said its video-on-demand service would ""feature 'non-woke' entertainment programming, news, podcasts, and more"". Mr Trump's announcement comes months after his former aide Jason Miller launched another social media company called GETTR. His criticism, that social media silences conservative voices, is shared by many Republicans, although Facebook data shows that figures such as Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino, as well as outlets like Fox News and The Daily Caller, consistently appear among the site's top performing posts. Mr Trump retains a strong hold over the the Republican party. He has hinted that he will run again in 2024 but has made no formal announcement. He has also kept his profile up with public rallies.

"The boss of one of the UK's biggest energy companies has called for the energy price cap to be abolished. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said the recent energy crisis had exposed deep flaws in the way the energy market was structured. He added there had been serious failures on the part of Ofgem. The regulator said the price cap had helped to keep down costs for millions of households. Mr Anderson said that the price cap was a popular idea politically but it has caused dozens of companies to go bust. As wholesale prices soared six-fold this year, companies had to buy gas at a price miles more than the rate they were allowed to sell it. ""There was a fixation about trying to create more and more competition and get more and more companies into the energy sector,"" he said. ""But it went too far. We ended up with a raft of small, not particularly well-run organisations coming into the retail sector. This crisis has shown this is quite a risky business."" Energy price cap not working, says power boss Why are gas prices so high and what is happening to fuel bills? He said that the regulator asking well-run companies to take on millions of customers from poorly-run and resourced companies is placing a massive burden on the sector which will mean prices will have to rise for the next 12 to 18 months. ""Every customer taken on at the price cap means Â£1,000 of cost,"" he said. ""We estimate the total cost to the industry of between Â£4bn and Â£5bn. ""The risk is that you will end up going back to the big five or the big six."" He added that a one-size-fits-all cap was regressive, as it did not even succeed in protecting more vulnerable customers, who spend a disproportionate amount of household income on energy. His solution would be the abolition of the cap while having a special tariff for people in fuel poverty. More affluent customers would pay more but that would be a more progressive way to regulate the industry. Mr Anderson was scathing about the competence of Ofgem saying the regulations were not fit for purpose. ""The regulator has not kept pace with what has been going on in the marketplace,"" he added. Ofgem responded by saying that the price cap had played its part in cushioning millions of households from soaring gas prices. But it acknowledged that regulations would need to change. ""Ofgem, with industry and the government, will need to build an energy market that is more resilient to shocks like this in the future. ""This is likely to mean an approach to regulation which is more focussed on the business models that enter and operate in our energy market, and on the risk they carry,"" it said. Mr Anderson rejected the notion that he is advocating an oligopoly with no price controls in which profit margins were allowed to be higher and people were disinclined to switch because they have seen smaller suppliers go bust. He said that a removal of the cap would not see profiteering as a market of 10 or 15 well-run companies in competition would provide good value for money. Mr Anderson noted that would still be more market competitors than you see in banking or supermarkets. He acknowledged the cost of transitioning to a net zero economy would be hundreds of billions which would end up on our bills or in taxes but said that it would ideally be spread over decades. The economic activity it generated would ripple right across the UK economy creating thousands of jobs, he said. His comments come the day after Scottish Power confirmed it was investing Â£6bn in three offshore wind projects. It was the centrepiece of a raft of investments the government announced at a global investment summit in London followed by a reception for business leaders at Windsor Castle attended by the prime minister and the Queen.

"This video can not be played ""Our past has shaped and scarred us"" The head of the Irish Catholic Church has said partition causes him ""a deep sense of loss and sadness"". Archbishop Eamon Martin was addressing a service to mark the centenary of Ireland being divided and the formation of Northern Ireland. In 1921, the island was divided into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State. Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined 150 guests from both sides of the border at the event on Thursday. Archbishop Martin said for the past 100 years, partition had ""polarised people on this island"". ""It has institutionalised difference, and it remains a symbol of cultural, political and religious division between our communities,"" he said. He told the service in Armagh's Church of Ireland Cathedral that he also felt churches could have gone further. NI Secretary Brandon Lewis and Prime Minister Boris Johnson were among those attending the centenary church service ""I have to face the difficult truth that, perhaps, we in the churches could have done more to deepen our understanding of each other and to bring healing and peace to our divided and wounded communities,"" he said. Speaking afterwards, the prime minister said: ""It has been very moving to be here today and see the way in which people from very different perspectives have come together."" Mr Johnson said Northern Ireland was ""an incredible part of the country"" and had ""an amazing future"". The prime minister added: ""I am a passionate unionist and, of course, I believe the future is within the United Kingdom."" The Queen had been due to attend the service but wasunable to travel for medical reasons. Irish president Michael D Higginsdeclined an invitation. The Armagh church service was organised to ""mark the centenaries of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland"". President Higgins said the title of the service made it ""inappropriate"" for him to attend as head of state. Sinn FÃ©in, including Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, also decided not to attend. A children's choir sang during the church service marking Northern Ireland's centenary However, Colum Eastwood, the leader of Northern Ireland's other nationalist party, the SDLP, was present. Among others at the service were Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP); DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson; Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie; Alliance leader Naomi Long; Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride. Two representatives from the Irish government were also present- Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, from the Fine Gael party, and chief whip Jack Chambers, from Fianna FÃ¡il. With Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey, a Sinn FÃ©in member, not attending, deputy speaker Roy Beggs formally represented the Northern Ireland Assembly. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney arriving at the service The event, titled ""A Service of Reflection and Hope"", was organised by the leaders of the main Protestant and Catholic Churches. It began with the ringing of the cathedral bell before the Dean of Armagh, Rev Shane Forster, sent his good wishes to the Queen. Welcoming the congregation in both English and Irish, he said: ""Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has divided us. And, yet, it has also, on occasion, brought us together."" The leaders of Ireland's main churches delivered their personal reflections on the creation of Northern Ireland.

""If we are to build a better future, then we must recognise our own woundedness and our responsibility to care for the wounds of one another."" Dr Ivan Patterson, the president of the Irish Council of Churches, said ""we need to learn"" from the example of young people. ""They are a generation who want to build peace, a generation who respect and care for this planet in solidarity with the poorest and most vulnerable here and around the world."" Church of Ireland Primate Rev John McDowell said:  ""I am hopeful. Hopeful in a new generation who know that the big problems we've landed them with, especially climate change and economic inequality, can only be tackled together. ""I think there are already signs that the next generation will see the things that we obsessed about as secondary and place their priorities elsewhere. ""As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light-filled, prosperous and peaceful future."" The main sermon was given by Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu, the president of the Methodist Church in Ireland The main sermon was given by the president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu, who told the congregation: ""We have come a long way - not just a century but centuries. ""During that time people have cared for one another and made efforts to build community."" But he added: ""We have also been blighted by sectarian divisions, terrible injustices, destructive violence, and by win-lose political attitudes. And for this, we have cause to lament."" African-born leader to give centenary sermon Queen cancels Northern Ireland trip on medical advice Church leaders hope for 'healing' centenary events Dr Yambasu said Thursday's service was an opportunity ""to give thanks and, also, lament; to imagine what could be, and to choose the way forward that can be mutually beneficial"". The service included an opening prayer in Irish led by Linda Ervine and SeÃ¡n Coll. Intercessions were offered by Prof Mary Hannon-Fletcher and Robert Barfoot, both of whom were injured in the Troubles. Children carried a lantern to the altar, a symbol of light and hope for the future. Northern Ireland was established inMay 1921 after the partition of Ireland. It followed decades of turmoil between nationalists, who wanted independence from British rule, and unionists, who wanted to remain in the United Kingdom. The border divided the 32-county island into two separate jurisdictions - six counties in the north-east became Northern Ireland, which is still part of the UK. The other 26-county territory became the Irish Free State, but is now the Republic of Ireland. Nationalists, north and south of the border, were infuriated by partition and continued to campaign for independence for the whole island. Many unionists were also bitterly disappointed, especially those who lived on the southern side and woke up to find themselves in a new state on 3 May 1921. The BBC News NI website has a dedicated section marking the 100th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland and partition of the island.

"Former US President Donald Trump said the new platform would ""stand up to the tyranny of big tech"" Former US President Donald Trump has announced plans to launch a new social media network, called TRUTH Social. He said the platform would ""stand up to the tyranny of big tech"", accusing them of silencing opposing voices in the US. Social media played a pivotal role in Mr Trump's bid for the White House and was his favourite means of communication as president. But Mr Trump was banned from Twitter and suspended from Facebook after his supporters stormed the US Capitol. Social media firms were under pressure throughout Mr Trump's presidency to ban him, with his posts criticised as insulting, inflammatory or peddling outright falsehoods. Last year Twitter and Facebook began deleting some of his posts or labelling them as misleading,such as one in which he said Covid was ""less lethal"" than the flu. They took the decision to ban or suspend Mr Trump after the January riots, which followed a speech in which he made baseless claims of electoral fraud. Responding to the riots, Mr Trump called those at the Capitol ""patriots"" and showed no sign of accepting the result of the election, prompting Twitter and Facebook to rule that it was too risky to allow him to continue to use their sites. Since then he and his advisers have hinted that they were planning to create a rival social media site. Earlier this year, he launched From the Desk of Donald J Trump, which was often referred to as a blog. The website was permanently shut down less than a month after it launched after attracting only a fraction of the audience he would have expected through established sites. His senior aide Jason Miller said it was ""just auxiliary to the broader efforts we have and are working on"". An early version of his latest venture, TRUTH Social, will be open to invited guests next month, and will have a ""nationwide rollout"" within the first three months of 2022, according to a statement by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). ""We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favourite American President has been silenced,"" wrote Mr Trump. ""Everyone asks me why doesn't someone stand up to Big Tech? Well, we will be soon!"" he added. Donald Trump's team is making a big deal of this.  Yet there's no indication that the new company has a working platform yet. The new site is just a registration page. He wants to create a platform that rivals Twitter or Facebook, but that simply won't happen. By its very nature the platform is overtly politicised. It is not going to be a talking shop of ideas like Twitter, or a place the whole family is on like Facebook. What it could be is a more successful version of other 'free speech' social media platforms like Parler or Gab. Donald Trump clearly wants his megaphone back. He thinks this might be his ticket. But if he's really going to be heard, he needs the Big Tech platforms to let him back on - and that's not going to happen anytime soon. TMTG, which he chairs, also intends to launch a subscription video-on-demand service. TMTG said its video-on-demand service would ""feature 'non-woke' entertainment programming, news, podcasts, and more"". Mr Trump's announcement comes months after his former aide Jason Miller launched another social media company called GETTR. His criticism, that social media silences conservative voices, is shared by many Republicans, although Facebook data shows that figures such as Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino, as well as outlets like Fox News and The Daily Caller, consistently appear among the site's top performing posts. Mr Trump retains a strong hold over the the Republican party. He has hinted that he will run again in 2024 but has made no formal announcement. He has also kept his profile up with public rallies.

"One home was completely destroyed in the blast in Ayr Dozens of people will spend a third night away from home after an explosion at a property in Ayr. Four houses in Gorse Park, Kincaidston, are likely to be demolished while 35 others are damaged or strewn with debris. A family of four remains in hospital after the blast on Monday, the cause of which is still being investigated. Police Scotland said it was too early to determine whether it had been caused by gas. Engineers from Scottish Gas Networks (SGN) remained at the scene on Wednesday. Family of four seriously injured in Ayr explosion Man helps evacuate boy from blast wreckage A 43-year-old woman and a 16-year-old boy are being treated for serious injuries at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. A 47-year-old man is in the city's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital while an 11-year-old boy is in the adjoining Royal Hospital for Children. On Wednesday afternoon, South Ayrshire Council confirmed residents of 46 properties could safely return to their homes. Work is ongoing to re-establish gas supply in the wider area Of the properties that will be left standing, four have been ""significantly"" damaged and will need extensive repairs before householders can return, the council said. Others were damaged by debris and some are not safe to access due to broken windows or debris strewn across gardens or inside properties. The council said teams were working to remove debris, but that some people could return to their homes while their next-door neighbours could not. Work is ongoing to re-establish gas supply to the wider area. Emergency services will decide whether people can return to their homes Council leader Peter Henderson said: ""I know that council teams, the emergency services and partners have been working tirelessly to help as many people as possible to return to their homes. ""This is no easy task and I am relieved that their painstaking work has allowed some families to get back home today. Of course, it's still very early days and the devastation caused by this tragic event will take considerable time to rectify. ""We are committed to working alongside our communities and partners to support them through the aftermath of this terrible event."" Earlier, the deputy leader of South Ayrshire Council, Brian McGinley, told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that some residents were back in their homes, some were staying with family and friends and others were in hotels. ""We need to realise that this has been a very major incident, it's a very demanding and technical situation,"" he said. ""Clearly we're working as fast and as hard as we can to make sure everybody is safe, that everyone's needs are met. But it's going to take a long time for this community to recover.""

Mr McGinley added: ""Volunteers are providing rest and food for local people and emergency services - they have clothes, drinks and foodstuffs available. Some people have been a bit traumatised by it so they can come down, have a cup of tea and chat to people about it."" The council also said it had been overwhelmed by donations from the public and offers of help from local businesses. A hub for residents affected by the incident and emergency service workers has been set up at Kincaidston Community Pavilion. One community worker told the BBC that about 120 residents were initially unable to return to their homes following the explosion. ""[They] had to register to say what location they were in approximate to the explosion and then they could get let back in their houses,"" he said. ""We had kids in getting their evening meals. ""As far as I'm led to believe one of the local hotels has put some of the residents up, that was [Tuesday] afternoon - I don't know what the situation is now."" He said the centre had received donations from local businesses, including takeaways, supermarkets, bakers and butchers to support displaced people. ""It's been quite hectic but the emergency services are very appreciative of what we've done for them - the community has rallied round."" A total of 35 homes were damaged or strewn with debris Scottish Fire and Rescue Service area commander Ian McMeekin described the aftermath of the explosion as ""extremely challenging"". At its height, nine appliances responded to the explosion, which happened shortly after 19:00 on Monday, as well as urban search and rescue teams. Mr McMeekin said: ""There is significant damage to the properties and the surrounding area."" He also thanked the local community for their ""support and understanding"". Residents needing support following the blast have been urged to contact 0300 123 0900. The gas distribution company SGN said it would continue to work with ""expert parties"" in the coming days to establish the cause of the explosion. A temporary, above-ground gas pipeline has been installed for homes in Kincaidston. The company said: ""We'd like to reiterate our reassurance to the local community that the gas network across the area remains safe and secure to use. ""Our engineers have carried out full safety checks in the area to ensure the safety of all the homes close to the damaged properties. ""We're aware some residents may have turned off their gas supply at the meter as a result of the incident.

"Major tax evasion and avoidance schemes have cost governments an estimated â¬150bn (Â£127bn) in lost revenues, research shows. So-called cum-cum and cum-ex schemes are designed to exploit weaknesses in national tax laws. They apply to the payments, or dividends, firms make to shareholders. The new figures have been calculated by a team of experts at the University of Mannheim, in partnership with the German not-for-profit group Correctiv. Evidence from leaked documents and people involved in the schemes suggests UK taxpayers have also lost out, potentially to the tune of billions of pounds. The tax fraud merry-go-round that cost billions The research forms part of a joint investigation carried out by newsrooms worldwide, co-ordinated by Correctiv, known as the CumEx Files 2.0. It casts new light on a growing scandal which first came to public attention in 2018. So-called cum-ex trades were transactions where shares were sold from one investor to another immediately before the payment of a dividend (cum, or with, dividend) but delivered afterwards (ex-dividend). This tactic effectively created confusion over who owned the shares at the moment when the dividend was paid. It allowed both parties to claim rebates on withholding tax - a levy which had only been paid once, when the dividend was issued. This practice became popular in Germany in the early years of the century and continued until 2012, when the law was changed. It also spread to other countries, notably Denmark, but also France, Belgium, Italy and Austria. In Germany, prosecutors have launched a wave of criminal inquiries. Several individuals have already been found guilty of tax evasion. Some 1,000 people are currently under investigation, including junior and senior banking staff, lawyers and brokers. A list acquired by German broadcaster ARD's investigative programme Panorama contains the names of more than 700 of those under scrutiny, of whom 134 are known to be UK citizens. Although London has been widely identified as the place where many cum-ex trading strategies were conceived, the UK exchequer was not a target - because dividends here are not subject to withholding tax. But documents show that bankers were able to carry out related trades to ""recycle"" otherwise unusable German tax credits and generate profits at UK taxpayers' expense. The complex system relied on so-called ""manufactured overseas dividends"" (MODs), payments made between parties involved in so-called short sales of borrowed shares in foreign companies. It allowed investors to generate liabilities which could be offset against German tax credits and at the same time, generate a credit against UK tax. Estimates vary as to how much this scheme actually cost the UK taxpayer. One individual who was involved in these kinds of trades in the past suggested it would have been several hundred million pounds a year until 2005 - and more than Â£100m per year thereafter. Another whistleblower told the BBC that ""these were not small trades"", and that the practice ""must have been used on a significant scale"". In 2014, HMRC changed the rules on taxation of MODs. It says this was done for a variety of reason, including to ""reduce the potential for tax avoidance"". While the fallout from the cum-ex affair has dominated media attention and prosecutor interest so far, the latest findings from Correctiv's investigation suggest an even bigger scandal may be brewing. Cum-ex is understood to have cost governments nearly â¬10bn. But according to researchers at the University of Mannheim, that figure is dwarfed by losses stemming from another long-standing form of dividend arbitrage, known as cum-cum. This strategy comes into play in countries where domestic and foreign investors are treated differently for tax purposes. A foreign investor will sell or loan shares just ahead of the dividend payment to a second investor resident in the country where the company is listed. The second party is able to claim a dividend tax credit that would not have been available to the foreign investor. The shares can then be passed back to the original owner, and the benefits shared. The Mannheim team has calculated that between 2000 and 2020, this practice cost 10 governments, including those of Germany, Spain, France and the US, a total of â¬141bn. It describes this estimate as ""very conservative"". Whether these losses will lead to prosecutions is less clear, however. While cum-ex involved generating multiple claims for withholding tax that had only been paid once, and its use has been described as a ""criminal act of tax fraud"" by Germany's Federal Court of Justice, experts say cum-cum sits in a legally grey area. ""It's not against the law,"" explains Christoph Spengel, a professor of international taxation and the leader of the Mannheim team. ""But in individual cases, in Germany it is against the law if the sole purpose of buying and repurchasing shares is to have a tax benefit.""

"Mr Souli says he doesn't know what impact the summit will have on his business Glasgow businessman Mohsen Souli is in two minds about the COP26 summit. The cafe and antiques shop owner is excited at the prospect of tens of thousands of people descending on Glasgow, potentially boosting his sales. But he's also worried. His businesses are only a short distance away from the SEC Campus, where COP26 is due to take place from the end of this month. Road closures around Finnieston, where he is based, have left him wondering if shop footfall will grow or slump. COP26: How will road closures affect Glasgow? COP26: Strikes and closures during Glasgow climate summit But he's even more worried about security. ""I am concerned about what might happen if there are protests. I am hopeful that they will be very peaceful but if not, a broken window would cost me Â£5,000 to replace,"" he says. ""I also don't know what affect the closing of roads is going to have on my business - will it be good or bad?"" Mr Souli says he plans to stock up on goods for his cafe ahead of the summit, in case deliveries are affected by security and traffic measures. ""I can't be sure whether I will be getting too many supplies - things are very uncertain at the moment. ""I have spoken to other businesses in the area and everyone has the same feeling of uncertainty. We will just have to see how it goes,"" he adds. The climate summit is due to be held at the SEC Campus in Glasgow Businesses in other sectors have widely welcomed COP26 - and its potential for future business - but some remain concerned over the impact on trading of road closures, traffic congestion andplanned rail and bus strikes. Road closures are due to come into effect in Glasgow from Saturday 23 October - more than a week before the start of the event - and last until 15 November. Get Ready Glasgow,external, the city's information site, has produced a congestion map showing how travel in the city will be ""significantly impacted"". Hotels and other accommodation providers in central Scotland have reported high levels of occupancy for the duration of the UN climate summit, bringing in welcome business as they work to recover from the pandemic. But Leon Thompson, executive director for Scotland of trade body UKHospitality,  said the picture was less clear for bar and restaurant owners. ""They will be hoping to see greater footfall on the streets during the event, but road closures in the city may have an impact on that,"" he explains. ""Traffic congestion may also have an effect on the number of people going out and about during the summit."" A further uncertainty, he added, was the amount of disruption road closures could have on deliveries of supplies to premises. The Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland has also raised concerns about the potential disruption facing some members. Policy chairman Andrew McRae explained: ""Like any global conference, COP26 was bound to cause some disruption to residents and businesses in Glasgow. ""While communications from the relevant authorities have mostly been good, the scale of the road closures has worried some in business as well as people who travel for work. ""And even if you know about a major diversion, that doesn't compensate you if, for example, it becomes more difficult for your customers to reach you for almost a month. ""On a more positive note, the high-end tourism and hospitality sector in Scotland looks likely to do well from the conference. ""And the event is an opportunity to show Glasgow and Scotland, as well as our business community, to some of the most important decision-makers on the planet."" The Glasgow Chamber of Commerce said ""inevitably"" there would be some disruption to businesses over the course of the summit, but added it was working closely with Glasgow City Council and the Scottish and UK governments to minimise the impact. Chief executive Stuart Patrick said: ""COP26 will put Glasgow on the world stage and we will be working hard with our members to ensure there is a lasting economic and environmental legacy from the event."" The Scottish Retail Consortium said its industry had shown repeatedly over recent years that it was adept at coping with disruptions and ensuring shoppers could continue to have access to a good range of products. Director David Lonsdale said: ""Most retailers in Glasgow have well-developed contingency plans in place to deal with a massive event like COP26, and to minimise any short-term impact on shoppers and deliveries to stores. ""Retailers continue to carefully monitor developments including road closures and industrial action with public transport. ""However, with trading conditions very tough at the moment, and with Glasgow's shopper footfall down by a fifth compared to pre-pandemic times, this will certainly put these plans to the test.""

"The COP26 climate summit is under way in Glasgow - one of the biggest ever world meetings on how to tackle global warming. BBC News Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris answers some of your questions. You can send a question using the form at the bottom of this page. How is the average family going to find the extra Â£20,000 needed to buy an electric vehicle?  Nicola Hippisley, London You don't necessarily need an extra Â£20,000 to buy an electric vehicle. Overall, electric cars have been more expensive than petrol or diesel ones for some time, but the difference has been narrowing. The average cost of an electric car in the UK is about Â£44,000, but you can buy a basic one for less than Â£20,000. That's partly because the price of the batteries which electric cars use has fallen sharply in recent years. At the moment, the price of raw materials is threatening to push battery prices up again, but the industry expects that as electric car sales increase, economies of scale will kick in. Experts predict that new electric and petrol/diesel cars will cost the same within the next five years. It is also possible to lease an electric vehicle, and there's a growing second-hand market as well, where vehicles are much cheaper. The UK government currently offersa grant of up to Â£2,500 as a discount on the price of certain brand new low-emission vehicles,externalincluding some electric models. You can also claima grant of up to Â£350 to help meet the cost of installing a chargepoint,externalat your house if you have dedicated off-street parking. This is available whether you lease your car or own it outright. Separately, the Scottish government offers interest-free loans to help people buybrand new,externalorused,externalelectric vehicles. Why electric cars will take over sooner than you think Video: Should I buy an electric car? How will the decisions made at COP26 change our day-to-day lives? I want to know what I can do to help move these policies forward. Matthew Hadley, Harpenden The decisions made at COP26 are part of the wider ambition to decarbonise our economies - and that will certainly have an impact on daily life. The cars we drive and the way we heat our homes are going to change. Buying an electric vehicle, or getting a heat pump installed at home, is going to become more and more common. The hope - and for many the expectation - is that as these technologies become more established, the costs will come down. There are also personal choices to be made about what we eat (the Climate Change Committee which advises the government recommends a 20% reduction per person by 2050 in the amount of beef, lamb and dairy we consume), and how often we fly. Then there are practical issues like recycling and cutting down on waste as much as possible. Why are we still referring to 2050 as some sort of end goal, since very little has changed in the last two decades? Wouldn't 2040 or perhaps even 2030 put a little more urgency into every little step humanity takes? Jake Kettmann, Bega, NSW, Australia The year 2050 is the target date set by many countries for reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. But you're not alone in thinking that 2050 is much too far in the future to force some politicians or companies to take action now. That's why there are also plenty of interim targets, and the 2020s have been identified as a critical decade for climate action - it can't all be delayed until the 10 years leading up to 2050. Many of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases have now set targets for 2030, and the UN says overall emissions need to fall by 45% [by that date]compared to 2010 levels, if the aim of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is to remain realistic. At the moment, though, the world is nowhere near achieving that, even with the new pledges made at COP26. If scientists have already considered a 1.5C reduction goal will not be achieved, why don't we set up a new goal, which we may able to achieve? Ana, Vietnam Quite a few scientists think it may already be too late to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but they'd rather have an ambitious target to aim for. The Paris Agreement in 2015 set the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C. So ""well below 2C"" is already written into law as a secondary target. There's also a growing awareness of the need to take action which will make a difference in the next five to 10 years. That's why many of the agreements made at COP26 - to reverse deforestation, for example, or to cut global methane emissions by 30% - set 2030 as their target date. The challenge now of course is to turn those promises into practice, and to deliver urgent change. How can we be sure the claims made about greenhouse gas emissions can be verified? What independent observer is measuring different countries' attempts to reduce their fossil fuel usage? Lee Gary, Spain Checking claims made about greenhouse gas emissions is one of the biggest issues for negotiators at COP26. At the moment, countries only have to review and update their pledges for cutting emissions every five years. Many people argue that's not often enough, and some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change want to turn it into an annual process to keep the pressure on. The role of independent observer is supposed to be filled by UN scientists. Buta recent investigation by The Washington Post,externalfound multiple examples of flawed or inaccurate data submitted to the UN by individual countries. It is another example of climate promises falling short of what is required, as a process which relies so heavily on data needs to ensure that the data is accurate. Last month,a UN-backed body launched a scheme,externalto verify net zero claims made by big companies, to ensure that corporate pledges can be easily compared and properly scrutinised. Is there a way to force countries in the UN, especially China and India, to cut back to net zero by 2050? Can sanctions or similar trade restrictions be used against them? Diana Butungi, Kampala Only a few countries have made their net zero pledges legally binding. Many of the national pledges are non-binding targets, but there is a hope that as momentum towards net zero begins to accelerate it will provide an incentive for others to follow. It would be possible in theory to impose trade or other sanctions on countries that are moving more slowly, but that could be counter-productive. The focus of meetings like COP26 is to try to encourage international cooperation. It's also unfair to put all the blame on countries like India and China for the majority of carbon emissions, even though China is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world today and India is the third largest. China and India have huge populations, and much lower emissions per person than more developed countries. In any case, it's important to consider the historical role played by European countries and the United States which are responsible for far more cumulative emissions than China or India. The damaging effects of emitting CO2 into the atmosphere linger for hundreds of years, and the rich world has acknowledged that it has the primary responsibility for tackling climate change. What does net zero mean? Are there plans for governments and countries to invest in carbon-capture technologies on a very large scale? If not, why? Bernath Bence, Netherlands The trouble with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is that the technology that does exist, won't be rolled out fast enough to make any significant difference this decade, when greenhouse gas emissions need to fall significantly. In 2020, for example, the UK allocated Â£1bn to a CCS infrastructure fund, with the ambition of capturing the equivalent of 10m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030. That target has already been increased to capturing 20-30m metric tonnes by 2030. But, to put that in perspective, the UK is estimated to have produced the net equivalent of more than 450m metric tonnes of CO2 in 2019. Government investment varies hugely around the world. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia are relying very heavily on CCS to allow them to continue producing fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, but that means scaling up the technology in a way which has not yet been proven to work effectively. How do agricultural products like rice and sugar contribute to the increase of CO2? What can we do to help reduce emissions? Ng Wee Meng, Singapore Most forms of agriculture produce CO2 emissions in one way or another. Beef is widely agreed to be the most carbon-intensive food to produce globally, but there are emissions from sugar and rice - these are connected with factors such as deforestation, animal feed, energy used in processing and transport, and packaging. One study estimates that rice, for example,produces the equivalent of 4kg of CO2 emissions for every 1kg of rice produced,external. Given that 755 million tonnes of rice are produced every year around the world, that is a lot of CO2. On the other hand, rice is an essential staple food feeding billions around the world. The best way to help reduce emissions is to try to ensure you eat food which is produced as sustainably as possible - although many people may not have the luxury of that choice. Would enforcing quotas for meat consumption and flight travels be efficient and feasible? Anonymous, Geneva Meat eating (especially beef) and travelling by air both have a sizeable environmental impact. Eating one or two hamburgers a week for a yearcreates the same amount of greenhouse gasesas heating a UK home for 95 days. And a return economy flight from London to New Yorkemits about 0.67 tonnes of CO2.That's 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK. In theory, enforced quotas for meat consumption or flying would make a difference, but there's little political appetite or support for that to happen. Instead, the focus is on encouraging behavioural change. The UK Climate Change Committee - which advises the government - has recommended that people should consume 20% less meat and dairy by 2030, and 35% less by 2050. People are also being urged to think about flying less. Using taxation to make certain things more expensive would probably be a more realistic solution than trying to enforce quotas. What's your diet's carbon footprint? Will I still be able to fly in a net zero world? Why can't we have an international fund to help poorer countries attain zero carbon emissions? Robert Patterson, Darlington That is partly what the current debate on climate finance is all about. In 2009, rich countries said they would provide $100bn (Â£73bn) every year to the developing world by 2020. But they have been unable to live up to their promise, and they are now suggesting they will only meet that target in 2023. Poorer countries need this money to help tackle the effects of climate change that they are already facing. But they also need it to make sure their economies become greener as they develop, on a path to net zero carbon emissions. What does net zero mean? If it is people causing climate change, what is being done to stop over-population ? Gaye Schmidt, Perth, Australia Overpopulation isn't the root cause of climate change. Rather, it's the excessive emission of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet up. And the richest one per cent of the world's population is responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest fifty per cent. It is true to say the population of the planet can't keep increasing indefinitely, because there is a finite number of resources available. But excessive consumption has played a larger role in climate change than a growing global population. Can your sex life be eco-friendly? The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. A really simple guide to climate change Why the COP26 climate summit is important What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change Is the global capitalist model not at odds with climate change and the need for a greener way of life? Andrew, Exeter Matt McGrath writes: According to some experts, such as the economist Lord Stern, climate change can be seen as the great failure of the market. This is because businesses have not generally had to pay for the damage they have caused to the environment. Global efforts to tackle climate change over the past two decades have focused more on harnessing capitalism to limit warming - for instance, putting a price on carbon and making the polluter pay, to ensure that emissions are ultimately restricted. Meanwhile, it's also the case that if there's consumer demand for greener products and services, capitalism will try to meet that demand. But there's evidently still a lot of work to be done to make these approaches work. Does COP26 really need 25,000 people there? They will generate a lot of CO2, so why can't many elements be online? David, Birmingham Matt McGrath writes: The pandemic might be seen as the perfect moment for the UN to use technology for negotiations, and it was attempted during a preparatory meeting for COP in June, which ran for three weeks. Unfortunately, it didn't go well - time-zone and technology challenges made it almost impossible for countries with limited resources, progress was limited and decisions were put off. As a result, many developing nations have insisted on having an in-person COP. They feel that it is far easier for their voices to be ignored on a dodgy Zoom connection. They also bring a lived experience of climate change that it is critical for rich countries to hear first-hand. There's some evidence that this works. In 2015, the presence of island states and vulnerable nations was key to securing the commitment to limit temperature changes to 1.5C in the Paris Agreement.
