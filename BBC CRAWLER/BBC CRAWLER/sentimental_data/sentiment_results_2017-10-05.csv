"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Look, I've had a cold this week"" Theresa May has said she has the ""full support of her cabinet"" after a former party chairman said there should be a Conservative leadership contest. The PM insisted she was providing the ""calm leadership"" the country needed. Grant Shapps says about 30 Tory MPs back his call for a leadership contest in the wake of the general election results and conference mishaps. But his claims prompted a backlash from loyal backbenchers, several of whom called on him to ""shut up"". There has been leadership speculation since Mrs May's decision to call a snap general election backfired and the Conservatives lost their majority. Laura Kuenssberg: Doubts are now out in open Tories rally round May after speech woes PM struggles through interrupted speech The Conservative conference this week was meant to be a chance to assert her authority over the party, but her big speech was plagued by a series of mishaps, as she struggled with a persistent cough, was interrupted by a prankster and some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her. Asked about leadership speculation as she attended a charity event in her constituency, Mrs May said: ""What the country needs is calm leadership and that's what I am providing with the full support of my cabinet."" This video can not be played Former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said Theresa May should face a leadership election She said her recent speech in Florence had given ""real momentum"" to Brexit negotiations and she was intending to update MPs next week on her plans to help ""ordinary working families"" with a cap on energy bills. Environment Secretary Michael Gove was among cabinet ministers and MPs publicly defending Mrs May on Friday morning, as the story broke that Mr Shapps was the senior Tory behind a bid to persuade her to go. Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4 the prime minister was a ""fantastic"" leader, had widespread support, and should stay ""as long as she wants"". He said that the ""overwhelming majority of MPs and the entirety of the cabinet"" backed the prime minister. Home Secretary Amber Rudd wrote an article inthe Telegraph,externalurging the prime minister to stay, while First Secretary of State Damian Green said on the BBC's Question Time the prime minister ""was determined as ever to get on with her job - she sees it as her duty to do so"". Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, hit out at those plotting to oust Mrs May as prime minister. Speaking to the BBC's Political Thinking podcast, she said: ""I have to say, I've not got much time for them... ""I really don't think that having a bit of a cold... when you are trying to make a speech changes the fundamentals of whether Theresa May is the right person to lead the country."" There is, this morning, an operation being mounted by the government to try to show that nothing has changed in the Conservative Party in the last few days. That Theresa May's leadership remains on track and she is, to use another of her famous phrases, just, ""getting on with the job"". Except, as happened the last time she proclaimed ""nothing has changed"", something rather fundamental has, after all. For the doubts that have been building about her in the party for months are now out there in the wide open. Read more from the BBC's political editor To trigger a vote of confidence in the party leader, 48 of the 316 Conservative MPs would need to write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee. A leadership contest would only be triggered if Mrs May lost that vote, or chose to quit. Mr Shapps, who was co-chair of the party between 2012 and 2015, said no letter had been sent and said his intention had been to gather signatures privately and persuade Mrs May to stand down. But he claimed party whips had taken the ""extraordinary"" step of making it public by naming him as the ringleader of a plot to oust the PM in a story in the Times. He told the BBC: ""I think it's time we actually tackle this issue of leadership and so do many colleagues. ""We wanted to present that to Theresa May privately. Now I'm afraid it's being done a bit more publicly."" He added: ""The country needs leadership. It needs leadership at this time in particular. I think the conference and the lead-up through the summer has shown that that's not going to happen. I think it's time that we have a leadership election now, or at least let's set out that timetable."" This video can not be played The ""overwhelming majority of MPs"" support the prime minister, says Environment Secretary Michael Gove But Conservative MP Nigel Evans told the BBC's Daily Politics that if Grant Shapps ""can't get 48 signatures, he should just shut up: ""In my chats to MPs at Westminster nobody wants an early leadership election. We just simply don't want that."" Fellow MP James Cleverlytweeted,external: ""I've always liked Grant Shapps but he really is doing himself, the party and (most importantly) the country no favours at all. Just stop."" Among other MPs criticising Mr Shapps was Charles Walker, vice chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, who suggested the plot was going to ""fizzle out"". ""No 10 must be delighted to learn that it's Grant Shapps leading this alleged coup,"" he said. ""Grant has many talents but one thing he doesn't have is a following in the party."" Former minister Ed Vaizey was the first MP to publicly suggest Mrs May should quit on Thursday, telling the BBC: ""I think there will be quite a few people who will now be pretty firmly of the view that she should resign.""

"The National Rifle Association has called for ""additional regulations"" on bump-stocks, a rapid fire device used by the Las Vegas massacre gunman. The group said: ""Devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations."" Republicans have said they would consider banning the tool, despite years of resisting any gun control. Lawmakers plan to hold hearings and consider a bill to outlaw the device. The NRA called on Thursday for regulators to ""immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law"". President Donald Trump later told reporters his administration would be looking into whether to ban them ""in the next short period of time"". Las Vegas gunman How bump-stocks work Las Vegas urges Trump to act Five reasons US gun control won't happen ""In the aftermath of the evil and senseless attack in Las Vegas, the American people are looking for answers as to how future tragedies can be prevented,"" NRA chiefs Wayne LaPierre and Chris Cox wrote in the statement. This video can not be played 'It was the scariest moment in my life' They criticised politicians who are calling for gun control, writing that ""banning guns from law-abiding Americans based on the criminal act of a madman will do nothing to prevent future attacks"". The statement, the organisation's first since Sunday's attack in Las Vegas that left 58 people dead and nearly 500 injured, noted that bump-stocks were approved by the Obama administration's Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms. Living with a monster They died in each other's arms Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington The NRA's strategy for responding to the Las Vegas mass-shooting is now coming into focus. By recommending that an executive branch agency conduct a review of the legality of bump stock devices, the extremely influential gun rights lobby is seeking to direct efforts towards administrative, not legislative, solutions. If Congress were to start drafting new laws, the process may be more difficult for the NRA to control. Democrats, who have been clamouring for the opportunity to debate new gun-control laws, could have their chance. Republican congressional leadership may try to clamp down on the proceedings, but there's a chance other proposals -like limits on magazine capacity, military-style rifle features and new background check requirements - could come up for consideration. These types of provisions are popular with the public at large but vigorously opposed by the NRA and their supporters in Congress. It could make for difficult votes for some conservative legislators. The White House and many congressional Republicans are pledging to have a ""conversation"" about the issue and ""look into"" the details. That, for the moment, is a far cry from action. The NRA is now suggesting an alternative route. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, who spoke to reporters moments after the NRA statement was issued, said: ""Members of both parties and multiple organisations are planning to take a look at bump-stocks. We welcome that and would like to be part of that conversation."" In the same statement the NRA urged Congress to pass their longstanding pet proposal to expand gun rights nationwide, so-called right-to-carry reciprocity. The lobby group wants gun-owners with concealed-carry permits from one state to be allowed to take their weapons into any other US state, even if it has stricter firearms limits. Another NRA policy priority, the deregulation of silencer attachments, appears to have stalled in Congress in the wake of the Las Vegas attack, after Republican sponsors withdrew their bill. A bill to ban bump-stocks was submitted to the US Senate on Wednesday by California Democrat Dianne Feinstein. This video can not be played After the Las Vegas attack in October 2017 the BBC looked at how US mass shootings are getting worse A Republican-led version of the bill may be submitted for debate as early as Thursday, Florida Republican Carlos Curbelo told reporters. He said there was growing bipartisan consensus and that his office had been ""flooded"" with calls from other lawmakers interested in the bill. ""I think we are on the verge of a breakthrough when it comes to sensible gun policy,"" he told reporters. Bump-fire stocks, also called bump-stocks and slide-fire adapters, allow semi-automatic rifles to fire at a high rate, similar to a machine gun. But they can be obtained without the extensive background checks required of automatic weapons. By James Cook, BBC News, Las Vegas Ask survivors of the Las Vegas massacre about gun control and you may well hear the sound of silence. The cultures of country music and shooting overlap and many concert-goers remain strong supporters of the right to bear arms. ""It's obviously kind of a touchy subject,"" singer and performer Krystal Goddard, 35, told me after recounting the horror of her escape from the gig. ""I think that guns are just a symptom of other things going on,"" she said, although she added that she did not understand why anyone needed to own an assault rifle. There is some support among survivors for banning bump-stocks but there is also a realisation that doing so does not amount to serious gun control. And all the while the killing continues. Fifty-nine people died here on Sunday. By Thursday afternoon at least 87 more people had been shot and killed across the US,according to the Gun Violence Archive,external. That's a Las Vegas massacre every three days. Stephen Paddock, the gunman in Las Vegas, had fixed the accessories to 12 rifles used in his attack. Bump-stocks typically cost less than $200 (Â£150) and allow nearly 100 high-velocity bullets to be fired in just seven seconds, according to one company advert. One of the most popular manufacturers of bump-stocks, Slide Fire, said they had sold out ""due to extreme high demands"" since the Las Vegas shooting.

"The Royal Navy could lose its ability to assault enemy held beaches, under plans being considered in the Ministry of Defence, BBC Newsnight understands. Two specialist landing ships - HMS Albion and Bulwark - would be taken out of service under the proposals. The plan - part of a package of cost-cutting measures - has caused alarm among senior Royal Marine officers. The MoD told the BBC that no decisions have been made yet and that discussion of options was ""pure speculation"". It is understood the head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Sir Philip Jones, formulated the move as part of a package designed to balance the books and free up sailors for the service's two new aircraft carriers. Critics say the proposal would deprive the Royal Marines of its core mission. Among other cuts envisaged are a reduction of 1,000 to the strength of the Royal Marines and the early retirement of two mine-hunting vessels and one survey vessel. A senior Royal Marine officer blamed the introduction of the new carriers for exacerbating the senior service's financial and manning problems. He told the BBC: ""This is the worst procurement decision of the past half century - that's what the Royal Marines are being sacrificed for."" The proposed cuts are part of a raft of ""adjustments"" being considered by all three services - the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force - as the Ministry of Defence struggles to balance its books. The Royal Air Force could slow down orders of its new F35 fighter, and the Army could lose dozens of helicopters as part of their efforts towards the same goal. In 2015 there was aStrategic Defence and Security Review,external, a paper intended to act as a blueprint for the coming five years. However the depreciation of sterling has made big buys of foreign equipment more expensive and the armed forces have crammed the programme with too many projects, creating a hole in the budget. The government announced ""additional work to review national security capabilities"" in July - a review by stealth - under the leadership of its national security adviser Mark Sedwill. The proposed cuts to the Royal Navy have been put forward as part of this exercise. Under the 1997 defence review, a group of ships was created to improve the UK's ability to land its commando brigade, even in the face of opposition. At a glance: 2015 Strategic Defence Review Defence Review: Fighting old battles? Royal Navy 'woefully low' on warships The helicopter carrier Ocean, two specialist landing ships - Albion and Bulwark - and four logistic support ships were to be acquired to allow the 5,000 strong force to continue performing operations such as the 1982 Falklands landing, or the one on the Faw peninsula during the 2003 Iraq conflict. With the retirement of HMS Ocean already announced, and the new plans to lose the two landing ships, the Royal Marines' ability to use landing or hovercraft to get ashore would be drastically curtailed. In recent years, as an economy measure, the Royal Navy has only been crewing Albion or Bulwark alternately - they are big ships, each requiring a complement of 325. While the government has dubbed 2017 ""the Year of the Royal Navy"" and emphasised its commitment to a new national shipbuilding strategy, observers at the MoD noticed that this blueprint contained no commitment to renew the amphibious warfare fleet. The service is already committed to putting its two new carriers into service, replacing Trident, buying a new class of hunter-killer submarines, and two new types of frigate. ""The Royal Navy has got us into this mess"", said a senior MoD figure, referring to the department's budgetary black hole, ""so it's up to them to take the pain necessary to get us out of it"". With budgetary responsibility devolved to service chiefs, it fell to the head of the Navy Admiral Sir Philip Jones, to come up with proposals for how he could run the fleet within the financial and personnel limits he has been set.

"Film producer Harvey Weinstein has issued an apology as a newspaper reported a number of sexual harassment allegations against him. ""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it,"" said the movie mogul's statement. But he later disputed a New York Times report that claimed he harassed female employees over nearly three decades. The newspaper reported he had reached at least eight settlements with women. Mr Weinstein, a married father-of-five, said he planned to take a leave of absence from his company and had hired therapists to deal with his issue. ""My journey now will be to learn about myself and conquer my demons,"" the 65-year-old's statement on Thursday said. Weinstein is married to English fashion designer Georgina Chapman ""I so respect all women and regret what happened,"" he added in the statement initially given to the New York Times, and later sent to the BBC. It continued: ""I cannot be more remorseful about the people I hurt and I plan to do right by all of them."" The Miramax and Weinstein Company co-founder has produced a number of Oscar-winning blockbusters, including Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and The Artist. Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said in another statement that he denies many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"". She also said that as a women's rights advocate she had been blunt with him that some of his conduct ""can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating"". ""He has acknowledged mistakes he has made,"" said Ms Bloom. ""He is reading books and going to therapy. He is an old dinosaur learning new ways."" But another Weinstein lawyer, Charles Harder, said in a separate statementto the Hollywood Reporter,externalthat his client was preparing to sue the New York Times. The attorney said the newspaper's report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"". The statement also said the report ""relies on mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report, apparently stolen from an employee personnel file, which has been debunked by 9 different eyewitnesses"". It did not specify which particular parts of the Times article were disputed. Mr Harder's statement said the New York Times had ignored the ""facts and evidence"" and any proceeds from the lawsuit would be donated to women's organisations. Mr Weinstein has been married since 2007 to London-born fashion designer Georgina Rose Chapman, and they have two children.

"The FDA's video about sleep positioners warns that ""all can be dangerous"" Some UK retailers have stopped selling baby sleep positioners amid concerns over their safety. A US health regulator said they ""can cause suffocation that can lead to death"" and have been linked to 12 infant deaths in the US. The positioners, aimed at infants under six months, are intended to keep a baby in a specific position while sleeping. Mothercare, John Lewis, eBay, Boots and Tesco have stopped sales, but they are still available from other retailers. The Lullaby Trust, a cot death charity which advises the NHS, told BBC News that there are hundreds of baby sleep products on the market - and ""parents assume that if something is for sale, it is safe to use"". Lullaby's Jenny Ward added: ""The age-old question that hasn't really changed is: how do I get my baby to sleep? ""And if there's a product that says: 'This will help your baby to sleep', it's obviously something that some parents will want to find out more about."" But she said the Trust recommends a firm, flat, waterproof mattress, in a clear cot free of pillows, toys, bumpers and sleep positioners, because the evidence shows that this reduces the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The Trust does not recommend wedges or sleep positioners - regardless of other potential benefits. If, for example, parents are worried about ""flat head syndrome"" from babies sleeping on their backs, there are techniques that can be used - such as supervised tummy time while they are awake - that will not increase the risk of SIDS. This video can not be played Here's how to put your baby to sleep safely The Food and Drug Administration in the USreleased a statement,externalon Wednesday explaining that the items - often called ""nests"" or ""anti-roll"" products - have caused some babies to suffocate after rolling from their sides to their stomachs. It said the two most common types of sleep positioners feature raised supports or pillows (called ""bolsters"") that are attached to each side of a mat, or a wedge to raise a baby's head. The FDA first issued a safety warning seven years ago, saying ""in light of the suffocation risk and the lack of evidence of any benefits, we are warning consumers to stop using these products"". There is no FDA equivalent in the UK, though the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is responsible for product safety policy, which is enforced by Trading Standards. A BEIS spokesman told the BBC: ""Manufacturers, distributors and retailers must ensure products meet the relevant safety requirements and be able to prove this is the case if asked, before the product is placed on the market."" Mothercare had been selling a sleep positioner for Â£39.99 but has told the BBC it is no longer for sale. It came with a warning that it should not be used once a baby was able to turn around on their own. Tesco, which sold sleep positioners on its website through a third party, said: ""We have removed these products from our website as a precautionary measure."" John Lewis, which had one sleep positioner for sale, the Cocoonababy Sleep Positioner, also said it was removing it as a ""precautionary measure"". The retailer said it was also removing the Cocoonababy Nest, a sleep pod, while it awaits ""further advice and reassurance from the supplier"". A spokesman for eBay said the website would be banning the sale of the products, adding: ""Our team will be informing sellers and removing any listings that contravene our policies."" Boots said it is removing the sale of all sleep positioner products ""whilst we investigate further with our suppliers"". Sleep positioners are however still available on other websites, including Amazon, which said it would not be commenting on the issue. A spokeswoman for Jo Jo Maman Bebe said it was still selling the products but was ""investigating the issue as a matter of urgency with our suppliers"". The Lullaby Trust said there is no need to use any type of equipment or rolled up blankets to keep a baby in one position, unless parents have been advised to do so by a health professional for a specific medical condition. It added: ""Babies are at higher risk of SIDS if they have their heads covered, and some items added to a cot may increase the risk of head-covering and can also increase the risk of accidents. ""We recommend that while evidence on individual products is not widely available, parents do not take any chances and stick to scientifically proven safer sleep guidelines"".

"Stranger Things has been a hit for Netflix Netflix has raised prices in countries including the UK and US for the first time in two years. The streaming video service will also increase subscription charges in some European countries, a spokeswoman said. A standard UK plan will rise 50p to Â£7.99 a month, while a premium subscription for four simultaneous users jumps Â£1 to Â£9.99 a month. The standard US plan increases by $1 to $10.99 a month, with a $2 rise to $13.99 for the premium option. A basic subscription in the UK, which does not offer high definition viewing, remains at Â£5.99 a month. The increases apply immediately for new customers, while existing users will be notified of the change 30 days in advance. Germany and France are among the other countries where prices will rise. Subscriptions were tweaked in Canada, Latin America and some Nordic countries earlier this year. Netflix said in July it has104 million subscribers globally, while revenues rose 32% in the second quarter to $2.8bn. Shares in Netflix closed 5.4% in New York, bringing the stock's gain this year to 56%. The price rises come as Netflix faces growing competition from Amazon and other sites such as Hulu in the US.

It also promises 40 feature films this year ranging from ""big-budget popcorn films to grassroots independent cinema"". One of those titles Mudbound, whichVariety,externaldescribes as ""an epic about race and poverty in the 1940s Mississippi Delta"", starring Mary J. Blige and Carey Mulligan. The film, which premiered at the Toronto film festival last month, is available to stream from 17 November - the same day it opens in some US cinemas.

"A 24-year-old secondary school teacher told the BBC she was shocked by the stories she heard from teenage pupils about their sexual activity. Herfrank accountprompted many readers to share their concerns. Catherine:I'm shocked by what I read. The exact thing happened to my 15-year-old daughter two years ago. The teacher could be talking about her experience. It was devastating. At the time she didn't realise what was happening to her. Two years on she does understand and she's very angry, but the damage is done. I'd like you to thank the teacher for speaking so boldly about a serious problem that needs addressing. Jayne:Wow. I'm in my 40s but so much of what you wrote hit home with me. No one taught me any of the things your teacher spoke about. My mum worked late nights in a factory. I didn't know I could and should say no. I did think it made me feel special. But it was crumby and lousy and I'm left years later thinking an otherwise idyllic childhood was shadowed and scarred somehow by crappy encounters with crappy boys. I feel shame for it - until I read your item - maybe I can be/should be kinder to my younger self. If only girls were taught their self worth. It's ok to say no. Shaun:Interesting article. I've just found out that my 14-year-old daughter has gone on the pill and is having sex with a boy one year older than her. I've tried talking to her and asking whether she has been pressurised into having sex but she says she's not. Kids (certainly my one) just want to be an adult but she's not, she's 14 and the media/friends/social network is dictating that she has to be sexually active. This is a con and she's now on the pill pumping hormones into her body unnecessarily. As a father all I can do (and have done) is ask her whether she is being pressured, is this what she wants to do and is she happy. Explaining that I cannot condone it, but I accept it, and that I am present and here if/when she wants to talk to me. Too many parents lose it with their daughters and push them away. Better to accept and be ready for the inevitable ""cry on my shoulders"" that I'll get when she realises she has made a mistake. Jade:I was in the same position and I understand where she is coming from but I still went with it. I regretted it once I got home and told my parents so I could get it off my shoulders. My parents helped me a lot. It is always good to tell someone if you regret something after. If it's going to be a weight on your shoulders, tell someone. I didn't say no, but I regret that because I haven't seen or heard from him since it happened and I know why. He didn't love me, he was only using me. Rachel:This teacher is three years younger than me and believes that 14-year-olds did not exhibit the behaviours she discusses in the article, when she was in school. This seems absolutely ridiculous to me. When I was 14, there were boys saying these things, and worse, every day. There was a ridiculous amount of pressure to be clean-shaven in school - and I didn't even have any sexual partners. Schoolgirls 'wear shorts under skirts' Sex education compulsory in schools Boys were always commenting on how girls looked; to the point where I was often ridiculed for having hair on my arms. Porn definitely shaped boys' opinions then, and it shapes boys' opinions now. But the blame can't all go to porn. Girls ""beauty"" magazines are to blame as well for these absurd expectations. Rachel, mother to two teenage boys:The article gives the impression that boys are predatory and incapable of understanding and regulating their own urges. I have found the opposite to be the case. I talk to my boys about respect, the pressure young women are under and that their desires are normal and healthy, but they should not expect these young women to meet those desires. They suffer the occasional feminist rant with good grace. I also leave a few art photography books, maybe a not too sexy underwear catalogue lying around. Images of happy healthy smiling girls, with pubic hair (of course). It might appear a little creepy, but in my opinion, as parents it would be foolish to bury our heads in the sand. Things are definitely not like when we were growing up and porn has a lot to do with that. Caitlin:This is so true and I cannot express how grateful I am to the teacher who wrote this article for starting this conversation. I'm 25 now. However, this article reflects exactly how the situation was when I was 14, 15, 16 and clearly nothing has changed. The sad thing is that these feelings and attitudes stay with you well past your early teen years. The quote ""almost like a validation of their appearance and attractiveness - or they think it is"" really rings true for me - not just at school but throughout my university life, and even in my early 20s I feel this has always been a huge reason I have felt the desire to sleep with men. Never for my own pleasure, but to boost my self-esteem and to validate that I was attractive to the opposite sex. An incredibly sad truth and one that I was only able to admit to myself very recently and, after speaking with friends about it, one which seems to be true among many bright and attractive young women. There really needs to be some radical reform in the way young people are taught about sex and what sex education is focused on. Otherwise I fear that this is something that we will see more and more within society. Holly:I was particularly struck by the topic of coercion among teenagers. I am very interested in this topic as I believe it is a monumental issue that exploded with the introduction of the internet, and actually massively affected me - among thousands of other girls - through my teenage years and even to this day. I currently work in a school and I am thinking about how we can help the current generation of young girls so they are as protected as possible from negative situations as outlined in your article. I believe so much more needs to be done in schools to educate girls about self-respect and empowerment and would like to develop a course that could be implemented in PSHE [personal, social, health and economic].

"Police said the security guard appears to have locked the door of the room before starting the fire Four children and a teacher have been killed in Brazil after a security guard threw flammable liquid on them and set them on fire, officials say. The man also set himself alight at the childcare centre in the remote town of Janauba in Minas Gerais state. Video footage showed chaotic scenes outside, as parents cried and panicked as the news broke. Twenty-five people, mostly children aged four and five, are being treated for burns in local hospitals. Some of the patients may still need to be airlifted to a specialised burns unit in the state capital, Belo Horizonte. Relatives and residents have gathered outside the local hospital in Janauba The mother of one of the victims, four-year-old Juan Miguel Soares Silva, told O Globo newspaper that she had been considering enrolling him in another nursery prior to the attack. ""We are about to move to a different neighbourhood,"" Jane Kelly da Silva Soares said. ""I woke up early to drop him at the nursery. When I saw him again he was already dead in hospital."" The security guard has been identified by police as Damiao Soares dos Santos, 50. He died in hospital of his wounds. The reasons for the attack are still being investigated. Local media has reported that he was dismissed after returning from annual leave last month with an alleged health condition. He went to the Gente Inocente childcare centre to hand in his medical certificate and then started the fire, O Globo newspaper reported. President Michel Temer tweeted: ""I'm very sorry about this tragedy involving children in Janauba. I want to express my sympathy to the families."" ""This must be a very, very painful loss,"" he added. The mayor of Janauba has declared seven days of mourning.

"A white picket fence, a good job, a nice car and a prosperous future for our kids - most of us have heard of the American Dream. But what about this side of the Atlantic? Theresa May promised to bring back the ""British Dream"" during herConservative Party Conference speech- or the idea that ""each generation should do better than the one before it"". She said her domestic servant grandmother, who has three professors and a prime minister as grandchildren, was proof the dream could be real, but admitted it felt ""distant"" and ""out of reach"" for many people today. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insisted Mrs May had set out a vision of ""how to renew"" the British Dream - but others watching the speech questioned what it was in the first place. ""The British Dream? What on earth is that? Never heard of it. What's in it? Unicorns?"" David Hendytweeted,external. Others began offering their own interpretations of the dream.

Despite the confusion, Mrs May is not the first politician to use the phrase. Former UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe, who grew up on a council estate in Moss Side in Manchester, previously claimed he was ""living proof"" of the British Dream. Hedescribed it as the chance to,external""succeed in your life, no matter your postcode, your gender or the colour of your skin"". It echoes the original idea behind the American Dream, which was coined by the writer James Truslow Adams in 1931. He described the ideal of a land where life was ""better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement"". Mr Johnson himself said in 2005, while editor of The Spectator and a shadow minister, that the UK had been ""hopeless"" at communicating any sense of a British Dream - compared with the Americans. ""We've all got to be as British as Carry On films and scotch eggs, and falling over on the beach while trying to change into your swimming trunks with a towel on,"" he wrote inthe Telegraph.,external Mr Johnson went on to say the first practical step was ensuring everyone in the UK speaks the same language. ""We should teach English, and we should teach in English. We should teach British history."" But Michael Howard, writing in theGuardian,externalshortly after the 7 July 2005 bombings in London, saw the dream differently. The success of fictional ballet dancer Billy Elliot has been likened to the British dream The then-Conservative Party leader thought it embodied the values of ""decency, tolerance and a sense of fair play"". ""We need to break down the barriers that exist in too many people's lives - and minds - that prevent or deter them from making a success of life,"" he said. He nevertheless agreed with Mr Johnson that ""no one"" talked about a British Dream as they do in America. Two years later, the academic Prof George Rodosthenous, a specialist in musical theatre, observed in ajournal article,externalthat the British Dream was ""a term which needs urgently a definition"". He was writing about the story of Billy Elliot - the fictional son of a coal miner who defies the odds to go to the Royal Ballet School in London - and defined it as ""the desire to do better than one's own parents, the forbidden desire to dream and the action of dreaming"". Professor Pamela Cox, social historian at the University of Essex, said the British Dream has come to stand for home ownership, having a secure job and a living standard higher than your parents. However, she believes it is ""not a phrase that rolls off the tongue like the American Dream"". Prof Cox said the one thing that holds back the British Dream is what she calls the ""British drawbridge"". ""Elites are very good at pulling up the drawbridge behind them - things such as private schools and an inflated housing market. ""The British elite don't have much interest in sharing spoils. It's very much about keeping it for themselves. ""The American Dream is much more 'anyone can make it'. The British Dream is a different version - there is not a willingness for everyone to make it."" PM struggles through interrupted speech Could May have fixed her croaky voice?

"Sgt Emile Cilliers denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers The wife of an Army sergeant who survived a 4,000ft fall after her husband allegedly tampered with her parachute was among the UK's top parachutists, a court has heard. Victoria Cilliers, 40, suffered multiple serious injuries at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire, on April 5, 2015. Emile Cilliers, 37, denies attempting to murder her. Winchester Crown Court heard Mrs Cilliers has completed more than 2,600 jumps. Prosecutors allege her ex-husband sabotaged both her main and reserve parachute by removing components. Mark Bayada, chief instructor of the Army Parachute Association at Netheravon, told the court Mrs Cilliers was ""in the top per cent of competency in the country"". He told jurors two vital components, known as slinks, were missing from Mrs Cillier's reserve chute. It is ""almost impossible"", he said, for the ""extremely strong"" components to come off by mistake. Mr Bayada said Mrs Cillier's main parachute was ""distorted, rotated and bunched up"". He said the parachute's lines were ""massively entangled"". It was ""highly unlikely"", he said, that user error ""would result in a malfunction with that much entanglement"". The only ""innocent explanation"" for the missing slinks, he said, was that medics had cut them away. The court was shown the various parachute parts But upon checking, he said, the only thing at the scene which first aiders had cut was Mrs Cilliers' goggles strap. Mr Bayada attributed Mrs Cilliers' survival to the relatively low height of her jump. Its ""sub terminal"" nature meant she had not reached full speed, he said. He also said her small size and ""exceptionally soft"" field had probably contributed to her survival too. Prosecutors alleged Mr Cilliers wanted to leave his wife for a lover he had met on Tinder. Alongside the allegation he tampered with his wife's parachutes, Mr Cilliers is also accused of deliberately causing a gas leak in the family home while he stayed away. He denies two counts of attempted murder. Mr Cilliers, who is based at the Royal Army Physical Training Corps in Aldershot, Hampshire, is also accused of a third charge of damaging a gas valve at their home in Amesbury, Wiltshire. The trial will resume on Friday.

"Are children turning to pornography to educate themselves about sex? Are boys coercing girls to do things they later regret? A 24-year-old secondary school teacher tells the BBC she's shocked by the stories she hears from her teenage pupils. ""The language boys use to discuss sex and sexual acts is degrading and shows a lack of understanding of consent and the actual mutual respect required to have meaningful sex. ""The girls, equally, are taught not to respect their own bodies and don't comprehend the notion that they may be being used. ""There was one time when one of the girls, who was 14, was really upset and said to me, 'I sucked his dick and he doesn't love me - he told me he loved me and he doesn't.' ""That was the main thing that made me think these girls are being used. 'I didn't say no, but I regret that' ""I don't think anyone can say a 14 or 16-year-old girl has performed these sex acts and enjoyed it - they just go along with it. ""They're going along with it at the time, it's almost like it's an honour that they're chosen, especially if it's a popular boy, almost like a validation of their appearance and attractiveness - or they think it is. ""I don't think these girls are aware of their vulnerability. I think these girls - 14 plus - will look back and think, 'Yeah, I was coerced into that.' ""They get themselves into a situation naively and then they're in too deeply. ""You need to make the girls realise they are being objectified and used and make them aware they are vulnerable to this sort of thing. ""It's their right to say 'no' and that nobody should feel peer-pressured. ""If a boy doesn't want a photo of you or 'get with you' as they say, you're not attractive. ""It's a very sad state of affairs to have girls empowered by how boys think of them. ""It's as bad not to have had a boy take a sexual interest in you, in a 15-year-old's view, as it is to be constantly asked for photos. ""I think the boys are quite clever, they tend to go for the ones who can be manipulated - not all boys obviously. ""I was on break time duty and I heard a boy say 'I put my hand in her pants and it was like a forest and I was quick out of there.' ""It's the accepted norm amongst the girls that you shave it all off - a totally unspoken rule. ""That's a porn thing, where every single woman has got no pubic hair - I don't think you can say it's not. ""And if they're shaving improperly down there, they are putting their health at risk, for example, if they're using an old razor or a used one, they can increase their risk of infection. ""Schools do teach sex education, but it's focused on contraception, how not to get pregnant. ""It's not about loving meaningful relationships or about consent - that's not really covered. ""They know a lot about STIs [sexually transmitted infections] and condoms but not a lot about the meaningful aspect. ""I honestly think you've got to teach these kids more than about contraception. ""It needs a revolution. They need specialists coming in - teachers can see PHSE [personal, social, health and economic education] as a bit of an extra, they're certainly not specialists in it, it's an extra lesson or 20 minutes in form. ""A lot of teachers don't feel confident talking about these things. ""We're setting them up to go on to a porn website to learn about sex. I don't think they're going on there to get kicks, but to learn about sex and that obviously feeds into a whole societal thing. ""When I was at school there were problems with webcams and sex chats and msn messenger. ""But I can't remember boys talking about girls like this. ""I really don't know why it's spiralled. ""I think we can blame a lot of things on the porn industry, we can blame social media and the ease of access. ""But they're an infected generation that no longer sees the gravitas of sex.""

"Girls at Benenden School took part in a voluntary three-day ""phone-fast"" Almost two-thirds of schoolchildren would not mind if social media had never been invented, research suggests. A survey of almost 5,000 students, mainly aged between 14 and 16, found a growing backlash against social media - with even more pupils (71%) admitting to taking digital detoxes to escape it. Benenden, an independent girls boarding school in Kent, told BBC News that its pupils set up a three-day ""phone-fast"". Some girls found fears of being offline were replaced by feelings of relief. Sixth former Isobel Webster, 17, said: ""There's a feeling that you have to go on Instagram, or whatever [site], to see what everyone's doing - sometimes everyone's talking about something and you feel like you have to look at it too"". Prefects at Benenden set up a temporary ban on mobile phones and social media in March, after concerns that younger pupils were spending too much time on their phones in their rooms. Headmistress Samantha Price said: ""In the run-up I was worried about how the girls would cope, but afterwards they were wondering what all the fuss had been about and said we should do it again - but for even longer next time, which I found incredibly reassuring"". Isobel said that the ban stopped her from sitting in her room scrolling through social media The survey of state and independent schools in England, by the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) and Digital Awareness UK, found that 57% of young people had received online abuse and 52% said it makes them feel less confident about themselves. Some 60% thought that their friends show a fake version of themselves on social media. Chris King, chair of the HMC and Headmaster of Leicester Grammar School, said the findings were among ""the first indications of a rebellion against social media"". He said they remind us that teenagers ""may need help to take breaks from [social media's] constant demands"". Some 56% of those surveyed said they were on the edge of addiction. Pandora Mann said people realised they ""don't enjoy their phones"" as much as they thought At Benenden, the girls' phones are taken away from them during lesson time but given back during lunch breaks and in the evenings. One Year 10 pupil, Pandora Mann, 14, said she was a bit annoyed at the phone-fast initially, but soon realised ""we don't enjoy our phones as much as we think we do"". ""In terms of the way we view ourselves and our lives negatively,"" she explained, ""I think people put what they see as their best image forward - it's not always the real image."" Isobel said that the ban stopped her from sitting in her room scrolling through social media and encouraged her to spend her work breaks chatting to friends. She said it reminded her ""what it was like before"" - when as a Year 7 (aged 12) she would spend more time socialising in person. The feedback in the HMC survey was not wholly negative, with students identifying memes, filters/lenses and storytelling features, such as Snapchat Stories, among the things they like. Flora Macpherson uses social media for message groups Sixth former Flora Macpherson, 17, was surprised at just how many teenagers surveyed said they would rather social media did not exist. For her, the most annoying thing about not having access to it was being unable to message groups of people. Flora said: ""I use it for the logistics - for extra sport practice, if we've got a big match on - we've got message groups for the firsts and seconds netball and lacrosse teams"". The school still has notice boards, but its pupils rely heavily on messenger groups. Isobel said she has a Facebook messenger group for every subject. ""If you have a question, normally at least one person will see it within 10 minutes,"" she said.

"This video can not be played 'It was the scariest moment in my life' The gunman behind Sunday night's mass shooting in Las Vegas planned to flee, and he may have had help with planning the massacre, officials suspect. Stephen Paddock was ""living a secret life, much of which would never be fully understood"", Sheriff Joe Lombardo told reporters. The gunman's girlfriendsaid she had no ideawhat he was plotting. Paddock's motive for killing 58 people in the largest mass shooting in modern US history remains a mystery. Police found the 64-year-old former accountant dead in a room on the 32nd floor of a hotel after he sprayed bullets on concert-goers below, injuring hundreds. He apparently turned one of his many guns on himself as police closed in. This video can not be played After the Las Vegas attack in October 2017 the BBC looked at how US mass shootings are getting worse In a press conference on Wednesday, Clark County Sheriff Lombardo was asked if he saw evidence that Paddock had planned to escape after the attack. The sheriff said ""yes"". Asked what it was, he said: ""I can't tell you."" Republicans open to ban on gun device Sheriff Lombardo was asked by a reporter if he thought Paddock had carried out the attack alone. ""You've got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point,"" the sheriff replied. ""Maybe he's a super guy, maybe he was working out all this on his own, but it would be hard for me to believe that."" The possibility that Paddock could have had an accomplice is a twist in the investigation. Living with a monster They died in each other's arms Las Vegas urges Trump to act In the aftermath of the shooting officials described him as ""a lone wolf"" and said he was ""solely responsible for this heinous act"". The FBI's Aaron Rouse said no link to terrorism had been found so far, but they would not discard the possibility. This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Las Vegas As traffic files past on a busy Thursday morning, a large purple billboard, advertising the Route 91 Harvest Festival, can be seen above. Behind it, the stage with the lighting rig is also in view. The scene of Sunday's massacre appears almost untouched - as you gaze across the busy highway two broken windows on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel break up the otherwise smooth gold facade of the building. It is hard to even imagine how gunfire could have travelled so far - from such a great height and distance - on innocent concertgoers. The hotel itself has reopened - a queue of people wait to check in at the marble counters, others sit at slot machines doing what people do best here. Outside on the boulevard, a makeshift memorial is growing in size as people bring candles, flowers and photos, and write messages of love with chalk. The motto of this city is ""What goes on here, stays here"" - that mantra rings true now. The tragedy of Sunday night will never be forgotten, but people are resilient, and determined to move on. Police are investigating whether the mass murderer originally planned to target other music festivals. Chicago police said they were looking into reports that Paddock booked a hotel room in August overlooking the Lollapalooza music festival in the Illinois city. Former President Barack Obama's daughters were among the thousands of revellers. It has also emerged that a week before his massacre, Paddock booked into a central Las Vegas apartment. It was in a high-rise tower overlooking another open-air concert, Life is Beautiful, where acts included Muse, Lorde and Chance the Rapper. The sheriff said more than 100 investigators had been combing through ""disturbed and dangerous"" Paddock's life. Some 33 of the 47 weapons the suspect owned were bought in the past year. Paddock - who was gambling just hours before he began shooting - had set up cameras both inside and outside the Mandalay Bay Hotel suite to see anyone approaching the room, police said. Photos of his hotel suitepublished by Boston 25,external, a TV news station, showed gun littered around the floor. Sheriff Lombardo added: ""Anything that would indicate this individual's trigger point and that would cause him to do such harm, we haven't understood it yet."" Marilou Danley, who was out of the country at the time of the shooting, has been described by US authorities as a ""person of interest"". She voluntarily flew back to Los Angeles from the Philippines on Tuesday night to speak to the FBI. Two weeks ago, she said Paddock surprised her with a plane ticket to visit her family in the South East Asian country. Paddock ""never said anything to me or took any action"" which she understood as a warning of what was to come, she said in a statement read by her lawyer. Ms Danley added: ""I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together."" Â· Tales of heroism emerge from Las Vegas 'Pandemonium' on the Strip How Vegas gunman sped rifles' fire rate While she was in the Philippines, he wired her $100,000 (Â£75,400), saying it was to buy a house. ""I was grateful, but honestly I was worried it was a way for him to break up with me,"" she said. ""It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone."" Her sister earlier told Australian outlet7News,externalthat Ms Danley ""was sent away... so that she will not be there to interfere with what he's planning"". Paddock checked into a suite in the Mandalay Bay Hotel on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents.

Particularly bad US mass shootings typically spark renewed calls for gun control measures, which tend to falter as the public horror fades and the lobbying might of the National Rifle Association is brought to bear on Congress. Butsome Republicans have said they might be opento the idea of banning a fully legal firearms accessory used by Paddock to such deadly effect.

"Film producer Harvey Weinstein has issued an apology as a newspaper reported a number of sexual harassment allegations against him. ""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it,"" said the movie mogul's statement. But he later disputed a New York Times report that claimed he harassed female employees over nearly three decades. The newspaper reported he had reached at least eight settlements with women. Mr Weinstein, a married father-of-five, said he planned to take a leave of absence from his company and had hired therapists to deal with his issue. ""My journey now will be to learn about myself and conquer my demons,"" the 65-year-old's statement on Thursday said. Weinstein is married to English fashion designer Georgina Chapman ""I so respect all women and regret what happened,"" he added in the statement initially given to the New York Times, and later sent to the BBC. It continued: ""I cannot be more remorseful about the people I hurt and I plan to do right by all of them."" The Miramax and Weinstein Company co-founder has produced a number of Oscar-winning blockbusters, including Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and The Artist. Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said in another statement that he denies many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"". She also said that as a women's rights advocate she had been blunt with him that some of his conduct ""can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating"". ""He has acknowledged mistakes he has made,"" said Ms Bloom. ""He is reading books and going to therapy. He is an old dinosaur learning new ways."" But another Weinstein lawyer, Charles Harder, said in a separate statementto the Hollywood Reporter,externalthat his client was preparing to sue the New York Times. The attorney said the newspaper's report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"". The statement also said the report ""relies on mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report, apparently stolen from an employee personnel file, which has been debunked by 9 different eyewitnesses"". It did not specify which particular parts of the Times article were disputed. Mr Harder's statement said the New York Times had ignored the ""facts and evidence"" and any proceeds from the lawsuit would be donated to women's organisations. Mr Weinstein has been married since 2007 to London-born fashion designer Georgina Rose Chapman, and they have two children.

"Pro-independence demonstrations have continued, following Sunday's referendum Spain's Constitutional Court has suspended next Monday's session of the Catalan parliament, in a bid to pre-empt a possible push for independence. The court said such a move would be ""a breach of the constitution"". Earlier Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy warned Catalonia's regional government against declaring independence after a disputed vote last Sunday. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont had indicated that he could make such a declaration at next week's session. The court's ruling on Thursday upheld a challenge not from the government in Madrid, but by the Socialists' Party of Catalonia, which opposes secession from Spain. Allowing the regional parliament to meet and declare independence, the court said, would violate the rights of the party's MPs. An earlier ruling by the court aimed at stopping Sunday's vote was ignored by Catalonia's leaders. That challenge to the court had come from Spain's government, which condemned the referendum as illegal. The socialists won almost 13% of the vote in the 2015 election, and has 13 MPs in the 135-seat regional parliament. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold Organisers of Sunday's vote put the turnout at 42%, with 2.2 million people taking part. They say 90% voted for independence, however they have not published final results. There have been several claims of irregularities. There was violence at polling stations as police, trying to enforce a Spanish court decision to ban the vote, attempted to seize ballot boxes and disperse voters. Carles Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain Divided loyalties: The couples at odds over independence Analysis: Biggest crisis for a generation Could Catalonia make a success of independence? 1 October: Catalonia holds banned referendum on independence, defying Spanish government and a Constitutional Court ruling; Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont says the independence camp has won. 2 October: The European Commission says it regards the referendum as illegal andan independent Catalonia would be outside the EU,external. 3 October: In a TV address, King Felipe said referendum organisers had showed their ""disrespect to the powers of the state""and broken the rule of law. 4 October: Mr Puigdemont says a declaration of independence will come within days; the government says it will not give in to""blackmail"" 5 October: Spanish PM  Mariano Rajoy urges Catalan leaders not to declare independence. Constitutional Court bans session of Catalan parliament due on Monday. Also on Thursday, Sabadell, a major bank, decided to transfer its legally registered base from Barcelona to the south-eastern Spanish city of Alicante. Its HQ and workforce will remain in Barcelona. Catalan bank moves legal HQ CaixaBank, another large Barcelona-based institution, is reported to be considering a similar move. This would ensure the banks remained within the eurozone and under the supervision of the European Central Bank. The captain of Barcelona Football Club, Andres Iniesta, appealed for dialogue. ""Do it for all of us. We deserve to live in peace,"" the 33-year-old saidin a Facebook post,external. Analysis by BBC Europe Editor Katya Adler, Madrid Mariano Rajoy is famous for his ""wait-and-see"" attitude in crises. He's more of a technocrat than a passionate politician. So far, it's served him well. While not wildly popular, he remains very much in control of Spain's central government. But the Catalan question is risky for him. His apparent inertia this week is coming under fire from the Spanish left - who want him to start a dialogue with Catalan separatists - and the harder right who want him to take immediate action, shutting the Catalan government down, bringing the reins of power back to Madrid. Spaniards call it ""the nuclear option"". In a nod to them on Thursday, Mr Rajoy warned of ""greater damage"" if Catalan separatists went ahead with a unilateral declaration of independence. Spain's constitutional court has now banned Monday's meeting of the Catalan parliament where that declaration was expected to be made. While this may appear a setback for the separatists, they have ignored court rulings before. But Mr Rajoy hopes the weight of Spanish law will now serve to divide Catalonia's pro-independence parties - which range from the moderate to the radical - and weaken their resolve.

"This video can not be played Kazuo Ishiguro talks to BBC arts editor Will Gompertz ""How should a Nobel laureate dress?"" asked Kazuo Ishiguro, who, 40 minutes earlier, had found out he had won the Nobel Prize for Literature. To say the news was unexpected is an understatement. He literally couldn't believe it. Until, that was, his phone began to ring constantly, an orderly queue of TV crews started to form outside his front door (""how do they all know where I live?""), and his publishers dispatched a top team to his house as back-up. This was not fake news. This was delightful, surprising news. Maybe there were others who should have won instead, he wondered. ""But that is the nature of prizes. They are a lottery."" While chaos reigned around him, he was calm, assured and thoughtful, talking (after nipping upstairs to fetch a smart jacket for our interview) about his belief in the power of stories and how those that he wrote would often explore wasted lives and opportunities. TV crews and reporters flocked to Ishiguro's London home ""I've always had a faith that it should be possible, if you tell stories in a certain way, to transcend barriers of race, class and ethnicity."" For me, he is one of the great living writers working in any language. All writers can tell stories. Ishiguro tells stories on another level. He places the reader in some sort of alternative reality - which might be the future, it might be the present, it might be the past. They feel like places that are whole and real, but you don't know them. They're weird and not necessarily happy places. But they're places that you can inhabit and relate to, and you become deeply involved with the characters. That's the writer's job - he just does it better than most. Kazuo Ishiguro held an audience with reporters in his garden Growing up in England in a Japanese household was crucial to his writing, he says, enabling him to see things from a different perspective to many of his British peers. It is most obvious in the slightly detached nature of many of his narrators, which he explains as coming from ""a long tradition in Japanese art towards a surface calm and surface restraint. There is a felling emotions can feel more intense if they are held down to the surface level"". There was nothing superficial about his emotions when we met earlier today. He was chuffed to bits, and rightly so. Kazuo Ishiguro is worthy recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

"The 2017 Nobel season is still under way, with the prizes for peace, and economics yet to be announced. But for the sciences, this year's work is done and many in the scientific community are noticing some similarities about the winners. In the case of physics, the winning discovery had already been making global headlines. The prize was shared by three researchers for the groundbreaking 2015detection of gravitational waves. For chemistry, the committee recognised the less publicised work of developing anew microscopy technique, which the Nobel committee said had ""moved biochemistry into a new era"". For physiology or medicine, a team who uncovered abetter understanding our body clockswas honoured.

Some researchers on Twitter took issue with the current criteria for awarding the Nobel. Each prize cannot be shared by more than three people, laureates are not nominated posthumously, and nomination lists are kept confidential for 50 years. Vera Rubin, Lise Meitner and Jocelyn Bell Burnell were all cited as worthy potential recipients of a prize in previous years. Rubin's death in 2016 means that her work on dark matter, believed to occupy most of the mass in the universe, is now ineligible for recognition. Meitner's long-term collaborator Otto Hahn was awarded the chemistry prize for nuclear fission in 1944, which she did not share, despite being nominated in previous and subsequent years. Burnell and Chien-Shiung Wu, both physicists, also saw their colleagues win for research they had worked on, but were not included. Allow Twitter content?

Given the lifelong prestige of becoming a Nobel laureate, the prize is a significant boost to any researcher's career. The acclaim can legitimise a life's work, and yield international notoriety in a field where funding is highly competitive. Yet for women in physics and chemistry, there are few forerunners to aspire to. Medicine does only slightly better, with 12 female laureates. Other prizes such as literature often fare better in terms of gender equality, with previous winners including Alice Munroe, Doris Lessing and Toni Morrison. This year the literature prize has gone to a Japanese-British male author -Kazuo Ishiguro. While equality initiatives likeAthena Swan,externaland organisations likeStemettes,externalwork to promote and encourage women, the Nobels remain the most prominent glass ceiling in the world of science. As part of this year's 100 Women Challenge, a team in Silicon Valley, where women hold just one in 10 senior positions, will be looking atways to tackle the glass ceiling.

"Mr Puigdemont is not the first Catalan leader forced to leave the region Catalonia's sacked President Carles Puigdemont has spearheaded the region's peaceful drive for independence from Spain. In defiance of the law and Spain's constitution, he has pushed forward in the hope of international recognition. But his zeal for secession has put him on a collision course with Spain's authorities, which outlawed the independence referendum held in Catalonia on 1 October. After imposing direct rule, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called a snap Catalan election. But the result on 21 December was bad news for Madrid.The separatists won a slim majority, even though a pro-unity party came top. Catalan crisis in 300 words ""[Rajoy] has only demonstrated a greater mobilisation of Catalans, greater votes,"" Mr Puigdemont said, calling for negotiations with the Spanish PM. He was speaking in Brussels, having fled there with four ministers after declaring independence. The election result proved that his campaigning via videolink from Brussels had worked. But the village baker's son from Girona faces the weight of Spanish law if he returns to Spain. The separatist leaders are accused of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Born in Amer in 1962, Carles Puigdemont grew up under the dictatorship of Gen Francisco Franco and was taught in Spanish at a Church-run boarding school, but spoke Catalan at home like others of his generation. Joan Matamala, a few years his senior at the school, remembers the boy everyone got on with, even the older pupils. Bookseller Joan Matamala went to school with Carles Puigdemont Mr Matamala runs a bookshop, Les Voltes, that has been promoting Catalan language and culture in Girona for 50 years. The young Mr Puigdemont did not come over as a natural leader at the time, but he was someone you did not forget, he says. ""Despite the difference in age, he was a role model for others,"" Mr Matamala remembers. As a young man, Mr Puigdemont had a passion for his native tongue, going on to study Catalan philology at the local university and polishing colleagues' copy when he first found work at the city's newspapers. Miquel Riera worked with him, often late into the night, at the fiercely pro-independence paper now known as El Punt Avui. Miquel Riera worked with Carles Puigdemont at the pro-independence newspaper now known as El Punt Avui ""Right from the start he was very interested in new technology and the internet,"" says Mr Riera. This may have fed Mr Puigdemont's awareness of social media, which was crucial in promoting the referendum campaign. ""He's a man who makes friends easily and remembers them,"" says Mr Riera, whose 25-year-old son, he says, was bruised on the chest by a police rifle butt at a polling station at the 1 October referendum. Mr Puigdemont served as mayor of Girona from 2011 until 2016 when he was elected regional president of Catalonia. There is no denying his star appeal among his supporters, who clamour to take selfies with him at rallies and avidly follow his social media accounts, which he curates himself. ""Mr Puigdemont has been absolutely key to bringing Catalonia to where we are now,"" said Montse Daban, international chairperson of the Catalan National Assembly, a grassroots pro-independence movement. ""An absolute and positive surprise for Catalan citizens"" - Montse Daban describing the impact of Puigdemont But in the eyes of Spain's government, the Catalan leader has ruthlessly created a crisis, burning all the bridges in order to make a unilateral declaration of independence. ""Democracy is not about voting - there are referenda in dictatorships too,"" a Madrid government source told the BBC. ""Only when you vote with guarantees according to the law is it a democracy."" Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? Images of violence at the polling stations in October's banned referendum caused an international outcry. But the source said this was ""150% part of Puigdemont's plan"". ""It's unfortunate because it was a trap. There's no doubt it looks bad for the Spanish government."" Mr Puigdemont talks the language of independence in a way his more cautious predecessor, Artur Mas, did not during the dry-run referendum of 2014, which was also banned by Madrid. Speaking to the BBC after the 1 October referendum, Mr Puigdemont said: ""I think we've won the right to be heard, but what I find harder to understand is this indifference - or absolute lack of interest - in understanding what is happening here. They've never wanted to listen to us. This video can not be played Police were filmed violently tackling voters and appearing to pull a woman by her hair ""How can we explain to the world that Europe is a paradise of democracy if we hit old women and people who've done nothing wrong? This is not acceptable. We haven't seen such a disproportionate and brutal use of force since the death of the dictator Franco."" He calls for mediation - something the Spanish government says is unacceptable. A Madrid source dismissed the idea, telling the BBC it would be ""mediation between the Spanish government and part of the Spanish state"". This video can not be played People expressed mixed views on Mr Puigdemont's actions From Brussels, Mr Puigdemont has watched ashis Catalan allies back home have been placed in Spanish custody to face trial. He has been mocked by some for not going to Madrid along with them and placing himself in the hands of Spanish justice. One cartoon apparently being circulated on the Whatsapp messaging app shows him, with his distinctive mop of hair and glasses, hiding out in a box of Belgian chocolates. Allow Twitter content?

"The 4,500-acre (seven-sq-mile) Inner Hebridean island of Ulva was put up for sale over the summer A beautiful, remote Scottish island is up for sale - but can the local community raise the money to buy it for themselves? Emma Jane Kirby writes from Ulva. The problem with Ulva is that once you get on to the 4,500-acre (seven-sq-mile) Inner Hebridean island, you really don't ever want to get off it. The unexpected autumn sunshine is showcasing the rusty browns and mossy greens of its landscape as a true bucolic idyll, and the dark sea, which follows the contours of its dramatic coastline, inspires childish thoughts of escape and adventure. Donald Munro, the island's ferryman tugs the brim of his hat down a little over his eyes when I tell him this. ""And how many others feel the way you do?"" he smiles. ""How many others with Â£4.25m to spend? But this is our home... we have roots here."" For Donald Munro, the island's ferryman, Ulva is his home Over the summer, Ulva was put up for sale. Billed as the ultimate private getaway, the island has drawn attention from wealthy individuals from all over the world. Rumours flip and fly across the narrow strait of water that separates it from the Isle of Mull - someone has heard a sheikh is keen, another fears Russian oligarchs, there are whispers of a professional footballer wanting his very own millionaire's playground. ""It's not really about who the buyer is,"" explains my tour guide for the day, John Addy, who lives on neighbouring Mull. ""It's about what that buyer wants to do with this island. The buyer could really want to regenerate this island; that would be great - or the buyer could just want it as a plaything. That's why we are putting in a bid for a community buyout - to protect the people from an absentee landlord."" John Addy has put in a bid for a community buyout of Ulva and hopes to develop and repopulate the island John is a director of the North West Mull Community Woodland Company Ltd, a community body, affectionately known as The Woodies, which has applied to the Scottish government to exercise the community right to buy, created by the land reform legislation, which gives communities the opportunity to try to buy land themselves if it comes up for sale. The Woodies, set up in 2006, have already successfully taken over acres of forests on Mull from the Forestry Commission Scotland. In Ulva they have plans to repopulate the island by increasing economic activity and the housing stock, building new affordable homes and developing farming, fishing, and even crofting. ""Just look at the potential here,"" says John, as we stop in front of an information board that boasts of the island's red deer, sea eagles, otters and dolphins. The community group would like to transform derelict cottages into hostels and B&Bs ""Can't you just imagine the tourism potential if we won our bid and were allowed to develop and restore and repopulate this place?"" We walk past some rundown farm buildings and some fairytale but derelict cottages the community group would like to transform into hostels and B&Bs. At the moment, wild camping is the only way to stay overnight as a visitor on the island. ""All that would change with the community buyout,"" says John. ""We're even thinking of electric cars."" Two hundred years ago, more than 500 people lived here. Today, only six call Ulva their home. They rent their homes from the current owner, Jamie Howard, who is resident on the island and whose family have owned Ulva for over 70 years. If The Woodies don't succeed in their community buyout, and the island is put back on the market for private sale, the residents fear that a new owner may not want tenants on their land. Barry George has been an Ulva resident for 21 years but fears a new owner could shut the island down ""I have nowhere else to go,"" says Barry George as he harvests vegetables from his beautiful island garden. Barry, who used to work on the local fish farms, has been an Ulva resident for 21 years. ""This is all I've got,"" he says. ""A new owner could shut our island down - when you buy the island, you also buy the piers - so we could be cut off and told to go."" It is possible that the Scottish government could refuse to consider North West Mull Community Woodland Company's buyout bid as the application came in late, but for now The Woodies' action has caused the private sale to be put on hold. If the bid is registered, the group would then have about eight months to come up with a viable economic plan, and the necessary funding, to meet whatever eventual sale price was set by the government. Ulva is not the first Scottish island to attempt a community buyout - in 1997,the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust successfully took ownership of the Isle of Eigg, meeting the sale price of  Â£1.5m through a series of grants and a major fundraising campaign. John Addy is confident the money needed to buy Ulva could also be raised through grants and crowdfunding. The fifth Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie, known as the Father of Australia, was an Ulva man, and there have already been encouraging noises from down under. The owner of this seafood cafe believes the community are the best people to run Ulva As she opens oysters for the hungry day-trippers at the thriving seafood cafe she runs with her sister-in-law, 30-year-old Rebecca Munro tells me that living on Ulva with her fisherman husband and bringing up their two young children here is ""exceptionally special"". Since the announcement that the island was up for sale however, she admits to sleepless nights. Rebecca is passionate about the community buyout and adamant that if Ulva was community-owned, it would be easy to repopulate the island because people would feel secure. ""This is about securing opportunities and our future,"" she says, wiping lemon juice from her hands on to her apron. ""Surely it's obvious that the community are the best people to run this place. ""Why would the people who live here and care about this place not be the best placed people to take over?"" As he ferries me back to Mull in his small boat, Rebecca's father-in-law Donald waves away my question about what would happen to his livelihood if the community buyout failed and a new owner decided to shut access to Ulva. ""Let's not talk about that,"" he says gruffly. He turns his head to look at Ulva's retreating and stunning coastline. ""It's a beautiful day, isn't it?"" he says.

"This video can not be played Ashraf Ghani: ""Now in terms of management and leadership things are really falling into place"" President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan makes no bones about the challenges facing his country when we sit down for an exclusive BBC interview in his palace in Kabul. ""This is the worst job on Earth,"" he tells me. And it is true there are no shortage of tough issues facing Afghanistan. The most obvious is security. His country has been at war for almost 16 years now. Yet the Afghan president is surprisingly bullish about how long the country will continue to require the support of Nato. Nato troops, he says, will be able to pull out ""within four years"". Many military analysts will consider that optimistic given that it is only three years since the Nato combat mission ended and the Afghan military took responsibility for the battle against the Taliban and other insurgent groups. About 14,000 Nato troops remain in the country to ""train, advise and assist"" Afghan forces. The aim is to strengthen them so they can take the battle to the Taliban. The president says the Afghan National Army is prevailing against the Taliban Mr Ghani doesn't deny it has been a difficult three years. ""We were like 12-year-olds taking on the responsibility of a 30-year-old; but we really grew in the process. Now in terms of management and leadership things are really falling into place."" He continues: ""Within four years, we think our security forces would be able to do the constitutional thing, which is the claim of legitimate monopoly of power."" He expects that some foreign troops will remain in Afghanistan after that period as part of the global fight against terrorism but, when I ask whether he is saying Afghan forces have turned the corner in the fight against the Taliban, there is no hesitation: ""Yes,"" he says. Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? Four days behind the Taliban front line Horror at the military hospital The new 'Great Game' in Afghanistan The Taliban, he says, had two strategic aims: to overthrow the government or to create two ""political geographies"", by which he means whole areas of the country where it holds sway. ""It has failed miserably in both of these aims,"" Mr Ghani believes. Whether that is true is debatable. The latest figures from the US military show that theAfghan government controls less than two-thirds of the country,external. The rest is either controlled or contested by the Taliban and other militant groups. What is more, last year Afghanistan lost some 10% of its entire fighting force: about 7,000 Afghan National Army soldiers were killed, another 12,000 were injured, and many thousands more deserted. One reason the Afghan president is so confident is that he believes that the West does not really understand the real nature of the conflict. His government is not fighting a civil war, he argues, but a drug war. The US has announced that some of its forces will stay in Afghanistan indefinitely ""Taliban is the largest exporters of heroin to the world. Why is the world not focusing on heroin? Is this an ideological war or is this a drug war?"" asks Mr Ghani. ""This criminalisation of the economy needs to be addressed."" So what is the ultimate aim, I ask. ""A peace agreement with the Taliban,"" he answers without a breath. ""The whole aim of the strategy is to provide the ground for political solution and a political solution is a negotiated solution. It's imperative that the people are given a chance to live their lives. We have been denied breathing space for 40 years, and in an immense tribute to our people for their resilience, any other state would've been completely broken."" Mr Ghani is full of praise for US President Donald Trump, who finally announced last month that his government was ready to stay in Afghanistan indefinitely. Withdrawal, said Mr Trump, would be determined by ""conditions on the ground and not arbitrary timetables"". The US president also said he would send a few thousand more troops to support the current Nato mission.  In return, Mr Ghani says he plans a complete overhaul of the Afghan government, including redoubled efforts to crack down on corruption. ""The first principle of tackling corruption,"" he tells me, ""is that you do not engage in it and you have the will to confront it. Whoever engages in corruption, regardless of affiliation, relationship etc, must be subject to the same law."" ""A three-star general that I have promoted is now in prison because it was demonstrated that fuel was being stolen,"" he boasts. ""One of the richest men in the country that people thought was untouchable is now in prison. You can ask anyone in the judiciary, I provide full political support."" The Afghan president's message is clear: ""Self-reliance is not just words, but deeds."" And, with two years to go before a general election, he says he doesn't care if the price of his reform efforts is his presidency. ""If election is your goal, you're never going to engage in reform. Reform has to be your goal. Election is the means. You run for office in order to do something, not in order to perpetuate yourself. Politicians have become extraordinarily conservative, but our times require imagination and bold action.""

"Royal Mail workers are set to strike for 48 hours from 19 October in a dispute over pensions, pay and jobs. The Communication Workers Union said it had told the Royal Mail Group that 111,000 postal workers will walk out. The industrial action follows the 89.1% vote in favour of a strike announced by the union on Thursday. Royal Mail said it will use all legal options, including applying for a High Court injunction, to prevent industrial action. The FTSE 250-listed company called for further talks with the CWU, adding: ""We believe any strike action before the dispute resolution procedures have been followed would be unlawful."" The union said the company's move to replace the pension scheme meant its members would lose up to a third of their retirement entitlements. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said it was a ""watershed dispute"" that would determine the future of the postal service. ""We are determined to take whatever steps are necessary to deliver an agreement that will protect and enhance our member's terms and conditions and improve the range of services on offer to customers,"" he said. The CWU vote, which had a 73.7% turnout, is the first major ballot since the introduction of the Trade Union Act, which requires a 50% turnout. The union did not rule out further strike action in addition to the 48-hour walkout later this month. CWU deputy general secretary Terry Pullinger said it had been in negotiations with the company for 18 months. ""Royal Mail Group management have clearly moved away from the spirit and intent of our agreements and the empty promises of privatisation, and have suffered a huge vote of no confidence from their employees and CWU members as a consequence,"" he said.

"Congress' most powerful Republican says lawmakers should examine ""bump-stocks"", a rapid-fire accessory used by the gunman in Sunday's Las Vegas massacre. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told a radio talk show: ""Clearly that's something we need to look into."" Texas Senator John Cornyn - the number two Republican in the Senate - has called for hearings into the devices. A bump-stock attaches to the butt of a rifle, allowing the weapon to fire close to the rate of a machine gun. Stephen Paddock, the gunman in Las Vegas, had fixed the accessories to 12 rifles. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBCNorth America reporter It appears a move to ban bump-stock devices is picking up steam in Congress. Some normally staunch gun-control opponents seem willing to consider new legislation. The NRA, which opposes just about any new regulations, has gone silent. That's going to change soon. The challenge for gun rights supporters is a bump-stock ban opens the door for a new debate about where to draw the line over limiting a firearm's lethality. For decades it's been at how many bullets can be fired with one trigger pull. Bump-stocks blur that line. Can you outlaw a device that helps squeeze off rounds more quickly but not think about prohibiting quick-change magazines or limiting their sizes? Or banning pistol grips, which make firing easier? It won't take many Republicans, with the NRA looking over their shoulder, to grind the process to a halt. Five reasons US gun control won't happen ""I didn't even know what they were until this week,"" Mr Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, said on Thursday of bump-stocks. He told talk show host Hugh Hewitt: ""I think we're quickly coming up to speed with what this is."" For years Republicans in Congress, as well as conservative Democrats, have blocked gun control efforts in the wake of violent tragedies. But now a liberal Democratic gun control measure appears to have found a receptive audience across the aisle. Senator Cornyn said on Wednesday: ""It strikes me as odd that it's illegal to convert a semi-automatic weapon to an automatic weapon, but apparently these bump-stocks are not illegal under the current law. ""I own a lot of guns. As a hunter and sportsman, I think that's our right as Americans. ""But I don't understand the use of this bump-stock."" He said his colleagues should hold hearings to discuss the legality of the devices. In the last five years lawmakers have proposed more than 100 gun control measures - not one of them has become law,report CBS News,external Republicans blocked a measure that would have limited the bullet capacity in gun magazines after 32 were shot dead at Virginia Tech university massacre in 2007 Efforts to expand background checks on gun sales and reinstate a Clinton-era ban on so-called assault weapons failed after 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting Congress rejected a bill aiming to stop suspected terrorists from legally buying guns after 14 people died in San Bernadino, California, in 2015 Efforts to expand background checks failed again after 49 died at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 Congressman Mark Meadows, who leads the hardline conservative Freedom Caucus, also said that he would be open to a hearing. Since Congress passed the Firearm Owners' Protection Act in 1986, it has been relatively difficult for civilians to buy new, fully automatic weapons, which reload automatically and fire continuously as long as the trigger is pulled. Bump-fire stocks, also called bump-stocks and slide-fire adapters, allow semi-automatic rifles to fire at a high rate, similar to a machine gun. This video can not be played After the Las Vegas attack in October 2017 the BBC looked at how US mass shootings are getting worse But the accessories can be obtained without the extensive background checks required of automatic weapons. They typically cost less than $200 (Â£150) and allow nearly 100 high-velocity bullets to be fired in just seven seconds, according to one company advert. One of the most popular manufacturers of bump-stocks, Slide Fire, said they had sold out ""due to extreme high demands"" since the Las Vegas shooting. Allow Twitter content?

""I think they should be banned,"" Republican Texas congressman Bill Flores told The Hill newspaper, adding that he had never heard of bump-stocks before. ""There's no reason for a typical gun owner to own anything that converts a semi-automatic to something that behaves like an automatic,"" he said. Democratic California congressman Mike Thompson, who chairs the congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, said Congress must address the ""loophole"". ""We don't know how many lives could have been spared in Las Vegas had the shooter not had bump-stocks,"" he said.

"A couple in Indiana stole $1.2m from Amazon by repeatedly claiming that packages had arrived damaged A couple in the US have admitted stealing goods from Amazon valued at more than $1.2m (Â£910,000) by repeatedly pretending that items they ordered were damaged in the post. Erin Joseph Finan, 38, and Leah Jeanette Finan, 37, from Indiana, have pleaded guilty to postal fraud and money laundering. The couple face fines of up to $500,000, as well as prison sentences of up to 20 years. They will be sentenced on 9 November. According to local newspaper theMuncie Star Press,external, the Finans used hundreds of false online identities to order popular tech gadgets from Amazon, including Samsung smartwatches, GoPro cameras and Xbox video game consoles. The couple then contacted Amazon's customer service department to report that the items had arrived damaged or were not working, and Amazon sent out replacement products for free. The Finans then sold the merchandise on to another individual, who resold the products to an unnamed firm based in New York. The couple and their accomplice were eventually caught after a joint investigation conducted by the US Postal Inspection Service, Indiana State Police and the Internal Revenue Service.

"This video can not be played Who was Edward Heath? Sir Edward Heath would have been questioned over sex abuse claims if he was alive when they came to light, police have said. Wiltshire Police launched Operation Conifer in 2015 when the former PM was accused of historical child sex abuse. The Conservative politician would have been interviewed under caution over seven claims, including the alleged rape of an 11-year-old, they said. No inference of guilt should be drawn from this, police stressed. The allegations include one of rape of a male under 16, three of indecent assault on a male under 16, four of indecent assault on a male under 14, and two of indecent assault on a male over 16. The earliest, dating from 1961 when Sir Edward was Lord Privy Seal, alleged he had raped and indecently assaulted an 11-year-old boy in London ""during a paid sexual encounter in private in a dwelling."" Another two of the seven claims relate to ""paid sexual encounters."" The Sir Edward Heath Foundation called the report ""profoundly unsatisfactory"". In a statement, Sir Edward's former cabinet secretary, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, and chairman of the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, Lord Hunt of Wirral, said the report neither justifies or dispels the ""the cloud of suspicion"". ""All those who knew Sir Edward Heath or worked with him are, without exception, convinced that the allegations of child abuse will all be found to be groundless,"" it said. Who was Ted Heath? Government to pay Â£1.1m for Sir Edward Heath inquiry Ex-PM Heath was 'completely asexual', says adviser Sir Edward, who led a Tory government from 1970 to 1974, died in 2005, aged 89. Operation Conifer - which spanned 14 UK police forces - said a total of 42 claims related to 40 different individuals, with alleged offences from 1956 to 1992 - while Sir Edward was an elected MP. The report concluded there was not enough information to meet the threshold for interview for 19 of the claims. Among these were two cases where police said there was reason to suspect the individuals ""intentionally misled"" them. One of the two has been cautioned for wasting police time. In three further cases, the investigation found that those reporting alleged abuse were ""genuinely mistaken"" in naming Sir Edward as the perpetrator. As part of the Â£1.5m investigation, three people unconnected to Sir Edward were arrested for offences related to child abuse, one of whom is still being investigated. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) has said it would investigate further. ""In regard to the allegations concerning Sir Edward Heath, the inquiry will investigate whether there was any knowledge within Westminster institutions, and if so, what actions were taken,"" a spokesman said. This video can not be played Lincoln Seligman, Sir Edward's godson, talks to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme Ahead of the ""closure"" report's publication, Sir Edward's godson said he believed the investigation was flawed and called for a judicial inquiry into the police's handling of the abuse claims. Lincoln Seligman, who knew Sir Edward for 50 years, said:""If you make a mass appeal for victims you are sure to get them, whether they are legitimate or not. ""A proper investigation should have taken place, but that's not what happened."" Following the report's publication, Mr Seligman told the BBC: ""These are still just allegations and I do not believe them."" Edward Heath, seen aboard Morning Cloud in 1971, was a world-class yachtsman Other friends of Sir Edward's have also criticised the investigation, and a psychologist who advised detectives claimed it was based on the allegations of a handful of fantasists. One of Sir Edward's closest advisers told the BBC that the former Conservative leader was ""completely asexual"". Lord Armstrong of Ilminster said he ""never felt a whiff of sexuality about Ted Heath, whether it was in relation to women, men or children"". North Wiltshire MP James Gray wants the allegations to be fully investigated by a judge-led inquiry, saying there is ""no evidence whatsoever in the report"". He added: ""This is a terrible cloud hanging over the head of a great statesman and we should take steps as a government to put that right."" Sir Edward's former private secretary Michael McManus, who wrote a biography about him, said he didn't believe there was any evidence of wrongdoing. He said: ""I spent 18 months talking to people who had known him. These allegations were out there and not one person believed them, including people who really didn't like him."" Clinical psychologist Dr Elly Hanson, who was on the independent panel that scrutinised the report for the police, said she ""empathises"" with supporters of Sir Edward but added that it was right for the allegations to be investigated. By Tom Symonds, BBC home affairs correspondent Child abuse in the past is extremely difficult to investigate. The modern staples of detective work - CCTV, forensics, mobile phones - aren't available. Witnesses may be dead or psychologically impaired. The purity of their evidence may have been tainted by the years between the alleged act and their account being given. When those accused are famous or powerful, even in the past, and dead, it becomes even harder. Operation Conifer has gathered a vast amount of evidence - pursuing a total of 1,580 lines of inquiry and it has made public the most serious allegations against the former prime minister, but it can't tell us whether they are true. More than anything else, this report prompts more questions than it answers. Mike Veale, chief constable of Wiltshire Police, said the operation was ""fair and rigorous"" During the course of the lengthy investigation, the police have defended their response, with Chief Constable Veale insisting Operation Conifer was neither a ""fishing trip"" nor a ""witch-hunt"". Chief Constable Veale said officers have ""gone where the evidence has taken us"", whether it supported the allegations or not. He said: ""The report does not draw any conclusions as to the likely guilt or innocence of Sir Edward Heath."" Referring to the political pressure on Operation Conifer to be scaled down or scrapped, Mr Veale said the scrutiny panel overseeing the process said it was ""fair, sensitive and rigorous"". He went on to praise the investigation team who had ""not buckled under the pressure of relentless external speculation and criticism"". Angus Macpherson, police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire and Swindon, said calls for Mr Veale to resign or be sacked were ""fundamentally misjudged"". The findings of the investigation will be passed to theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. The seven victim disclosures for which Sir Edward would have been interviewed under caution: 1961, London: Sir Edward allegedly raped and indecently assaulted boy, 11, during a paid sexual encounter in private in a dwelling 1962, Kent: Sir Edward allegedly indecently assaulted a ten year-old-boy during a chance encounter in a public place 1964, Sussex and London: Sir Edward allegedly indecently assaulted a 15-year-old boy in three paid sexual encounters 1967, Guernsey: Sir Edward allegedly indecently assaulted a 15-year-old boy in a public building 1976, Jersey: Sir Edward allegedly indecently assaulted, over clothing, an adult male at a public event 1992, Wiltshire: Sir Edward allegedly assaulted an adult male after consent was withdrawn in a hotel Between 1990-1992, Wiltshire: Sir Edward allegedly indecently assaulted a male, aged between 12 and 14 years, in private gardens Inquiry urged into Heath abuse probe Police defend Edward Heath abuse probe Who was Ted Heath?

"Zameer Ghumra denied disseminating ""terrorist propaganda"" in the form of a graphic Twitter video A man who showed a beheading video to a child has been convicted of disseminating ""terrorist propaganda"". Pharmacist Zameer Ghumra, of Leicester, showed the boy a graphic Twitter video on his mobile phone. Nottingham Crown Court heard the 38-year-old also told two primary school-age youngsters ""you had to kill"" anyone who insulted Islam. Ghumra, who will be sentenced on Friday, had claimed the two boys were making ""a false allegation"". He was convicted of disseminating ""terrorist propaganda"" in the form of a graphic Twitter video on his mobile phone, between January 2013 and September 2014. During the trial, prosecutor Simon Davis said Ghumra believed in a ""very, very, very extreme"" form of Islam. The court heard Ghumra posted pro ISIS content on social media Ghumra, of Haringworth Road, stood emotionless as the verdict was read out after two hours of jury deliberation. The court heard he had been working as a pharmacist in Oundle, Northamptonshire and told a customer members of the so-called Islamic State were ""not bad people, they're only defending themselves"". He ""brainwashed"" the two children, instructing them to not have non-Muslim friends and asking if they wanted to join the terrorist group or help recruit others to its ranks, the jury was told. The older boy described being shown ""horrible and disgusting"" beheading videos, and asked Ghumra ""how can you behead people?"". He said Ghumra replied: ""If you truly believe in Allah, you can do it."" Ghumra was arrested in September 2015 but the beheading video was not found In a police interview played to the court, the younger child said: ""He put us on Twitter. He told us to follow whoever he followed. He was following ISIS and really bad people."" He also said Ghumra gave them business cards - which were shown to the jury - with the boy's names and email addresses alongside a picture of a rifle. The jury heard he used a rented house to teach children about jihad and the boys were not allowed non-Muslim friends. The boy said Mr Ghumra asked him to choose between going to Iraq or Syria, or staying in the UK and ""manipulating"" other people into supporting IS. After Ghumra's arrest at Birmingham Airport in September 2015, a computer was seized showing 1,600 search results for terms including ""survival knives"" and ""bushcraft"". But when police searched his home, neither the phone containing the beheading video or the video itself were recovered. Sue Hemming, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Zameer Ghumra tried to brainwash impressionable children with this violent ideology by making one watch beheading videos and urging them both to adopt a hard-line religious outlook. ""The children were brave to give evidence and we would like to thank them for helping to secure this conviction of a dangerous man.""

"This video can not be played Kazuo Ishiguro talks to BBC arts editor Will Gompertz ""How should a Nobel laureate dress?"" asked Kazuo Ishiguro, who, 40 minutes earlier, had found out he had won the Nobel Prize for Literature. To say the news was unexpected is an understatement. He literally couldn't believe it. Until, that was, his phone began to ring constantly, an orderly queue of TV crews started to form outside his front door (""how do they all know where I live?""), and his publishers dispatched a top team to his house as back-up. This was not fake news. This was delightful, surprising news. Maybe there were others who should have won instead, he wondered. ""But that is the nature of prizes. They are a lottery."" While chaos reigned around him, he was calm, assured and thoughtful, talking (after nipping upstairs to fetch a smart jacket for our interview) about his belief in the power of stories and how those that he wrote would often explore wasted lives and opportunities. TV crews and reporters flocked to Ishiguro's London home ""I've always had a faith that it should be possible, if you tell stories in a certain way, to transcend barriers of race, class and ethnicity."" For me, he is one of the great living writers working in any language. All writers can tell stories. Ishiguro tells stories on another level. He places the reader in some sort of alternative reality - which might be the future, it might be the present, it might be the past. They feel like places that are whole and real, but you don't know them. They're weird and not necessarily happy places. But they're places that you can inhabit and relate to, and you become deeply involved with the characters. That's the writer's job - he just does it better than most. Kazuo Ishiguro held an audience with reporters in his garden Growing up in England in a Japanese household was crucial to his writing, he says, enabling him to see things from a different perspective to many of his British peers. It is most obvious in the slightly detached nature of many of his narrators, which he explains as coming from ""a long tradition in Japanese art towards a surface calm and surface restraint. There is a felling emotions can feel more intense if they are held down to the surface level"". There was nothing superficial about his emotions when we met earlier today. He was chuffed to bits, and rightly so. Kazuo Ishiguro is worthy recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

"The children's mother said it ""was intended as a joke"" A fire crew has been suspended from community work after a firefighter wrapped two children in cling film. The incident, which involved the children of a crew member, was caught on camera at a fire station in Southend. Essex Fire Service is investigating after the BBC notified it of photographs sent by a concerned party. The chief fire officer said the images had ""raised concerns"" and a ""thorough investigation"" was under way. The service said the watch had been put on ""core duties only"", meaning it cannot carry out community work. The children's mother said what happened ""was intended as a joke"" and the youngsters enjoyed it. Chief fire officer Adam Eckley said it was believed no harm was done to the children The incident happened two weeks ago. Five people, including the two children, were present when the photographs were taken and their mother later posted them on Facebook. The youngsters were wrapped in plastic by a colleague of their father. Their mother, who is not being named in order to protect the privacy of the children, said it was a joke. She added: ""I can see that this was not an appropriate activity, and we should not have played around like this at the fire station."" Chief fire officer Adam Eckley said although he encouraged ""family spirit"", stations were still ""a workplace"" where behaviour ""must reflect our service values and exemplify professionalism"". He said: ""The photos we have seen have raised concerns, we have liaised with the appropriate statutory agencies and a thorough investigation and process has now started. ""The firefighters involved are embarrassed and regretful of how this event has been interpreted. ""It does not give the right impression to our public, and it is not who we are."" Roger Hirst, the police, fire and crime commissioner for Essex, said: ""I am clear that the behaviour shown in these photos is inappropriate and requires a thorough and robust investigation.""

"Royal Mail workers are set to strike for 48 hours from 19 October in a dispute over pensions, pay and jobs. The Communication Workers Union said it had told the Royal Mail Group that 111,000 postal workers will walk out. The industrial action follows the 89.1% vote in favour of a strike announced by the union on Thursday. Royal Mail said it will use all legal options, including applying for a High Court injunction, to prevent industrial action. The FTSE 250-listed company called for further talks with the CWU, adding: ""We believe any strike action before the dispute resolution procedures have been followed would be unlawful."" The union said the company's move to replace the pension scheme meant its members would lose up to a third of their retirement entitlements. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said it was a ""watershed dispute"" that would determine the future of the postal service. ""We are determined to take whatever steps are necessary to deliver an agreement that will protect and enhance our member's terms and conditions and improve the range of services on offer to customers,"" he said. The CWU vote, which had a 73.7% turnout, is the first major ballot since the introduction of the Trade Union Act, which requires a 50% turnout. The union did not rule out further strike action in addition to the 48-hour walkout later this month. CWU deputy general secretary Terry Pullinger said it had been in negotiations with the company for 18 months. ""Royal Mail Group management have clearly moved away from the spirit and intent of our agreements and the empty promises of privatisation, and have suffered a huge vote of no confidence from their employees and CWU members as a consequence,"" he said.

"Mr Foster, who moved to Cardiff for university, was a sales representative for an outdoor clothing firm The family of a climber from Wales killed shielding his wife from a rock fall in California have said he will ""always be our hero"" for saving her. Andrew Foster, 32, originally from Cheltenham, died whenrocks fell from El Capitanin Yosemite National Park on 27 September. His wife Lucy, 28, who was seriously injured and is recovering in hospital, was protected by her husband's body. Mr Foster's family said they were so proud of their ""brave boy"". In a statement, they said they wake up every morning hoping his death had been a ""bad dream"". ""As has already been reported, Andrew died whilst shielding Lucy and, indeed, we understand another climber witnessed him running back to the rock fall to protect Lucy,"" his family said. ""They loved each other dearly and, while our loss is indescribable, we are so proud of our brave boy in saving Lucy; he will always be our hero."" The couple got engaged during a skiing holiday Mrs Foster's family said he was ""the man of her dreams"". ""We take some comfort from the fact that Andy's last act of love saved Lucy's life. Both families are supporting each other at this incredibly difficult time of loss and sadness,"" they said. The families said she was stable in hospital and the friends the couple had been climbing with had been at her hospital bedside. They said they were now focused on getting his body back to the UK. The El Capitan rock formation is the world's largest granite monolith and one of the best-known landmarks in Yosemite. The pair, found with climbing equipment, are believed to have been scouting out the ascent from a trail when a ""sheet"" of granite plummeted from a height of 200m (656ft). Mr Foster proposed to his wife in the Alps in 2015 and the couple married last year. He went to Cleeve School in Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, before going to Cardiff University in 2003 to study engineering. In 2006, he began working for the Cardiff-based outdoor activity shop Up and Under, before joining the international company Patagonia.

"This video can not be played Five things that went wrong with May's speech Tory ministers have rallied round Theresa May after her conference speech on Wednesday was marred by mishaps. First Secretary of State Damian Green said it was ""nonsense"" to suggest she should quit because her speech was interrupted by a cough and a prankster. He said the prime minister was ""as determined as ever"" to get on with the job. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Mrs May was doing an ""excellent job"". But ex-minister Ed Vaizey said ""quite a few people"" wanted her to quit. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said that while many MPs wanted her to stay as leader, there were ""emerging plots"". PM struggles through interrupted speech May revives promise to cap energy prices Security review after PM pranked Could May have fixed her croaky voice? These involved Tory MPs trying to gather support to approach Mrs May privately and persuade her to stand aside. This group will only act if they feel they have the numbers to do so ""quickly and cleanly"", the BBC political editor added, saying: ""It is just not clear at the moment where the numbers really lie."" Speaking on BBC Radio Oxford, Mr Vaizey, who was sacked as a culture minister when Mrs May became leader in 2016, said most people were being ""pretty loyal"" in public but were ""very concerned"" in private. He added: ""I think there will be quite a few people who will now be pretty firmly of the view that she should resign."" This video can not be played 'Nothing quite like it' - Laura Kuenssberg on PM's speech Politics is certainly cruel, and clearly the prime minister was the victim of some appallingly bad luck. A former minister told me that after the election and Grenfell it would only have taken one more event to trigger her exit and this ""was the event"". In normal political times, it is probably the case that what one minister described as a ""tragedy"" would have led to a prime minister being forced out or quitting. But these aren't normal times. Allies of Theresa May say Wednesday's events have shown her resilience and determination in spades, demonstrating exactly why she deserves to stay in the job. Read more from our political editor But speaking on BBC One's Question Time Mr Green said: ""I know that she is as determined as ever to get on with her job - she sees it as her duty to do so. She will carry on and she will make a success of this government"". He said it was ""complete nonsense"" to suggest that having a cold or having an ""unfunny pillock"" interrupt her speech meant she was the wrong person for the job. The PM's speech was seen as her opportunity to assert her authority, after her decision to call a snap election backfired. She apologised to activists and put forward new policies, including an extra Â£2bn to build 25,000 new council houses and social homes for rent by 2021 and draft legislation for a cap on standard tariff energy bills, which she said were part of her mission to improve people's lives and promote a ""British dream"". This video can not be played Charles Walker: She comes out of it as heroic But a nagging cough and croaky voice forced the PM to stop on more than one occasion. Prankster Simon Brodkin - also known as his TV persona Lee Nelson - was arrested by Greater Manchester Police after briefly interrupting the PM and giving her and a mock P45 redundancy notice he claimed was from Boris Johnson. To add to Mrs May's woes, some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her. By the end it read: ""Building a country that works or everyon."" Cabinet ministers including Mr Johnson, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt have praised the speech and a No 10 source said colleagues had been ""offering support"" and declared ""resignation is not an issue"" for Mrs May. Simon Brodkin was arrested for his stunt but later released But backbench Tory MP Mark Pritchard said on Twitter that a ""small number"" of colleagues were raising questions over her leadership in text messages. Mr Pritchard, one of Mrs May's trade envoys, warned those ""circling above"" that there was only one message: ""There is no vacancy at No 10."" And his colleague Charles Walker, vice chairman of the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs, praised Mrs May's ""heroic"" efforts on stage, telling the BBC: ""You are actually allowed to be ill occasionally and that's what she was, ill - and she was ill because she's been working so damn hard on behalf of this country."" Ex-chancellor Lord Lamont warned against ""political instability"" during the ""massively important"" Brexit negotiations. ""I think what people ought to remember before they pitch in is that we are facing a very serious situation at the moment,"" he said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Business Secretary Greg Clark said people admired the ""poise"" and ""guts"" the PM showed to get through her speech. He also said the fact that a comedian was able to get within yards of the prime minister showed a ""weakness in the system"". Security at future Conservative events is to be reviewed. The prankster, Mr Brodkin, was later released by police who said he had ""legitimate accreditation"" to attend the event. Former Conservative deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft said there was an air of a party that did not ""know what it is doing"". But Business Minister Margot James told the BBC's Daily Politics she believed the coverage of the speech had been ""pretty vicious"" and Theresa May was ""a very good prime minister"". Asked about reports of MPs plotting against her, Ms James said: ""I think there will be a small minority of disaffected colleagues who are angry, bitter for whatever personal reasons they've got, and I do hope my other colleagues will have the sense to disown them.""

"Pro-independence demonstrations have continued, following Sunday's referendum Spain's Constitutional Court has suspended next Monday's session of the Catalan parliament, in a bid to pre-empt a possible push for independence. The court said such a move would be ""a breach of the constitution"". Earlier Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy warned Catalonia's regional government against declaring independence after a disputed vote last Sunday. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont had indicated that he could make such a declaration at next week's session. The court's ruling on Thursday upheld a challenge not from the government in Madrid, but by the Socialists' Party of Catalonia, which opposes secession from Spain. Allowing the regional parliament to meet and declare independence, the court said, would violate the rights of the party's MPs. An earlier ruling by the court aimed at stopping Sunday's vote was ignored by Catalonia's leaders. That challenge to the court had come from Spain's government, which condemned the referendum as illegal. The socialists won almost 13% of the vote in the 2015 election, and has 13 MPs in the 135-seat regional parliament. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold Organisers of Sunday's vote put the turnout at 42%, with 2.2 million people taking part. They say 90% voted for independence, however they have not published final results. There have been several claims of irregularities. There was violence at polling stations as police, trying to enforce a Spanish court decision to ban the vote, attempted to seize ballot boxes and disperse voters.

Analysis by BBC Europe Editor Katya Adler, Madrid Mariano Rajoy is famous for his ""wait-and-see"" attitude in crises. He's more of a technocrat than a passionate politician. So far, it's served him well. While not wildly popular, he remains very much in control of Spain's central government. But the Catalan question is risky for him. His apparent inertia this week is coming under fire from the Spanish left - who want him to start a dialogue with Catalan separatists - and the harder right who want him to take immediate action, shutting the Catalan government down, bringing the reins of power back to Madrid. Spaniards call it ""the nuclear option"". In a nod to them on Thursday, Mr Rajoy warned of ""greater damage"" if Catalan separatists went ahead with a unilateral declaration of independence. Spain's constitutional court has now banned Monday's meeting of the Catalan parliament where that declaration was expected to be made. While this may appear a setback for the separatists, they have ignored court rulings before. But Mr Rajoy hopes the weight of Spanish law will now serve to divide Catalonia's pro-independence parties - which range from the moderate to the radical - and weaken their resolve.

"This video can not be played Kazuo Ishiguro talks to BBC arts editor Will Gompertz British writer Kazuo Ishiguro has won the 2017 Nobel Prize for Literature. The novelist was praised by the Swedish Academy as a writer ""who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world"". His most famous novels The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go were adapted into highly acclaimed films. He was made an OBE in 1995. The 62-year-old writer said the award was ""flabbergastingly flattering"". He has written eight books, which have been translated into over 40 languages. Allow Twitter content?

When contacted by the BBC, he admitted he hadn't been contacted by the Nobel committee and wasn't sure whether it was a hoax. He said: ""It's a magnificent honour, mainly because it means that I'm in the footsteps of the greatest authors that have lived, so that's a terrific commendation."" This video can not be played BBC producer Elizabeth Needham-Bennett is the first to tell Kazuo Ishiguro he's won He said he hoped the Nobel Prize would be a force for good. ""The world is in a very uncertain moment and I would hope all the Nobel Prizes would be a force for something positive in the world as it is at the moment,"" he said. ""I'll be deeply moved if I could in some way be part of some sort of climate this year in contributing to some sort of positive atmosphere at a very uncertain time."" Carey Mulligan starred in the film version of Ishiguro's novel Never Let Me Go Born in Nagasaki, Japan, in 1954, he moved to England with his family when his father was offered a post as an oceanographer in Surrey He read English and philosophy at the University of Kent after a gap year that included working as a grouse beater for the Queen Mother at Balmoral He studied an MA in creative writing at the University of East Anglia, where his tutors were Malcolm Bradbury and Angela Carter His thesis became his critically acclaimed first novel, A Pale View of Hills, published in 1982 He won the Booker Prize in 1989 for The Remains of the Day More on Kazuo Ishiguro from BBC Arts The Remains of the Day was turned into an Oscar-nominated film with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson His work, which includes scripts for film and television, looks at themes of memory, time and self-delusion. The Nobel committee praised his latest book The Buried Giant, which was released in 2015, for exploring ""how memory relates to oblivion, history to the present, and fantasy to reality"". Fans gathered in Tokyo in the hope of celebrating Haruki Murakami, who had been the bookies' favourite - but ended up celebrating Ishiguro's win Kazuo Ishiguro was inundated with members of the press at his north London home after his award was announced Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, described his style as ""a little bit like a mix of Jane Austen, comedy of manners and Franz Kafka"". She said Ishiguro was a writer of ""great integrity"", adding: ""He doesn't look to the side. He's developed an aesthetic universe all of his own."" The Nobel comes with a prize of nine million kronor (Â£844,000, $1.1m). Nobel Prize: Where are the women? For me, he is one of the great living writers working in any language. All writers can tell stories. Ishiguro tells stories on another level. He places the reader in some sort of alternative reality - which might be the future, it might be the present, it might be the past. They feel like places that are whole and real, but you don't know them. They're weird and not necessarily happy places. But they're places that you can inhabit and relate to, and you become deeply involved with the characters. That's the writer's job - he just does it better than most. Read Will's full blog post.

"Noel Conway was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2014 A terminally ill man has lost his High Court challenge against the law on assisted dying. Noel Conway, 67, from Shrewsbury, who has motor neurone disease, wanted a doctor to be allowed to prescribe a lethal dose when his health deteriorates. Currently any doctor helping him to die would face up to 14 years in prison. His lawyers had argued he faced a stark choice, which was unfair and the law needed to change. They said he could either bring about his own death while still physically able to do so, or await death with no control over how and when it came. He had previously said he wanted to say goodbye to loved ones ""at the right time, not to be in a zombie-like condition suffering both physically and psychologically"". He argued that when he had less than six months to live and retained the mental capacity to make the decision, he wished to be able to enlist assistance from the medical profession to bring about a ""peaceful and dignified"" death. Mr Conway, who was not at London's High Court on Thursday, wanted a declaration that the Suicide Act 1961, which lays out the law on assisted dying, is incompatible with Article eight of the European Convention on Human Rights. This relates to respect for private and family life, and Article 14, which protects from discrimination. But Lord Justice Sales, Mrs Justice Whipple and Mr Justice Garnhamrejected,externalhis case. Before his illness Noel Conway was a keen skier, climber and cyclist Mr Conway, who has been supported by campaign group Dignity in Dying, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the judgement and intends to appeal it. ""The experiences of those who are terminally ill need to be heard. ""As I approach the end of my life, I face unbearable suffering and the possibility of a traumatic, drawn-out death."" But Peter Saunders, from the Care Not Killing Alliance, said the decision was right ""because of the concern that vulnerable people might be exploited or abused by those who have a financial or emotional interest"". It is not the first time the law has been challenged. A case brought by Tony Nicklinson - who was paralysed after a stroke - was dismissed in 2014 by the Supreme Court, which stated it was important that Parliament debated the issues before any decision was made by the courts. In 2015 MPs rejected proposals to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, in their first vote on the issue in almost 20 years. Supporters of the current legislation say it exists to protect the weak and vulnerable from being exploited or coerced. Mr Conway's case is different from Mr Nicklinson's in that he has a terminal illness and his legal team set out strict criteria and clear potential safeguards to protect vulnerable people from any abuse of the system.

"Pro-independence demonstrations have continued, following Sunday's referendum Spain's Constitutional Court has suspended next Monday's session of the Catalan parliament, in a bid to pre-empt a possible push for independence. The court said such a move would be ""a breach of the constitution"". Earlier Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy warned Catalonia's regional government against declaring independence after a disputed vote last Sunday. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont had indicated that he could make such a declaration at next week's session. The court's ruling on Thursday upheld a challenge not from the government in Madrid, but by the Socialists' Party of Catalonia, which opposes secession from Spain. Allowing the regional parliament to meet and declare independence, the court said, would violate the rights of the party's MPs. An earlier ruling by the court aimed at stopping Sunday's vote was ignored by Catalonia's leaders. That challenge to the court had come from Spain's government, which condemned the referendum as illegal. The socialists won almost 13% of the vote in the 2015 election, and has 13 MPs in the 135-seat regional parliament. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold Organisers of Sunday's vote put the turnout at 42%, with 2.2 million people taking part. They say 90% voted for independence, however they have not published final results. There have been several claims of irregularities.

"The Joker's suit, as worn by Jack Nicholson, was up for sale Some film memorabilia fetches millions of pounds at auction, but it can cost nothing to start a collection. A life-size replica of the Joker, as played by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film Batman, leers down from a podium. His plum-coloured suit is unmistakable in its sinister glory. A few metres away, a mannequin sports a coral and maroon-hued cowboy outfit that looks like it's seen better days. It once belonged to fictional character Marty McFly and was worn by Michael J Fox in the 1990 film Back to the Future Part III. It's the day of the Prop Store's memorabilia auction and at the BFI Imax cinema in London, some of the film world's most recognisable props and costumes are on display ahead of a sale that afternoon. A helmet worn by Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy Also up for grabs are model miniatures of the Los Angeles skyline used in the making of Blade Runner, the 1982 sci-fi classic. And there's a pair of Garth's ""tighty whities"" underpants from the 1993 comedy Wayne's World 2. While some items will go on to fetch relatively modest sums, others, such as a helmet worn by Chris Pratt in recent superhero film Guardians of the Galaxy, will sell for more than Â£100,000. So what is it that compels punters to spend a fortune on film props and costumes? As chair of the David C. Copley Center for Costume Design at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Deborah Nadoolman-Landis is well placed to offer an opinion. She's been a costume designer for more than 40 years and her work on Coming to America, the 1988 comedy starring Eddie Murphy, secured her an Oscar nomination. Deborah Nadoolman-Landis designed the outfits for Raiders of the Lost Ark In the industry, she's affectionately known as the ""Mother of Indiana Jones"" for designing the outfits worn in Raiders of the Lost Ark. ""People are supposed to fall in love with the people on screen and when you fall in love with Indiana Jones you want something from the character. Memorabilia is an extension of falling in love with the film."" It doesn't stop at cinema, she adds. Ms Nadoolman-Landis also designed the costumes for Michael Jackson's 1983 Thriller music video, which ""everyone was obsessed with"" at the time. ""Michael's red jacket ended up being sold for $1.2m (Â£900,000),"" she says. But not everything in the world of memorabilia costs the earth, says Jon Baddeley, head of Bonhams auction house in the UK. Granted, Bonhams New York sold the piano from the film Casablanca for $3.4m, and Mr Baddeley hopes to sell aRobby the Robot,externalprop, used in the 1956 classic Forbidden Planet, for seven figures at an upcoming auction. Bonhams New York sold the piano from Casablanca for $3.4m But he says it is quite possible to start a memorabilia collection for free. ""The film posters and lobby cards made to advertise films in cinemas often get thrown away. So why not make friends with your cinema manager and ask for posters or cut-outs when you see a film you like?"" So could today's rubbish be a future collector's item? An original poster for the 1933 monster adventure filmKing Kong,externalcan fetch around Â£70,000. ""Who knows?"" says Mr Baddeley. ""But remember, whatever you buy you've got to live with it. Have it framed and enjoy it. If it goes up in value you've got a double whammy, if not, you've still got something you enjoy."" At the auction, Stephen Lane, the head of Prop Store, gives me a whistle-stop tour of the day's top lots. He won't be giving anything away for free but says that, in amongst the stratospherically expensive nuggets of movie gold, there are some very affordable items. A creature costume from Aliens was sold for Â£50,000 ""The lots start at Â£40 to Â£60. For that you'd be buying crew items or gifts, things like call sheets which were used in the production. It might not be quite as personal but it's still something from your favourite film."" That's good news for first-time auction visitor and Blade Runner fan, Chris Dagger. ""I don't have a big budget, the most I can spend is around Â£500,"" concedes Mr Dagger. ""I've got my eye on the Blade Runner crew jacket. I've always been a fan of the film and with the new one coming out, I'd love to buy it."" The jacket in question is dark maroon satin with the name ""Tim"" stitched onto the front. More stories from the BBC'sBusiness Brainseries looking at interesting business topics from around the world: The firms that donate as many goods as they sell How do you like your wine - with a cork or screw-cap? Are changeable heels the end to women's sore feet? Do the colours you wear at work matter? ""I don't have much chance of getting it,"" says Mr Dagger. ""There are people here with a lot of money to spend, a lot more than I've got, but we'll see."" In the imposing auditorium of the BFI Imax the auction gets underway. Things don't look good for Chris. A single grey T-shirt, embossed with ""Peace through superior firepower"", which was worn in the film Aliens, is sold for Â£3,000. And a full alien creature costume from the same film fetches Â£50,000. Chris Dagger bid for a Blade Runner crew jacket Chris holds his number ""26"" bidding card nervously, waiting for his lot to be called. The auctioneer announces a starting bid of Â£250, and within seconds Mr Dagger is pushed to his maximum bid of Â£500 for the Blade Runner jacket. There are no further bids in the auditorium, but there's an agonising wait as the auctioneer checks whether other offers have come in by phone or email. None have, and to his delight and astonishment, Mr Dagger gets what he came for. Out in the refreshment area, he takes a couple of deep breaths and poses for photos next to a poster for Blade Runner 2049, the film's soon-to-be released sequel. ""It's such an iconic film and if you're a fan you know all the trials and tribulations they went through to make it. ""And here we are, surrounded by posters for the current film. I'm just really happy, there's not much more I can say."" With the 22% buyer's premium, VAT and shipping charges, the final bill is Â£700, which doesn't make the jacket a cheap purchase.

"The sonar contact matches the dimensions of the Athenia in all details The remains of the first British ship to be sunk in WW2 appear to have been identified on the Atlantic seabed. Shipwreck-hunter David Mearns says sonar data shows the transatlantic passenger liner Athenia to be lying 200m down on Rockall Bank, off Ireland. A German submarine torpedoed the ship hours after Britain declared war on Hitler in 1939 - more than 100 people, including many Americans, were killed. Germany initially denied involvement fearing the US would join the war. U-boat commander Fritz Julius Lemp had mistaken the liner for an armed cruiser and the German naval authorities tried to cover up the sub's actions. They even attempted to blame the sinking on Winston Churchill, who on that very day - 3 September, 1939 - was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. The Germans said he had ordered a British submarine to fire on the Athenia as part of a plot to force Washington's hand. The full truth only emerged at the Nuremberg Trials. This video can not be played British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain declared war on 3 September, 1939 Chamberlain's famous ""this country is at war with Germany"" broadcast was delivered shortly after 11 in the morning. The torpedo from U-30 struck the Athenia at 7:38 that evening. She was slow to go down, disappearing beneath the waves, stern first, at 11 the next morning. When she left Liverpool on 2 September, three-quarters of her passengers were women and children David Mearns, who has found some two dozen major wrecks for insurers and TV companies, says the Athenia's hull is visible in sonar data acquired by the Geological Survey of Ireland. It is split in the aft section where the torpedo hit, but otherwise is sitting proud of the sediment and looks to be in reasonable shape. To the untrained eye, sonar imagery can be difficult to interpret, but Mr Mearns says the dimensions of the target match exactly what would be expected of a 160m-long, 13,500-tonne passenger liner. What is more, the coordinates are very close to those sent out by the Athenia's radio officer in his distress call, and recorded in the logbooks of the vessels that came to the rescue. ""Can I go into a court of law and say, '100%, that's Athenia?' No. But barring a photograph I can say in my expert opinion there's a very, very high probability that that's Athenia. Everything fits,"" said Mr Mearns, who sets out the case in his book The Shipwreck Hunter. The relatively shallow water on Rockall Bank, an area of raised seabed a few hundred km from the Irish coastline, means it should be reasonably straightforward to send down a remotely operated vehicle to investigate the sonar contact. This video can not be played David Mearns: ""My research rules out all other shipwrecks in this area"" The marine scientist first got involved in the search for the wreck in a commission from the BBC. Producers had wanted to stage a live, underwater broadcast from the sunken remains of a famous ship. In the end, the TV idea was dropped, but Mr Mearns still hopes an expedition can be mounted by someone. It is the first wreck in his consultancy career ""which I've identified from my armchair, so to speak"". Searching the seafloor for sunken ships in this way is usually a wasted pursuit because of thedearth of high-resolution sonar data. ""The Moon and Mars are mapped to a greater degree of accuracy than our seabed. Our own inner-world is largely unexplored,"" Mr Mearns told BBC News. A Punch magazine cartoon: No-one in Britain accepted the German explanation He is now involved in efforts to change this. His expertise means he has been appointed as a judge on theShell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE,external, a $7m incentive to get engineering groups to develop innovative seafloor mapping technologies and strategies. These new approaches would help achieve an international goal set last year to have 100% of the topography of the world's ocean bedmapped by 2030. ""It would be at such resolution that anyone could look for shipwrecks like the Athenia from their desk. That's the ultimate goal, anyway,"" said Mr Mearns. The Athenia still draws interest because of the many stories associated with the sinking The Donaldson Atlantic Line SS Athenia was built in Glasgow and the city'sRiverside Museum,externalof transport has an exhibition dedicated to the vessel and the stories surrounding its sinking. The rescue effort by six other ships was nothing short of heroic, according to testimony. 1,306 individuals were successfully pulled off the Athenia in deteriorating seas. Most of those who died were in two lifeboats that were smashed just as they were about to be saved. ""It was a shocking event,"" said Riverside curator Emily Malcolm. ""We've got several items on display includingthe watch from the ship's cook,external. We've also got a detailed model of the Athenia. You can see all the lifeboats. It was something Donaldson had made when the ship was built,"" she told BBC News. Fritz Julius Lemp commanded submarines for another two years. He eventually lost his life in a confrontation in 1941 when his U-110 boat was forced to the surface after being damaged by depth charges. The British captured the submarine and took possession of its Enigma cipher machine. Senior figures in the German navy were convicted at Nuremberg for war crimes in relation to the Athenia affair. The attack on an unarmed passenger liner was a clear breach of international protocols.

The reaction to the loss had echoes in the debates we have today about the reporting of news events, he told BBC News. ""The sinking of the SS Athenia, a civilian liner, was significant not only as the first British shipping loss of the war but as an example of a Nazi attempt to promote 'fake news'. ""Fearing the impact of the affair on American opinion, the Germans promoted an absurd conspiracy theory, claiming that Winston Churchill, as First Lord of the Admiralty, had been responsible.

"Protesters wave Spanish flags at a demonstration defending unity on Wednesday Spain's government has said it will not accept ""blackmail"" after the Catalan leader indicated that independence could be declared next week. Carles Puigdemont must return to the path of law before any negotiation could take place, the Madrid governmentsaid in a statement (in Spanish).,external His criticism of the king showed he was ""out of touch with reality"", it added. Catalan officials say 90% of those who voted in a disputed referendum on Sunday backed independence. Organisers put the turnout on Sunday at 42%, with 2.2 million people taking part. But there were several reports of irregularities. There was violence at polling stations as police, trying to enforce a Spanish court decision to ban the vote, attempted to seize ballot boxes and disperse voters. The threat that independence could unilaterally be declared is being taken seriously by Catalan businesses. Sabadell, the fifth-largest bank in Spain, has called an extraordinary meeting of its board on Thursday afternoon to discuss transferring its headquarters out of Catalonia. Carles Puigdemont (left) criticised Spain's King Felipe in his address CaixaBank, an even bigger institution, is mulling a similar move, say reports, which will ensure the banks remain within the eurozone and under the supervision of the European Central Bank. Some smaller businesses have already decided to move. King Felipe VI made a TV address on Tuesday night, calling Sunday's vote illegal and undemocratic. Mr Puigdemont attacked him for ""deliberately ignoring millions of Catalans"" and accused the king of adopting the Spanish government's position. ""This moment calls for mediation,"" he said in a televised statement late on Wednesday. He claimed that the king had rejected a moderating role granted to him by the Spanish constitution. Carles Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain Divided loyalties: The couples at odds over independence Analysis: Biggest crisis for a generation Could Catalonia make a success of independence? Mr Puigdemont told the BBC on Tuesday that he would declare independence ""at the end of this week or the beginning of next"". The Catalan government has said there will be an extraordinary meeting of parliament on Monday to discuss the outcome of the disputed referendum. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold In his statement on Wednesday evening, Mr Puigdemont did not give any further details of a possible declaration of independence. Switching to Spanish from Catalan, he thanked Spanish citizens who had sent their ""solidarity"" to Catalonia. Nearly 900 people were hurt as police violently tried to enforce a Spanish court order suspending the vote, which the government had declared illegal. Some police officers were seen firing rubber bullets, storming into polling stations and pulling women by their hair. Thirty-three police officers were also injured, local medical officials said. Shocked by what they had seen, hundreds of thousands of Catalans joined street protests on Tuesday. A general strike was also called in protest at ""the grave violation of rights and freedoms"" seen during the ballot. Q&A: Do Catalans really want independence? Why Catalan emotions are running high How Barcelona and Madrid viewed the vote By Patrick Jackson, BBC News, Girona It was a rare public attack on the Spanish monarch but King Felipe himself, symbol of national unity, seldom addresses the country on TV, and President Puigdemont had to respond. At a bar in the Catalan leader's home region, they clapped respectfully afterwards, happy with their leader and his call for mediation, and then they joked about the Game of Thrones TV series. ""We need a king like Jon Snow who tries to keep his lands together and is with the people,"" said one woman, laughing. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, by common agreement, was the Night King, wishing eternal winter on Catalonia. ""I want a Spain that cares for all its cultures,"" she added more seriously.

"Jason Manford says his grandmother is his biggest fan When TV funnyman Jason Manford announced he was releasing an album of serious show tunes, it may have come as a surprise to fans of his comedy. But his biggest fan has known there was an album brewing in this old school entertainer for some time. Her name, I hear you ask? Leah Manford - aka Jason's nan. The Mancunian's debut record A Different Stage is being released this week - and if it does well then his beloved 93-year-old grandmother will be able to claim some of the credit. ""I never thought about it to be honest"" said Jason. ""Then about two years ago my nana said: 'You should do an album'. She's more of a fan of the singing than the comedy."" Leah Manford and her favourite singer He added: ""Then I went on tour with Alfie Boe and did a few tunes with him, including Stars from Les Miserables with his orchestra andit hit YouTube,externaland went a bit viral. ""Loads of people on my Facebook were like 'do an album'. ""So when I looked at the two things, I thought this is something my nana would really love and if 'normal' people are into it - you know, people who are not my nana - then maybe there's something in this."" The 36-year-old, whose album goes up against fellow Manchester City fan and solo debutant Liam Gallagher on Friday, acknowledges that he isn't the first comedian to try his hand at singing - think Billy Connolly, Tim Minchin and Donald Glover. Jason Manford v Liam Gallagher: The 'new Britpop battle' is on 10 stars you didn't know released an album When the crowd say Boe, select him But he also has the added pressure of knowing that fellow comicBradley Walsh achieved the biggest-selling British debut album of last year. The host of game show The Chase sold 115,650 copies of his LP Chasing Dreams in the UK last year - putting him ahead of Mercury Prize-nominated Blossoms and former One Direction star Zayn. So who's laughing now then? ""I'm pals with Bradley so I wouldn't mind being an album behind him,"" said Jason. ""In my head, the main aim is to not become a quiz question in a few years time: 'Who sold seven albums on release of their debut?'."" Bradley Walsh - king of the singing jokers Quick-witted Northerner Jason comes from a family of club singers (including his uncle Dennis, a bald Michael Buble impersonator) and may have more of a claim to this year's singing throne than he makes out. He recorded his debut album after spending five years singing in musicals like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, The Producers and Sweeney Todd. And while comedy remains the main focus for father-of-five Jason, there's no reason why he can't follow in his funny friend's footsteps. Jason as Caractacus Pott in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ""I guess I've just always done them both really, so it felt like the natural thing to do. At school I was in all the musicals so I've been an orphan many a time: Annie, Oliver, you name it. ""I did three musicals over the last five years and this felt like the next step. ""There's something about doing eight shows a week, singing every night, that suddenly your voice comes on - it's like training a muscle. ""Suddenly a few years on your voice is a million times better than when you first started, through sheer practice."" He added: ""What's nice about the album is the reassurance that I'm not mad - this actually sounds alright. With the amount of messages I've had off people saying they really like it, I've been like: 'OK we're good. I'm not embarrassing myself!'."" As well as the aforementioned Stars, Jason points to trackHushabye Mountain,external- a duet with Rosanna Bates which he ""sang 500 times in Chitty"" - as one of his favourite moments on the new record. ""My kids love that one,"" he added. Show (tune) time Whatever form it takes, Manford - who also presents the Sunday morning breakfast showon Absolute Radio,external, always seems to find himself entertaining others. He has previously crossed the sacred streams of comedy and song during his stand-up career - but says he won't be making a habit of it during next year'sMuddle Class tour,external. Nor is there A Different Stage Tour lined up, bar a few gigs perhaps. ""Once or twice at the end of the show a few people have requested a song but generally it is two hours of straight stand-up,"" he said. ""Separately we've done a few shows with a band called 'Jason Manford and his band: A Different Stage' - so there's plenty of clues in the title! ""But entertaining is entertaining and as long as the audience know what they're coming for I think it's alright."" So if he had the hypothetical chance to sing his new songs on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury - but could never tell a joke again - would he take it? ""I'd have to say no"" he replies, with little hesitation. ""There's something about stand-up - it's the rawest form of entertaining. It doesn't get any harder and it doesn't get any better. The highs are so high because the lows are so low. This video can not be played Jason Manford: Who are the funniest singers? ""So for me stand up is always going to be my bread and butter - but at the same time I just love singing. When you're singing in the shower you can trick yourself into thinking you are at Pyramid Stage anyway because music has that thing that's tuned into your emotions. ""I've spent a lot of time singing in the shower, thinking: 'I sound alright here'. ""I have to say the album is great - but I sound well better in the shower.""

"The industrial action is over plans to make train doors driver-only operated Train services have ended for the day in two companies affected by a second 24-hour strike by RMT members this week across England. All services have finished on Arriva Rail North and all but one have ended on Merseyrail. Both Southern and Greater Anglia said a lot of their services ran normally despite the 24-hour walkout. Unions say the industrial action is over plans to make train doors driver-only operated. Rail companies have said this means theguard's role will changebut some workers believe safety procedures would be compromised. Rail companies warned commuters trains that are running would be very busy and some beleaguered commuters chose to stay at home Union members at South Western have also voted to strike, but any action first needs to be agreed with the executive body. The operator said it planned to increase numbers of drivers and guards and urged its staff to ""avoid premature strike action"". What does a train guard do? Rail strikes: What you need to know The strikes have coincided with a planned closure of Liverpool Lime Street for refurbishment, something the boss of Merseyrail, Jan Chaudhry-van der Velde, said ""doubled up the inconvenience"". Rail companies warned commuters that trains are running would be very busy and some beleaguered commuters chose to stay at home. The strikes have coincided with a planned closure of Liverpool Lime Street for refurbishment Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""There is no safety issue, on Northern they haven't even set out in detail plans for how the new trains are going to work. ""Merseyrail have bought new trains in the wake of a safety investigation that recommended they take this approach. ""I'm afraid leading figures of the RMT have made it clear they are in a political battle with the government and the passengers are pawns, and I feel desperately sorry for the passengers."" A Southern spokesman said: ""Today will be the 36th day of RMT strikes and we, like our passengers and the vast majority of our colleagues, simply want an end to this unnecessary dispute."" Passenger services director Angie Doll added: ""The RMT is striking about changes we made almost a year ago as part of our modernisation programme. ""Nobody has lost their job over this, in fact we employ more on-board staff to help passengers than we did before, and we are providing a better service with fewer cancelled trains."" Industrial action by London Underground drivers that would have coincided with the rail strike was called off Sharon Keith, regional director for Northern Rail, the operating name of Arriva Rail North, said she wanted to work with the unions. ""We're in the middle of a large modernisation agenda so we're investing in new trains [and] refurbished trains and what we want to do with our people is to modernise that role."" Jamie Burles, managing director of Greater Anglia, said all of the company's trains were operating ""as promised"". He added: ""Everywhere I've been all of our employees are working really well. ""The trains haven't all been on time because there's a couple of trees on the overhead lines but it's been been a good day with lots and lots of passengers."" RMT general secretary Mick Cash said union members ""stand solid, united and determined this morning in the latest phase of strike action"". ""Political and public support is flooding in as our communities choose to stand by their guards against the financially and politically motivated drive to throw safety-critical staff off our trains,"" he added. ""Again this morning I am calling on Theresa May and Chris Grayling to call off the centrally imposed blockade on serious talks in these disputes and allow us to get on with genuine negotiations with their contractors."" The union claimed members of the public were put at risk after the doors on one of Greater Anglia's trains was opened on the wrong side by stand-in conductors during Tuesday's strike action. It is understood the doors were incorrectly operated when the service arrived at Ipswich train station, but no passengers were hurt. The RMT claimed the rail company was ""using staff who have had a few days training rather than the four months required by the company's own standards"". But Greater Anglia said the stand-in staff had ""safely operated over 500 services"" and they had been ""fully trained and had to pass safety, competency and medical tests"". Allow Twitter content?

"Iraqi pro-government forces have made swift progress against IS in recent months Iraq's prime minister says its military has retaken Hawija, the main town in one of the last two enclaves of so-called Islamic State in the country. Haider al-Abadi told reporters that Hawija had been ""liberated"" as part of an operation launched two weeks ago. A few villages east of the town are believed to still be under IS control. Once they fall, IS will be left with only a stretch of the Euphrates river valley around al-Qaim, in the western desert near the border with Syria. The jihadist group still controls large parts of the valley in the neighbouring Syrian province of Deir al-Zour, but it is under pressure there from Syrian pro-government forces and a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters. 'New tape posted' of IS leader How Iraqi courts deal with IS suspects What happens after Islamic State leaves? The archaeological treasures IS failed to destroy Hawija, which lies 215km (135 miles) north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, has been a bastion of Sunni Arab insurgents since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. The town fell to IS in June 2014, when the jihadist group seized control of much of northern and western Iraq and proclaimed the creation of a ""caliphate"". But it was surrounded and cut off from other IS-held territory more than a year ago, when government forces advanced north towards the second city of Mosul. The offensive on Hawija began on 21 September and has involved army, police and special forces units, as well as the Shia-led paramilitary Popular Mobilisation. With the help of US-led coalition air strikes and military advisers, they recaptured the town of Shirqat on the second day and then moved steadily south-eastwards. On Wednesday, the operation's commander announced that troops had begun a major operation to ""liberate"" Hawija itself. They quickly breached jihadist defences in the north-western outskirts and stormed the town centre as night fell. Troops used a bulldozer to push over an IS sign outside Hawija Speaking at a press conference in Paris on Thursday morning after holding talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Abadi called the recapture of Hawija a ""victory not just of Iraq, but of the whole world"". But he said the victory had been achieved ""despite the crises that some people have tried to drag us into"" - an apparent reference to the referendum on independence held by the autonomous Kurdistan Region last week despite opposition from the government in Baghdad and the international community. Mr Abadi wants the Kurdistan Regional Government to annul the result - more than 90% voted in favour of secession - or face punitive sanctions, international isolation and possible military intervention. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said he did not want an armed confrontation with Kurds He banned direct international flights to the region last week and on Tuesday called for a ""joint administration"" in the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and other disputed areas that have been controlled by the Kurds since 2014 but claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government. ""We do not want an armed confrontation, we don't want clashes, but the federal authority must prevail and nobody can infringe on the federal authority,"" Mr Abadi said on Thursday.

"The industrial action is over plans to make train doors driver-only operated Train services have ended for the day in two companies affected by a second 24-hour strike by RMT members this week across England. All services have finished on Arriva Rail North and all but one have ended on Merseyrail. Both Southern and Greater Anglia said a lot of their services ran normally despite the 24-hour walkout. Unions say the industrial action is over plans to make train doors driver-only operated. Rail companies have said this means theguard's role will changebut some workers believe safety procedures would be compromised. Rail companies warned commuters trains that are running would be very busy and some beleaguered commuters chose to stay at home Union members at South Western have also voted to strike, but any action first needs to be agreed with the executive body. The operator said it planned to increase numbers of drivers and guards and urged its staff to ""avoid premature strike action"". What does a train guard do? Rail strikes: What you need to know The strikes have coincided with a planned closure of Liverpool Lime Street for refurbishment, something the boss of Merseyrail, Jan Chaudhry-van der Velde, said ""doubled up the inconvenience"". Rail companies warned commuters that trains are running would be very busy and some beleaguered commuters chose to stay at home. The strikes have coincided with a planned closure of Liverpool Lime Street for refurbishment Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""There is no safety issue, on Northern they haven't even set out in detail plans for how the new trains are going to work. ""Merseyrail have bought new trains in the wake of a safety investigation that recommended they take this approach. ""I'm afraid leading figures of the RMT have made it clear they are in a political battle with the government and the passengers are pawns, and I feel desperately sorry for the passengers."" A Southern spokesman said: ""Today will be the 36th day of RMT strikes and we, like our passengers and the vast majority of our colleagues, simply want an end to this unnecessary dispute."" Passenger services director Angie Doll added: ""The RMT is striking about changes we made almost a year ago as part of our modernisation programme. ""Nobody has lost their job over this, in fact we employ more on-board staff to help passengers than we did before, and we are providing a better service with fewer cancelled trains."" Industrial action by London Underground drivers that would have coincided with the rail strike was called off Sharon Keith, regional director for Northern Rail, the operating name of Arriva Rail North, said she wanted to work with the unions. ""We're in the middle of a large modernisation agenda so we're investing in new trains [and] refurbished trains and what we want to do with our people is to modernise that role."" Jamie Burles, managing director of Greater Anglia, said all of the company's trains were operating ""as promised"". He added: ""Everywhere I've been all of our employees are working really well. ""The trains haven't all been on time because there's a couple of trees on the overhead lines but it's been been a good day with lots and lots of passengers."" RMT general secretary Mick Cash said union members ""stand solid, united and determined this morning in the latest phase of strike action"". ""Political and public support is flooding in as our communities choose to stand by their guards against the financially and politically motivated drive to throw safety-critical staff off our trains,"" he added. ""Again this morning I am calling on Theresa May and Chris Grayling to call off the centrally imposed blockade on serious talks in these disputes and allow us to get on with genuine negotiations with their contractors."" The union claimed members of the public were put at risk after the doors on one of Greater Anglia's trains was opened on the wrong side by stand-in conductors during Tuesday's strike action. It is understood the doors were incorrectly operated when the service arrived at Ipswich train station, but no passengers were hurt. The RMT claimed the rail company was ""using staff who have had a few days training rather than the four months required by the company's own standards"". But Greater Anglia said the stand-in staff had ""safely operated over 500 services"" and they had been ""fully trained and had to pass safety, competency and medical tests"". Allow Twitter content?

"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: Well, that was... different. Theresa May's conference speech, in which she attempted to put the disappointment of the general election behind her and offer some plans for the future, was disrupted by coughing, croaking, letters falling off the slogan behind her and an unscheduled appearance by a comedian.But senior Conservatives, including cabinet ministers, have rallied round the prime minister, some praising her fortitude for continuing- and showing a sense of humour - amid the distractions. MP James Cleverley said he was ""proud"" of his leader, while former cabinet minister John Redwood commended her ""strong message"". The speech included several policies, including an extra Â£2bn to build 25,000 council houses and social homes for rent by 2021, anddraft legislation for a cap on standard tariff energy bills. However, it is thought that dozens of MPs are discussing the possibility of asking Mrs May to step aside - although it is far from clear they will get enough support to turn this into a reality. By Laura Kuenssberg, political editor For those who want her gone there are three obstacles. First, with Brexit negotiations under way, any change of leader could be destabilising at a time when the UK needs to look strong. Second, Tory MPs don't agree on who is her natural successor, and a leadership election could open a Pandora's Box with untold consequences. And third, many Tory MPs are terrified of a general election. Doing anything that could precipitate a national contest means their jobs are at risk.

"Patients are suffering due to long waits at Royal Cornwall Hospital Patients waiting for heart treatment have died and those waiting for ophthalmology care have lost their sight at Cornwall's main hospital, according to a report. NHS Improvement has placed Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust in special measures after an inspection from the Care Quality Commission (CQC). It said patients suffered harm as a result of waiting too long for care. The trust's chief executive has apologised. Get the latest on this and other stories in Cornwall Inspectors visited Royal Cornwall Hospital in July, after anearlier unannounced inspectionfound services had failed to improve since 2016. Thetrust was told to make a number of immediate improvementsafter concerns were raised about safety in the maternity and paediatric emergency departments and long waiting lists in cardiology and ophthalmology. In cardiology, 554 patients suffered delays waiting for appointments between December 2016 and June 2017. Two patients died of cardiac-related causes while on the waiting list. Inspectors said: ""While it is not possible to say the deaths were directly linked to the delay, the trust reported it was highly likely."" In ophthalmology, inspectors said long waits for treatment had caused harm to at least four patients ""who had suffered partial loss of vision or complete blindness as a result"". Inspectors also identified serious problems in maternity, with unsafe staffing levels and inadequate neonatal life-support training. By Tamsin Melville, BBC political reporter There's been a long period of instability at board level at RCHT, and various critical inspections and warnings over at least three years. Now, the Care Quality Commission is basically saying enough is enough - and that the people of Cornwall deserve better. It says during the latest inspection in July, and in previous visits, it has found persistent evidence of care that falls below standard - and that it's clear these are not isolated lapses. Worryingly, it also highlights some patients have been put at risk. The chief inspector of hospitals, Prof Ted Baker, said people in Cornwall were entitled to safe, effective, compassionate and high-quality care. He said inspectors repeatedly found ""persistent evidence of care that falls below those standards"". As a result, patients had been ""let down"" with some ""placed at risk"". But he paid tribute to staff at the trust, whom inspectors found to be caring and compassionate. RCHT chief executive Kathy Byrne said she took the CQC report ""very seriously"" and the trust was ""responding swiftly and effectively to every one of the CQC recommendations"". She said: ""I want to apologise to any patient who has waited too long for treatment or nor received the very best care."" Members of the public have reacted strongly to the news onBBC Radio Cornwall's Facbook page,external, sharing their experiences of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust, its services and its staff. Hannah Richards Dash said ""They need to stop closing cottage hospitals which also provide outpatient services"", adding this would free up beds at Royal Cornwall Hospital in Treliske and reduce waiting times. She described emergency staff at the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust as ""high trained and professional"", and said they had saved the lives her husband, son and father-in-law. But added the 40 minute travel time to A&E at Treliske from Penzance and some areas in the west of the county was ""not acceptable"". Diane Lowman Cahill said the staff at the hospital who helped her 11-year-old son were ""amazing"", and ""could not have done more to help"", but the level of care experienced by her grandmother was ""appalling"". Ms Cahill added new housing developments ""with no extra schools, doctors surgeries or hospitals"" as well as ""constant cutbacks"" had to have a negative effect on the trust. Deborah Nardone said her mother was almost blind in one eye after two years of waiting for appointments and ""mess up procedures"", which ended in her being told nothing could be done.

"Are children turning to pornography to educate themselves about sex? Are boys coercing girls to do things they later regret? A 24-year-old secondary school teacher tells the BBC she's shocked by the stories she hears from her teenage pupils. ""The language boys use to discuss sex and sexual acts is degrading and shows a lack of understanding of consent and the actual mutual respect required to have meaningful sex. ""The girls, equally, are taught not to respect their own bodies and don't comprehend the notion that they may be being used. ""There was one time when one of the girls, who was 14, was really upset and said to me, 'I sucked his dick and he doesn't love me - he told me he loved me and he doesn't.' ""That was the main thing that made me think these girls are being used. 'I didn't say no, but I regret that' ""I don't think anyone can say a 14 or 16-year-old girl has performed these sex acts and enjoyed it - they just go along with it. ""They're going along with it at the time, it's almost like it's an honour that they're chosen, especially if it's a popular boy, almost like a validation of their appearance and attractiveness - or they think it is. ""I don't think these girls are aware of their vulnerability. I think these girls - 14 plus - will look back and think, 'Yeah, I was coerced into that.' ""They get themselves into a situation naively and then they're in too deeply. ""You need to make the girls realise they are being objectified and used and make them aware they are vulnerable to this sort of thing. ""It's their right to say 'no' and that nobody should feel peer-pressured. ""If a boy doesn't want a photo of you or 'get with you' as they say, you're not attractive. ""It's a very sad state of affairs to have girls empowered by how boys think of them. ""It's as bad not to have had a boy take a sexual interest in you, in a 15-year-old's view, as it is to be constantly asked for photos. ""I think the boys are quite clever, they tend to go for the ones who can be manipulated - not all boys obviously. ""I was on break time duty and I heard a boy say 'I put my hand in her pants and it was like a forest and I was quick out of there.' ""It's the accepted norm amongst the girls that you shave it all off - a totally unspoken rule. ""That's a porn thing, where every single woman has got no pubic hair - I don't think you can say it's not. ""And if they're shaving improperly down there, they are putting their health at risk, for example, if they're using an old razor or a used one, they can increase their risk of infection. ""Schools do teach sex education, but it's focused on contraception, how not to get pregnant. ""It's not about loving meaningful relationships or about consent - that's not really covered. ""They know a lot about STIs [sexually transmitted infections] and condoms but not a lot about the meaningful aspect. ""I honestly think you've got to teach these kids more than about contraception. ""It needs a revolution. They need specialists coming in - teachers can see PHSE [personal, social, health and economic education] as a bit of an extra, they're certainly not specialists in it, it's an extra lesson or 20 minutes in form. ""A lot of teachers don't feel confident talking about these things. ""We're setting them up to go on to a porn website to learn about sex. I don't think they're going on there to get kicks, but to learn about sex and that obviously feeds into a whole societal thing. ""When I was at school there were problems with webcams and sex chats and msn messenger. ""But I can't remember boys talking about girls like this. ""I really don't know why it's spiralled. ""I think we can blame a lot of things on the porn industry, we can blame social media and the ease of access. ""But they're an infected generation that no longer sees the gravitas of sex.""
