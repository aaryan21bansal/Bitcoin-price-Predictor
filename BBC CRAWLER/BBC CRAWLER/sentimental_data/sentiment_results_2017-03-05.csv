"Bellew has now won 29 of his 32 fights Missed the fight? Listen to a repeat of the commentary every hour on Sunday from 06:00-13:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra WBC cruiserweight champion Tony Bellew produced a stunning upset to stop bitter rival David Haye in a thrilling heavyweight contest at London's O2 Arena. The Liverpudlian, 34, pounced when Haye suffered what turned out to be an Achilles injury in the sixth round to score a knockdown. Haye, who had his right ankle strapped, carried on as bravely as he could for the rest of the fight, but was unable to move freely as Bellew seized the momentum. And in the 11th, a second knockdown saw former heavyweight champion Haye tangled in the ropes, the towel enter from his corner and his hopes of a return to the world-title level of the sport left in tatters. Bellew - a big underdog with bookmakers - raced to trainer Dave Coldwell in celebration as he scored a victory which will likely filter through to non-boxing fans far more than his 2016 world-title win at Goodison Park did. Bellew: I asked Haye to throw in the towel Bellew broke his hand in early rounds of Haye bout Listen: 'Iâve beaten the best cruiserweight this country has ever produced' And the bitter war of words leading up to the fight ended with Bellew helping a limping and exhausted Haye back to his corner. The two embraced and the beaten, humbled Haye asked for a rematch during a lengthy post-fight interview before heading off to hospital to have surgery. Haye injured his right ankle in the sixth round The first round had those in the O2 Arena intrigued. A hate-fuelled slug-fest or artistic boxing? The latter won the day, with Bellew happy to see Haye jump in while he fired off solid replies in-between darting out of trouble. And so established a pattern, Haye taking the centre of the ring, Bellew nearer the ropes. As the established heavyweight stalked his man, often they stood statuesque for moments as Bellew looked for Haye's trigger - his own prompt to counter. But slipping shots can be a dangerous game and a straight right to Bellew's jaw in the fifth was audible ringside, though nothing could be heard in the sixth as the Arena screamed at the drama. Both men went down - Haye twice - though neither faced a count as their falls to the canvas were deemed slips but the sheer punch volume from Bellew then legally felled Haye, who looked stunned and shattered in answering a nine count. Bellew, who stressed his rival would start tiring after four rounds, was then able to dominate, dictating the pace and notably throwing everything at Haye in the seventh in attempt to bring an end to proceedings. Haye's low blow in the ninth summed up his increasing desperation and, two rounds later, his brave resistance was ended moments after a barrage of punches sent him sprawling through the ropes. Having clambered back into the ring, finally his camp threw in the towel, signalling the third defeat of a 31-fight career. Bellew, speaking to Radio 5 live:""He's probably the hardest puncher in the world, and he's so quick early on, he's like a sprinter. He can really hit but he can also take a few himself. ""In my eyes I've beaten the best cruiserweight this country has ever produced and one of the best heavyweights. I am honoured to fight in the same ring as him. I've looked up to him. ""He made the same mistake everybody else does. He underestimated me. Watch me on tape and I'm terrible but in the ring I'm harder to hit than you think."" Haye swung wildly at Bellew in the early rounds David Haye, also speaking to Radio 5 live:""I've knocked out guys a lot bigger and stronger but he has the heart of a lion. ""I gave it my best and it wasn't good enough. He was by far the better fighter tonight. He dug deep and took my best shots and put me down. ""I would love to do it again, I have never been in a fight like that. If the fans want to see it again I would do it again. We'll do it on his terms, in his town - he deserves it."" On his injury he said:""The ankle was just one of those things. The better man won on the night. ""It wasn't my night. I didn't land the good shots, I was in good shape but his game was better than mine. ""It felt like a Rocky movie and I was one punch away from knocking him out but I couldn't quite do it."" Haye was fighting in just his third fight since 2012 and he has now lost three times in his 31 fights Haye's graphic descriptions of his hopes of damaging Bellew in the run-up to the fight prompted concern from boxing authorities and undoubtedly turned some fans against him. But the bad blood meant the contest was expected to sell between 500,000 and 700,000 buys on pay-per-view. Eddie Hearn, Bellew's promoter, believed anything other than an explosive knockout would be a ""disaster"" for Haye, who will now have to either retire or embark on rebuilding his in-ring reputation. The 36-year-old will win plenty of plaudits for courageously battling on. But he was unable to land anything too meaningful prior to the critical sixth round. With this latest injury added to the reconstructive shoulder injury he received in 2013, have we seen the last of a fighter who once unified the cruiserweight division, won a heavyweight world title and of course took Wladimir Klitschko 12 rounds in defeat? A rematch with Bellew would be a money spinner, although many will call for retirement instead. Promoter Eddie Hearn on Radio 5 live:""We've got to go after a heavyweight world title for Bellew now. I am so pleased for him. He's secured the future for his family and they can live a wonderful life. ""He is everything you would want in a man, he has a big heart, never gives up, has a wonderful family and I am so happy for him."" Bellew is the reigning world cruiserweight champion Bellew's jump in weight to claim victory is perhaps even more impressive considering he has had just eight fights at cruiserweight, spending most of his career two divisions lower than the one he competed in in this exhilarating affair. He was an English champion at heavyweight at amateur, following in the footsteps of the ringside Frank Bruno, but few gave him hope - and those who did emphasised the survival mission he had on his hands in dodging Haye's early power. But he did, the 13 fights he has had since Haye briefly left the sport providing a sharpness his opposite number simply lacked. Roared on by the likes of Wayne Rooney and AP McCoy in attendance, he shone in a cauldron atmosphere, boxing admirably to complement his reputation as a power puncher. Bellew's stock has never been so high. Unification bouts in the cruiserweight division will likely present themselves and his adaptability in stepping up to over 200lbs could open doors in the sport's showpiece division. Haye and Bellew embraced at the end, despite the heated build-up to the fight Boxing pundit Steve Bunce on BBC Radio 5 live How much of an impact did that injury of Haye's have? I had Haye up four rounds to one going into the sixth but he didn't win a round after the injury. That was pure bravery and guts and up there with anything I've ever seen. They went to hell. It was sensational, scary but sensational. Had David Haye won in the first round or the 11th round, we wouldn't have questioned his eligibility to chase any heavyweight. Bellew didn't mention Anthony Joshua, so go and chase it, put an offer out to Joseph Parker, put an offer out to Deontay Wilder. In the summer, at Goodison Park, there will be enough money on the table to get those guys in the ring.

"It's 26 years since I set off to try my luck as a journalist in Moscow. I had a rucksack, a Russian phrasebook, and the expectation of adventure. What I hadn't anticipated wasâ¦ pets. Within a year there was an insistent scratching sound on my apartment door. I opened it to find a scrawny stray ginger cat. Grace strolled in from a dark, pungent stairwell and declared (in that blank, unimpressed way that Russians often have with strangers) that this would do just fine. Oh, and she was pregnant. After that, Grace left our flat just once - slipping on an icy windowsill and falling three storeys. On the phone, the vet loftily declared that she'd be fine: ""Only falls of between five and 10 storeys are fatal here. Anything higher or lower is perfectly safe."" Besides, it was winter. Plenty of snow. Nearly 10 years later - still serenely unimpressed by life - Grace, and one of her sons, flew with us from Moscow to Nairobi. Kenya meant good weather, the unfamiliar pleasure of friendly strangers, birds big enough to grab an inexperienced cat, and a house with a garden. Suddenly a dog seemed possible. Maybe even necessary. Like most of our neighbours in Nairobi, we had a night guard who wandered around the garden holding a big stick until we were asleep and then settled down on two chairs to snore his way through the rest of the night. Perhaps a dog would help. We found Lily in languid, rural Karen, on the edge of the Rift Valley. She'd recently been born to Tamu and General Gordon - a Labrador retriever couple. Others in the same litter ended up with Nairobi diplomats and soon grew uncomfortably plump on the crust-less sandwiches they sourced at garden parties. Lily quickly made it clear that guarding was not in her skill set. She enjoyed eating unfamiliar objects and playing with our young children - but she was understandably terrified of Grace the cat, and equally scared of the dark. And of strangers. And of wildlife. Not that it seemed to matter. In much of Africa dogs are not generally perceived according to their breed or temperament. They are simply dogs. Things to be wary of. Things that police and guards tend to set on people. So it's possible, I suppose that blonde, enthusiastic Lily may inadvertently have given a few Nairobi burglars second thoughts. Either way, four years later, we moved to Singapore. Small, safe, steamy. The immaculate kennels where Lily served her three months of quarantine even offered air conditioning. We had a garden, once again - now frequented by large snakes, and by larger monitor lizards with their wide, grotesque mouths. Lily stayed indoors. Grace too. And over time I became properly acquainted with the complex, haphazard, expensive world of international pet transportation. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 BST and Saturdays at 11:30 BST Moving around the former Soviet Union had been rather easy. Vets, for instance, were often happy to backdate or forge whatever certificates seemed appropriate. Bribery wasn't just an option, it was an integral part of the process. In Singapore, then Thailand, then briefly in France, and now in South Africa, it's a more unpredictable affair. Nine years ago, I sat with Grace on my lap, in a Bangkok vet's office, quietly pleading with him to put her down. She was 18 years old, had days to live, and was in obvious pain. The vet nodded, smiled sympathetically, and then explained that that wasn't part of Thai culture. Grace and son in Moscow I took Grace home. She died. And a week later she was given a proper send-off at a local Buddhist temple - one catering specially for pets. I like to think she would have been unimpressed. Then, of course, there's the paperwork, and what I've discovered to be the fundamental, immutable law of pet migration. The stricter and more extensive the requirements ahead of travel - for passports, jabs, microchips, special crates, transit fees and all the rest of it - the bigger the smiles of the customs officials at the destination airport, as they wave away your dossier full of hard-won paperwork without a glance, and crouch down to stroke the new arrival. Last week I took Lily to the vet here in Johannesburg. She's 16 now - Lily, that is - and getting a little unsteady. She's also quite happily deaf, which means the summer thunderstorms here no longer send her frantic with fear. Unlike their Thai counterparts, South Africans vets always seem to be offering to put pets down. It's as if they have a quota to fill. But all Lily needed was her nails clipping. She's sitting with me here as I write this at home. Her large ears lifting inquisitively. An elderly, cosmopolitan Kenyan.

"Fed up with what she felt was mismanagement at her hospital, gynaecologist Homa Amiri Kakar had walked out of her job in a remote part of Afghanistan and returned to the capital. But just a week later she agreed to go back, guilt-stricken about the women she had deserted, as the BBC's Sarah Buckley and Asif Maroof report. ""I am deeply unhappy that I left behind patients, especially female patients in remote villages - they are not in a condition to explain all types of their sickness to male doctors - so it would be very difficult without a female doctor,"" she says. Religious and cultural mores mean that women rarely visit male doctors for any condition, never mind a gynaecological one, and Dr Kakar, 39, realised that leaving her post in Paktika province left her patients dangerously vulnerable. ""Many times if there is not a female doctor many symptoms will remain untold by females and could cause a big problem, and even lead to their deaths,"" she told the BBC. Dr Kakar (R) had told the health minister Ferozuddin Feroz (L) she was not happy with her working conditions If the patient's husband, father or other male relative cannot or will not find a way of transporting her to an area where there is a female doctor on hand, then she will simply not receive treatment, says ex-health minister Soraya Dalil, now Afghan ambassador to Switzerland. ""In Afghanistan the decisions are usually made by men... if they are a female patient then it depends on the male member of the family if they want to take the female to the doctor, or to take her to another area of the country where there is a female,"" she said. One woman on the other side of Afghanistan - in Herat province - told the BBC a neighbour died in childbirth before her eyes because she needed medical help and there were no female doctors available in her district. Her husband was too poor to arrange transport to a hospital which did have a female doctor. BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. We create documentaries, features and interviews about their lives, giving more space for stories that put women at the centre.

And in Paktia province a six-year-old girl narrowly escaped the same fate, Dr Kakar says. The girl had been married by her family to a 45-year-old man and sex with him had caused her to bleed and develop an infection. Because there was no female doctor in the area where she lived no-one could examine her and work out what was the matter. It was only after severe bleeding that her father eventually took her to a hospital some distance away that did have a female medic on hand. The authorities intervened and separated her from her husband and she is now living in a shelter. Whilst there is a lack of female doctors, there has been a major push in recent years by NGOs and health officials to train up more midwives. A report by UNFPA and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2002 found that for every 100,000 live births, some 1,600 women died from causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. But according to the UN,this has now fallen to 396 per 100,000 women. By contrast, the UK rate is 9 per 100,000 women.,external There has been recent investment in midwifery care in Afghanistan The Afghan government says this success is due to a concerted training programme for midwives -which have increased from 437 in 2002 to 4,600 last year.,external However Dr Kakar says that there is still insufficient midwifery presence in the province she works in because hospitals are not recruiting them - instead midwives are encouraged to make home visits. But she says they need to be under the authority of a hospital where they can receive proper mentoring by doctors. She also said that all too often unqualified unofficial midwives are operating in the community - offering women medicine without prescription, sometimes with fatal results. Elyas Wahdat, the governor of the province Dr Kakar has returned to, says they need more women doctors. ""We have many facilities and equipment but unfortunately the female doctors are not coming to Paktika,"" he said. Decades of under-developed female education means there are not many women doctors available in the country. This video can not be played Training midwives in Afghanistan ""Now the residents are being persuaded to send their girls to school - this year is the first year we graduated girls from school, and they are due to sit their exam for entering the university - but still we need another five years until they graduate [from university],"" he said. Under the Taliban, girls were almost completely excluded from school and university but according to the Afghan Ministry of Education today there are more than 9 million students enrolled in schools, 40% of whom are girls. Many schoolchildren learn outside in dangerous circumstances But according to the Brookings Institute only 21% of girls finish even primary education, due to factors such as cultural barriers, early marriage, a lack of female teachers and long and dangerous routes to school. In its annual report on Afghanistan, the UN said that as a result ofground fighting between militants and troops in civilian areas3,498 civilians were killed and 7,920 wounded in 2016, a 3% rise on 2015. The number of children killed or injured jumped by a quarter to its highest level to date. ""The other element is providing sufficient equipment for their education so the family should realise that if they send their girls to schools there is good equipment and teachers there so it's not a waste of time,"" says Soraya Dalil. Dr Kakar is clear that Paktika province needs her. ""I strongly feel that it's better for a female doctor to be there, that's why I accepted the request by the minister to go back.""

"Julia says her current job is a good opportunity, but on a previous flower farm she was sexually harassed Female flower pickers in Kenya can face many hardships in their work - often finding themselves victims of sexual harassment or earning a wage so low they struggle to get by - but initiatives are in place to try to improve the workers' rights. As Julia prepares for the start of the working week, a discarded pile of jumpers and jeans are flung from a wire rack on to a sunken mattress on the floor. She has a busy day ahead, picking roses on the local flower farm, and she wants to impress her new manager. ""It was an opportunity I couldn't refuse,"" she explains, ushering the youngest of her five children out the door. ""Regular work, a school nearby and a new home. Here in rural Kenya, there isn't anything else for women like me."" Glancing out of the window of the minibus as it skirts around the shores of serene Lake Naivasha, 100km (62 miles) north of Nairobi, she points out the rays of sun bouncing off calm waters. It's easy to see why families flock here during the harvesting season. But beyond the vibrant fields of freshly cut roses and chrysanthemums, it's claimed that workers' rights are being exploited on an industrial scale, with allegations of low pay, unfair dismissals and sexual harassment of the predominantly female workforce. ""Men complain that when we wear skirts, they feel like having sex with us. We have to be careful,"" says Julia. ""That's why it's important that I am dressed appropriately."" Julia, who does not want to give her last name, recently left a role on a farm nearby after she refused to have sex with her male supervisor. She is hopeful that her new job on a farm certified by Fairtrade International will offer more protection. Fairtrade Africa says female workers need to be empowered Aware of the frequency of incidents of sexual assault, Fairtrade has set up a gender committee on each of its 39 flower farms in Kenya, which encourages women to report violations. Tsitsi Choruma, global gender adviser and chief operating officer for Fairtrade Africa, believes these structures are necessary to ensure harassment is reported. ""We need to build confidence - the softer skills mean these women are able to talk. We must build the power within them. We also need to involve men to enhance equality and empowerment."" But for the remaining 60% of flower farms in Kenya that do not have the Fairtrade reporting structures in place, holding perpetrators to account is complex. Andrew Odete, regional project manager at Hivos International, a Kenyan human rights organisation, says that more needs to be done to address the sexual harassment of female staff. ""Many women live in fear of losing their marriages if they are accused of being complicit in that act. Because of power relations, if it is the director or the manager accused of a violation, the choice as to who must leave is an easy one for many farms."" Some workers say they don't earn enough to sustain themselves Low pay is also rife across the horticulture sector in Kenya. On average, a harvester earns between $60 to $120 per month, falling far below what workers require to sustain themselves. At a farm on the southern shores of Lake Naivasha, flower harvester Daisy shuffles languidly towards the bus stop at the end of her shift. She says that she is concerned her salary is not enough to support her family. ""I earn around $50 per month. That money is too small. It's not enough to feed myself and it's much too little to provide food for my children."" Kenya country profile Kenya's blooming flower industry While discussions about a minimum wage are continuing within the horticulture sector, Stephen Oburo from the Federation of Kenyan Employers, an affiliate of Kenya's Labour Ministry, claims that the onus should be shifted to employees rather than employers in order to exercise fair workers' rights. ""If these women can't even inform union leaders or the Ministry of Labour about their wages, they are doing a disservice to themselves and this country,"" he states. ""Do they want us to put a policeman on each farm to make sure these violations don't happen? We don't have the resources to do that."" For many flower harvesters, safeguarding their rights is primarily managed by trade unions and local non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Jane Ngige, chief executive of the Kenya Flower Council, says that supporting farms to come up with innovative answers to old problems will be the next step forward. Jane Ngige says new initiatives are having a big impact on workers' lives ""When women get their wages, they lose their money to thieves. They are often attacked on the way home, or their husbands find 'better ways' for them to use that money. In response, the farms installed ATMs. These women are now running bank accounts and you cannot imagine what an impact that has had on these workers."" The role that consumers in Europe play can also make an impact, Andrew Odete from Hivos says. ""We have found that there is a willingness by the consumer to pay 35 euro cents (30p) per bouquet of flowers in order that that money comes back upstream and translates into a liveable wage for a worker on the farms of Lake Naivasha."" But for women like Daisy without the reporting structures in place to address violations of workers' rights, she hopes that this role will be a short-term fix. ""When I get a better job, I will go. I don't mind where. Anywhere would be better than here."" Kenya country profile Kenya's blooming flower industry.

"It's no secret that the Russians have long tried to plant ""sleeper agents"" in the US - men and women indistinguishable from normal Americans, who live - on the surface - completely normal lives. But what happens when one of them doesn't want to go home? Jack Barsky died in September 1955, at the age of 10, and was buried in the Mount Lebanon Cemetery in the suburbs of Washington DC. His name is on the passport of the man sitting before me now - a youthful 67-year-old East German, born Albert Dittrich. The passport is not a fake. Albert Dittrich is Jack Barsky in the eyes of the US government. The story of how this came to be is, by Barsky's own admission, ""implausible"" and ""ridiculous"", even by the standards of Cold War espionage. But as he explains in a new memoir, Deep Undercover, it has been thoroughly checked out by the FBI. As far as anyone can tell, it is all true. It began in the mid-70s, when Dittrich, destined at the time to become a chemistry professor at an East German university, was talent-spotted by the KGB and sent to Moscow for training in how to behave like an American. His mission was to live under a false identity in the heart of the capitalist enemy, as one of an elite band of undercover Soviet agents known as ""illegals"". ""I was sent to the United States to establish myself as a citizen and then make contact, to the extent possible, at the highest levels possible of decision makers - particularly political decision makers,"" he says. This ""idiotic adventure,"" as he now calls it, had ""a lot of appeal to an arrogant young man, a smart young man"" intoxicated by the idea of foreign travel and living ""above the law"". This video can not be played ""This kind of double life wears on you"" He arrived in New York in the Autumn of 1978, at the age of 29, posing as a Canadian national, William Dyson. Dyson, who had travelled via Belgrade, Rome, Mexico City and Chicago, ""immediately vanished into thin air"", having served his purpose. And Dittrich began his new life as Jack Barsky. He was a man with no past and no identification papers - except for a birth certificate obtained by an employee of the Soviet embassy in Washington, who had kept his eyes open during a walk in the Mount Lebanon cemetery. Barsky had supreme self-confidence, a near-flawless American accent, and $10,000 in cash. He also had a ""legend"" to explain why he did not have a social security number. He told people he had had a ""tough start in life"" in New Jersey and had dropped out of high school. He had then worked on a remote farm for years before deciding ""to give life another chance and move back to New York city"". He rented a room in a Manhattan hotel and set about the laborious task of building a fake identity. Over the next year, he parlayed Jack Barsky's birth certificate into a library card, then a driver's licence and, finally, a social security card. But without qualifications in Barsky's name, or any employment history, his career options were limited. Rather than rubbing shoulders with the upper echelons of American society, as his KGB handlers had wanted, he initially found himself delivering parcels to them, as a cycle courier in the smarter parts of Manhattan. The young KGB agent arrived in New York in the late 1970s ""By chance it turned out that the messenger job was actually really good for me to become Americanised because I was interacting with people who didn't care much where I came from, what my history was, where I was going,"" he says. ""Yet I was able to observe and listen and become more familiar with American customs. So for the first two, three years I had very few questions that I had to answer."" The advice from his handlers on blending in - gleaned from Soviet diplomats and resident agents in the US - ""turned out to be, at minimum, weak but, at worst, totally false"", he says. ""I'll give you an example. One of the things I was told explicitly was to stay away from the Jews. Now, obviously, there is anti-Semitism in there, but secondly, the stupidity of that statement is that they sent me to New York. There are more Jews in New York than in Israel, I think."" Barsky would later use his handlers' prejudices and ignorance of American society against them. But as a ""rookie"" agent he was eager to please and threw himself into the undercover life. He spent much of his free time zig-zagging across New York on counter-surveillance missions designed to flush out any enemy agents who might be following him. He would update Moscow Centre on his progress in weekly radio transmissions, or letters in secret writing, and deposit microfilm at dead drop sites in various New York parks, where he would also periodically pick up canisters stuffed with cash or the fake passports he needed for his trips back to Moscow for debriefing. He would return the to the East every two years, where he would be reunited with his German wife Gerlinde, and young son Matthias, who had no idea what he had been up to. They thought he was doing top secret but very well-paid work at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Barsky's handlers were delighted with his progress except for one thing - he could not get hold of an American passport. This failure weighed heavily on him. On one early trip to the passport office in New York an official asked him to fill out a questionnaire which asked, among other things, the name of the high school he had attended. ""I had a legend but it could not be verified,"" he says. ""So if somebody went to check on that they would have found out that I wasn't real."" Terrified that his cover might be blown, he scooped up any documents with his name on them and marched out of the office in a feigned temper at all this red tape. The real Jack Barsky is buried in a Washington DC cemetery Without a passport, Barsky was limited to low-level intelligence work and his achievements as a spy were, by his own account, ""minimal"". He profiled potential recruits and compiled reports on the mood of the country during events such as the 1983 downing of a Korean Airlines flight by a Soviet fighter, which ratcheted up tensions between the US and the Soviet Union. On one occasion, he flew to California to track down a defector (he later learned, to his immense relief, that the man, a psychology professor, had not been assassinated). He also carried out some industrial espionage, stealing software from his office - all of it commercially available - which was spirited away on microfilm to aid the floundering Soviet economy. But it often seemed the very fact of him being in the US, moving around freely without the knowledge of the authorities, was enough for Moscow. ""They were very much focused on having people on the other side just in case of a war. Which I think, in hindsight, was pretty stupid. That indicated very old thinking."" The myth of the ""Great Illegals"" - heroic undercover agents who had helped Russia defeat the Nazis and gather vital pre-war intelligence in hostile countries - loomed large over the Soviet intelligence agencies, who spent a lot of time and effort during the Cold War trying to recapture these former glories, with apparently limited success. Barsky later found out that he was part of a ""third wave"" of Soviet illegals in the US - the first two waves having failed. And we now know that illegals continued to be infiltrated in the 1980s and beyond. He believes about ""10 to 12"" agents were trained up at the same time as him. Some, he says, could still be out there, living undercover in the United States, though he finds it hard to believe that anyone exposed to life in the US would retain an unwavering communist faith for long. He is scathing about his KGB handlers, who were ""very smart"" and the ""cream of the crop"" but who seemed chiefly concerned with making his mission appear a success to please their bosses. ""The expectations of us, of me - I didn't know anybody else - were far, far too high. It was just really wishful thinking,"" he now says of his mission. On the other hand, the KGB's original plan for him might actually have worked, he says. ""I am glad it didn't work out because I could have done some damage. ""The idea was for me to get genuine American documentation and move to Europe, say to a German-speaking country, where the Russians were going to set me up with a flourishing business. And they knew how to do that. ""And so I would become quite wealthy and then go back to the United States without having to explain where the money came from. At that point, I would have been in a situation to socialise with people that were of value."" This plan fell through because of his failure to get a passport, so the KGB reverted to Plan B. This was for Barsky was to study for a degree and gradually work his way up the social order to the point where he could gather useful intelligence - a mission he describes as ""nearly impossible"". The degree part was relatively straightforward. He was, after all, a university professor in his former life. He graduated top of his class in computer systems at Baruch College, which enabled him to get a job as a programmer at Met Life insurance in New York. Like many undercover agents before him, he began to realise that much of what he had been taught about the West - that it was an ""evil"" system on the brink of economic and social collapse - was a lie. Barsky (fourth right) felt at home with co-workers at Met Life ""There was a way to rationalise that because we were taught that the West was doing so well because they took all the riches out of the Third World,"" he says. But, he adds, ""what eventually softened my attitude"" was the ""normal, nice people"" he met in his daily life. ""[My] sense was that the enemy was not really evil. So I was always waiting to eventually find the real evil people and I didn't even find them in the insurance company."" Met Life almost felt like home, he says, ""because it was a very paternalistic, 'we take care of you' kind of a culture"". ""There was nothing like we were taught. Nothing that I expected. I wanted to really hate the people and the country and I couldn't bring myself to hate them. Not even dislike them."" But he was keeping a far bigger secret from his KGB bosses than his wavering commitment to communism. In 1985, he had married an illegal immigrant from Guyana he had met through a personal ad in the Village Voice newspaper - and they now had a daughter together. He now had two families to go with his two identities, and he knew the time would come when he had to choose between them. It finally happened in 1988, when after 10 years undercover he was suddenly ordered to return home immediately. Moscow was in a panic, believing the FBI was on to him. To do anything other than run as ordered - grab his emergency Canadian birth certificate and driver's licence and get out of the US - would be potentially suicidal. He dithered and stalled for a week. Could he really leave his beloved baby daughter Chelsea behind forever? But the KGB was losing patience. One morning, on a subway platform a resident agent delivered a chilling message: ""You have got to come home or else you're dead."" This video can not be played The Americans producers: 'Here was someone who lived it' It was time for some lateral thinking. From discussions with his handlers in Moscow, Barsky had come to believe the Soviet hierarchy feared three things about America. He already knew about their anti-Semitism and their fear of Ronald Reagan, who they saw as an unpredictable religious zealot who might launch a nuclear strike to ""accelerate"" the Biblical ""end times"". But he also remembered their ""morally superior"" attitude to the Aids epidemic - their belief that it ""served the Americans right"" and their determination to protect the motherland from infection. Barsky stalled a bit more and then hatched a plan. ""I wrote this letter, in secret writing, that I wouldn't come back because I had contracted Aids, and the only way for me to get treatment would be in the United States. ""I also told the Russians in the same letter that I would not defect, I would not give up any secrets. I would just disappear and try to get healthy."" To begin with Barsky lived in constant fear for his life, remembering that threat on the subway platform. But after a few months, he began to breathe more easily. ""I started thinking 'I think I got away with this.' The FBI had not knocked on the door. The KGB had not done anything."" He gradually let his guard down and settled into the life of a typical middle-class American in a comfortable new home in upstate New York. While he had fallen for the American Dream and the trappings of the consumer society, he still had some conflicting feelings. ""My loyalties to communism and the homeland and Russia, they were still pretty strong. My resignation, you can also call it a 'soft defection' - that was triggered by having this child here. It was not ideological. It would be easy to claim that. But it wasn't true."" Playing at the back of his mind was always the question of whether his past would catch up with him. And, finally, one day, it did. The man who exposed him was a KGB archivist, Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin, who defected to the West in 1992 - after the fall of communism - with a vast trove of Soviet secrets, including the true identity of Jack Barsky. The FBI watched him for more than three years, even buying the house next door to his as they tried to figure out whether he really was a KGB agent and, if so, whether he was still active. The Soviet Union began using ""illegal"" agents, living in Europe under false identities, as early as 1919 Unlike ""resident agents"", who are in the country legally as diplomats, they are not immune from prosecution if caught The first illegal was sent to the US in 1921, according to the Mitrokhin archive Famous illegals include Rudolf Abel, unmasked as a Soviet spy in the US in 1957, and Richard Sorge, who posed as a Nazi journalist in Japan during the war In 2010, 10 Russian ""sleeper agents"" on a long-term mission to spy on US policy makers were exposed - including Anna Chapman (pictured) In the end, Barsky himself gave the game away, during an argument with his wife, Penelope, that was picked up by the FBI's bugs. ""I was trying to repair a marriage that was slowly falling apart. I was trying to tell my wife the 'sacrifice' I had made to stay with Chelsea and her. So in the kitchen I told her, 'By the way, this is what I did. I am a German. I used to work for the KGB and they told me to come home and I stayed here with you and it was quite dangerous for me. This is what I sacrificed.' ""And that completely backfired. Instead of bringing her over to my side, she said: 'What does that mean for me if they ever catch you?'"" It was the evidence the FBI needed to pick him up. In a meticulously planned operation, Barsky was pulled over by a Pennsylvania state trooper as he drove away from a toll booth on his way home from work one evening. After stepping out of his car, he was approached by a man in civilian clothes, who held up a badge and said in a calm voice: ""Special agent Reilly, FBI. We would like to talk with you."" The colour drained from Barsky's face. ""I knew the gig was up,"" he says. But with characteristic bravado he asked the FBI man: ""What took you so long?"" He kidded around with Joe Reilly and the other agents who interrogated him, and tried to give them as much information about the KGB's operations as he could. But inside he was panicking that he would be sent to jail and that his American family, which he had been trying to hold together, would be broken up. In fact, luck was on his side. After passing a lie-detector test he was told that he was free to go and, even more remarkably, that the FBI would help him fulfil his dream of becoming an American citizen. Reilly, who went on to become Barsky's best friend and golfing partner, even visited the elderly parents of the real Jack Barsky, who agreed not to reveal that their son's identity had been stolen. ""I was so lucky and so was my family that the decision-makers were nice enough to say, 'Well, you were so well-established, we don't want to disrupt your life,'"" he says. ""It required some interesting gymnastics to make me legal because one thing I didn't have was proof of entry into the country. I came here on documentation that was fraudulently obtained, so it took 10-plus years to finally become a citizen. And when it did, it felt good."" Barsky's coveted American passport Barsky is now married for a third time and has a young daughter. He has also found God, completing his journey from a hardline communist and atheist to a churchgoing, all-American patriot. He has even managed to reconnect with the family he left behind in Germany, although his first wife, Gerlinde, is still not speaking to him. ""I have a very good relationship with Matthias, my son, and his wife. And I am now a grandfather. When we talk about things like Americans playing soccer against Germans, I say 'us'. I mean the Americans. I am not German any more. The metamorphosis is complete."" The final act in his story came two years ago when he revealed the secret of his extraordinary double life on the US current affairs programme, 60 Minutes. He had long wanted to share his story with the world, but his bosses at the New York electricity company where he worked as a software developer were less than impressed to find they had a former KGB agent on the payroll, and promptly fired him. Barsky says he has no regrets. He knows how fortunate he has been. ""This kind of double life wears on you. And most people can't handle it. I am not saying that I lived a charmed life but I got away with it. ""I am in good health. I have had some issues with alcohol that I have overcome and I got another chance to have a good family life. And another child. And I am finally getting to live the life that I should have lived a long time ago. I am really lucky."" Perhaps the supreme irony of Jack Barsky's story is that he was only able to complete the mission the KGB had set him - to obtain an American passport and citizenship - with the help of the FBI. He cannot resist a smile at the thought of telling his KGB handlers that he has not been such a failure after all. ""I wouldn't mind meeting one or two of those fellows I worked with and saying 'Hey, see I did it!'""

"This video can not be played How tech investor Barry Eggers' whip-round at Saint Francis High School led to an incredible windfall It's no coincidence thatthe school that banked millions this weekby investing early in Snapchat is in the middle of Mountain View, California. When the parents of your students are some of the world's wealthiest technology investors then, well, it's smart to make the most of it. Saint Francis High School's incredible windfall wasn't a fluke - it was the result of a patient process which began in 1990, when it set up a development fund to raise cash for the school. The fund has been bankrolled by parents and alumni who know their stuff - particularly when it comes to making bets on technology stock. At $17,000 a year for tuition, the school isn't exactly strapped for cash. Its campus, where I spent Friday morning, is leafy, green and well-equipped outside and in. The 1,760 students that come here are lucky, privileged, and most likely on their way to great things. The development fund was set up to, among other things, provide money for scholarships that are offered out to kids from less well-off families in the area. And with the Snap deal, the fund has swollen to phenomenal new heights - $24m so far, with many more millions set to come. All from a $15,000 investment. It made me wonder - why doesn't this kind of thing happen more often? $15,000 is small change to the budgets of venture capital firms around the world, particularly in Silicon Valley where $25bn was invested in tech companies in 2016 - an apparently ""bad"" year. Most schools can't afford to put together a fund like Saint Francis. But then, why should they need to? What if investment firms allowed a small slice of the money they invest to be kept by for schools, charities or other needy causes so that if and when the ship comes in, it's life changing for the many rather than the few? ""I think in Silicon Valley especially, or places with a lot of entrepreneurship, I think it's great for investors to reach out to local institutions and schools and see if they can include them in some of their deals,"" said Barry Eggers, founding partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, the firm that led Snap's first investment round. This week that investment became worth more than a billion dollars. The school set up a development fund in 1990 It was Mr Eggers' idea to involve Saint Francis in the deal five years ago, based on the enthusiasm of his children, who loved Snapchat. ""They were sitting around the kitchen table one day and they were all on their cellphones laughing. They said 'Dad, have you seen this app, Snapchat?' ""My daughter said 'I used to use it five times a day, now I use it 30 times a day!'."" He sees no reason why the success at Saint Francis can't be emulated at other schools - but it won't happen easily. ""These institutions have to have a programme. It can't be a one-off, that's not going to work. They have to commit to doing this."" His point is it takes time and money, and it's about playing the numbers. Schools won't be able to just invest $15,000, sit back for a few years and see the success roll in. There will be vastly more misses than hits. At Saint Francis, as school president Simon Chiu was fielding questions from the nation's media, the music of Bruno Mars soundtracked a dancing competition, an event held as part of a week of activities designed to de-stress students. The school didn't want us disrupting the day, or the dance-off, so we weren't able to get the view of the kids in what right now is America's most talked about school. That's a shame, as the future of Snapchat rests in high schools like this one across the country, and eventually - if the app can grow as investors hope - the entire world. But only if it remains ""cool"". Just as Mr Eggers' daughter was the early-adopter that predicted Snap's success, the students that are studying at the school nowadays would be the harshest critics of whether or not it will succeed. Maybe they've already moved onto the next big thing. ""Certainly we know that kids are the first people to figure out what's hot and what's new and what's desirable,"" said Mr Chiu. He too hopes the school's success will lead other venture capital firms to work in the same way. ""I think this is an amazing way for venture capital folks, or companies, to share these experiences with schools. ""I would hope that companies would look at this as an example of something they can do to help their local community."" Paying more tax would be a better way, of course, but that's a debate for another day. For now, Silicon Valley is basking in the enjoyment of a huge success that will trickle down into the tech start-up ecosystem, meaning more money for new companies. A success like Snap is rare. But deals happen here every day - acquisitions and exits that have created a new breed of super rich. As California's newest billionaires celebrate this weekend, perhaps we should imagine the impact if every big deal held aside just a few thousand dollars at the beginning for a good cause. It would allow the needy causes to accumulate real wealth. Now that would be truly disruptive, wouldn't it? Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,externalandon Facebook,external.

"Senior DUP figures say leader Arlene Foster's position is safe, despite the party's poor showing in the election Former first minister Arlene Foster predicted a brutal election campaign but she didn't expect such a brutal result for unionism. For the first time in the history of Northern Ireland unionistsno longer hold the majority at Stormont. And it happened under the watch of a DUP leader who, 10 months ago, was electoral gold dust. In the end, just 1,168 votes separated the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in - a gap which is sure to spook unionists. The DUP has lost its veto. Without the magic 30 seats the party can no longer play the petition of concern card. But it may call on the support of some like-minded unionists when it feels the need to block legislation. Sinn FÃ©in toasts election surge Q&A: NI Assembly Election 2017 In quotes: Leaders react Nesbitt steps down as UUP leader Much will depend on its relationship with the new leader of the Ulster Unionists. The make up of the next Executive is also set to change. The DUP will no longer have four ministers around table: They will drop to three - Sinn FÃ©in will have two. But those figures will change if the SDLP and Ulster Unionists decide to remain in opposition: They are entitled to one seat each at the Executive table. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood fought the election to enter government, but only if the conditions after the negotiations are to his liking. If he turns his back on government, then he will have to make room on the ""official"" opposition benches for the Alliance party. Mike Nesbitt suggested Northern Ireland wasn't ready for post-sectarian politics Having won 8.8% of the vote, it has now passed the threshold to gain ""official"" status. But what direction will the leaderless Ulster Unionists now take, and who will make that call if the Executive returns? As Mike Nesbitt discovered, big bold moves don't always pay dividends, especially if those standing on your shoulder quietly don't agree. One unionist who did emerge unscathed is ready and willing to return to her post. Former Justice Minister Clare Sugden says she wants ""to finish the job she started"". But will those who sat with her around that table have the same drive to finish the job they started?

"This video can not be played John Dean spoke to BBC radio about Watergate The row over the US attorney general's denial that he met a Russian official when he had in fact done so is leading to comparisons with the most notorious political scandal in US history - Watergate. The events of 1972 led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon, who resigned after a web of political spying, sabotage and bribery was exposed by the media. Among the most prominent voices linking Trump and Watergate is Nixon lawyer John Dean, then described by the FBI as the ""master manipulator of the cover up"". ""I have been hearing echoes of Watergate ever since this presidency started,"" he told the BBC. ""We are not at Watergate 2.0 yet but we are certainly seeing trends and [Jeff] Sessions dissembling in front of the Senate is just another one."" Mr Trump himself has also taken to referencing Watergate, though not for the same reasons. In atweet,externalhe accused Barack Obama of tapping his phones in during the election, sparking a new row. The name, Watergate, refers to an office and hotel complex in Washington where five men were arrested in June 1972 trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Nixon became the only US president to resign from the job The break-in was traced to Nixon supporters. The Senate investigated and in April 1974 President Nixon released edited tapes of his conversations about Watergate. In July the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee approved impeachment. In August, Nixon admitted he had been aware of the cover-up and had tried to halt the FBI's inquiry. Four days later, he became the only US president to resign. But are there really parallels between the Trump administration's alleged links to Russia and what happened 45 years ago? One similarity is that the DNC, the target of the Watergate break-in, was also targeted in last year's US election campaign, when emails were stolen and leaked. US intelligence agencies say Russia was behind the DNC hack, though Russia denies any involvement. Can US election hack be traced to Russia? Russia is believed to have wanted Mr Trump to win the election. An unverified report apparently compiled by a private intelligence firm claimed Russia had compromising information on Mr Trump and was in a position to blackmail him. Trump's 'Russian dossier' â what we know and what we don't Some commentators - including former President George W Bush's ethics lawyer Richard Painter - now fear the Russian connection could make Watergate seem trivial. This video can not be played Jeff Sessions: ""I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign"" ""The facts now in this investigation are much worse than the facts in the early stages of Watergate, which was a simple break-in ordered by mid-level campaign officials - not by the president,"" Mr Painter toldVox,external. ""Here we have facts that are much worse: We have a foreign power that has orchestrated a break in. It's a much worse situation than the outset of Watergate."" The alleged falsehood told by Mr Sessions has also fired up Watergate comparisons. One of Mr Nixon's attorney generals, John Mitchell, was later jailed for offences including perjury for his role in the scandal. His replacement Richard Kleindienst was not implicated in Watergate but pleaded guilty in 1974 to failing to testify fully to the Senate about favouritism shown to a communications company during his confirmation hearing. ""It's pretty clear listening to his testimony that [Sessions] certainly wasn't truthful when he was before the Senate and I don't think that's simply going to disappear because he's recused himself from partaking in any of the investigation as attorney general. That's going to continue,"" Mr Dean said. ""These eerie echoes of Watergate keep coming,"" he added. Who is US Attorney General Jeff Sessions? Mr Sessions is now facing calls for him to quit over his recently-admitted contact with Sergei Kislyak - the same Russian official whose phone calls with Mr Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Mr Flynn's resignation last month. Mr Flynn's exit prompted veteran journalist Dan Rather to say onFacebook,external: ""Watergate is the biggest political scandal of my lifetime, until maybe now."" Contact with Mr Kislyak has already seen Mr Flynn resign - will it do the same for Mr Sessions? It is alleged that Mr Flynn discussed diplomatic issues with Mr Kislyak before assuming his role at the White House. It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy. Russia looms large behind Flynn affair Some commentators are now calling for a Watergate-style bipartisan Senate select committee to investigate links between Mr Trump's administration and Russia. ""I would immediately get a special prosecutor on the case,"" said Mr Dean. Mr Trump's Januarydismissal of the previous attorney generalSally Yates also led to comparison's with Nixon's infamous ""Saturday night massacre"" during Watergate in 1973, when he fired an independent special prosecutor, triggering the resignations of attorney general Elliot Richardson and his deputy Gen William Ruckelshaus. Nixon and Mr Trump are believed to be the only US presidents to have dismissed an attorney general. As more people began making comparisons between the Trump administration and Watergate, Mr Trump took to Twitter to accuse Mr Obama of Watergate-style behaviour and call him a ""bad (or sick) guy"". The allegation - which Mr Trump has not provided evidence for - has further convulsed US politics, with Mr Obama denying it and FBI director James Comey also reportedly denying it. Mr Comey has also reportedly asked the US Justice department to reject the allegation because it suggests that the FBI acted illegally. The White House has also called on Congress to investigate whether the Obama administration abused its powers.

"Brexit. It's all about Britain, right? Well, not entirely. There is the rest of the club to consider - what has become known, rather inelegantly, as the EU-of-27. They are about to lose - depending on your point of view - a curmudgeonly whinger who was dragging the whole project down or one of their largest economies and the most powerful defence and security power in Europe. So what to do? There are those who think, genuinely, good riddance. ""General de Gaulle was right all along,"" they mutter. ""We should never have let them join in the first place. ""Freed from the shackles of British ministers objecting to integration here and integration there, we can get on with it."" Closer co-operation on EU defence policy is high on their list; and it has been given an extra boost bythe new president of the United States musing out loud about Natoand whether it is all worth it. Others are dismayed by the British decision to leave, but after getting over the initial shock - and it really was a shock - they too are determined to make the best of it. And when it comes to negotiating the UK divorce bill, make no mistake. For the people who matter,the unity of the remaining 27 is more important than trying not to upset the Britsas they wave goodbye. The bill will be big - up to 60 billion euros - and European diplomats are bracing themselves for what one called ""the very real possibility"" that the UK will walk out in a huff. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has set out five possible futures But the likelihood is that after one too many late-night summits - and one too many outraged tabloid headlines - a deal of sorts will emerge from the rubble. The consequences of Brexit will rumble on for years; there are trade deals that will have to be done. But the EU is in no position to wait for the dust to settle. In many ways, it has already moved on. So long Britain, and thanks for the memories. Later this month, leaders of the 27 (the 28th has already sent her apologies) will meet in Rome to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the EU's founding treaty. I say celebrate, but there is no illusion about the challenges facing the union. Could the forces that prompted Brexit spread to other countries? Will anti-EU populists continue to rise in France, the Netherlands and parts of Central Europe? It is certainly not impossible, and EU leaders know it. The idea that the EU could fall apart - unthinkable a few years ago - is now the subject of serious discussion. Theresa May joined EU leaders in Valletta in February, but will skip the celebrations in Rome Which is why they need a new plan to reinvigorate the project on its 60th birthday, and make it fit for future purpose. The European Commissionhas now produced a series of policy options for the best way forward, ranging from shrugging its shoulders to throwing up its hands in horror. But the most likely solution is to make more use of what is known as multi-speed Europe. That's the idea that ""coalitions of the willing"" can move forward on big projects even if others want to linger on the starting line. It is already happening with the euro, and with the passport-free Schengen area - not all EU countries are members of everything. An inner core may want to push ahead, if (and it's a big if) it can take public opinion along for the ride. The other Commission proposal that looks to have legs is the idea that Brussels would return some powers to member states, as long as the EU was given greater responsibilities in major policy areas such as trade, migration, security and defence. Variations on this theme have been around for some time. The EU needs to be big on the big things, they said, and smaller on smaller things. And the biggest of the big things - in a competitive field - is probably the need to fix the eurozone. The single currency remains half-formed, and - as a result - not yet secure. There is talk of a eurozone finance minister and a single eurozone budget. But if you centralise economic power, you have to make sure it is politically accountable. After 12 years, are German voters tiring of Chancellor Angela Merkel? In an era of populist, anti-establishment rage, that is a difficult balancing act. Much will depend on who wins national elections this year in Germany and, in particular, France. Political leadership will be at a premium. But as the UK prepares to leave and enter a whole new world, the status quo is no longer an option for the countries that remain. The EU either needs to move forward towards closer integration, or transfer significant power back to nation states. It continues to be a bold experiment in Europe. But the halfway house has been built on sand. Juncker lays out EU's post-Brexit options What happens now that a deal's been done?
