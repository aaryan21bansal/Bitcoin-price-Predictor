"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said face masks would become compulsory on public transport Three-layer face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July, the first minister has said. At the daily Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mark Drakeford said this would also be the case for taxis and other situations where 2m social distancing was not possible. Last month,Health Minister Vaughan Gething recommendedtheir use. But he stopped short of making them mandatory. How to make your own face mask Who should wear a face mask or face covering? Face coverings in England's shops to be compulsory Transport for Wales said it had worked with the Welsh Government throughout the pandemic and Great Western Railway said it encouraged all customers to follow the new rule. The Welsh Conservatives questioned why the measure was not being introduced immediately and Plaid Cymru called for masks to be made mandatory for all indoor spaces. The union Unite said it warmly welcomed the decision. Mr Drakeford said: ""For the sake of simplicity and consistency, as well as being part of our plan toÂ help reduce the risk of transmission while on public transport where it is not always possible to maintain a two metre physical distance, it will become mandatory for people to wear a three-layer face covering while travelling - this includes taxis."" This video can not be played Passengers in Cardiff had a mixed view of face masks Face coverings are currently required on public transport in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, whilewearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England is to become mandatory from 24 July. Having a different rule for wearing masks on public transport in Wales and England was ""not sustainable in the long term"", Mr Drakeford said. ""Our decision to make face coverings mandatory on public transport is a combination of the fact that we know as the economy gets back into operation more people will need to use public transport to go to work and for other purposes, and when more people need to use confined spaces then additional protections need to be introduced in order to overcome the fact that two-metre social distancing will not always be possible,"" he added. Taxi driver Stephen Clifford is not sure if the plan will work for taxis Taxi driver Stephen Clifford, from Newport, does not believe it will work for customers He said: ""Most of people the customers wouldn't wear them. ""We'd lose an awful lot of money. If you've got to have it, you have got to have it. And what if we had to provide them? It's hard to say."" This video can not be played The masks should be made of cotton, and even an old pair of socks can be used to cover your face Asked why coverings were not mandatory in other public spaces, Mr Drakeford said: ""The advice of the Welsh Government is that if places are crowded then face coverings are advisory. Where places are not crowded it is a matter for the individual citizen to make that decision."" Coronavirus is now ""at its lowest ebb"" since the pandemic began, he added, saying the Welsh Government's response had to be ""proportionate"". While Mr Drakeford said masks would not be mandatory for shoppers, businesses may ask people to wear them. The Welsh Government has recommended face coverings should be three layers thick He said the retail sector had made ""huge efforts"" to introduce measures to maintain physical distancing, including putting up one-way systems, limiting the number people who can enter a shop and putting up screens at checkouts.Â But, he added: ""At this point in time, when the prevalence of coronavirus is low, we are not mandating the use of face coverings in other public places, but many people may choose to wear them - and there is nothing to stop that happening in Wales. ""Our advice may change if cases of coronavirus begin to increase."" The first minister said the Welsh Government had made changes to regulations which recognise there are some occasions when it is not always possible to maintain a distance of 2m. ""These include maintaining hygiene standards and limiting close face-to-face interaction, wherever reasonable,"" he added. London Underground staff have been handing out face coverings Mr Drakeford also said 300,000 coronavirus tests have been carried out in Wales, with 17,000 of them positive. He urged people to carry on following the ""golden rules"" such as washing hands frequently. He said there had been a ""real change in working patterns, with more people working from home"", adding: ""We need to see flexible working become a permanent feature of working life in Wales and the Welsh government will lead the way in this."" Reacting to the announcement, Conservative Covid recovery spokesman Darren Millar said: ""We must still take every precaution to avoid a second wave of cases, and making wearing face masks mandatory from today may go some way to achieving this - but only if brought in now."" The British Medical Association (BMA) also called for the new rules to be ""implemented without delay"". It said face coverings should be used whenever people could not keep a safe distance. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price welcomed the move but said: ""In acknowledging that face coverings make a crucial difference on trains, buses and in taxis, the question must be begged of Welsh Government - why not in shops also? ""The latest guidance, while a step in the right direction, still doesn't go far enough."" Unite Wales regional secretary Peter Hughes said: ""This decision will improve safety on our buses, trains and taxisâ¦ it will also greatly increase the confidence of the general public to travel on public transport as lockdown measures are eased.""

"The plane was taken to a remote part of the airfield before passengers disembarked A flight from Krakow to Dublin was forced to land after a note was discovered in a toilet claiming there were explosives on board. The Ryanair flight was diverted to Stansted Airport to allow Essex Police officers to carry out checks. Two RAF jets escorted the plane which landed at about 18:40 BST on Monday. Police said nothing suspicious was found and two men have been arrested on suspicion of making threats to endanger an aircraft. The men, aged 26 and 47, remain in custody and the plane has been handed back to Stansted Airport and the operator. A spokeswoman for the airline said: ""The plane landed normally, but was taxied to a remote stand where passengers disembarked safely."" Footage of the RAF jets scrambling was shared on Twitter.

"Health workers have been demanding better pay and conditions at recent protests The French government has agreed to give pay rises worth â¬8bn (Â£7.2bn; $9bn) to health workers, as it hailed their role in fighting coronavirus. The deal was signed with trade unions on Monday after seven weeks of fraught negotiations. Health workers have been revered as heroes during the pandemic with regular displays of public appreciation. But they wanted more than recognition and have held protests to demand pay rises and better funding for hospitals. Some demonstrators were fined for breaking social-distancing rules. More than 200,000 infections and 30,000 deaths have been recorded in France, one of Europe's worst-hit countries. French health workers fined at Paris hospital protest Now the government has reached an agreement on pay that will see the wages of health workers rise by â¬183 a month on average. The agreement, which most trade unions have signed up to, was hailed by the new French Prime Minister, Jean Castex, as a ""historic moment for our health system"". ""This is first of all recognition of those who have been on the front line in the fight against this epidemic,"" Mr Castex said at a signing ceremony. ""It's also a way of catching up the delay for each and every one - including perhaps myself - has their share of responsibility."" This video can not be played Violence marred protests for health workers in Paris in June Most of the pay-rise package will cover the wages of nurses, care workers and non-medical staff. Some - around â¬450m - has been reserved for doctors who work exclusively in the public sector. The move to increase wages comes a day before Bastille Day, a national public holiday on which health workers will be lauded for their efforts during the pandemic. More low-key celebrations than usual have been organised for the 14 July holiday this year, as Covid-19 restrictions remain in place. A parade will be held on the Place de la Concorde in the capital Paris, where around 1,400 nurses, doctors and carers will watch on as the guests of honour. French President Emmanuel Macron has spent much of the first part of his term embroiled in disputes with unions. He signalled ahead of a recent cabinet reshuffle that he wanted to focus more on social justice in the last years of his term. Earlier this month, Edouard Philippe tendered his resignation as prime minister, despite being considered more popular than Mr Macron in opinion polls. Macron picks Castex as PM after Philippe resigns Mr Castex, a little-known civil servant who has played a key role in the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic, was named as Mr Philippe's successor. Mr Macron came to power three years ago but now faces an economic crisis after the coronavirus pandemic. The next presidential election is due to be held in April 2022.

"Wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England is to become mandatory from 24 July. Those who fail to comply with the new rules will face a fine of up to Â£100, the government has announced. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would ""give people more confidence to shop safely and enhance protections for those who work in shops"". The move will bring England into line with Scotland and other major European nations like Spain, Italy and Germany. Since mid-May, members of the public have been advised to wear coverings in enclosed public spaces, where they may encounter people they would not usually meet. Mask-wearing has been compulsory on public transport in England and at NHS facilities across the UK since 15 June. Children under 11 and those with certain disabilities will be exempt. The list of exemptions has not yet been published, but the rules for face maskson public transport,externalexempt anyone who cannot wear one ""because of any physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability"", who would experience ""severe distress"" from doing so, or relies on lip reading, among other reasons. Mr Hancock told the Commons: ""Sadly, sales assistants, cashiers and security guards have suffered disproportionately in this crisis. ""The death rate of sales and retail assistants is 75% higher amongst men and 60% higher amongst women than in the general population."" He added: ""There is also evidence that face coverings increase confidence in people to shop."" The new rule will not apply to retail staff. It comes asthe UK recorded the deaths of a further 138,externalpeople who had tested positive for coronavirus. Why have attitudes to face masks changed? How to make your own face mask Why do customers have to wear face coverings but not staff? And other questions Tory MP Desmond Swayne described the rule as a ""monstrous imposition"" that would make him less likely to go shopping. Labour said ministers had been ""slow and muddled"" on face coverings and questioned why the new rules would not come into force for 11 days. But Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC that research on the use of face coverings, including advice from the World Health Organization, had been ""evolving"". And he said the delay between the announcement and the rule coming into force on 24 July ""gives people time to prepare"". Wearing face coverings in shops is an ""appropriate mitigation"" against the ""overall risk"" of the coronavirus, but the rule would not work in pubs, cafes or restaurants, he added. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering The latest rules for shops will be enforced by the police, with anyone disregarding them at risk of a fine of up to Â£100. This will be reduced to Â£50 if the fine is paid within 14 days. ""A shop can refuse them entry and can call the police if they refuse to comply,"" Mr Hancock said. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said police should be involved only as a ""last resort"". During lockdown, police in England issued around 16,000 fines for alleged breaches of the restrictions. Enforcing the rules was not always easy, particularly because the regulations were drawn up at the last minute, but forces did at least have enough resources - as crime and emergency calls had fallen sharply. Now, as the country begins to return to normal, demands on police time are growing again. That's one reason why officers don't want the extra burden of dealing with non-compliant shop customers. Another factor is a concern is that it may draw police into confrontations with the public at a time when the service is already under the spotlight for its use of tactics, such as stop-and-search. However, the way the face-covering rules are likely to be drafted means it will be the police, not shop staff, who will be called upon if people refuse to abide by the measures. Ken Marsh of the Metropolitan Police Federation suggested enforcing the new rule could strain the relationship between police officers and the general public. And John Apter of the Police Federation said it should be down to shops to make wearing a face covering a ""condition of entry"". In Scotland, the use of coveringsin shops has been mandatory since 10 July. Few fines have been issued and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggestedcompliance had been ""extremely high"". Shoppersin WalesandNorthern Irelandare not currently required to wear them, although both nations have said this will be kept under review. Peter Barnes says wearing coverings in shops to stop the spread can only be a good thing Antiques shop owner Mary Foster from Weybridge, Surrey, tells the BBC she fears mandatory face coverings in stores could increase shoplifting. ""I think people will feel more empowered to try to steal things,"" she says. For some BBC Radio 5 Live listeners, face coverings are uncomfortable, steam up your glasses, and infringe on personal freedom. Andy, from Manchester, says the discomfort means he's less likely to go to the shops and now worries shopping must carry a higher risk than he thought. Pamela, who runs a clothes shop in East Kilbride, says most of her customers have been happy to wear one - only one refused because they didn't like it. But Peter Barnes, a London-based political consultant who contracted Covid-19 in March, tells BBC Business the discomfort of a covering is worth it to save lives. ""If we can save one life, then wearing a mask in the supermarket for an hour or so has got to be entirely worth it,"" he says. Read morehere. Do you work in a shop?

Boris Johnson signalled a shift in the government's position on Friday when he spoke of the need for a stricter approach in confined setting. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove downplayed the suggestion of any immediate legal change on Sunday. Labour said the mixed messages demonstrated the government's indecision during the pandemic, and ministers had to explain the ""further delay"". ""The government has been slow and muddled again,"" shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said. Boris Johnson has been seen wearing a cloth face covering in recent days A No 10 spokesman said: ""There is growing evidence that wearing a face covering in an enclosed space helps protect individuals and those around them from coronavirus. ""The prime minister has been clear that people should be wearing face coverings in shops and we will make this mandatory from 24 July."" Unions and businesses have said the new guidance must be ""clear and detailed"" to protect staff and customers.

"Making the wearing of face masks in shops in England compulsory could ""trigger abuse"" of staff, unions and businesses have warned. Union Usdaw said workers should not be made to enforce the rule if it becomes law as it could make them targets. And the Federation of Small Businesses said masks could make some ""happier to shop"", but others more nervous. Wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England is to become mandatory from 24 July. Those who fail to comply with the new rules will face a fine of up to Â£100, the government is to announce. Waterstones boss James Daunt told the BBC's Today Programme that making people wear masks in shops seemed ""a perfectly reasonable thing"". But the book chain boss also said it ""would not be right"" to ask staff to enforce the rule. ""There are a tiny, tiny minority of people who will be confrontational over it and it is not the position of shop workers to enter into that situation,"" he said. ""We shouldn't put ourselves in confrontational positions, but I think we can, as retailers, if we are requested to do so, clearly tell everybody it is a sensible thing to do."" Boris Johnson wore a mask for the first time as he visited a shop in Uxbridge on Friday The union Usdaw said workers were already dealing with more abuse than normal and urged the government to clarify its policy on face coverings in shops. ""It should never fall on shop workers to enforce the wearing of face coverings,"" warned Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary. Mike Cherry, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, added: ""We must be careful that this does not become a trigger for abuse against shop owners and their employees. Who should wear a face mask or face covering? Gove 'trusts common sense' on masks in shops Calls for clarity over face coverings in England ""[This policy] is likely to make some people happier to shop, and make others more nervous."" In Scotlandit has been compulsory to wear a covering while inside a shop since last Friday. Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told the Today programme that evidence now suggests that wearing masks in confined spaces makes a difference. ""Essentially infections are spread by droplets and they're relatively large when they come out in a cough or a sneeze but they become much smaller as they travel through the air. ""So the job of a cloth covering isn't so much to protect the wearer but to block the source of infection,"" she said. She said leaders should lead by example by being seen wearing face coverings and should explain clearly why it is needed or required. ""Enforcement needn't be heavy-handed. Requiring people to wear masks in shops will give that little extra nudge and make it much clearer for the general public,"" she said. Since mid-May, the public have been advised to wear coverings in enclosed public spaces, where they may encounter people they would not usually meet. It has been compulsory on public transport since 15 June. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to set out the new guidance on face coverings on Tuesday. They are designed to minimise the spread of coronavirus and also encourage people to return to the shops safely. Only 7% of shoppers say they have ""complete faith"" in current protective measures put in place by retailers, according to retail solutions firm Cennox. Its research suggested just over half of shoppers that had visited stores found measures inadequate or poorly managed. ""For the foreseeable future, safety is the new gold standard for retail loyalty,"" said Cennox boss Nick Cockett. ""Shoppers will vote with their feet if they don't feel protected.""

"Leicester was placed under local lockdown two weeks ago, following a rise in coronavirus cases ""Targeted action"" is being taken against more than 100 local outbreaks of coronavirus in England every week, the health secretary has said. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalMatt Hancock said increased testing meant officials could now be ""targeted"" in their response. His comments came after 73 cases of Covid-19were confirmed at a farm in Herefordshire. About 200 workers there have been told to self-isolate. It is now two weeks since Mr Hancock announced Leicester would be the first city in the UK to be put under a local lockdown. Restrictions are expected to be reviewed this week. But he stressed that most measures to contain the coronavirus will not involve a whole city but instead centre on much smaller areas, even just one business or building - and he says these interventions often go unreported by the media and unnoticed by all except those directly involved. What could a lockdown be like in my area?,external How does contact tracing work? The government strategy of targeted local responses whenever data suggests a coronavirus flare-up is a key part of its ongoing plan to reopen British businesses in different phases. In the latest of these, beauty salons, spas, tattoo parlours and nail bars in the rest of England are welcoming back their first clients for almost four months,as national lockdown restrictions are eased. In Scotlandindoor shopping centrescan reopen from Monday, while in Wales pubs, bars and restaurantscan start serving customers outdoorsandhairdressers can also reopen for business. Around 200 workers are self-isolating at AS Green and Co following an outbreak there In his article, Mr Hancock said more cases were being found through testing. ""The result is we can lift more of the lockdown and take targeted action,"" he wrote. ""Each week, there are more than 100 local actions taken across the country - some of these will make the news but many more are swiftly and silently dealt with."" Mr Hancock said England's NHS Test and Trace service was helping the government understand how the virus was spreading ""so we can hunt down coronavirus and keep it contained"". The health secretary said there were now more than 250 testing centres and the government was also deploying a dozen walk-in testing centres. ""Where we find a cluster or outbreak, we send in extra testing, including mobile testing units that can be deployed anywhere in the country,"" he added. Clusters of cases in places such as hospitals, factories or schools can also be dealt with by closing the premises. This has already happened in several parts of the UK, includinga hospital in Weston-super-Mare,North Somerset and meat factoriesin Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire,and Wrexham and Anglesey. The UK's first full local lockdown was announced in Leicester at the end of June Asked what counted as an outbreak during an interview on BBC Breakfast, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said each case would differ, adding ""I think we know it when we see it."" It could be when many individuals caught the virus in a particular area - such as a workplace, village or town, he said. But pressed on whether the virus spreading outside of a household or social bubble would constitute an outbreak, Mr Buckland said: ""I defer to the experts in this. ""They know what an outbreak constitutes when they see it, and I think with each one that we see we get more knowledgeable, more sophisticated, and are able to respond in ever more appropriate ways."" According to Public Health England,,externalan outbreak is when two or more laboratory confirmed cases are linked to a particular setting. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Also appearing on Breakfast, Leicester's mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby said the lockdown there could have been prevented if local authorities had received testing data earlier. He said after having ""finally"" been provided with ""useful data"", they knew around 10% of the city had recorded a higher transmission of the virus. ""It's very clear when you look at the data that it's a couple of areas of the city that have got a higher than the average transmission of the virus, and certainly the way in which the city has been locked down in its entirety, and indeed beyond our boundary, is not justified,"" he said. ""We should have been able to know this many, many weeks ago and we should have focused on those areas, preventing the transmission there."" Leicester's rate of new Covid-19 cases has fallen from its recent peak, according to figures from NHS England - but it is not a steady decline. For example, the rate jumped from 115.1 cases per 100,000 people for the seven days to 4 July to 127.5 for the seven days to 5 July. It fell again to 115.4 in the week to 9 July. This fluctuation could be because more testing means more cases are being picked up. Under the government's testing strategy, anyone withcoronavirus symptomsshould self-isolate and get a test. If someone tests positive they will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace, which will then contact any close contacts, who will also be told to self-isolate. NHS Test and Trace only operates in England.Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandhave their own contact tracing systems. NHS Scotland has signed a new contract with biotech firm E&O Laboratories to supply a solution that can be placed in test tubes to help make samples of Covid-19 safe - allowing each sample to be tested as soon as it arrives at a lab and improving efficiency.

"This video can not be played Kevin works for the Violent Offender Watch (VOW) team in Edinburgh The social and economic devastation caused by Covid-19 could lead to an increase in serious youth violence in the UK, MPs have warned. AYouth Violence Commission report,externalsays incidents of unemployment, homelessness and trauma sparked by pandemic could impact on vulnerable young people. It fears 18 Violence Reduction Units in England and Wales could lose funding. The Home Office says Â£70m is being spent on the units modelled on a scheme which helped cut crime in Scotland. BBC Panorama has been investigating how Scotland's VRU - launched in 2005 and the first in the UK  - has succeeded in reducing crime. Karyn McCluskey, the former head of intelligence for Strathclyde Police and one of the founders of the unit, tells the programme they approached youth violence as a health issue, ""like a disease"". How Scotland stemmed the tide of knife crime 'Poverty link' to youth violence - London mayor 'Weakened' lockdown has 'woken dormant criminals' According to the cross-party Youth Violence Commission, long-term investment is needed in youth services and VRUs but the funding is at risk because of the ""economic devastation"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Itsreport,externalcomes after three years of research into the causes of violence in the UK which concludes that poverty and inequality are ""fundamental drivers"". ""Given the potential for the impact of Covid-19 to create the types of social conditions in which one might reasonably expect to see increased rates of serious violence, it is imperative that support for these units is not only maintained, but increased,"" the report says. ""If support and investment is withdrawn from these VRUs - a particular concern given the possibility of austerity measures that may be taken on the back of the economic impact of Covid-19 - the commission fears this would undo much of the hugely important work that has taken place."" The commission says serious youth violence across England and Wales has cost the economy Â£11bn since 2008 - based on costs to the police, criminal justice system, NHS, victim services, as well as costs from lost economic output and costs associated with physical and emotional harm. According to its report, the cost of running 18 regional VRUs for 10 years is Â£350m. Talking about the type of young offenders helped by Scotland's VRU, Karyn McCluskey says: ""You're brought up in an angry, aggressive home, so you almost become infectedâ¦ So we started to look at it like, what would prevention look like?"" This public health approach aimed to treat offenders with compassion and offering them more support, in the hope that they could bring down levels of violence. In 2005, there were 39 homicides in Glasgow alone. The police cracked down on Glasgow's gangs, with increased stop and search and tougher sentences, but also decided to look at the causes as well.  Over the next 14 years, homicides in Glasgow fell from 39 to 11 in one year. However, in recent years there has been a small increase in violence after a decade of steep falls. Kevin Neary works with the Violent Offenders Watch, a Police Scotland initiative to partner police officers and former convicts in order to reach out to young offenders. As a former armed robber and heroin addict himself, Mr Neary helps offenders keep out of prison. He says most young offenders had experienced childhood trauma such as separation or loss of parents through bereavement. ""What we're doing is not a soft justice; it's not a soft approach, it's a caring and compassionate approach."" By Kate Silverton, presenter of Panorama's How Scotland Cut Violent Crime The founders of the VRU believe that in order to tackle the root causes of violent crime, it needed to not just be a criminal justice issue but something much broader and tackled collaboratively across education, health and prisons. During my filming for the Panorama documentary, it became clear to me that this ""joined-up"" approach is essential to its effectiveness. The people I met believe that we need to understand that children will be much more likely to ""act out"" the violence they themselves experienced or observed and that they need access to counselling, education and training.

"Leah Johnson and Brandon Burridge finished working at the coronavirus-hit farm on 2 July and claimed hygiene at the site was questionable Vegetable pickers at a farm where 74 people tested positive for Covid-19 said they had hygiene concerns about the site. Two workers said they had to share one toilet with up to 60 others at A S Green and Co in Herefordshire,which went into lockdown after the tests. The couple are self-isolating at home in addition to 200 or so workers said to be in quarantine at the site's live-in accommodation. The farm has been asked for comment. Later, West Mercia Police said that three farm workers, including one who had tested positive for Covid-19, had left the site. Dr Helen Carter, from Public Health England, said: ""We are aware that three individuals have left the farm against our guidance and advice and we are working with the West Mercia Police force to make sure they are safe and well."" Asked if they had been traced, Dr Carter said ""at the moment, police are trying to find their location"". Responding to concerns about workers' well-being, a spokesperson for public health in the county said the owners of the farm, which supplies national supermarket chains, were doing ""their very best in this difficult situation"". Brandon Burridge and Leah Johnson, a couple from Malvern, Worcestershire, signed up to work on the farm after seeing its Pick for Britain adverts in the local press. Their last day of work was 2 July and they said the first they had heard of the outbreak had been in the media. They said no-one from the farm had been in touch over the outbreak, and claimed they had been blocked from a company WhatsApp group after asking questions. They said they were now self-isolating in their homes and awaiting the result of their own tests, which they say they organised themselves. Workers are self-isolating at this farm in Herefordshire Ms Johnson, 21, said during an induction process about 15 people had been sitting on shared benches with no mention of keeping 2m (6ft) apart. ""There was nothing about hand sanitiser, we weren't given any. We were not allowed to wear gloves,"" she said. ""It seemed strange to us, but we thought because it was an outdoor job, the risk of coronavirus would be low. ""But we hadn't considered the shared facilities. ""People were saying 'there is only one toilet' - that is ridiculous - and it got quite gross quite quickly, and we were told [by other team members] to avoid it all costs. ""There was one bit of hand sanitiser in the toilet."" Mr Burridge, 22, said: ""I tried to ring them to ask why we hadn't been informed [of the outbreak] as I thought it was their duty to say so. ""But we were told that our usual contacts weren't available. The woman on the phone offered to pass on the message, but we didn't get a response. So I emailed them but I still haven't had a response. ""And we've been blocked from the team Whatsapp group."" Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Workers at the farm, which employs a mix of seasonal workers from the UK and abroad, are being supported by public health staff, who are providing food and other provisions, along with translators. Director of Public Health for Herefordshire, Karen Wright, confirmed the 74 cases at the farm. She said: ""Our focus remains the health and well-being of residents while we work to contain and control the spread of Covid-19. ""We continue to support the farm management, their workers - who form an important part of our local economy - and the local community through this challenging time."" EASY STEPS:What can I do?

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It seems after all that the ministers won't just be asking everyone to use their ""common sense"" or even just rely on manners to make people cover up. After weeks of discussion about the relative benefits of covering your face when out and about, ministers are now likely to confirm that it will be mandatory to cover your face in shops in England as soon as Tuesday and, like in Scotland seven days ago, expect that change to be brought in in law. It is quite the shift. At the start of the crisis, the government's scientists suggested that masks could do more harm than good. There were nerves too about creating sudden demand from the public to get hold of medical grade coverings when there was a worldwide spike in demand as the pandemic took hold. But more evidencehas emergedabout how coronavirus can be transmitted through the air. Read more from Laura here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinaâs media have been keen to
highlight where countries with large numbers of Covid-19 cases have been lax
about wearing masks, or have not taken mask-wearing seriously. In particular, papers have focused
on the US and India. Itâs big news today in China that US President Donald
Trump wore a face mask for the first time in public over the weekend. . Many on the popular
Weibo social media platform are asking whether the president has become
âscaredâ, either for his own health, or for his chances at re-election later in
the year. There is also a lot of online reaction to a report in Global Times about diamond-encrusted masks and
solid-gold masks are being manufactured in India. Many in China are
asking why masks are being treated like a fashion accessory, and not something
that could potentially save your life. China was an early advocate of
face-mask wearing, and in late January, papers noted that the outbreak in the
central city of Wuhan had led to a âsurge in demand,externalâ from consumers all across
the country.TV presenters were even wearing them at this point. Masks have traditionally been worn
anyway in the country whenever anybody has even a mild cold. This was a lesson
learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak in the country. China has reported 83,602
confirmed cases of Covid-19 since late December and 4,634 deaths. Llamas could provide the key to immune therapyin a potential coronavirus breakthrough. Scientists from the UK's Rosalind Franklin Institute have used specially evolved antibodies from a llama to make an immune-boosting therapy. The Covid-specific ""antibody cocktail"" could enter clinical trials within months. The development has beenpublished in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology,external.  A US soldier guards a testing site in New York in April Rates of Covid-19 infection among the ranks of the US military are growing at twice the rate of the general public, according to analysis by theMilitary Times,external. The newspaper reports that 4,100 US soldiers and sailors have tested positive since 1 July, representing a rise of about 33% in the last 10 days. Over the same time period, the US Covid-19 growth rate reached 16%. The outbreak has not only affected US troops at home, but also has hit deployed forces stationed around the world. As we reported earlier today, at least 95 US troops have been affected at a US military base in Okinawa, Japan. Hong Kong Disneyland reopened in June, only to be closed again a month later Walt Disney has announced it will temporarily close its Hong Kong theme park on 15 July after the territory saw a spike in coronavirus cases. Disneyland Hong Kong had reopened less than a month ago after it was shut in January during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Hong Kong has so far managed to keep infections down relative to other countries, recording around 1,500 cases since late January. But on Monday, 52 cases were reported in Hong Kong, prompting  authorities to tighten social-distancing rules. âAs required by the government and health authorities in line with prevention efforts taking place across Hong Kong, Hong Kong Disneyland park will temporarily close from July 15,â Disney said in a statement on Monday. Hotels at the resort will remain open with enhanced safety measures in place. The closure comes just days after Disney reopened its biggest resort, Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, where coronavirus cases rose by a daily record of 15,000 on Sunday. Nearly 3,000 daycare centres and childrenâs nurseries are reopening on Monday in New York City, months after they were closed due to the pandemic. Masks will not be required for children under two-years-old, but are compulsory for adults. No more than 15 children can be present in one room, sharing of toys is to be limited and staff must undergo health screenings. ""It's been really, really tough for parents,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last week as the decision was announced. ""So bringing back childcare is crucial."" The move comes one day after New York announced that no Covid-19 deaths had been recorded in a 24-hour period for the first time since the start of the outbreak. On Monday, Gov Cuomo announced that schools that are in Phase 4 counties - where the daily infection rate remains below 5% - will be permitted to open in August. But he warned that schools can be shut again if the region's infection rate rises above 9% over a seven-day average. Raymundo Capetillo starred in many soap operas throughout his decades-long career Mexican actor Raymundo Capetillo has died with Covid-19 at the age of 76, local media has reported. The actorâs death wasconfirmed by the AsociaciÃ³n Nacional de IntÃ©rpretes,externalon social media on Monday. Capetillo was reportedly admitted to hospital in Mexico City on 5 July after experiencing respiratory problems. Actress Laura Zapata was among those to pay tribute to Capetillo. âI'm going to miss you, my friend,âshe wrote on Twitter,external. An economist by profession and a professor of English, Capetillo began his acting career in the late 1960s. He worked in TV, film and theatre, but was best known for his performances in soap operas, appearing in dozens of shows between the 1960s and the 2010s. Wild Rose, Brave Love and Hearts to the Limit were among the shows he appeared in. US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci is being targeted by the Trump administration as tensions rise between the health expert and the president. The White House has been increasingly critical of Dr Fauci, and on Sunday, an official shared a list detailing past apparent erroneous comments. Dr Fauci's changing advice on masks and remarks on Covid-19's severity are among the points from the White House. The move to undercut him comes as the US continues to see surges in Covid-19. There are over 3.3 million cases confirmed and more than 135,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. Read more here. BBC OS This video can not be played Musician Michaela Anne had her tour cancelled because of the pandemic The coronavirus outbreak has led
to the cancellation of tours, gigs and festivals around the world. Analysts say
that the music industry could lose billions as a result of the pandemic. Singer-songwriter Michaela Anne
was due to go on tour before the outbreak began. Speaking toBBC OS on World Service radiofrom New York, she says she has been doing live streams and teaching online lessons to
make money. âItâs been financially helpful
for me, while also being emotionally helpful. Itâs kind of kept me connected to feel like I have some purpose."" She is worried about the prospects of others in the industry - such as booking agents, tour managers, merchandise
sellers and crew members, adding that she is not sure how they will come through the crisis. The number of people reported to have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK has risen by 11, the Department of Health and Social Care says. It's believed to be the smallest daily increase in the number of deaths since lockdown was announced. However, the figure is usually lower on Mondays because fewer deaths are reported at weekends. It means 11 deaths were reported to DHSC in the 24-hour period - but some could have died several days ago. The individual nations of the UK report deaths slightly differently to the DHSC - which explains why their figures don't add up to the UK total. As of 17:00 BST on 12 July, 44,830 people have now died in all settings after testing positive for Covid-19, the DHSC said. Separate figures from the UK's statistical agencies show there have now been more than 55,000 deaths in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.  Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent The island of Majorca is popular with German and British tourists in particular Germanyâs health minister has expressed concern after pictures emerged this weekend of hundreds of German tourists flouting social-distancing rules on the Spanish island of Majorca. Jens Spahn told reporters on Monday that the coronavirus pandemic was not over, warning German tourists against complacency. Pictures showing crowds of German tourists partying - many without masks - in the bars and streets of Majorca have angered the Spanish authorities and dismayed the German government. The island is a popular destination for German and British tourists. Following the lifting of travel restrictions a few weeks ago, many Germans have seized the opportunity for a post-lockdown holiday. Mr Spahn said the island must not become a second Ischgl â referring to the Austrian ski resort which emerged as a coronavirus hotspot and the source of some of Germanyâs very first infections. Thousands of German holidaymakers were allowed to travel to Spain's Balearic Islands last month as part of a pilot scheme to help reboot the country's tourism sector. A British pub landlord hasput an electric fence in front of his barto encourage customers to keep social distancing. Jonny McFadden, who runs the Star Inn in St Just, Cornwall, said there was limited space in his small pub and he had struggled to get the social distancing message across to some customers. He described the barrier as ""just a normal electric fence that you would find in a field"". Asked if it was switched on, Mr McFadden said: ""Come and find out - there is a fear factor and it works."" He said the fence was a good deterrent because customers ""don't want to touch it to find out whether it is on or not"", adding that ""people keep away from it, people are like sheep"". Mark Sleet, who lives in England and works in Scotland, says shops were busier south of the border More restrictions have lifted in Scotland today, with non-essential shops within shopping malls allowed to open. But at one such centre, Waverley Mall in Edinburgh, a number of shops remained closed on Monday. Mark Sleet, 62, a project manager working on the construction of another shopping centre in Edinburgh city centre, described his experience as a ""culture shock"". He said: ""I've been travelling to Edinburgh from Morpeth in England every day for work and it's like going back in time. ""It's really getting back to normal in England and the shopping malls are busy. ""Waverley Mall was empty today and I had to wear a mask, which felt confusing for me."" Alex Weedman, 29, from Edinburgh, said: ""I'm a shopaholic and wanted to see Flying Tiger, which is a shop that is only in Waverley Mall. I'm wearing a mask in case others feel worried but I'm not afraid."" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been highly critical of the response of some governments to Covid-19 The coronavirus pandemic is going to get âworse and worseâ if certain governments do not take decisive action to curb the spread of the disease, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said we are seeing âdangerous increases in casesâ in countries where âproven measures to reduce risk are not implemented or followedâ. âLet me blunt, too many countries are headed in the wrong direction,â Dr Tedros said at a briefing in Geneva on Monday. âThe virus remains public enemy number one, but the actions of many governments and people do not reflect this.â Dr Tedros said âmixed messages from leadersâ were undermining public trust in attempts to bring the pandemic under control. While Dr Tedors did not mention those leaders by name, some may interpret his pointed remarks as a warning to US President Donald Trump and others who have been widely criticised for their handling of the pandemic. âIf the basics arenât followed, there is only one way this pandemic is going to go,â Dr Tedros added. âItâs going to get worse and worse and worse.â This video can not be played Dr Anthony Fauci explains failure of testing in the US Anthony Fauci is best known as the face of America's fight against coronavirus. In his five decades as a medical researcher, he has become used to criticism. He has seen his effigy burnt, heard the cries of protesters calling him a ""murderer"", and had smoke bombs thrown outside his office window. Now the 79-year-old, who has served under six presidents, has become the target of an attempt by the White House to discredit him over the pandemic. An official told the US press that Dr Fauci - a key member of government's Coronavirus task force - had âbeen wrong on thingsâ. Read our profile here Â© 2025 BBC.

There were nerves too about creating sudden demand from the public to get hold of medical grade coverings when there was a worldwide spike in demand as the pandemic took hold. But more evidencehas emergedabout how coronavirus can be transmitted through the air. Read more from Laura here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinaâs media have been keen to
highlight where countries with large numbers of Covid-19 cases have been lax
about wearing masks, or have not taken mask-wearing seriously. In particular, papers have focused
on the US and India. Itâs big news today in China that US President Donald
Trump wore a face mask for the first time in public over the weekend. . Many on the popular
Weibo social media platform are asking whether the president has become
âscaredâ, either for his own health, or for his chances at re-election later in
the year. There is also a lot of online reaction to a report in Global Times about diamond-encrusted masks and
solid-gold masks are being manufactured in India. Many in China are
asking why masks are being treated like a fashion accessory, and not something
that could potentially save your life. China was an early advocate of
face-mask wearing, and in late January, papers noted that the outbreak in the
central city of Wuhan had led to a âsurge in demand,externalâ from consumers all across
the country.TV presenters were even wearing them at this point. Masks have traditionally been worn
anyway in the country whenever anybody has even a mild cold. This was a lesson
learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak in the country. China has reported 83,602
confirmed cases of Covid-19 since late December and 4,634 deaths. Llamas could provide the key to immune therapyin a potential coronavirus breakthrough. Scientists from the UK's Rosalind Franklin Institute have used specially evolved antibodies from a llama to make an immune-boosting therapy. The Covid-specific ""antibody cocktail"" could enter clinical trials within months. The development has beenpublished in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology,external.  A US soldier guards a testing site in New York in April Rates of Covid-19 infection among the ranks of the US military are growing at twice the rate of the general public, according to analysis by theMilitary Times,external. The newspaper reports that 4,100 US soldiers and sailors have tested positive since 1 July, representing a rise of about 33% in the last 10 days. Over the same time period, the US Covid-19 growth rate reached 16%. The outbreak has not only affected US troops at home, but also has hit deployed forces stationed around the world. As we reported earlier today, at least 95 US troops have been affected at a US military base in Okinawa, Japan. Hong Kong Disneyland reopened in June, only to be closed again a month later Walt Disney has announced it will temporarily close its Hong Kong theme park on 15 July after the territory saw a spike in coronavirus cases. Disneyland Hong Kong had reopened less than a month ago after it was shut in January during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Hong Kong has so far managed to keep infections down relative to other countries, recording around 1,500 cases since late January. But on Monday, 52 cases were reported in Hong Kong, prompting  authorities to tighten social-distancing rules. âAs required by the government and health authorities in line with prevention efforts taking place across Hong Kong, Hong Kong Disneyland park will temporarily close from July 15,â Disney said in a statement on Monday. Hotels at the resort will remain open with enhanced safety measures in place. The closure comes just days after Disney reopened its biggest resort, Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, where coronavirus cases rose by a daily record of 15,000 on Sunday. Nearly 3,000 daycare centres and childrenâs nurseries are reopening on Monday in New York City, months after they were closed due to the pandemic. Masks will not be required for children under two-years-old, but are compulsory for adults. No more than 15 children can be present in one room, sharing of toys is to be limited and staff must undergo health screenings. ""It's been really, really tough for parents,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last week as the decision was announced. ""So bringing back childcare is crucial."" The move comes one day after New York announced that no Covid-19 deaths had been recorded in a 24-hour period for the first time since the start of the outbreak. On Monday, Gov Cuomo announced that schools that are in Phase 4 counties - where the daily infection rate remains below 5% - will be permitted to open in August. But he warned that schools can be shut again if the region's infection rate rises above 9% over a seven-day average. Raymundo Capetillo starred in many soap operas throughout his decades-long career Mexican actor Raymundo Capetillo has died with Covid-19 at the age of 76, local media has reported. The actorâs death wasconfirmed by the AsociaciÃ³n Nacional de IntÃ©rpretes,externalon social media on Monday. Capetillo was reportedly admitted to hospital in Mexico City on 5 July after experiencing respiratory problems. Actress Laura Zapata was among those to pay tribute to Capetillo. âI'm going to miss you, my friend,âshe wrote on Twitter,external. An economist by profession and a professor of English, Capetillo began his acting career in the late 1960s. He worked in TV, film and theatre, but was best known for his performances in soap operas, appearing in dozens of shows between the 1960s and the 2010s. Wild Rose, Brave Love and Hearts to the Limit were among the shows he appeared in. US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci is being targeted by the Trump administration as tensions rise between the health expert and the president. The White House has been increasingly critical of Dr Fauci, and on Sunday, an official shared a list detailing past apparent erroneous comments. Dr Fauci's changing advice on masks and remarks on Covid-19's severity are among the points from the White House. The move to undercut him comes as the US continues to see surges in Covid-19. There are over 3.3 million cases confirmed and more than 135,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. Read more here. BBC OS This video can not be played Musician Michaela Anne had her tour cancelled because of the pandemic The coronavirus outbreak has led
to the cancellation of tours, gigs and festivals around the world. Analysts say
that the music industry could lose billions as a result of the pandemic. Singer-songwriter Michaela Anne
was due to go on tour before the outbreak began. Speaking toBBC OS on World Service radiofrom New York, she says she has been doing live streams and teaching online lessons to
make money. âItâs been financially helpful
for me, while also being emotionally helpful. Itâs kind of kept me connected to feel like I have some purpose."" She is worried about the prospects of others in the industry - such as booking agents, tour managers, merchandise
sellers and crew members, adding that she is not sure how they will come through the crisis. The number of people reported to have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK has risen by 11, the Department of Health and Social Care says. It's believed to be the smallest daily increase in the number of deaths since lockdown was announced. However, the figure is usually lower on Mondays because fewer deaths are reported at weekends. It means 11 deaths were reported to DHSC in the 24-hour period - but some could have died several days ago. The individual nations of the UK report deaths slightly differently to the DHSC - which explains why their figures don't add up to the UK total. As of 17:00 BST on 12 July, 44,830 people have now died in all settings after testing positive for Covid-19, the DHSC said. Separate figures from the UK's statistical agencies show there have now been more than 55,000 deaths in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.  Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent The island of Majorca is popular with German and British tourists in particular Germanyâs health minister has expressed concern after pictures emerged this weekend of hundreds of German tourists flouting social-distancing rules on the Spanish island of Majorca. Jens Spahn told reporters on Monday that the coronavirus pandemic was not over, warning German tourists against complacency. Pictures showing crowds of German tourists partying - many without masks - in the bars and streets of Majorca have angered the Spanish authorities and dismayed the German government. The island is a popular destination for German and British tourists. Following the lifting of travel restrictions a few weeks ago, many Germans have seized the opportunity for a post-lockdown holiday. Mr Spahn said the island must not become a second Ischgl â referring to the Austrian ski resort which emerged as a coronavirus hotspot and the source of some of Germanyâs very first infections. Thousands of German holidaymakers were allowed to travel to Spain's Balearic Islands last month as part of a pilot scheme to help reboot the country's tourism sector. A British pub landlord hasput an electric fence in front of his barto encourage customers to keep social distancing. Jonny McFadden, who runs the Star Inn in St Just, Cornwall, said there was limited space in his small pub and he had struggled to get the social distancing message across to some customers. He described the barrier as ""just a normal electric fence that you would find in a field"". Asked if it was switched on, Mr McFadden said: ""Come and find out - there is a fear factor and it works."" He said the fence was a good deterrent because customers ""don't want to touch it to find out whether it is on or not"", adding that ""people keep away from it, people are like sheep"". Mark Sleet, who lives in England and works in Scotland, says shops were busier south of the border More restrictions have lifted in Scotland today, with non-essential shops within shopping malls allowed to open. But at one such centre, Waverley Mall in Edinburgh, a number of shops remained closed on Monday. Mark Sleet, 62, a project manager working on the construction of another shopping centre in Edinburgh city centre, described his experience as a ""culture shock"". He said: ""I've been travelling to Edinburgh from Morpeth in England every day for work and it's like going back in time. ""It's really getting back to normal in England and the shopping malls are busy. ""Waverley Mall was empty today and I had to wear a mask, which felt confusing for me."" Alex Weedman, 29, from Edinburgh, said: ""I'm a shopaholic and wanted to see Flying Tiger, which is a shop that is only in Waverley Mall. I'm wearing a mask in case others feel worried but I'm not afraid."" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been highly critical of the response of some governments to Covid-19 The coronavirus pandemic is going to get âworse and worseâ if certain governments do not take decisive action to curb the spread of the disease, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said we are seeing âdangerous increases in casesâ in countries where âproven measures to reduce risk are not implemented or followedâ. âLet me blunt, too many countries are headed in the wrong direction,â Dr Tedros said at a briefing in Geneva on Monday. âThe virus remains public enemy number one, but the actions of many governments and people do not reflect this.â Dr Tedros said âmixed messages from leadersâ were undermining public trust in attempts to bring the pandemic under control. While Dr Tedors did not mention those leaders by name, some may interpret his pointed remarks as a warning to US President Donald Trump and others who have been widely criticised for their handling of the pandemic. âIf the basics arenât followed, there is only one way this pandemic is going to go,â Dr Tedros added. âItâs going to get worse and worse and worse.â This video can not be played Dr Anthony Fauci explains failure of testing in the US Anthony Fauci is best known as the face of America's fight against coronavirus. In his five decades as a medical researcher, he has become used to criticism. He has seen his effigy burnt, heard the cries of protesters calling him a ""murderer"", and had smoke bombs thrown outside his office window. Now the 79-year-old, who has served under six presidents, has become the target of an attempt by the White House to discredit him over the pandemic. An official told the US press that Dr Fauci - a key member of government's Coronavirus task force - had âbeen wrong on thingsâ. Read our profile here Â© 2025 BBC.

"Manchester City face Real Madrid next month in the second leg of their last-16 Champions League tie Manchester City have successfully overturned their two-year ban from European club competitions. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) announced the club were cleared of ""disguising equity funds as sponsorship contributions"". Uefa issued the ban in February after ruling City had committed ""serious breaches"" of Financial Fair Play regulations between 2012 and 2016. City's fine has been cut from 30m euros (Â£26.9m) to 10m euros. In delivering the ruling on Monday, Cas said City did ""fail to cooperate with Uefa authorities"" but overturned the decision by Uefa's club financial control body (CFCB) to ban them. City said the decision was ""validation of the club's position and the body of evidence that it was able to present"". ""The club wishes to thank the panel members for their diligence and the due process that they administered,"" City added. This video can not be played 'Difficult' to have had Europe ban hanging over Man City - Richards Cas' ruling means City, who are guaranteed to finish second in the Premier League this season, will play in the 2020-21 Champions League. In this year's competition, Pep Guardiola's side face Real Madrid in their last-16 second leg at Etihad Stadium on 7 August. They lead 2-1 from the first leg and will face Juventus or Lyon if they progress. Cas, who will provide full written reasons for the ruling ""in a few days"" said the decision ""emphasised that most of the alleged breaches reported by the adjudicatory chamber of the CFCB were either not established or time-barred"". It added that in clearing City of the more serious charges surrounding ""dishonest concealment"" of sponsorship deals it was ""not appropriate to impose a ban on participating in Uefa's club competitions"" for the lesser charge of ""obstructing the CFCB's investigations"". On reducing the fine, Cas said that, while it considered ""the importance of the co-operation of clubs in investigations conducted by the CFCB"" and Manchester City's ""disregard of such principle and its obstruction of the investigations"", the Cas panel ""considered it appropriate to reduce Uefa's initial fine by two-thirds"". It added: ""The final award with reasons will be published on the Cas website in a few days."" Uefa said it noted there was ""insufficient conclusive evidence to uphold all of the CFCB's conclusions in this specific case and that many of the alleged breaches were time-barred"". The governing body added: ""Over the last few years, Financial Fair Play has played a significant role in protecting clubs and helping them become financially sustainable and Uefa and the European Club Association remain committed to its principles."" Simon Stone, BBC Sport Privately, City are hugely satisfied with today's decision. For, while the verdict is being viewed as a major blow for the whole FFP concept, senior sources at the club insist their argument - and resistance to complying with the initial hearing - was because of opposition to the process they were being judged by, not the regulation itself. City could not see how it was fair that the evidence being used against them was obtained illegally particularly as, in their view, it created a distorted picture of the reality. It is also being stressed the non-compliance aspect of this case was with the Uefa process, not case. And, given the vehemence with which they repeatedly argued that the emails used as evidence against them was obtained illegally, it is not hard to work out what the major area of non-compliance might have been. Even as their two-year ban was being announced in February, the club were confident it would be overturned if they were given what, in their eyes, constituted a fair hearing and they now feel vindicated at how the situation has unfolded. No-one from the club is saying so but you get the sense the first line of CAS' statement is the most pleasing from their point of view because it addresses the very crux of the argument City were trying to make, namely, they did not cheat the system by inflating their deals. Uefa launched an investigation after German newspaper Der Spiegel published leaked documents in November 2018 alleging City had inflated the value of a sponsorship deal, misleading European football's governing body. Reports alleged City - who have always denied wrongdoing - deliberately misled Uefa so they could meet FFP rules requiring clubs to break even. On 14 February, the independent adjudicatory chamber of the CFCB said City had broken the rules by ""overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to Uefa between 2012 and 2016"". It added that City had ""failed to cooperate in the investigation"". City, who have been owned by Sheikh Mansour since 2008, were fined Â£49m in 2014 for a previous breach of regulations. City failed in an initial bid to have Cas halt Uefa's investigation in November last year. After the two-year ban was announced, City said the process that led to it was ""flawed"" and ""prejudicial"" and immediately announced their intention to appeal. They alleged they had been the victim of an illegal hack by people who had the express intention of damaging their reputation and that the emails were being used as the basis for reports which were being taken out of context. City also believed the CFCB was not independent and ended up being distrustful of it, partly because of the amount of secretive information the club felt was leaked to the media. City boss Guardiola had said on Friday that he was ""fully confident about what the club has done"". Uefa could appeal against the decision in the Swiss federal courts. But BBC Sport understands that is not a route Uefa is keen to go down. It is unlikely that any such appeal would be heard before the 2020-21 Champions League starts. The Premier League could have looked to take action as well if the ban had been upheld because their own FFP rules are similar - but not exactly the same - as Uefa's. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor Over the last decade, City have been the dominant force in the English game, but few results have been as important as this one. An upheld two-year ban would have been disastrous for the club's finances, their chances of keeping their best players and, above all, their reputation. Instead, City can breathe a huge sigh of relief, and the uncertainty instead surrounds Uefa and its financial rules. The credibility off FFP lies in tatters. After all, how can FFP survive after one of the world's richest clubs, having been found guilty of obstructing a Uefa investigation, a club that was found to have breached the rules in 2014, walk away with just a 10m euros fine? Many will wonder what kind of deterrent that sets for other clubs, especially clubs with such financial resources. It shows how difficult it has become for governing bodies to enforce the rules. The language that Cas uses is important. Uefa noted that Cas found ""insufficient conclusive evidence"" to uphold all of its conclusions, not 'no evidence'. And some allegations were dismissed because they were more than five years old. And, because City were found to have failed to co-operate, this falls short of a full exoneration. But City are unlikely to care too much about that and what a story it would be if they can follow this up with a first Champions League success.

"Leah Johnson and Brandon Burridge finished working at the coronavirus-hit farm on 2 July and claimed hygiene at the site was questionable Vegetable pickers at a farm where 74 people tested positive for Covid-19 said they had hygiene concerns about the site. Two workers said they had to share one toilet with up to 60 others at A S Green and Co in Herefordshire,which went into lockdown after the tests. The couple are self-isolating at home in addition to 200 or so workers said to be in quarantine at the site's live-in accommodation. The farm has been asked for comment. Later, West Mercia Police said that three farm workers, including one who had tested positive for Covid-19, had left the site. Dr Helen Carter, from Public Health England, said: ""We are aware that three individuals have left the farm against our guidance and advice and we are working with the West Mercia Police force to make sure they are safe and well."" Asked if they had been traced, Dr Carter said ""at the moment, police are trying to find their location"". Responding to concerns about workers' well-being, a spokesperson for public health in the county said the owners of the farm, which supplies national supermarket chains, were doing ""their very best in this difficult situation"". Brandon Burridge and Leah Johnson, a couple from Malvern, Worcestershire, signed up to work on the farm after seeing its Pick for Britain adverts in the local press. Their last day of work was 2 July and they said the first they had heard of the outbreak had been in the media. They said no-one from the farm had been in touch over the outbreak, and claimed they had been blocked from a company WhatsApp group after asking questions. They said they were now self-isolating in their homes and awaiting the result of their own tests, which they say they organised themselves. Workers are self-isolating at this farm in Herefordshire Ms Johnson, 21, said during an induction process about 15 people had been sitting on shared benches with no mention of keeping 2m (6ft) apart. ""There was nothing about hand sanitiser, we weren't given any. We were not allowed to wear gloves,"" she said. ""It seemed strange to us, but we thought because it was an outdoor job, the risk of coronavirus would be low. ""But we hadn't considered the shared facilities. ""People were saying 'there is only one toilet' - that is ridiculous - and it got quite gross quite quickly, and we were told [by other team members] to avoid it all costs. ""There was one bit of hand sanitiser in the toilet."" Mr Burridge, 22, said: ""I tried to ring them to ask why we hadn't been informed [of the outbreak] as I thought it was their duty to say so. ""But we were told that our usual contacts weren't available. The woman on the phone offered to pass on the message, but we didn't get a response. So I emailed them but I still haven't had a response. ""And we've been blocked from the team Whatsapp group."" Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Workers at the farm, which employs a mix of seasonal workers from the UK and abroad, are being supported by public health staff, who are providing food and other provisions, along with translators. Director of Public Health for Herefordshire, Karen Wright, confirmed the 74 cases at the farm. She said: ""Our focus remains the health and well-being of residents while we work to contain and control the spread of Covid-19.

"Beauty salons, spas, tattoo parlours and nail bars are welcoming back their first clients for almost four months, as lockdown restrictions ease further in England. But some treatments, such as eyebrow threading, are still banned, leaving many salons unable to reopen. In Scotland,indoor shopping centres are allowed to reopen. In Wales, pubs, bars and restaurantscan start serving customers outdoors, while hairdresserscan also reopen. Businesses will be required to follow guidelines to reduce the spread of coronavirus - and treatments which involve work directly in front of the face will not be available. Government guidance,externalsays services including face waxing, eyebrow threading, eyelash treatments, make-up applications and facials should not be provided because of the greater risk of Covid-19 transmission. Government to decide on face masks in shops How can I have my nails done safely? Naresh Bhana, who runs Flamin' Eight tattoo studio in north London, said the business was only taking advance bookings, so ""you can't walk off the street unannounced"". ""We can accommodate two or three being tattooed but we stagger their start times,"" he said. ""Work areas are four metres apart. Everyone's wearing masks. Clients will wear visors as well."" He has created a commemorative tattoo for his wife to mark the reopening. The tattoo design to mark the end of lockdown for tattoo parlours was created for Naresh's wife, Sonia Beard trims have been allowed since barbers opened last weekend - but should be limited to simple tidy-ups or thinning which can be carried out from the side or by circling the client to avoid the highest risk zone in front of the face,the British Beauty Council has said,external. The co-founder of the home beauty service, Blow Ltd, Fiona McIntosh, said the ban on beauty treatments involving the face was ""hugely frustrating"". ""We still don't know when we're going to be able to do those services, which is having a huge impact on the freelancers who work for us,"" she said. ""We have 250 women, freelance beauticians on our platform across London, Manchester and Birmingham who can't work and they have been given no date on when they can work."" She added: ""I found it very difficult to understand how a lash treatment when you actually could have a mask on to have that done is different to a beard treatment."" Blow Ltd uses 1,000 self-employed beauticians and about a quarter of them can still not work, says Fiona McIntosh Angela Burnett, the co-founder of Moreton Place Beauty and Wellbeing in London, added: ""It's half of our business, not being able do facials and facial treatment. For example we can't do any eyebrow waxing, any tinting, any lip waxing. So we're just doing manicures, pedicures and massages."" Vanita Parti, founder and chief executive of the Blink Brow Bar walk-in beauty bar chain, which has 11 shops in London and specialises in eyebrow treatments, said her salons would not be able to reopen under the guidelines. ""I'm furious,""she told the BBC last week. ""This will kill so many businesses. I wish they'd consulted us."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? Massage studios, tanning salons, physical therapy businesses and piercing services are also now allowed to reopen in England. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""Enabling these often small, independent businesses to reopen is yet another step in our plan to kickstart the economy to support jobs and incomes across the country."" Some nail bars have installed plastic screens to reduce the spread of coronavirus At a salon in Birkenhead, a nail technician wears a PPE face shield and mask People - including a woman in Chirton, North Shields - are also returning to sunbeds for the first time in three months In Scotland, hospitals are reopening to visitors and children and young people are now allowed to play contact sports outdoors. From Wednesday, Scottish hairdressers and barbers will be able to reopen and indoor pubs, cafes and restaurants can return to business. In Wales, hospitality businesses can open for outdoor service.  Only half of venues are predicted to do so, with major chains, including Wetherspoons and Brains, waiting until customers are allowed indoors from 3 August. The National Trust is also reopening some of its historic houses, with visitors allowed at seven properties in England and Northern Ireland in a test run of new rules intended to keep the public and staff as safe as possible. ""We're really grateful to our members and supporters for sticking with us during lockdown,"" said Tarnya Cooper from the National Trust, who spoke to BBC's Breakfast from Petworth House. ""This is the first time in  16 weeks we've been able to contemplate reopening our houses."" She said about one million visitors had already pre-booked trips to National Trust's parks and gardenssince they opened in early June. Meanwhile, the government's approach to face coverings in England continues to be discussed, following calls for clarity over the weekend. Boris Johnsonhas said people in England""should be wearing"" masks or other coverings inside shops to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. He said the government would decide in the next few days if ""tools of enforcement"" were needed. Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said he would ""perhaps"" support making the wearing of masks in public compulsory but his colleague Michael Govesaid on Sunday he thought the matter should be left to people's ""common sense"". Mr Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Wearing them in an enclosed space where you've got lots of people, for example a busy shop, seems to be sensible. ""It is all about increasing confidence. I think the more of us who do the courteous and responsible thing, the more people you'll see venture out into shops."" He added: ""If it becomes necessary to nudge people further by taking further action then of course we will consider that. I think the matter is under careful and daily review."" Face masks are mandatory in shops in Scotland but not in England, although some shoppers do wear them A further 650 coronavirus cases were reported across the UK on Sunday,according to the Department of Health,external. That is an increase on the 516 cases reported on the same day a week earlier - but hugely down on the peak in April when there were about 5,000 new cases a day. The total number of people who have died with Covid-19 in the UK is now 44,819, a rise of 21 on the previous day - although figures tend to be lower at weekends because of reporting delays.

"This video can not be played ""He had so much passion for football"" Alina Joseph remembers sitting with her son Christopher Kapessa in their living room watching the 2018 Fifa World Cup on the telly. It was a scorcher of a day but Christopher was glued to the screen watching Cristiano Ronaldo playing for Portugal. He knew his mum wasn't really a football fan but he couldn't resist telling her which team was the best, what the rules were and who his favourite player was. When she went upstairs to have a lie-down, it wasn't long before she was woken up by the huge racket coming from downstairs. ""Mum, mum, they won, they won!"" Christopher shouted. ""He had so much passion for football,"" Alina tells me. ""His younger brother misses him so much, especially when it comes to football, because Christopher was teaching him how to play."" Christopher played for Mountain Ash Juniors FC Christopher was 13 when his body was found in the River Cynon in Rhondda Cynon Taff, south Wales, on 1 July last year. He'd been out with a group of other young people on a really hot day when it happened. He was the only black child there. Within 24 hours, South Wales Police had told his mum there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death - it was a tragic accident. But the family and their lawyerraised concerns about how the investigation was handledand it was taken on by the force's major crime unit. Then in February this year, Alina got a letter from the Crown Prosecution Service. It said there was ""clear evidence"" that Christopher - who couldn't swim - had been pushed into the river. It said there was ""sufficient evidence to support a charge of unlawful act of manslaughter"" but they weren't going to prosecute the 14-year-old suspect because it wasn't in the ""public interest"". Christopher's familyhave accused the police and the CPS of institutional racism. ""If this had been 14 black youths and a white victim we have no doubt that the approach of the police and outcome would have been different,"" Alina said at the time. Alina Joseph has questioned why the suspect hasn't been prosecuted over her son's death I'm chatting to Alina on the phone a day before the first anniversary of her son's death. Three days earlier, I'd been at a remembrance event where friends and family gathered to share their memories of Christopher. His 14-year-old friend Cobi spoke through tears as he described how much Christopher meant to him. ""Christopher wasn't just a friend, he was more or less family. He was always cheeky - in a good way,"" he told the crowd. I've reported on many stories about people who've died - and there are some that just really hit you without warning. I was there writing notes of what Cobi was saying when I just had to stop because I welled up. This young lad was so upset but from somewhere he found the strength to speak up for his friend. ""To see the same joy that he gave me as his mum, he was able to give to somebody else's heart - that was deep,"" Alina tells me. Cobi paid tribute to Christopher wearing a football shirt with his friend's surname on it At times, you can hear the pride in Alina's voice when she talks about her son - it feels just like a very normal conversation. She tells me how he loved watching YouTube videos about history and how he had this certain way of saying ""Mummy"" which meant he wanted a fiver from her. Then there were the constant arguments with his six brothers and sisters over sharing the PlayStation - because he wanted to play Minecraft and Fortnite. Oh, and then there were all the times he broke his glasses. ""He slept with his glasses, we'd have to go in and take them off,"" Alina tells me. ""Everybody knew we needed to help him with his glasses because we were sure that the opticians had had enough. ""I remember one time he was in the shower and he was having a shower in the glasses. I said 'Christopher!' and he said 'Mum I can't really see properly'. ""Christopher was just funny in his own way."" Flowers were left near to the place where Christopher died a year on from his death It was a sunny morning when Alina woke up on the day Christopher died. ""I don't like beautiful mornings anymore because it's like you know something bad is just gonna end up happening,"" she tells me. The memory of that day must be so strong in her mind - she talks me through it in such detail. Christopher had come in from school and a few minutes later he told his mum he was going out to play football. Alina agreed he could go - but never got to say ""see you later"" or ""goodbye"". ""I hate that word now, or goodnight. What's good about it?"" she says. Later on, Alina was on the phone to her sister in Africa when there was a knock on the door. ""We were chatting away, we were laughing - he was there dying,"" she says through tears. It was Christopher's sports coach. ""We can't find Christopher, apparently he's jumped off a bridge,"" he told her. Police focused on a bridge over the River Cynon a part of their investigation Time is a bit blur for her after that. Alina started to go down to the river where he was last seen, but the roads were blocked off and she was told to wait at home as the police were on their way. But the officers couldn't tell her anything so she tried to keep busy by washing the dishes.  Eventually some news came in. ""We need to go to the hospital. We've found him,"" an officer told Alina. As we continue talking about it over the phone, the emotion of it all just overwhelms her. Hearing a mum wail down the phone for her son is absolutely heartbreaking - and we take a little break from the interview. But then she agrees to carry on - she's ready to tell me what happened next. ""I was blocking it, saying that he's fine, everything's fine. I'm actually gonna tell him off,"" she recalls. ""I was sweating like mad and every sound of that siren just made the situation even worse."" Alina releases a dove in memory of her son at his remembrance event Alina was taken into a grey room - the atmosphere was so bad. No-one could give her any information about Christopher. Frustrated and angry, she left and set off down the hospital corridor. ""I just started walking. I started crying. I just started walking, not knowing I was even actually walking in the right direction. ""Everybody was just lined up. The more I approached, they had their heads down. He was asleep. The only difference was he didn't have his glasses. And I knew. ""I tried calling his name. Normally he'd be like 'Yes Mama, I'm OK, Stop fussing, Mama. Mama, I didn't do it, it wasn't me.' ""Nothing like that was coming out."" Alina then goes on to tell me how the family had so many questions that weren't getting answered. Where exactly did he jump off the bridge? Why wasn't he wearing the same clothes in the morgue as he had been when he had left the house? How many people were actually there when Christopher fell into the river? Christopher's friends and family brought balloons with messages to his remembrance event It took seven months for Alina to find out exactly what evidence there was about how her son had died. ""There was clear evidence that the suspect pushed Christopher in the back with both hands causing him to fall into the river,"" the letter from the CPS said. ""That push was an unlawful act and it was clearly dangerous in that on an objective standard it created a danger of some harm."" It said that the evidence suggested the push was ""not in an effort to harm someone"" but ""ill considered"" and the suspect was ""mature and intelligent for his age"" and had a ""good school record"". It said the suspect ""will have learnt the very harshest of lessons from this experience, which will act as a deterrent from further offending"". It also explained the decision not to prosecute had considered the best interest of the suspect and the adverse impact on his future prospects. ""Christopher had so much going for him, so for that to be taken away and then to be told that somebody else's future is of more value than of his, that's very painful,"" Alina told the BBC at the time. Christopher's family came together for his remembrance event on 27 June During our chat, Alina told me her family had experienced racism since moving from London to south Wales in 2011. They'd had ""hate letters"" sent to the house, her children have been ""peed on"" and once Christopher had been left in a ""pool of blood"" after being attacked in a shop. I've seen the comments some people have posted on Facebook about this case and they're honestly tough to read. ""Pulling the race card is disgusting, total disrespect for the emergency services, sadly the boy has lost his life. People have donated thousands of pounds for his funeral, a little bit of gratitude is in order,"" one woman wrote. ""It's more of a worry that mum gave the boy permission to go swimming and he couldn't swim. It wasn't as if it was a swimming pool where lifeguards could have been at hand,"" another wrote. ""Sad to hear this, but pulling out the race card cheapens and demeans the issue and loses respect,"" said one man. And these are not from anonymous trolls. They're from people from around the community where Christopher lived. Some of the Facebook comments I've seen about this case have been tough to read The lack of compassion and nastiness that comes across in the comments must be so difficult for Alina to get her head around. She's a mum who has lost her 13-year-old child. Imagine if it was your son, your brother, your nephew? Would you just accept what had happened? Christopher's mum has been supported by anti-racism charity The Monitoring Group ever since the tragedy happened. ""This isn't playing the race card,"" its director Suresh Grover tells me. ""This is the lived experience of a large number of black people which tells you that when there are a large number of black people or children in the majority, and there are accusations of crimes, inevitably, they're mostly charged. ""And when black people are in the minority and suffer racial violence with a group of white people, we have cases which show that white people are never charged. 'I think for those people who say it's the 'race card' I just would say stop denying the reality that is so prevalent for black people in this country."" Suresh says there are still so many questions the family want answering. ""I think racism is a factor that can't be taken out and has to be examined by the police. ""For us, what's important is what exactly was said to Christopher before he was pushed in? What are the circumstances that led to his death? Was he afraid before he was pushed in? Was he being goaded before he was pushed in? ""What's very clear is that had Christopher been the only white person, I think the investigation wouldn't have come to the conclusion so quickly that it was an accident."" Suresh Grover is leading the Justice For Christopher Kapessa campaign Christopher's family have asked for the CPS's decision not to prosecute the suspect to be reviewed. They're currently waiting for the outcome. A crowdfunding page has raised nearly Â£20,000 to help with the family's legal fees and an online petition demanding ""Justice For Christopher Kapessa"" has more than 50,000 signatures. ""For Alina, justice looks like having confidence in the police to investigate properly and for the CPS to put the evidence in front of the jury, and for her boy's life to be treated on equal terms with any other person, not as somebody who has less worth or less value or less rights,"" Suresh says. I contacted the CPS but they told me it couldn't comment because its decision not to prosecute the suspect is still under review. They wouldn't tell me when the family might hear the outcome. South Wales Police said it's also waiting for the decision to be made. It added: ""South Wales Police has also referred the investigation to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) who will examine our response and subsequent investigation into the tragic circumstances surrounding Christopher's death. ""We will be absolutely committed to implementing any opportunities for learning by South Wales Police."" The IOPC said its investigation has made ""good progress"" but is partially suspended while the CPS's decision is under review. For now, Alina just has to wait. I think back to Christopher's remembrance event and there's one thing that his friend Coby says that really sticks out in my mind. It's something I think is important to remember, whatever happens next. ""Christopher Kapessa was an amazing person and he didn't deserve this.""

"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said face masks would become compulsory on public transport Three-layer face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July, the first minister has said. At the daily Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mark Drakeford said this would also be the case for taxis and other situations where 2m social distancing was not possible. Last month,Health Minister Vaughan Gething recommendedtheir use. But he stopped short of making them mandatory. How to make your own face mask Who should wear a face mask or face covering? Face coverings in England's shops to be compulsory Transport for Wales said it had worked with the Welsh Government throughout the pandemic and Great Western Railway said it encouraged all customers to follow the new rule. The Welsh Conservatives questioned why the measure was not being introduced immediately and Plaid Cymru called for masks to be made mandatory for all indoor spaces. The union Unite said it warmly welcomed the decision. Mr Drakeford said: ""For the sake of simplicity and consistency, as well as being part of our plan toÂ help reduce the risk of transmission while on public transport where it is not always possible to maintain a two metre physical distance, it will become mandatory for people to wear a three-layer face covering while travelling - this includes taxis."" This video can not be played Passengers in Cardiff had a mixed view of face masks Face coverings are currently required on public transport in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, whilewearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England is to become mandatory from 24 July. Having a different rule for wearing masks on public transport in Wales and England was ""not sustainable in the long term"", Mr Drakeford said. ""Our decision to make face coverings mandatory on public transport is a combination of the fact that we know as the economy gets back into operation more people will need to use public transport to go to work and for other purposes, and when more people need to use confined spaces then additional protections need to be introduced in order to overcome the fact that two-metre social distancing will not always be possible,"" he added. Taxi driver Stephen Clifford is not sure if the plan will work for taxis Taxi driver Stephen Clifford, from Newport, does not believe it will work for customers He said: ""Most of people the customers wouldn't wear them. ""We'd lose an awful lot of money. If you've got to have it, you have got to have it. And what if we had to provide them? It's hard to say."" This video can not be played The masks should be made of cotton, and even an old pair of socks can be used to cover your face Asked why coverings were not mandatory in other public spaces, Mr Drakeford said: ""The advice of the Welsh Government is that if places are crowded then face coverings are advisory. Where places are not crowded it is a matter for the individual citizen to make that decision."" Coronavirus is now ""at its lowest ebb"" since the pandemic began, he added, saying the Welsh Government's response had to be ""proportionate"". While Mr Drakeford said masks would not be mandatory for shoppers, businesses may ask people to wear them. The Welsh Government has recommended face coverings should be three layers thick He said the retail sector had made ""huge efforts"" to introduce measures to maintain physical distancing, including putting up one-way systems, limiting the number people who can enter a shop and putting up screens at checkouts.Â But, he added: ""At this point in time, when the prevalence of coronavirus is low, we are not mandating the use of face coverings in other public places, but many people may choose to wear them - and there is nothing to stop that happening in Wales. ""Our advice may change if cases of coronavirus begin to increase."" The first minister said the Welsh Government had made changes to regulations which recognise there are some occasions when it is not always possible to maintain a distance of 2m. ""These include maintaining hygiene standards and limiting close face-to-face interaction, wherever reasonable,"" he added. London Underground staff have been handing out face coverings Mr Drakeford also said 300,000 coronavirus tests have been carried out in Wales, with 17,000 of them positive. He urged people to carry on following the ""golden rules"" such as washing hands frequently. He said there had been a ""real change in working patterns, with more people working from home"", adding: ""We need to see flexible working become a permanent feature of working life in Wales and the Welsh government will lead the way in this."" Reacting to the announcement, Conservative Covid recovery spokesman Darren Millar said: ""We must still take every precaution to avoid a second wave of cases, and making wearing face masks mandatory from today may go some way to achieving this - but only if brought in now."" The British Medical Association (BMA) also called for the new rules to be ""implemented without delay"". It said face coverings should be used whenever people could not keep a safe distance. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price welcomed the move but said: ""In acknowledging that face coverings make a crucial difference on trains, buses and in taxis, the question must be begged of Welsh Government - why not in shops also? ""The latest guidance, while a step in the right direction, still doesn't go far enough."" Unite Wales regional secretary Peter Hughes said: ""This decision will improve safety on our buses, trains and taxisâ¦ it will also greatly increase the confidence of the general public to travel on public transport as lockdown measures are eased.""

"Making the wearing of face masks in shops in England compulsory could ""trigger abuse"" of staff, unions and businesses have warned. Union Usdaw said workers should not be made to enforce the rule if it becomes law as it could make them targets. And the Federation of Small Businesses said masks could make some ""happier to shop"", but others more nervous. Wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England is to become mandatory from 24 July. Those who fail to comply with the new rules will face a fine of up to Â£100, the government is to announce. Waterstones boss James Daunt told the BBC's Today Programme that making people wear masks in shops seemed ""a perfectly reasonable thing"". But the book chain boss also said it ""would not be right"" to ask staff to enforce the rule. ""There are a tiny, tiny minority of people who will be confrontational over it and it is not the position of shop workers to enter into that situation,"" he said. ""We shouldn't put ourselves in confrontational positions, but I think we can, as retailers, if we are requested to do so, clearly tell everybody it is a sensible thing to do."" Boris Johnson wore a mask for the first time as he visited a shop in Uxbridge on Friday The union Usdaw said workers were already dealing with more abuse than normal and urged the government to clarify its policy on face coverings in shops. ""It should never fall on shop workers to enforce the wearing of face coverings,"" warned Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary. Mike Cherry, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, added: ""We must be careful that this does not become a trigger for abuse against shop owners and their employees. Who should wear a face mask or face covering? Gove 'trusts common sense' on masks in shops Calls for clarity over face coverings in England ""[This policy] is likely to make some people happier to shop, and make others more nervous."" In Scotlandit has been compulsory to wear a covering while inside a shop since last Friday. Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told the Today programme that evidence now suggests that wearing masks in confined spaces makes a difference. ""Essentially infections are spread by droplets and they're relatively large when they come out in a cough or a sneeze but they become much smaller as they travel through the air. ""So the job of a cloth covering isn't so much to protect the wearer but to block the source of infection,"" she said. She said leaders should lead by example by being seen wearing face coverings and should explain clearly why it is needed or required. ""Enforcement needn't be heavy-handed. Requiring people to wear masks in shops will give that little extra nudge and make it much clearer for the general public,"" she said. Since mid-May, the public have been advised to wear coverings in enclosed public spaces, where they may encounter people they would not usually meet. It has been compulsory on public transport since 15 June. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to set out the new guidance on face coverings on Tuesday. They are designed to minimise the spread of coronavirus and also encourage people to return to the shops safely. Only 7% of shoppers say they have ""complete faith"" in current protective measures put in place by retailers, according to retail solutions firm Cennox. Its research suggested just over half of shoppers that had visited stores found measures inadequate or poorly managed. ""For the foreseeable future, safety is the new gold standard for retail loyalty,"" said Cennox boss Nick Cockett. ""Shoppers will vote with their feet if they don't feel protected.""

"Potential changes to travel insurance and passport rules for UK holidaymakers after Brexit are being highlighted in a series of adverts starting this week. The government's ""UK's new start: let's get going"" campaign will be run on TV, radio, online, print and billboards. There will be advice for Britons in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK, as well as UK and EU businesses, on how to prepare for the end of the transition period on 31 December. People will also receive text messages. On Mondaythe government also published,externala model setting out how the border with the EU would operate after the transition. Ministers say most of the actions that citizens and businesses are being asked to take will need to be completed regardless of theongoing negotiations between the UK and EUon the post-Brexit trade arrangements. That is because the UK will no longer be part of the single market and current customs union at the end of the year, no matter what arrangements are put in place. Brexit: Get ready because this time itâs for real A really simple guide to Brexit 'Significant divergences' in UK-EU talks - Barnier Gove defends Â£705m plan for post-Brexit borders The government says the actions people need to take after 1 January 2021 will vary depending on individual circumstances but the adverts will cover advice suggesting that: Britons intending to travel to Europe should ensure their passports are valid for a specific period, they have comprehensive travel insurance, and they check their mobile phone roaming policy people travelling to Europe from the UK with pets should contact a vet at least four months before their trip businesses planning to export or import to or from the EU should ensure they have registered with the relevant customs authority The adverts will advise people to ""Check, Change, Go"" and recommend using a checker tool on the government's website. Will the EHIC still be valid after Brexit? We've already left the EU but we've been in the departure lounge, the transition period, when the status quo is pretty much held. That is going to run out at the end of December, when we will leave the single market and the customs union. That means big changes for business and a lot of them are frustrated that it isn't clear enough what that new world would look like. There are also likely changes for all of us too. Your mobile phone bills might be pretty different next year if you escape somewhere in Europe on holiday, and message your friends from the beach. The EU health card that has given people insurance wouldn't apply anymore, so we need to make different arrangements about that. There are particular tensions for Northern Ireland, which of course will be part of the UK customs territory, but will still follow some EU customs law and regulation on goods to avoid a hard border. There could be real disruption there if laws on the different sides of the channel diverged over the years. And there is an overall concern in government too, as we saw from a leaked letter from the International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, that the government just isn't quite ready for all of this, let alone the population and businesses who will have to grapple with the changes on the ground. The adverts will appear on TV, radio and online - as well as billboards Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the end of the transition period will ""bring changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare"". ""While we have already made great progress in getting ready for this moment, there are actions that businesses and citizens must take now to ensure we are ready to hit the ground running as a fully independent United Kingdom."" However, the Cabinet Office says some of the UK-wide guidance will not apply to trade between Northern Ireland and the EU until the negotiations have concluded. A special trade arrangement involving Northern Ireland was agreed as part of the Brexit transition deal. The campaign comes after the government announced a Â£705m funding package to help manage Britain's borders after Brexit - measures Labour said were ""too little, too late"" and showed that ministers were unprepared. This video can not be played Michael Gove announces a new public information campaign and an âoperating model for the borderâ. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Gove set out details of a new border operating model that would be phased in between January and July 2021. From January, traders importing standard goods, such as clothes and electronics, will need to prepare for basic customs requirements. By July, traders moving any goods will have to make full customs declarations at the point of importation and pay relevant tariffs. HMRC estimates that the new system will see a 215 million rise in the number of customs declarations. It is understood that the government expects to build 10 to 12 inland border posts, in order to check traders are complying with customs rules. Brexit: What do businesses need to prepare for? Mr Gove told MPs that the model would help the UK on its way to having ""the world's most effective border by 2025"". But Labour's Rachel Reeves accused the government of ""wrapping business in red tape and sending them to a supersize lorry park in Dover"". ""The best way to help all businesses to prepare is to agree a deal with EU on the terms we were told to expect - that means no fees, charges, tariffs or quantitative restrictions across all sectors. ""It does not mean customs, physical checks and export declarations.""

"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18.

Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate.

If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before.

"Bonnybridge-based E&O Laboratories is behind the solution A Scottish biotech firm has landed a deal worth up to Â£7m with NHS Scotland after creating a chemical solution to aid the Covid-19 testing process. The ""breakthrough"" approach is said to help make testing turnaround more efficient and improve safety. The VPSS solution (Viral PCR Sample Solution) was developed by Bonnybridge-based E&O Laboratories. VPSS is placed in each tube, which is said to make test samples that contain Covid-19 safe within the tube itself. This means that by the time it is transported to the lab, it is immediately ready for testing. This streamlines the testing process and means lab technicians do not need to reopen the tubes to apply any pre-testing solution in the lab environment. The result is an approved solution for production with up to 3.5 million of the new 'VPSS added' test tubes. An initial quantity of 85,000 units will be distributed across Scotland from this week. Trade minister Ivan McKee said: ""Since the start of this pandemic the Scottish government has supported many Scottish businesses to innovate and alter their production processes, allowing us to be less reliant on global supply chains. ""E&O's work in this area secures a Scottish supplier of a crucial testing chemical that not only streamlines the testing process and supports our national test and protect programme, it will also further improve the safety of lab workers carrying out these essential tests."" Virginia Lucey, Managing Director of E&O said: ""Our research and development team worked tirelessly with NHS virology experts to design formulations that will aid reliable testing of Covid-19.""

"This video can not be played ""He had so much passion for football"" Alina Joseph remembers sitting with her son Christopher Kapessa in their living room watching the 2018 Fifa World Cup on the telly. It was a scorcher of a day but Christopher was glued to the screen watching Cristiano Ronaldo playing for Portugal. He knew his mum wasn't really a football fan but he couldn't resist telling her which team was the best, what the rules were and who his favourite player was. When she went upstairs to have a lie-down, it wasn't long before she was woken up by the huge racket coming from downstairs. ""Mum, mum, they won, they won!"" Christopher shouted. ""He had so much passion for football,"" Alina tells me. ""His younger brother misses him so much, especially when it comes to football, because Christopher was teaching him how to play."" Christopher played for Mountain Ash Juniors FC Christopher was 13 when his body was found in the River Cynon in Rhondda Cynon Taff, south Wales, on 1 July last year. He'd been out with a group of other young people on a really hot day when it happened. He was the only black child there. Within 24 hours, South Wales Police had told his mum there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death - it was a tragic accident. But the family and their lawyerraised concerns about how the investigation was handledand it was taken on by the force's major crime unit. Then in February this year, Alina got a letter from the Crown Prosecution Service. It said there was ""clear evidence"" that Christopher - who couldn't swim - had been pushed into the river. It said there was ""sufficient evidence to support a charge of unlawful act of manslaughter"" but they weren't going to prosecute the 14-year-old suspect because it wasn't in the ""public interest"". Christopher's familyhave accused the police and the CPS of institutional racism. ""If this had been 14 black youths and a white victim we have no doubt that the approach of the police and outcome would have been different,"" Alina said at the time. Alina Joseph has questioned why the suspect hasn't been prosecuted over her son's death I'm chatting to Alina on the phone a day before the first anniversary of her son's death. Three days earlier, I'd been at a remembrance event where friends and family gathered to share their memories of Christopher. His 14-year-old friend Cobi spoke through tears as he described how much Christopher meant to him. ""Christopher wasn't just a friend, he was more or less family. He was always cheeky - in a good way,"" he told the crowd. I've reported on many stories about people who've died - and there are some that just really hit you without warning. I was there writing notes of what Cobi was saying when I just had to stop because I welled up. This young lad was so upset but from somewhere he found the strength to speak up for his friend. ""To see the same joy that he gave me as his mum, he was able to give to somebody else's heart - that was deep,"" Alina tells me. Cobi paid tribute to Christopher wearing a football shirt with his friend's surname on it At times, you can hear the pride in Alina's voice when she talks about her son - it feels just like a very normal conversation. She tells me how he loved watching YouTube videos about history and how he had this certain way of saying ""Mummy"" which meant he wanted a fiver from her. Then there were the constant arguments with his six brothers and sisters over sharing the PlayStation - because he wanted to play Minecraft and Fortnite. Oh, and then there were all the times he broke his glasses. ""He slept with his glasses, we'd have to go in and take them off,"" Alina tells me. ""Everybody knew we needed to help him with his glasses because we were sure that the opticians had had enough. ""I remember one time he was in the shower and he was having a shower in the glasses. I said 'Christopher!' and he said 'Mum I can't really see properly'. ""Christopher was just funny in his own way."" Flowers were left near to the place where Christopher died a year on from his death It was a sunny morning when Alina woke up on the day Christopher died. ""I don't like beautiful mornings anymore because it's like you know something bad is just gonna end up happening,"" she tells me. The memory of that day must be so strong in her mind - she talks me through it in such detail. Christopher had come in from school and a few minutes later he told his mum he was going out to play football. Alina agreed he could go - but never got to say ""see you later"" or ""goodbye"". ""I hate that word now, or goodnight. What's good about it?"" she says. Later on, Alina was on the phone to her sister in Africa when there was a knock on the door. ""We were chatting away, we were laughing - he was there dying,"" she says through tears. It was Christopher's sports coach. ""We can't find Christopher, apparently he's jumped off a bridge,"" he told her. Police focused on a bridge over the River Cynon a part of their investigation Time is a bit blur for her after that. Alina started to go down to the river where he was last seen, but the roads were blocked off and she was told to wait at home as the police were on their way. But the officers couldn't tell her anything so she tried to keep busy by washing the dishes.  Eventually some news came in. ""We need to go to the hospital. We've found him,"" an officer told Alina. As we continue talking about it over the phone, the emotion of it all just overwhelms her. Hearing a mum wail down the phone for her son is absolutely heartbreaking - and we take a little break from the interview. But then she agrees to carry on - she's ready to tell me what happened next. ""I was blocking it, saying that he's fine, everything's fine. I'm actually gonna tell him off,"" she recalls. ""I was sweating like mad and every sound of that siren just made the situation even worse."" Alina releases a dove in memory of her son at his remembrance event Alina was taken into a grey room - the atmosphere was so bad. No-one could give her any information about Christopher. Frustrated and angry, she left and set off down the hospital corridor. ""I just started walking. I started crying. I just started walking, not knowing I was even actually walking in the right direction. ""Everybody was just lined up. The more I approached, they had their heads down. He was asleep. The only difference was he didn't have his glasses. And I knew. ""I tried calling his name. Normally he'd be like 'Yes Mama, I'm OK, Stop fussing, Mama. Mama, I didn't do it, it wasn't me.' ""Nothing like that was coming out."" Alina then goes on to tell me how the family had so many questions that weren't getting answered. Where exactly did he jump off the bridge? Why wasn't he wearing the same clothes in the morgue as he had been when he had left the house? How many people were actually there when Christopher fell into the river? Christopher's friends and family brought balloons with messages to his remembrance event It took seven months for Alina to find out exactly what evidence there was about how her son had died. ""There was clear evidence that the suspect pushed Christopher in the back with both hands causing him to fall into the river,"" the letter from the CPS said. ""That push was an unlawful act and it was clearly dangerous in that on an objective standard it created a danger of some harm."" It said that the evidence suggested the push was ""not in an effort to harm someone"" but ""ill considered"" and the suspect was ""mature and intelligent for his age"" and had a ""good school record"". It said the suspect ""will have learnt the very harshest of lessons from this experience, which will act as a deterrent from further offending"". It also explained the decision not to prosecute had considered the best interest of the suspect and the adverse impact on his future prospects. ""Christopher had so much going for him, so for that to be taken away and then to be told that somebody else's future is of more value than of his, that's very painful,"" Alina told the BBC at the time. Christopher's family came together for his remembrance event on 27 June During our chat, Alina told me her family had experienced racism since moving from London to south Wales in 2011. They'd had ""hate letters"" sent to the house, her children have been ""peed on"" and once Christopher had been left in a ""pool of blood"" after being attacked in a shop. I've seen the comments some people have posted on Facebook about this case and they're honestly tough to read. ""Pulling the race card is disgusting, total disrespect for the emergency services, sadly the boy has lost his life. People have donated thousands of pounds for his funeral, a little bit of gratitude is in order,"" one woman wrote. ""It's more of a worry that mum gave the boy permission to go swimming and he couldn't swim. It wasn't as if it was a swimming pool where lifeguards could have been at hand,"" another wrote. ""Sad to hear this, but pulling out the race card cheapens and demeans the issue and loses respect,"" said one man. And these are not from anonymous trolls. They're from people from around the community where Christopher lived. Some of the Facebook comments I've seen about this case have been tough to read The lack of compassion and nastiness that comes across in the comments must be so difficult for Alina to get her head around. She's a mum who has lost her 13-year-old child. Imagine if it was your son, your brother, your nephew? Would you just accept what had happened? Christopher's mum has been supported by anti-racism charity The Monitoring Group ever since the tragedy happened. ""This isn't playing the race card,"" its director Suresh Grover tells me. ""This is the lived experience of a large number of black people which tells you that when there are a large number of black people or children in the majority, and there are accusations of crimes, inevitably, they're mostly charged. ""And when black people are in the minority and suffer racial violence with a group of white people, we have cases which show that white people are never charged. 'I think for those people who say it's the 'race card' I just would say stop denying the reality that is so prevalent for black people in this country."" Suresh says there are still so many questions the family want answering. ""I think racism is a factor that can't be taken out and has to be examined by the police. ""For us, what's important is what exactly was said to Christopher before he was pushed in? What are the circumstances that led to his death? Was he afraid before he was pushed in? Was he being goaded before he was pushed in? ""What's very clear is that had Christopher been the only white person, I think the investigation wouldn't have come to the conclusion so quickly that it was an accident."" Suresh Grover is leading the Justice For Christopher Kapessa campaign Christopher's family have asked for the CPS's decision not to prosecute the suspect to be reviewed. They're currently waiting for the outcome. A crowdfunding page has raised nearly Â£20,000 to help with the family's legal fees and an online petition demanding ""Justice For Christopher Kapessa"" has more than 50,000 signatures. ""For Alina, justice looks like having confidence in the police to investigate properly and for the CPS to put the evidence in front of the jury, and for her boy's life to be treated on equal terms with any other person, not as somebody who has less worth or less value or less rights,"" Suresh says. I contacted the CPS but they told me it couldn't comment because its decision not to prosecute the suspect is still under review. They wouldn't tell me when the family might hear the outcome. South Wales Police said it's also waiting for the decision to be made. It added: ""South Wales Police has also referred the investigation to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) who will examine our response and subsequent investigation into the tragic circumstances surrounding Christopher's death. ""We will be absolutely committed to implementing any opportunities for learning by South Wales Police."" The IOPC said its investigation has made ""good progress"" but is partially suspended while the CPS's decision is under review. For now, Alina just has to wait. I think back to Christopher's remembrance event and there's one thing that his friend Coby says that really sticks out in my mind. It's something I think is important to remember, whatever happens next. ""Christopher Kapessa was an amazing person and he didn't deserve this.""

"Key workers Kevin and Melissa Antwhistle are stuck in ""a financial nightmare"" because of their mortgage MPs are calling on the government to step in and help more than 170,000 ""mortgage prisoners"" who are trapped on high interest rates. Thousands of frontline workers, including nurses and hospital workers, are forced to pay double the interest they would on a competitive mortgage. Strict affordability rules prevent them from re-mortgaging to a cheaper deal. MPs now want the government to order regulators to investigate capping the profits firms make from the borrowers. They are asking for the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to undertake a joint consultation and introduce a cap on standard variable rates. The Treasury said it sympathises with the situation of borrowers who cannot switch mortgages if, for example, their loan is too high against the value of their home or because they are now too old to re-mortgage. Last October, the FCA reformed the affordability rules to allow lenders to help mortgage prisoners with cheaper home loans. But so far not a single lender has done so. Some key workers, who are also mortgage prisoners, say the financial pressure caused by paying far more than other homeowners is worsening the considerable stress of being on the frontline during the coronavirus pandemic. Melissa Antwhistle has been dressing in protective equipment every day for round-the-clock shifts on the frontline at Scunthorpe general hospital, including in the intensive care unit. But financially, she feels far from supported. Speaking between shifts, she said: ""Many mortgage prisoners are key workers like my husband and me. Doing this job with all the stress of Covid and also looking after our children aged one and three, we could do without the extra stress and anxiety of this financial nightmare. Melissa Antwhistle is a frontline NHS worker ""While the nation clapped for key workers every Thursday evening in admiration, in fact we have been risking everything not just to fulfil our vocations but also because we were forced to work round the clock just to keep a roof over our heads."" Her husband Kevin - also a key worker who runs and maintains a power station on the south Humber bank - bought his Â£120,000 house with a mortgage from Northern Rock and an unsecured loan on top in 2007. Northern Rock's ""Together"" mortgage was approved at the time by regulators under the oversight of the Treasury. But it's a decision he has had 13 years to regret. After it was nationalised, the Treasury put his loan along with hundreds of thousands of others into a new entity called Northern Rock Asset Management (NRAM). The Treasury then allowed NRAM to make bigger profit margins on standard variable rate mortgages, preparing the way for the sale of a portfolio of mortgages to private investors who could make large profits from the repayments Kevin and Melissa were making. His loan was then sold in 2014 as part of a Â£13bn portfolio of loans to private investors whose mortgage interest rates were outside the regulation of the FCA. Northern Rock collapsed in September 2007 before being nationalised It was the biggest privatisation in UK history, meeting the Treasury's long-cherished goal of re-privatising the mortgage assets nationalised in the 2008 financial crisis. However, the investors purchasing the loans were typically 'inactive' lenders, meaning they were not willing or able to offer competitive new deals to existing borrowers. It meant that when their initial fixed-rate interest rate deals expired, Kevin and Melissa could not re-mortgage to a cheaper deal with their existing lender. Instead they moved on to the high standard variable rate where they paid interest rates of between 6% and 9%, compared to loans of less than 3% had they been able to re-mortgage. Melissa and Kevin have been paying Â£780 a month on their Northern Rock loan, compared to Â£420 or less if they could re-mortgage. But because they borrowed more than the value of the property, the regulators' affordability rules now say they can't re-mortgage. The rules, in other words, say they can't afford to pay less. ""Watching the widespread financial support during the current crisis has been a bitter pill to swallow. For many years we've been blamed for being ill-prepared and told that buying a mortgage is the risk you take,"" Kevin says. ""Yet whilst we're asked to risk our lives and take risks with our families' health, making huge sacrifices, we continue to be financially exploited without any choice. Our job is vocational but also necessary to pay the crippling interest rates."" Rachel Neale of the UK Mortgage Prisoners campaign said appeals to the Treasury to help key workers and others trapped on high-interest loans haven't helped a single mortgage prisoner. ""Families are being crippled by these high interest rates and aren't able to live properly because of it. We need action immediately before things get even worse and drive people into further arrears or cause repossessions."" In a letter to the Competition and Markets Authority, the all-party parliamentary group on mortgage prisoners says even during this period of record-low official rates, mortgage prisoners are typically paying 4.4%, two and half times the most competitive rates of 1.8% or less. Campaigner Rachel Neale says families are being ""crippled"" by high interest rates ""Mortgage prisoners are being exploited, by both fully regulated lenders and unregulated vulture funds by being held on high standard variable rates, ""says the letter, signed by LibDem, Conservative and Labour MPs. ""We believe that the only way mortgage prisoners will see the vital improvements they need within an acceptable timescale will be for the CMA and the FCA to conduct a joint consultation and introduce a cap on standard variable rates."" A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""We know that being unable to switch your mortgage can be stressful. ""That's why we've introduced rules that will make it easier for some customers to change provider, which we now expect to be in place by the end of the year. ""The Financial Conduct Authority has also reiterated to lenders that customers on variable rate mortgages must be treated fairly, and that lenders should be actively reviewing their rates.""

"Beauty salons, spas, tattoo parlours and nail bars are welcoming back their first clients for almost four months, as lockdown restrictions ease further in England. But some treatments, such as eyebrow threading, are still banned, leaving many salons unable to reopen. In Scotland,indoor shopping centres are allowed to reopen. In Wales, pubs, bars and restaurantscan start serving customers outdoors, while hairdresserscan also reopen. Businesses will be required to follow guidelines to reduce the spread of coronavirus - and treatments which involve work directly in front of the face will not be available. Government guidance,externalsays services including face waxing, eyebrow threading, eyelash treatments, make-up applications and facials should not be provided because of the greater risk of Covid-19 transmission. Government to decide on face masks in shops How can I have my nails done safely? Naresh Bhana, who runs Flamin' Eight tattoo studio in north London, said the business was only taking advance bookings, so ""you can't walk off the street unannounced"". ""We can accommodate two or three being tattooed but we stagger their start times,"" he said. ""Work areas are four metres apart. Everyone's wearing masks. Clients will wear visors as well."" He has created a commemorative tattoo for his wife to mark the reopening. The tattoo design to mark the end of lockdown for tattoo parlours was created for Naresh's wife, Sonia Beard trims have been allowed since barbers opened last weekend - but should be limited to simple tidy-ups or thinning which can be carried out from the side or by circling the client to avoid the highest risk zone in front of the face,the British Beauty Council has said,external. The co-founder of the home beauty service, Blow Ltd, Fiona McIntosh, said the ban on beauty treatments involving the face was ""hugely frustrating"". ""We still don't know when we're going to be able to do those services, which is having a huge impact on the freelancers who work for us,"" she said. ""We have 250 women, freelance beauticians on our platform across London, Manchester and Birmingham who can't work and they have been given no date on when they can work."" She added: ""I found it very difficult to understand how a lash treatment when you actually could have a mask on to have that done is different to a beard treatment."" Blow Ltd uses 1,000 self-employed beauticians and about a quarter of them can still not work, says Fiona McIntosh Angela Burnett, the co-founder of Moreton Place Beauty and Wellbeing in London, added: ""It's half of our business, not being able do facials and facial treatment. For example we can't do any eyebrow waxing, any tinting, any lip waxing. So we're just doing manicures, pedicures and massages."" Vanita Parti, founder and chief executive of the Blink Brow Bar walk-in beauty bar chain, which has 11 shops in London and specialises in eyebrow treatments, said her salons would not be able to reopen under the guidelines. ""I'm furious,""she told the BBC last week. ""This will kill so many businesses. I wish they'd consulted us."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? Massage studios, tanning salons, physical therapy businesses and piercing services are also now allowed to reopen in England. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""Enabling these often small, independent businesses to reopen is yet another step in our plan to kickstart the economy to support jobs and incomes across the country."" Some nail bars have installed plastic screens to reduce the spread of coronavirus At a salon in Birkenhead, a nail technician wears a PPE face shield and mask People - including a woman in Chirton, North Shields - are also returning to sunbeds for the first time in three months In Scotland, hospitals are reopening to visitors and children and young people are now allowed to play contact sports outdoors. From Wednesday, Scottish hairdressers and barbers will be able to reopen and indoor pubs, cafes and restaurants can return to business. In Wales, hospitality businesses can open for outdoor service.  Only half of venues are predicted to do so, with major chains, including Wetherspoons and Brains, waiting until customers are allowed indoors from 3 August. The National Trust is also reopening some of its historic houses, with visitors allowed at seven properties in England and Northern Ireland in a test run of new rules intended to keep the public and staff as safe as possible. ""We're really grateful to our members and supporters for sticking with us during lockdown,"" said Tarnya Cooper from the National Trust, who spoke to BBC's Breakfast from Petworth House. ""This is the first time in  16 weeks we've been able to contemplate reopening our houses."" She said about one million visitors had already pre-booked trips to National Trust's parks and gardenssince they opened in early June. Meanwhile, the government's approach to face coverings in England continues to be discussed, following calls for clarity over the weekend. Boris Johnsonhas said people in England""should be wearing"" masks or other coverings inside shops to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. He said the government would decide in the next few days if ""tools of enforcement"" were needed. Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said he would ""perhaps"" support making the wearing of masks in public compulsory but his colleague Michael Govesaid on Sunday he thought the matter should be left to people's ""common sense"". Mr Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Wearing them in an enclosed space where you've got lots of people, for example a busy shop, seems to be sensible. ""It is all about increasing confidence. I think the more of us who do the courteous and responsible thing, the more people you'll see venture out into shops."" He added: ""If it becomes necessary to nudge people further by taking further action then of course we will consider that. I think the matter is under careful and daily review."" Face masks are mandatory in shops in Scotland but not in England, although some shoppers do wear them A further 650 coronavirus cases were reported across the UK on Sunday,according to the Department of Health,external. That is an increase on the 516 cases reported on the same day a week earlier - but hugely down on the peak in April when there were about 5,000 new cases a day. The total number of people who have died with Covid-19 in the UK is now 44,819, a rise of 21 on the previous day - although figures tend to be lower at weekends because of reporting delays.

"The Pelican, in Ogmore-by-Sea, will welcome drinkers back on Monday Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes in Wales are allowed to start serving customers outdoors on Monday - but only half are predicted to open. Major pub chains including Wetherspoons and Brains will wait until customers are allowed indoors from 3 August. With turnover expected to be at 25% of pre-lockdown levels, independent businesses say only half will open. After self-catering accommodation opened on Saturday,hairdressers will also welcome customers backon Monday. This video can not be played A ""scrumptious"" socially-distant drink On Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford saidhospitality businesses could reopen indoors from 3 August, providing coronavirus cases continue to fall. He announced the date in a long list of changes to coronavirus restrictions, including that exemptions will be made to the 2m social distancing rule for some businesses. One pub in Tintern,Monmouthshire, opened its beer garden early on Monday morning. Royal George landlord Richard Secular said it had taken ""a gigantic effort"" to reopen and take the pub ""from the inside to the outside"". Tintern's Royal George opened its beer garden early on Monday morning He added that customers were having their temperatures checked. ""We have built an outside bar with a cover so whatever the weather we can serve people,"" he said. Mark Griffiths owns four pubs in Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan and is gearing up to start serving from two of these, while the other two will remain shut. Fear pubs will 'go bust' unless rules relaxed Give pubs and cafes re-opening date, say unions England has first night out since lockdown The Pelican, at Ogmore-by-Sea, has been serving takeaway food for a month, and Mr Griffiths said ""it went really well, but we had to slow down"". ""We were selling too many and the bank behind it was like Henman Hill,"" he said. He is hoping to open the pub from 12:00 BST until 20:00, and maybe later on the weekend, as well as The Haywain in Brackla, Bridgend, where an 80-seater marquee has been erected in the car park in case it rains, with social distancing measures put in place. Hundreds of people have booked tables on social media for The Haywain, including a group of eight for Monday, Friday and Saturday. But Mr Griffiths has decided not to open his other two pubs - The Five Bells in Bridgend and The Seahorse in Porthcawl - because they have no outside area. ""I will concentrate on the two,"" he said. ""The weather is looking quite good, so if I can get 100 people outside both pubs every day next week, that will be good. ""We have lost the summer money now, there's no point trying to chase it. It's a case of making what you can."" Staff at The Lion in Treorchy have been preparing to reopen Reopening pubs in England on a Saturday was ""irresponsible"", according to Adrian Emmett, of The Lion in Treorchy. ""I think the Scottish and Welsh governments have the right idea opening on a Monday. It will make my job a lot easier."" Mr Emmett said ""the pressure is going to be on"" staff to make sure customers adhere to rules. At the St Brides Inn, Little Haven, Pembrokeshire, 80% of trade is from tourists. Landlord Malcolm Whitewright has arranged tables two metres apart and hopes social distancing measures will be reduced to one metre. Tourists usually flock to Little Haven during the summer months ""We have a modest garden with about ten tables available,"" he said. ""We probably won't make a profit but at least we will be up and running again and get some of our staff back to work."" Out of 18 employees, about eight will start work again, with the rest remaining on furlough. This video can not be played Confused about what you can do when? This should help 'I've spent close to Â£30,000 Miguel Santiago is looking forward to pulling pints again after spending Â£30,000 preparing to reopen. The landlord owns The Beaufort, in Raglan, Monmouthshire. Miguel Santiago is looking forward to pulling pints again after spending Â£30,000 preparing to reopen He told BBC Radio Wales he had made changes to the pub's outdoor seating and had bought bought two tiki huts - a kind of outdoor bar. ""I think I've spent close to Â£30,000, which on top of everything you've lost is a lot,"" he said. ""But when you get left alone in a big building and are a bit bored, you start spending money you haven't got!"" He said staff were ""really looking forward"" to returning to work. ""We will attract a lot of people from the city, because they will come out to more rural areas because we have more outside space here,"" Mr Santiago said. ""I'm looking forward to meeting some new people."" The Gower Brewery has focused mainly on online orders since lockdown, delivering between Llanelli and Cardiff and sending beer around the UK The Swansea-based Gower Brewery has been delivering hundreds of draught beer kegs in readiness  - but the company's Bob Dudley-Jones said many pubs in the city will not open. ""A lot have no beer gardens, or you have to go through the pub to get to them,"" he said. ""More on the coast and seaside resorts will, but because people are sat outside, a lot will depend on the weather."" The Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective warned that limited potential to make a profit would see as few as half of independent premises open on Monday. None of the 104 pubs owned and managed by Cardiff-based brewer SA Brains will reopen, although some of the 40 which are tenanted may. The Duke of Cambridge opened the brewery's new site in Cardiff Bay after it moved from the city centre In a statement, it said it looked forward to welcoming customers when it has ""the green light"" to open fully - with3 August announced as the dateon Friday. Brains is not the only chain to take this approach, with Wetherspoons and Mitchells & Butlers, each of which own about 50 pubs in Wales, not opening. But Stonegate will open a number of its premises, including Henry's, The Woodville and Owain Glyndwr in Cardiff, Railway Hotel in Penarth and The Carlton, Llandudno. The Ei group will serve pints from 64 premises, including The Old Cross Keys in Swansea, Bulls Head in Bala and The Mitre in Pwllheli.

"Everyone in Wales will have to wear face coverings when using public transport from 27 July, the first minister has announced Mark Drakeford said it was for the ""sake of simplicity"" as they are already required in the other UK nations Hairdressers and barbers in Wales can reopen from today under strict hygiene rules and appointment booking Pubs, restaurants and cafes can also resume trading outdoors It comes after restrictions for cottages, caravan sites and holiday parks were eased on Saturday No new deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales were reported on Monday, for the fourth time in the last seven days Nicola Bryan, Matt Lloyd, James McCarthy and Andy Roberts Thatâs it for our live blog today. Weâll be back again
tomorrow with all the latest on coronavirus in Wales. In the meantime you cankeep up to date here on developments around the world. Hereâs a recap of todayâs main
developments in Wales: Opposition parties have criticised the Welsh Government's decision on making masks compulsory on public transport. The Welsh Conservatives said the rule should come into force from today rather than July 27. Covid recovery spokesman Darren Millar said: ""The first minister and his cabinet must produce the scientific evidence - if it exists - to justify introducing them two weeks from now, rather than with immediate effect, and why only on public transport."" Meanwhile Plaid Cymru wants masks worn in all enclosed spaces. Party leader Adam Price said: ""In acknowledging that face coverings make a crucial difference on trains, buses and in taxis, the question must be begged of Welsh Government, why not in shops also? Masks were made compulsory for shoppers in Scotland last Friday A motorist stopped by police in north Wales told them his friend was giving him a driving lesson during lockdown, a court heard. Daniel Peel, from Telford, Shropshire, was convicted in his absence by Llandudno magistrates of going on a non-essential journey at Rhuddlan in April. This was in breach of coronavirus restrictions. The 27-year-old was fined Â£90 and told to pay Â£200 costs. Outdoor team sports areallowed to resume from Mondayonce their ruling bodies have issued guidelines based the Welsh Government's decision. Previously only non-team outdoor sports - such as tennis and bowls - werepermitted below elite level. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said guidelines for the return of football, rugby and cricket would be issued by those sports' governing bodies. ""They [the guidelines] allow low-contact sport, so football is okay,"" he said. ""A rugby scrum is a different matter. ""Coronavirus would be very happy indeed to see people doing that, so that will not be part of what we are reopening."" The Welsh Rugby Union, the Football Association of Wales and Cricket Wales are consulting members before announcing how and when their respective sports can resume at grassroots level. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Masks to become compulsory on public transport in Wales Face masks are to be mademandatory on public transport in Wales from 27 July, the first minister has announced. At the Welsh Governmentâs daily coronavirus briefing, Mark Drakeford said this would include taxis and other situations where social distancing was not possible. He said this was being done for ""simplicity and consistencyâ because of the âporousâ border between England and Wales and to reduce transmission risk on public transport. âIt will become mandatory for people to wear a three-layer face covering while travelling,â he said. Such coverings are already required on public transport in the rest of the UK. The union Unite has welcomed the Welsh Government's decision to make masks compulsory on public transport. It said previous measures to make coverings discretionary did not go far enough. Unite Wales regional secretary Peter Hughes said: ""Our members working for bus companies, and within the taxi trade, have been arguing that this is the best way to protect themselves and the travelling public. ""This decision will improve safety on our buses, trains and taxis and help prevent the transmission of Covid-19 within Wales. ""It will also greatly increase the confidence of the general public.â Facial coverings are already required on public transport in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland For the fourth day in the last seven, no new deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales have been reported, according to Public Health  Wales. This graph shows the daily number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths according to when they occurred, rather than when they were announced. Graph showing coronavirus deaths in Wales Any decision about the future of Wales should ""lie in the hands of Welsh peopleâ, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford was asked about whether the differing decisions made by the UK and Welsh governments over coronavirus would encourage people to move towards an independent Wales. The Welsh Labour leader said the people of Wales would have the opportunity next May to elect a new government, but he would be âadvocatingâ for a devolved Wales remaining in the United Kingdom. He added: âOther parties will be able to put alternative propositions to them, and then I do certainly agree that it is for people in Wales to make a decision about how they would best want their futures to be organised."" Plaid Cymru will lead a debate on independence in the Senedd on Wednesday. For the fourth day in the last seven, no new deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported in Wales, according to Public Health Wales. It means the official total number of deaths remains at 1,541.

However CHAIRsalons on Whitchurch Road, Cardiff, has only opened for clients to have a skin test ahead of any treatment.

No deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported in Wales once again, for the fourth day in the last week, Public Health Wales has said. The official total number of deaths of people with Covid-19 in Wales remains at 1,541.  We'd lose money if we had to provide the masks, says Stephen Clifford Newport taxi driver Stephen Clifford says there needs to be more advice to drivers over the use of face masks. Three-layer face coverings will be mandatory on public transportin Wales from 27 July, the first minister has announced. However Mr Clifford does not think the policy will be followed by all. âI
just donât think it would work. Most of the customers wouldnât wear
them,"" he said. ""If youâve gotta have it, you gotta have
it, but what if we had to provide them? Itâs hard to say [but] weâd lose an awful lot of money."" The arts sector in Wales will be consulted on how to spend a Â£59m support grant, the first minister has said. That isWales' share of a Â£1.57bn coronavirus support packagefor the arts and culture industry announced by the UK government. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government would âplan and then publish, rather than publish than planâ. He added: âIt is better we say things publicly when we've agreed with the people who are most directly affected what it is we intend to do.â Artists have been left in ""real hardship""by the closure of venues, events and concerts during the coronavirus outbreak, the Arts Council of Wales has previously warned. An announcement on whether the Welsh Government would offer astamp duty holidayto property buyers could be made as early as tomorrow, the first minister has said. A temporary holiday on stamp duty - a tax on property sales - forthe first Â£500,000 of the sale price in England and Northern Irelandhas already come into effect. However in Wales, stamp duty - known as Land Transaction tax - is devolved. Mark Drakeford said there would be an announcement on it âvery shortly, maybe as early as tomorrowâ. Estate agents in Wales have raised concerns that cutting tax on house sales in England would hit the property market in Wales, especially in border areas. The two-week delay in making face masks mandatory on public transport in Wales is to work out the details as well as exceptions, the first minister said. Exceptions will include children under a certain age, those with breathing difficulties, and those who rely on lip-reading. âA couple of weeks to get those things right and get them in place, and to do that with the operators, is not unreasonable,"" Mark Drakeford said. On whether he would wear a face mask, the first minister replied: âWhen I next take a bus out through Canton in Cardiff then I will be wearing a face covering like everyone else.â Localised coronavirus spikes in Wales will be publicised, the first minister said. Mark Drakeford said people âmust be preparedâ for the
fact there will be local flare-ups, and the whole point of its test and trace
system was to identify them emerging. He said the government would not publish a âspeculative
listâ of places, but would react to the data. âAs soon as we have the evidence of it, then we will
publish that in order to make sure people have that data,â Mr Drakeford said at the daily coronavirus briefing. Over the border in England, up to200 workers have been told to self-isolateon a farm in Herefordshire where they pick crops after 73 of them tested positive for Covid-19. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the decision to makeface coverings mandatory on public transport from 27 Julyis a response to the easing of lockdown rules to help kick-start the Welsh economy. Todayhairdressers have welcomed back customerswhilepubs, cafe and restaurants can open outsideareas. âAs the economy gets back into operation more people will need to use public transport to go to work and for other purposes, and when more people need to use confined spaces then additional protections need to be introduced to overcome the fact that 2-metre social distancing will not always be possible,â Mr Drakeford said. Face coverings are already required on public transport in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, so having a different rule in Wales was ânot sustainable in the long termâ, he said. Asked why coverings were not mandatory in other public spaces, the first minister said: âIf places are crowded then face coverings are advisory;  where places are not crowded it is a matter for the individual citizen to make that decision.â Coronavirus is now âat its lowest ebbâ since the pandemic began, Mr Drakeford added, saying the Welsh Governmentâs response had to be âproportionateâ. Face coverings are already required on public transport in Scotland, such as this bus in Edinburgh The first minister says almost 300,000 coronavirus tests have been carried out in Wales. Of those tests, 17,000 had been positive. ""The percentage of people testing positive continues to reduce"", Mark Drakeford said. Meanwhile he has urged people to carry on following the ""golden rules"". ""Always keep your distance from others. Wash your hands frequently. Only meet people from one other household â or extended household â outdoors and work from home wherever possible."" Mr Drakeford told the Welsh Government's daily briefing there had been a ""real change"" in working patterns with more people working from home. He added: ""We need to see flexible working become a permanent feature of working life in Wales, and the Welsh Government will lead the way in this."" Face coverings are not compulsory in shops and supermarkets in Wales although some businesses may ask people to wear them, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said the retail sector has made ""huge efforts"" to introduce social distancing measures, including one-way systems, limits on customer numbers, and screens at checkouts. As a result and while the ""prevalence of coronavirus is low"", the Welsh Government is not making masks mandatory in all public spaces. ""Our advice may change if cases of coronavirus begin to increase"", Mr Drakeford said. He said the Welsh Government had made changes to the ""2m physical distancing duty"" which recognise there are some occasions when it is not always possible to maintain 2m. Mr Drakeford said the changes set out the additional measures businesses needed to put in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus. ""These  include maintaining hygiene standards and limiting close face-to-face interaction, wherever reasonable."" Face masks are compulsory in shops in Scotland while Prime MinisterBoris Johnson says they should be worn by shoppers in England, with enforcement being considered. Everyone in Wales will have to wearface coverings when using public transport from 27 July, the first minister has announced. Mark Drakeford says masks will be compulsory on trains, buses and taxis. ""For the sake of simplicity and consistency, as well as being part of our plan to help reduce the risk of transmission while on public transport where it is not always possible to maintain a 2m physical distance, it will become mandatory for people to wear a three-layer face covering while travelling â this includes taxis,"" he said at the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus briefing. Face coverings are already required on public transport in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This is in line with updated World Health Organization (WHO) advice, which says non-medical face coveringsshould be worn in publicwhere social distancing is not possible. However it will not be compulsory to wear face coverings in shops. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Beauty salons, spas, tattoo parlours and nail bars are welcoming back their first clients for almost four months, as lockdown restrictions ease further in England. But some treatments, such as eyebrow threading, are still banned, leaving many salons unable to reopen. In Scotland,indoor shopping centres are allowed to reopen. In Wales, pubs, bars and restaurantscan start serving customers outdoors, while hairdresserscan also reopen. Businesses will be required to follow guidelines to reduce the spread of coronavirus - and treatments which involve work directly in front of the face will not be available. Government guidance,externalsays services including face waxing, eyebrow threading, eyelash treatments, make-up applications and facials should not be provided because of the greater risk of Covid-19 transmission. Government to decide on face masks in shops How can I have my nails done safely? Naresh Bhana, who runs Flamin' Eight tattoo studio in north London, said the business was only taking advance bookings, so ""you can't walk off the street unannounced"". ""We can accommodate two or three being tattooed but we stagger their start times,"" he said. ""Work areas are four metres apart. Everyone's wearing masks. Clients will wear visors as well."" He has created a commemorative tattoo for his wife to mark the reopening. The tattoo design to mark the end of lockdown for tattoo parlours was created for Naresh's wife, Sonia Beard trims have been allowed since barbers opened last weekend - but should be limited to simple tidy-ups or thinning which can be carried out from the side or by circling the client to avoid the highest risk zone in front of the face,the British Beauty Council has said,external. The co-founder of the home beauty service, Blow Ltd, Fiona McIntosh, said the ban on beauty treatments involving the face was ""hugely frustrating"". ""We still don't know when we're going to be able to do those services, which is having a huge impact on the freelancers who work for us,"" she said. ""We have 250 women, freelance beauticians on our platform across London, Manchester and Birmingham who can't work and they have been given no date on when they can work."" She added: ""I found it very difficult to understand how a lash treatment when you actually could have a mask on to have that done is different to a beard treatment."" Blow Ltd uses 1,000 self-employed beauticians and about a quarter of them can still not work, says Fiona McIntosh Angela Burnett, the co-founder of Moreton Place Beauty and Wellbeing in London, added: ""It's half of our business, not being able do facials and facial treatment. For example we can't do any eyebrow waxing, any tinting, any lip waxing. So we're just doing manicures, pedicures and massages."" Vanita Parti, founder and chief executive of the Blink Brow Bar walk-in beauty bar chain, which has 11 shops in London and specialises in eyebrow treatments, said her salons would not be able to reopen under the guidelines. ""I'm furious,""she told the BBC last week. ""This will kill so many businesses. I wish they'd consulted us."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? Massage studios, tanning salons, physical therapy businesses and piercing services are also now allowed to reopen in England. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""Enabling these often small, independent businesses to reopen is yet another step in our plan to kickstart the economy to support jobs and incomes across the country."" Some nail bars have installed plastic screens to reduce the spread of coronavirus At a salon in Birkenhead, a nail technician wears a PPE face shield and mask People - including a woman in Chirton, North Shields - are also returning to sunbeds for the first time in three months In Scotland, hospitals are reopening to visitors and children and young people are now allowed to play contact sports outdoors. From Wednesday, Scottish hairdressers and barbers will be able to reopen and indoor pubs, cafes and restaurants can return to business. In Wales, hospitality businesses can open for outdoor service.  Only half of venues are predicted to do so, with major chains, including Wetherspoons and Brains, waiting until customers are allowed indoors from 3 August. The National Trust is also reopening some of its historic houses, with visitors allowed at seven properties in England and Northern Ireland in a test run of new rules intended to keep the public and staff as safe as possible. ""We're really grateful to our members and supporters for sticking with us during lockdown,"" said Tarnya Cooper from the National Trust, who spoke to BBC's Breakfast from Petworth House. ""This is the first time in  16 weeks we've been able to contemplate reopening our houses."" She said about one million visitors had already pre-booked trips to National Trust's parks and gardenssince they opened in early June. Meanwhile, the government's approach to face coverings in England continues to be discussed, following calls for clarity over the weekend. Boris Johnsonhas said people in England""should be wearing"" masks or other coverings inside shops to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. He said the government would decide in the next few days if ""tools of enforcement"" were needed. Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said he would ""perhaps"" support making the wearing of masks in public compulsory but his colleague Michael Govesaid on Sunday he thought the matter should be left to people's ""common sense"". Mr Buckland told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Wearing them in an enclosed space where you've got lots of people, for example a busy shop, seems to be sensible. ""It is all about increasing confidence. I think the more of us who do the courteous and responsible thing, the more people you'll see venture out into shops."" He added: ""If it becomes necessary to nudge people further by taking further action then of course we will consider that. I think the matter is under careful and daily review."" Face masks are mandatory in shops in Scotland but not in England, although some shoppers do wear them A further 650 coronavirus cases were reported across the UK on Sunday,according to the Department of Health,external. That is an increase on the 516 cases reported on the same day a week earlier - but hugely down on the peak in April when there were about 5,000 new cases a day. The total number of people who have died with Covid-19 in the UK is now 44,819, a rise of 21 on the previous day - although figures tend to be lower at weekends because of reporting delays.

"Bonnybridge-based E&O Laboratories is behind the solution A Scottish biotech firm has landed a deal worth up to Â£7m with NHS Scotland after creating a chemical solution to aid the Covid-19 testing process. The ""breakthrough"" approach is said to help make testing turnaround more efficient and improve safety. The VPSS solution (Viral PCR Sample Solution) was developed by Bonnybridge-based E&O Laboratories. VPSS is placed in each tube, which is said to make test samples that contain Covid-19 safe within the tube itself. This means that by the time it is transported to the lab, it is immediately ready for testing. This streamlines the testing process and means lab technicians do not need to reopen the tubes to apply any pre-testing solution in the lab environment. The result is an approved solution for production with up to 3.5 million of the new 'VPSS added' test tubes. An initial quantity of 85,000 units will be distributed across Scotland from this week. Trade minister Ivan McKee said: ""Since the start of this pandemic the Scottish government has supported many Scottish businesses to innovate and alter their production processes, allowing us to be less reliant on global supply chains. ""E&O's work in this area secures a Scottish supplier of a crucial testing chemical that not only streamlines the testing process and supports our national test and protect programme, it will also further improve the safety of lab workers carrying out these essential tests."" Virginia Lucey, Managing Director of E&O said: ""Our research and development team worked tirelessly with NHS virology experts to design formulations that will aid reliable testing of Covid-19.""

"The workers, who carry out picking and packing work, are being asked to remain on the farm during a period of isolation Up to 200 workers have been told to self-isolate on the farm where they pick crops after 73 of them tested positive for Covid-19. Vegetable producers A S Green and Co, in Herefordshire, has gone into lockdown after the positive tests. Food and other essential supplies are being delivered to the farm, where the workers have been segregated into the mobile homes they live in. The firm is also being supported by Public Health England (PHE). Herefordshire Council, which has organised the supply of deliveries, believes the outbreak is ""contained"" on the farm. The workers carry out picking and packing work during the harvesting season on the farm, just west of Malvern, in Worcestershire. The company said the welfare of its staff was its ""priority"" and further testing of management and visitors to the farm had so far produced negative test results. As a precaution, the workers are being treated as ""one extended bubble"" and are staying within household groups, the council said. Herefordshire Council said the workers are isolating in mobile homes on the site In a statement on its website, A S Green and Co said: ""Public Health England advises that it is very unlikely Covid-19 can be transmitted through food or food packaging, so shoppers can remain confident buying British fruit and veg."" The farm is currently closed to visitors. From 29 June to 5 July, Herefordshire had an average rate of two new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people, figures from Public Health England show. This compares with Leicester, which had 116 cases per 100,000. Joan Cummins, BBC Midlands Today A S Green nestles in sight of the Malvern Hills in Herefordshire. The farm grows beans and broccoli and is a long established family run business in the area. It employs about 200 seasonal pickers and packers from Eastern Europe to help with the crop. A few workers could be seen in the distance wearing face coverings and walking to the entrance of the farm to collect shopping delivered by the local authority. I understand although a few of the workers had symptoms, most were asymptomatic and the positive results of 73 people came as a surprise to them. The Director of Public Health for Herefordshire said both the farm's owners and staff were co-operating with the health authorities. Katie Spence, PHE Midlands health protection director, said a range of infection control measures had been introduced, including on-site testing, social distancing in communal areas and the indoor packaging area. Workers are also being encouraged to wash their hands regularly and use face coverings in closed areas. ""Despite these measures, a small number of workers became symptomatic earlier this week and they and a few close contacts among the workforce were tested initially and found to be positive,"" she said. PHE said it is still awaiting a few final results of tests on the workforce. Hereford Council leader David Hitchiner said the virus is ""contained"" on the farm Karen Wright, director of public health for Herefordshire, said: ""Prompt testing on the farm has allowed us to understand transmission and control the spread of infection. ""We continue to support the farm management, their workers, who form an important part of our local economy, and the local community through this challenging time."" The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said the industry takes this issue ""incredibly seriously"". ""Everything is being done to keep workers safe; their health and safety remains the priority,"" a spokesman said. ""Across the sector there have been significant investments this season; from the use of additional safety equipment and PPE, regularly testing temperatures, and following government guidance created specifically for seasonal workers."" Following the Pick for Britain campaign - an initiative to bring together UK workers and farmers to prevent crops rotting during the pandemic - the farm said it had received more than 300 applications. The farm's website says workers are expected to share accommodation at Rook Row Farm, while there is a recreational building with a pool table, dartboard and TV for all employees. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Why are there outbreaks in meat processing plants? Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry There has been a recent spike in cases atmeat processing plantsacross the UK and Europe. Lawrence Young, Professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick, said factories and, in particular, indoor areas which are cold and damp are ""perfect environments for coronavirus to linger and spread"". The government hasissued guidelines,externalon working safely in food manufacturing. Overall, the Herefordshire council area has recorded 749 cases during lockdown, as of 7 July. Speaking to BBC Midlands Today, council leader David Hitchiner said: ""I would say we've got it contained, these people are not people who travel around the community, they tend to stay where they are. ""I don't physically know the site but I would hope it is quite isolated and so it shouldn't spread out among the community. ""The owners are keeping the workers there on the site and doing their very best to make sure it can't spread any further off this farm."" He added that expected PHE are now trying to trace the original source of the outbreak. EASY STEPS:What can I do?

The leaders of Houston, Texas, are calling for another statewide lockdown after infections there climbed to more than 27,600 on Sunday. ""Not only do we need a stay home order now, but we need to stick with it this time until the hospitalisation curve comes down, not just flattens,"" tweeted Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - who oversees the most populous county in Texas - on Sunday. ""Many communities that persevered in that way are reopening for the long haul. Letâs learn from that (and) not make the same mistake twice."" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said over the weekend that he disagrees with the governorâs effort to reopen schools. âIt makes no sense to be having this conversation while this virus is out of control,"" Turner said on Saturday. ""You don't send kids back to school when there's a raging fire and the fires still burning in August. âPut the doggone fire out in July, so shut down for a couple of weeks."" Texas recorded 8,100 new cases on Sunday and 80 Covid-related deaths. Residents and carers at a north London care homehave been recreating classic album coversto keep themselves occupied during the lockdown. Albums by Adele, Taylor Swift and Queen are among those to have been redone at Sydmar Lodge Care Home, in Edgware. Robert Speker, who came up with the idea, said the residents had ""absolutely loved"" the creations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It seems after all that the ministers won't just be asking everyone to use their ""common sense"" or even just rely on manners to make people cover up. After weeks of discussion about the relative benefits of covering your face when out and about, ministers are now likely to confirm that it will be mandatory to cover your face in shops in England as soon as Tuesday and, like in Scotland seven days ago, expect that change to be brought in in law. It is quite the shift. At the start of the crisis, the government's scientists suggested that masks could do more harm than good. There were nerves too about creating sudden demand from the public to get hold of medical grade coverings when there was a worldwide spike in demand as the pandemic took hold. But more evidencehas emergedabout how coronavirus can be transmitted through the air. Read more from Laura here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinaâs media have been keen to
highlight where countries with large numbers of Covid-19 cases have been lax
about wearing masks, or have not taken mask-wearing seriously. In particular, papers have focused
on the US and India. Itâs big news today in China that US President Donald
Trump wore a face mask for the first time in public over the weekend. . Many on the popular
Weibo social media platform are asking whether the president has become
âscaredâ, either for his own health, or for his chances at re-election later in
the year. There is also a lot of online reaction to a report in Global Times about diamond-encrusted masks and
solid-gold masks are being manufactured in India. Many in China are
asking why masks are being treated like a fashion accessory, and not something
that could potentially save your life. China was an early advocate of
face-mask wearing, and in late January, papers noted that the outbreak in the
central city of Wuhan had led to a âsurge in demand,externalâ from consumers all across
the country.TV presenters were even wearing them at this point. Masks have traditionally been worn
anyway in the country whenever anybody has even a mild cold. This was a lesson
learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak in the country. China has reported 83,602
confirmed cases of Covid-19 since late December and 4,634 deaths. Llamas could provide the key to immune therapyin a potential coronavirus breakthrough. Scientists from the UK's Rosalind Franklin Institute have used specially evolved antibodies from a llama to make an immune-boosting therapy. The Covid-specific ""antibody cocktail"" could enter clinical trials within months. The development has beenpublished in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology,external.  A US soldier guards a testing site in New York in April Rates of Covid-19 infection among the ranks of the US military are growing at twice the rate of the general public, according to analysis by theMilitary Times,external. The newspaper reports that 4,100 US soldiers and sailors have tested positive since 1 July, representing a rise of about 33% in the last 10 days. Over the same time period, the US Covid-19 growth rate reached 16%. The outbreak has not only affected US troops at home, but also has hit deployed forces stationed around the world. As we reported earlier today, at least 95 US troops have been affected at a US military base in Okinawa, Japan. Hong Kong Disneyland reopened in June, only to be closed again a month later Walt Disney has announced it will temporarily close its Hong Kong theme park on 15 July after the territory saw a spike in coronavirus cases. Disneyland Hong Kong had reopened less than a month ago after it was shut in January during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Hong Kong has so far managed to keep infections down relative to other countries, recording around 1,500 cases since late January. But on Monday, 52 cases were reported in Hong Kong, prompting  authorities to tighten social-distancing rules. âAs required by the government and health authorities in line with prevention efforts taking place across Hong Kong, Hong Kong Disneyland park will temporarily close from July 15,â Disney said in a statement on Monday. Hotels at the resort will remain open with enhanced safety measures in place. The closure comes just days after Disney reopened its biggest resort, Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, where coronavirus cases rose by a daily record of 15,000 on Sunday. Nearly 3,000 daycare centres and childrenâs nurseries are reopening on Monday in New York City, months after they were closed due to the pandemic. Masks will not be required for children under two-years-old, but are compulsory for adults. No more than 15 children can be present in one room, sharing of toys is to be limited and staff must undergo health screenings. ""It's been really, really tough for parents,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last week as the decision was announced. ""So bringing back childcare is crucial."" The move comes one day after New York announced that no Covid-19 deaths had been recorded in a 24-hour period for the first time since the start of the outbreak. On Monday, Gov Cuomo announced that schools that are in Phase 4 counties - where the daily infection rate remains below 5% - will be permitted to open in August. But he warned that schools can be shut again if the region's infection rate rises above 9% over a seven-day average. Raymundo Capetillo starred in many soap operas throughout his decades-long career Mexican actor Raymundo Capetillo has died with Covid-19 at the age of 76, local media has reported. The actorâs death wasconfirmed by the AsociaciÃ³n Nacional de IntÃ©rpretes,externalon social media on Monday. Capetillo was reportedly admitted to hospital in Mexico City on 5 July after experiencing respiratory problems. Actress Laura Zapata was among those to pay tribute to Capetillo. âI'm going to miss you, my friend,âshe wrote on Twitter,external. An economist by profession and a professor of English, Capetillo began his acting career in the late 1960s. He worked in TV, film and theatre, but was best known for his performances in soap operas, appearing in dozens of shows between the 1960s and the 2010s. Wild Rose, Brave Love and Hearts to the Limit were among the shows he appeared in. US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci is being targeted by the Trump administration as tensions rise between the health expert and the president. The White House has been increasingly critical of Dr Fauci, and on Sunday, an official shared a list detailing past apparent erroneous comments. Dr Fauci's changing advice on masks and remarks on Covid-19's severity are among the points from the White House. The move to undercut him comes as the US continues to see surges in Covid-19. There are over 3.3 million cases confirmed and more than 135,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. Read more here. BBC OS This video can not be played Musician Michaela Anne had her tour cancelled because of the pandemic The coronavirus outbreak has led
to the cancellation of tours, gigs and festivals around the world. Analysts say
that the music industry could lose billions as a result of the pandemic. Singer-songwriter Michaela Anne
was due to go on tour before the outbreak began. Speaking toBBC OS on World Service radiofrom New York, she says she has been doing live streams and teaching online lessons to
make money. âItâs been financially helpful
for me, while also being emotionally helpful. Itâs kind of kept me connected to feel like I have some purpose."" She is worried about the prospects of others in the industry - such as booking agents, tour managers, merchandise
sellers and crew members, adding that she is not sure how they will come through the crisis. The number of people reported to have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK has risen by 11, the Department of Health and Social Care says. It's believed to be the smallest daily increase in the number of deaths since lockdown was announced. However, the figure is usually lower on Mondays because fewer deaths are reported at weekends. It means 11 deaths were reported to DHSC in the 24-hour period - but some could have died several days ago. The individual nations of the UK report deaths slightly differently to the DHSC - which explains why their figures don't add up to the UK total. As of 17:00 BST on 12 July, 44,830 people have now died in all settings after testing positive for Covid-19, the DHSC said. Separate figures from the UK's statistical agencies show there have now been more than 55,000 deaths in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.  Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent The island of Majorca is popular with German and British tourists in particular Germanyâs health minister has expressed concern after pictures emerged this weekend of hundreds of German tourists flouting social-distancing rules on the Spanish island of Majorca. Jens Spahn told reporters on Monday that the coronavirus pandemic was not over, warning German tourists against complacency. Pictures showing crowds of German tourists partying - many without masks - in the bars and streets of Majorca have angered the Spanish authorities and dismayed the German government. The island is a popular destination for German and British tourists. Following the lifting of travel restrictions a few weeks ago, many Germans have seized the opportunity for a post-lockdown holiday. Mr Spahn said the island must not become a second Ischgl â referring to the Austrian ski resort which emerged as a coronavirus hotspot and the source of some of Germanyâs very first infections. Thousands of German holidaymakers were allowed to travel to Spain's Balearic Islands last month as part of a pilot scheme to help reboot the country's tourism sector. A British pub landlord hasput an electric fence in front of his barto encourage customers to keep social distancing. Jonny McFadden, who runs the Star Inn in St Just, Cornwall, said there was limited space in his small pub and he had struggled to get the social distancing message across to some customers. He described the barrier as ""just a normal electric fence that you would find in a field"". Asked if it was switched on, Mr McFadden said: ""Come and find out - there is a fear factor and it works."" He said the fence was a good deterrent because customers ""don't want to touch it to find out whether it is on or not"", adding that ""people keep away from it, people are like sheep"". Mark Sleet, who lives in England and works in Scotland, says shops were busier south of the border More restrictions have lifted in Scotland today, with non-essential shops within shopping malls allowed to open. But at one such centre, Waverley Mall in Edinburgh, a number of shops remained closed on Monday. Mark Sleet, 62, a project manager working on the construction of another shopping centre in Edinburgh city centre, described his experience as a ""culture shock"". He said: ""I've been travelling to Edinburgh from Morpeth in England every day for work and it's like going back in time. ""It's really getting back to normal in England and the shopping malls are busy. ""Waverley Mall was empty today and I had to wear a mask, which felt confusing for me."" Alex Weedman, 29, from Edinburgh, said: ""I'm a shopaholic and wanted to see Flying Tiger, which is a shop that is only in Waverley Mall. I'm wearing a mask in case others feel worried but I'm not afraid."" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been highly critical of the response of some governments to Covid-19 The coronavirus pandemic is going to get âworse and worseâ if certain governments do not take decisive action to curb the spread of the disease, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said we are seeing âdangerous increases in casesâ in countries where âproven measures to reduce risk are not implemented or followedâ. âLet me blunt, too many countries are headed in the wrong direction,â Dr Tedros said at a briefing in Geneva on Monday. âThe virus remains public enemy number one, but the actions of many governments and people do not reflect this.â Dr Tedros said âmixed messages from leadersâ were undermining public trust in attempts to bring the pandemic under control. While Dr Tedors did not mention those leaders by name, some may interpret his pointed remarks as a warning to US President Donald Trump and others who have been widely criticised for their handling of the pandemic. âIf the basics arenât followed, there is only one way this pandemic is going to go,â Dr Tedros added. âItâs going to get worse and worse and worse.â This video can not be played Dr Anthony Fauci explains failure of testing in the US Anthony Fauci is best known as the face of America's fight against coronavirus. In his five decades as a medical researcher, he has become used to criticism. He has seen his effigy burnt, heard the cries of protesters calling him a ""murderer"", and had smoke bombs thrown outside his office window. Now the 79-year-old, who has served under six presidents, has become the target of an attempt by the White House to discredit him over the pandemic. An official told the US press that Dr Fauci - a key member of government's Coronavirus task force - had âbeen wrong on thingsâ. Read our profile here Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played ""He had so much passion for football"" Alina Joseph remembers sitting with her son Christopher Kapessa in their living room watching the 2018 Fifa World Cup on the telly. It was a scorcher of a day but Christopher was glued to the screen watching Cristiano Ronaldo playing for Portugal. He knew his mum wasn't really a football fan but he couldn't resist telling her which team was the best, what the rules were and who his favourite player was. When she went upstairs to have a lie-down, it wasn't long before she was woken up by the huge racket coming from downstairs. ""Mum, mum, they won, they won!"" Christopher shouted. ""He had so much passion for football,"" Alina tells me. ""His younger brother misses him so much, especially when it comes to football, because Christopher was teaching him how to play."" Christopher played for Mountain Ash Juniors FC Christopher was 13 when his body was found in the River Cynon in Rhondda Cynon Taff, south Wales, on 1 July last year. He'd been out with a group of other young people on a really hot day when it happened. He was the only black child there. Within 24 hours, South Wales Police had told his mum there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death - it was a tragic accident. But the family and their lawyerraised concerns about how the investigation was handledand it was taken on by the force's major crime unit. Then in February this year, Alina got a letter from the Crown Prosecution Service. It said there was ""clear evidence"" that Christopher - who couldn't swim - had been pushed into the river. It said there was ""sufficient evidence to support a charge of unlawful act of manslaughter"" but they weren't going to prosecute the 14-year-old suspect because it wasn't in the ""public interest"". Christopher's familyhave accused the police and the CPS of institutional racism. ""If this had been 14 black youths and a white victim we have no doubt that the approach of the police and outcome would have been different,"" Alina said at the time. Alina Joseph has questioned why the suspect hasn't been prosecuted over her son's death I'm chatting to Alina on the phone a day before the first anniversary of her son's death. Three days earlier, I'd been at a remembrance event where friends and family gathered to share their memories of Christopher. His 14-year-old friend Cobi spoke through tears as he described how much Christopher meant to him. ""Christopher wasn't just a friend, he was more or less family. He was always cheeky - in a good way,"" he told the crowd. I've reported on many stories about people who've died - and there are some that just really hit you without warning. I was there writing notes of what Cobi was saying when I just had to stop because I welled up. This young lad was so upset but from somewhere he found the strength to speak up for his friend. ""To see the same joy that he gave me as his mum, he was able to give to somebody else's heart - that was deep,"" Alina tells me. Cobi paid tribute to Christopher wearing a football shirt with his friend's surname on it At times, you can hear the pride in Alina's voice when she talks about her son - it feels just like a very normal conversation. She tells me how he loved watching YouTube videos about history and how he had this certain way of saying ""Mummy"" which meant he wanted a fiver from her. Then there were the constant arguments with his six brothers and sisters over sharing the PlayStation - because he wanted to play Minecraft and Fortnite. Oh, and then there were all the times he broke his glasses. ""He slept with his glasses, we'd have to go in and take them off,"" Alina tells me. ""Everybody knew we needed to help him with his glasses because we were sure that the opticians had had enough. ""I remember one time he was in the shower and he was having a shower in the glasses. I said 'Christopher!' and he said 'Mum I can't really see properly'. ""Christopher was just funny in his own way."" Flowers were left near to the place where Christopher died a year on from his death It was a sunny morning when Alina woke up on the day Christopher died. ""I don't like beautiful mornings anymore because it's like you know something bad is just gonna end up happening,"" she tells me. The memory of that day must be so strong in her mind - she talks me through it in such detail. Christopher had come in from school and a few minutes later he told his mum he was going out to play football. Alina agreed he could go - but never got to say ""see you later"" or ""goodbye"". ""I hate that word now, or goodnight. What's good about it?"" she says. Later on, Alina was on the phone to her sister in Africa when there was a knock on the door. ""We were chatting away, we were laughing - he was there dying,"" she says through tears. It was Christopher's sports coach. ""We can't find Christopher, apparently he's jumped off a bridge,"" he told her. Police focused on a bridge over the River Cynon a part of their investigation Time is a bit blur for her after that. Alina started to go down to the river where he was last seen, but the roads were blocked off and she was told to wait at home as the police were on their way. But the officers couldn't tell her anything so she tried to keep busy by washing the dishes.  Eventually some news came in. ""We need to go to the hospital. We've found him,"" an officer told Alina. As we continue talking about it over the phone, the emotion of it all just overwhelms her. Hearing a mum wail down the phone for her son is absolutely heartbreaking - and we take a little break from the interview. But then she agrees to carry on - she's ready to tell me what happened next. ""I was blocking it, saying that he's fine, everything's fine. I'm actually gonna tell him off,"" she recalls. ""I was sweating like mad and every sound of that siren just made the situation even worse."" Alina releases a dove in memory of her son at his remembrance event Alina was taken into a grey room - the atmosphere was so bad. No-one could give her any information about Christopher. Frustrated and angry, she left and set off down the hospital corridor. ""I just started walking. I started crying. I just started walking, not knowing I was even actually walking in the right direction. ""Everybody was just lined up. The more I approached, they had their heads down. He was asleep. The only difference was he didn't have his glasses. And I knew. ""I tried calling his name. Normally he'd be like 'Yes Mama, I'm OK, Stop fussing, Mama. Mama, I didn't do it, it wasn't me.' ""Nothing like that was coming out."" Alina then goes on to tell me how the family had so many questions that weren't getting answered. Where exactly did he jump off the bridge? Why wasn't he wearing the same clothes in the morgue as he had been when he had left the house? How many people were actually there when Christopher fell into the river? Christopher's friends and family brought balloons with messages to his remembrance event It took seven months for Alina to find out exactly what evidence there was about how her son had died. ""There was clear evidence that the suspect pushed Christopher in the back with both hands causing him to fall into the river,"" the letter from the CPS said. ""That push was an unlawful act and it was clearly dangerous in that on an objective standard it created a danger of some harm."" It said that the evidence suggested the push was ""not in an effort to harm someone"" but ""ill considered"" and the suspect was ""mature and intelligent for his age"" and had a ""good school record"". It said the suspect ""will have learnt the very harshest of lessons from this experience, which will act as a deterrent from further offending"". It also explained the decision not to prosecute had considered the best interest of the suspect and the adverse impact on his future prospects. ""Christopher had so much going for him, so for that to be taken away and then to be told that somebody else's future is of more value than of his, that's very painful,"" Alina told the BBC at the time. Christopher's family came together for his remembrance event on 27 June During our chat, Alina told me her family had experienced racism since moving from London to south Wales in 2011. They'd had ""hate letters"" sent to the house, her children have been ""peed on"" and once Christopher had been left in a ""pool of blood"" after being attacked in a shop. I've seen the comments some people have posted on Facebook about this case and they're honestly tough to read. ""Pulling the race card is disgusting, total disrespect for the emergency services, sadly the boy has lost his life. People have donated thousands of pounds for his funeral, a little bit of gratitude is in order,"" one woman wrote. ""It's more of a worry that mum gave the boy permission to go swimming and he couldn't swim. It wasn't as if it was a swimming pool where lifeguards could have been at hand,"" another wrote. ""Sad to hear this, but pulling out the race card cheapens and demeans the issue and loses respect,"" said one man. And these are not from anonymous trolls. They're from people from around the community where Christopher lived. Some of the Facebook comments I've seen about this case have been tough to read The lack of compassion and nastiness that comes across in the comments must be so difficult for Alina to get her head around. She's a mum who has lost her 13-year-old child. Imagine if it was your son, your brother, your nephew? Would you just accept what had happened? Christopher's mum has been supported by anti-racism charity The Monitoring Group ever since the tragedy happened. ""This isn't playing the race card,"" its director Suresh Grover tells me. ""This is the lived experience of a large number of black people which tells you that when there are a large number of black people or children in the majority, and there are accusations of crimes, inevitably, they're mostly charged. ""And when black people are in the minority and suffer racial violence with a group of white people, we have cases which show that white people are never charged. 'I think for those people who say it's the 'race card' I just would say stop denying the reality that is so prevalent for black people in this country."" Suresh says there are still so many questions the family want answering. ""I think racism is a factor that can't be taken out and has to be examined by the police. ""For us, what's important is what exactly was said to Christopher before he was pushed in? What are the circumstances that led to his death? Was he afraid before he was pushed in? Was he being goaded before he was pushed in? ""What's very clear is that had Christopher been the only white person, I think the investigation wouldn't have come to the conclusion so quickly that it was an accident."" Suresh Grover is leading the Justice For Christopher Kapessa campaign Christopher's family have asked for the CPS's decision not to prosecute the suspect to be reviewed. They're currently waiting for the outcome. A crowdfunding page has raised nearly Â£20,000 to help with the family's legal fees and an online petition demanding ""Justice For Christopher Kapessa"" has more than 50,000 signatures. ""For Alina, justice looks like having confidence in the police to investigate properly and for the CPS to put the evidence in front of the jury, and for her boy's life to be treated on equal terms with any other person, not as somebody who has less worth or less value or less rights,"" Suresh says. I contacted the CPS but they told me it couldn't comment because its decision not to prosecute the suspect is still under review. They wouldn't tell me when the family might hear the outcome. South Wales Police said it's also waiting for the decision to be made. It added: ""South Wales Police has also referred the investigation to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) who will examine our response and subsequent investigation into the tragic circumstances surrounding Christopher's death. ""We will be absolutely committed to implementing any opportunities for learning by South Wales Police."" The IOPC said its investigation has made ""good progress"" but is partially suspended while the CPS's decision is under review. For now, Alina just has to wait. I think back to Christopher's remembrance event and there's one thing that his friend Coby says that really sticks out in my mind. It's something I think is important to remember, whatever happens next. ""Christopher Kapessa was an amazing person and he didn't deserve this.""
