"A Paisley man who is recovering from coronavirus has called on young people not to underestimate the impact the virus can have. Calum Wishart said when news of the pandemic first broke his ""naive arrogance"" led him to believe he would be OK because he is only 25 years old. But within days of the lockdown Mr Wishart started displaying symptoms of the virus and was taken to hospital. He described it as ""the most horrendous experience"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: ""I had the completely wrong attitude. ""I would not say I was hugging strangers or anything like that, I think I just underestimated the real impact of it. ""I had the perspective that because I was young it would not affect me, that it would be like a kind of flu."" Mr Wishart was taken to hospital after suffering breathing difficulties and other symptoms of coronavirus Mr Wishart said he had a ""massive dose of reality"" when the gravity of his situation became clear after being rushed to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and put on oxygen. He continued: ""It started off as a slight fever and from there it escalated. ""The next few days was just on and off oxygen and not being able to do anything."" The loss of his freedom of movement was the biggest impact and now, out of hospital and into self-isolation, he is using his time to try and make younger people aware that coronavirus can strike anyone.

"The home secretary has said she is sorry if NHS staff feel there has been a failure to provide protective kit for those treating coronavirus patients. But Priti Patel said there were going to be problems during what she called an ""unprecedented global pandemic"". The British Medical Association earlier said that NHS staff were putting their lives at risk when treating patients. The health secretary said earlier that 19 NHS workers had died with coronavirus since the outbreak began. Speaking at Saturday's coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, the home secretary said: ""I'm sorry if people feel that there have been failings. I will be very, very clear about that. ""But at the same time, we are in an unprecedented global health pandemic right now. It is inevitable that the demand and the pressures on PPE and demand for PPE are going to be exponential."" This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""The central challenge is one of distribution"" On Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was enough kit for everyone and unveiled a plan to address shortages. He said the government was looking into how NHS staff who had died with the virus had been infected - adding that some may have caught it outside of work. ""But that doesn't take away from the bravery of every single NHS worker,"" he said, adding that his ""heart goes out"" to those who have died and their families. Mr Hancock said he was ""particularly struck at the high proportion of people from minority ethnic backgrounds and people who have come to this country to work in the NHS who have died of coranavirus"". ""We should recognise their enormous contribution,"" he added. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) in London and Yorkshire are at ""dangerously low levels"", according to the BMA. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said doctors were being forced into a corner and faced ""heart-breaking decisions"" over whether to carry on without proper protection. He said: ""This is an immensely difficult position to be in, but is ultimately down to the government's chronic failure to supply us with the proper equipment."" Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags Has the NHS got enough PPE? A nurse at Watford General Hospital in Hertfordshire, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC he felt unsafe with the level of PPE he had been given. He said shortages meant those working on wards with coronavirus patients were only being given a surgical mask and plastic apron, rather than a gown covering the whole body. Last week a nursing assistant who had been looking after coronavirus patients at the hospital died. ""We are scared because we are spreading the virus,"" he said. ""We don't deserve it and our patients even more."" The health secretary said 742 million pieces of protective gear had been delivered so far, saying: ""There's enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance. We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is."" Mr Hancock said he was not ""impugning anyone who works for the NHS"" and ""they do an amazing job"". ""But what I am reiterating, stressing, is the importance to use the right amount of PPE,"" he added. However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE"" and the government ""must act"" to ensure sufficient supplies are delivered. For several weeks, the government and NHS leaders have insisted there are enough stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE) and that the problem lay in the distribution from warehouses to the front line. Some hospitals have reported receiving higher consignments of gloves, masks, gowns and aprons. But doctors and nurses have continued to report shortages. Care homes, pharmacies, GP practices and community health teams feel they are at the back of the queue for equipment to protect staff who may come into contact with patients who have Covid-19. There has also been confusion over how safety guidelines should apply. Now Matt Hancock has admitted there are global supply problems and says it is a ""herculean effort"" to get deliveries to health workers and a ""huge task"" to keep it going. He set out a series of measures to step up provision of equipment. He may be given credit for acknowledging the scale of the problem. But NHS and care staff won't take much notice of plans until they are reflected in reality on the ground. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has dismissed any suggestion that healthcare staff have been overusing PPE. RCN chief executive Dame Donna Kinnair told the BBC no PPE was ""more precious a resource than a healthcare worker's life, a nurse's life, a doctor's life"". ""I take offence, actually, that we are saying that healthcare workers are abusing or overusing PPE,"" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that nurses were still telling her they did not have adequate supply of protective equipment. Meanwhile, the business organisation Make It British said the government had not yet taken up offers from some firms to help manufacture PPE. The group said at least 100 companies had responded to an appeal for help four weeks ago but had heard nothing since. How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

"Streets across India have been deserted because of the lockdown India will extend a strict nationwide lockdown imposed last month to stop the spread of the coronavirus, a top official says. On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video conference with state ministers, and many of them urged the government to prolong the measure. Delhi's chief minister said Mr Modi had agreed to extend the lockdown, due to end on Tuesday, without giving details. It comes amid concerns about how the lockdown has hit the country's poorest. The spread of the virus has been varied in India with some states seeing bigger jumps in cases, despite the shutdown. Millions of migrant workers have been left jobless with the poorest suffering most. India has confirmed about 8,000 infections and 288 deaths, according to a tally by US-based Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the disease globally. The true figures, however, are thought to be far higher. The children struggling to survive India's lockdown Inside India's busiest Covid-19 hospital The race to stop the virus spread in Asia's 'biggest slum' On Twitter, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal saidMr Modi had ""taken [a] correct decision to extend [the] lockdown"",external, without saying for how long the extension would be. ""If it is stopped now, all gains would be lost. To consolidate, it is [important] to extend it."" Later on Saturday,an online post from the prime minister's office said the ""extensive deliberations"" with chief ministers had been fruitful,externaland there ""seems to be a consensus"" to extend the lockdown measures two weeks. Mr Modi also described the next three to four weeks as ""critical"" to seeing the impact of measures taken so far. There has been no official confirmation to extend the national lockdown, but some state-wide extensions have now been announced. On 24 March, India shut its $2.9 trillion (Â£2.3tn) economy, closing its businesses and issuing strict stay-at-home orders to more than a billion people. Air, road and rail transport systems were suspended. As testing has ramped up, the true picture is emerging. The virus is beginning to spread through dense communities and new clusters of infection are being reported every day. Lifting the lockdown could easily risk triggering a fresh wave of infections. A harsh lockdown is certain to slow down the disease. Virologists I spoke to believe India is still at an early stage of the infection. The country still doesn't have enough data on the transmissibility of the virus or even how many people could have been infected and recovered to develop adequate herd immunity. Not surprisingly, the lockdown is already hurting the economy. Many of the early hotspots are economic growth engines and contribute heavily in revenues to the exchequer. Mumbai, India's financial capital and Maharashtra's main city, accounts for more than a third of overall tax collection. Read more from Soutik Earlier, hundreds of angry migrant workers stuck in the western city of Surat in Gujarat defied the restrictions to demand they be allowed to return home after reportedly hearing the shutdown was to be extended. The migrants blocked roads, vandalised properties and set fire to tyres and vehicles while some threw stones. Large numbers of police have been sent to the area, and about 80 migrants have been detained. This video can not be played As cases of coronavirus rise and the virus hits India's congested slums, will the country cope? Mr Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown on 25 March, announced with little warning, leaving millions stranded and without food. The country's 1.3 billion people are banned from leaving their homes, all non-essential businesses have been closed and almost all public gatherings are banned. There are fears that a major coronavirus outbreak in the country - one of the world's most densely populated - could result in a humanitarian catastrophe.

"Tens of thousands of people across the UK have now died with coronavirus, including more than 100 NHS staff and other healthcare workers. The BBC has been tracking their deaths during the pandemic. Among them are a pregnant nurse who died before she could meet her daughter; a father-of-seven whose family say he was let down over a lack of personal protective equipment; and a grandmother who colleagues say was one the unsung heroes of the NHS. Many of them came to the UK from other countries to work for the NHS. Most were working on the frontline and caring for patients, while some were retired but continued to work. Here are 100 of their stories. Renowned surgeon Dr El Tayar worked in the NHS for 11 years before moving back to his native Sudan to help establish a transplant programme. He returned to the UK in 2015, working as a locum surgeon before his death. He gave the ""precious gift of life to so many people around the world"", fellow surgeon Abbas Ghazanfar wrote in a tribute. Dr Zaidi was a managing partner of a GP practice with his wife Dr Talat Zaidi. Their four children all work in the medical profession. His daughter, Dr Sarah Zaidi, said his death was ""reflective of his sacrifice"" and he had a ""vocational attitude to service"". A care co-ordinator in Hillingdon, north-west London, Ms Perugia was a ""lovely woman, who never said no to any requests"", colleagues said. Her mother, sister, brother and fiance all work for the same NHS trust she represented. Ms Sharma, who worked as a pharmacist at Eastbourne District General Hospital, was the ""superstar of the family"", her brother said. ""Her irresistible laugh, sense of humour and good nature would light up our world and fill it with colours. For this I am eternally grateful that Pooja was my sister. ""For me, Pooja would always be the little protector or shield for when I had done something mischievous."" An ear, nose and throat consultant at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, Mr El-Hawrani's family said he was ""a loving and much-loved husband, son, father, brother, and friend"". ""His greatest passions were his family and his profession, and he dedicated his life to both,"" they said. Mr El-Hawrani died at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester on 28 March. Father-of-seven Thomas Harvey, 57, was a healthcare assistant at Goodmayes Hospital in Ilford, east London. His family criticised the NHS for the lack of personal protective equipment provided to staff, saying he ""just had gloves and a flimsy apron"". He died at home on 29 March, after feeling unwell for several days. ""Living legend"" Dr Alfa Saadu, who had returned to work after retirement, died in hospital on 31 March. His family said he had been working part-time at the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn, Hertfordshire, before contracting the virus. His son said the family told him to go to hospital, but his father insisted he ""did not want to take up a hospital bed because others would need it"". The mother-of-two had worked as an administrator for Basildon and Brentwood Clinical Commissioning Group in an NHS career of more than 10 years. ""She was fantastic,"" her husband said. ""She was very loving, caring. ""I'm having stories coming through where she would just randomly meet people at the bus stop, friends that she'd made, just got talking to people, they've laid flowers on the doorstep.""

The nurse worked at St Charles Hospital, in West London, and died after falling ill on Mother's Day. Her husband, Mario, said their three children have been left devastated by the loss. He told Sky News: ""Our youngest child is 14 years old and it is so hard. The pain is unbearable."" Known to his colleagues as ""Bob"", Mr Bamotra ""touched so many people's hearts with his personality"", his family said in a statement.

"Some key medicines used in intensive care are ""in relatively short supply"", the BBC has learned. Supply of anaesthetic medicines in some areas is ""a bit stretched"", according to the Royal College of Anaesthetists. One consultant has told the BBC that supplies are ""running low"" and alternatives are already being used in intensive care in the Midlands. The government says it is ""aware there is an increase in demand for a number of intensive care drugs"". On 2 April, four leading royal colleges and health organisations asked staff to ""act immediately"" and use alternatives to some ""first line"" medications in new guidance on changes to specific anaesthetic drugs facing ""pandemic pressures"". What is an intensive care unit? What are ventilators and how do they work? Dr Ron Daniels, an intensive care consultant in the West Midlands, says his hospital is ""running low"" on propofol, a commonly used anaesthetic, and alfentanil, an opioid painkiller which is used in intensive care. Dr Ron Daniels believes there has been too much focus on ventilators ""We are also in short supply of noradrenaline, used to treat life-threateningly low blood pressure, and are now using these drugs only on people who really need them and using older drugs on people who need less intensive support."" Dr Daniels says the quality of care for all intensive care patients, not just coronavirus sufferers, will ""likely be lower"" as a result as the crisis peaks, and believes there has been too much focus on ventilators. ""With the need of ventilation comes the need for medications to help circulation and blood pressure,"" he said. ""Without this medication, doctors have no choice but to try to find substitutes,"" said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chair of the British Medical Association. ""This may affect how long patients remain on ventilators, which are in short supply, as well as ultimately impacting their chances of recovery,"" he added. ""This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency."" EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Dr Julia Patterson, founder of medical campaign group EveryDoctor, says she is aware of GPs and palliative care consultants who are also concerned about shortages of diamorphine, in addition to clinicians in ICUs. She says one ICU consultant in London, who is worried about stocks of muscle relaxants and anaesthetic drugs, has told her that the NHS is working to increase stocks but the situation is ""extremely concerning"". The BBC has also been told the chief pharmaceutical officer of NHS England, Keith Ridge, has privately expressed concerns about the availability of some drugs. ""We are seeing some drugs being in relatively short supply"", said Prof Mike Grocott, vice-president of the Royal College of Anaesthetists. He says in centres he has spoken to, ""some of the drugs supply is getting a bit stretched, and therefore we may choose to use different types of drugs"", but he reassured patients that they would be safe. ""Relative shortages of different drugs - using alternative drugs in their place - is a very normal part of clinical practice,"" he said. ""We have a variety of different options that we can choose from a menu, if you like, under different circumstances."" The British Generic Manufacturers Association - which represents UK-based manufacturers and suppliers of generic medicines - says supplies are being moved to areas experiencing shortages. Its director general, Warwick Smith, said it was seeing four or five times the amount of demand for medicines. He said one manufacturer recently requested the equivalent of three years' worth of supplies to ramp up production. In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We are aware there is an increase in demand for a number of intensive care drugs and we are working with the pharmaceutical industry to make additional supplies available. ""We are working closely with industry, the NHS and the relevant national expert groups to ensure precautions are in place to reduce the likelihood of shortages."" Last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""currently confident"" about the supply of drugs. NHS England has been approached for a response.

"Refrigerated tractor trailers serve as temporary morgues in New York City The US has become the first country in the world to record more than 2,000 coronavirus deaths in a single day. Figures from Johns Hopkins University show 2,108 people died in the past 24 hours while there are now more than half a million confirmed infections. The US could soon surpass Italy as the country with the most coronavirus deaths worldwide. But experts on the White House Covid-19 task force say the outbreak is starting to level off across the US. Dr Deborah Birx said there were good signs the outbreak was stabilising, but cautioned: ""As encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak."" President Donald Trump also said he expects the US to see a lower death toll than the initial predictions of 100,000 fatalities, adding: ""We're seeing clear signs that our aggressive strategy is saving countless lives"".

About half of the deaths were recorded in the New York area. Italy has reported 18,849 deaths while globally more than 102,000 people have died with the virus. Researchers had predicted the US death toll would hit its peak on Friday and then gradually start to decline, falling to around 970 people a day by 1 May - the day members of the Trump administration have floated as a possible date to start reopening the economy. ""I want to get it open as soon as possible,"" Mr Trump said at a Good Friday briefing at the White House. ""I would say without question it's the biggest decision I've ever had to make."" However, no action would be taken until the government knew the ""country [was] going to be healthy"", he said. ""We don't want to go back and start doing it over again."" By Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York The coronavirus has changed everything about life, and now it's upending the rituals of death. New Yorkers have been shocked by the grim scenes: ambulances constantly blaring down eerily deserted streets, body bags being forklifted into refrigerated trucks outside hospitals and now new trenches being dug on Hart's Island for possible mass burials. The remote cemetery, accessible only by boat, is a place regarded historically with sorrow because of its mass graves with no tombstones, just unclaimed bodies. The city's morgues can only handle so much before temporary burials for Covid-19 victims, once an absolute worst-case scenario, become necessary. Funeral directors talk openly about how scared and depressed the spiking death toll has left them. Even before this week's record number of deaths, some families have had to wait a week or more to bury and cremate their loved ones. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Dr Anthony Fauci, US infectious diseases chief, concurred that the country was ""starting to see the levelling off and coming down"" of cases and deaths. But despite the ""important advance"", he added, mitigation efforts such as social distancing should not be pulled back yet. A new projection by theInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington forecast 60,000 deaths by 4 August,externalassuming that those restrictions remain in place. Last month, Dr Fauci estimated at least 100,000 deaths. Also at the briefing, Dr Birx noted that the rate of increase appeared to be stabilising in hard-hit regions like New York, New Jersey and the city of Chicago. She added that the US mortality rate was ""significantly less than many of the other countries, when you correct them for our population"". But she emphasised the nation had yet to see the peak of the outbreak. ""We need to continue to do what we did yesterday, and the week before, and the week before that because that's what, in the end, is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side."" This video can not be played Drone footage shows mass burials in New York. On Friday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the latest data showed the state was successfully ""flattening the curve"", but also cautioned that it was too early to relax social distancing measures. ""Even though it's a grind, even though it's difficult, we have to stay with it.""

""As a matter of fact, I have been carrying an inhaler in my pocket for 40 years out of fear of having a fatal asthma attack,"" continued Dr Adams, who is African-American. But he caused controversy by urging minorities to stop drinking, smoking and taking drugs to reduce their risk. He was particularly criticised for his use of colloquial language, when he told them to respect social distancing guidelines. ""Do it for your abuela. Do it for your granddaddy. Do it for your Big Mama. Do it for your Pop Pop,"" Dr Adams said. He later advised all Americans to avoid alcohol, tobacco and drugs. This video can not be played US surgeon general shows his inhaler while discussing the impact of coronavirus on people of colour In Friday's briefing, Mr Trump also said he had seen the drone images of coffins being stacked in a mass grave on New York's Hart Island. Officials there say the island, which has been used to bury people with no next of kin for over 150 years, is now burying bodies at five times the normal rate. Earlier in the day, Dr Fauci told CNN that officials are currently discussing whether to adopt immunity certificates for Americans who have safely survived the coronavirus and have antibodies in their blood to prove it. The certificates might ""have some merit under certain circumstances"", he said, adding that antibody tests would be available next week.

The grim milestone comes shortly afterthe US became the first nation to record more than 2,000 virus deaths in a single day. The governor of New York Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday the state's death toll appeared to be stabilising. Announcing a 24-hour figure of 783 new deaths, he noted the last several days had seen around the same number. ""That is not an all-time high, and you can see that the number is somewhat stabilising but it is stabilising at a horrific rate,"" Mr Cuomo said. ""These are just incredible numbers depicting incredible loss and pain.""

"Personal protective equipment (PPE), like masks and gloves, helps stop the spread of coronavirus and saves lives. With a new, more contagious variant of Covid circulating in the UK, doctors and nurses are calling formore kit that provides the highest protection. Anyone in close contact with patients should wear some form of protection. That includes staff in care homes, prisons and the community, as well as in GP surgeries or hospitals. People giving vaccines will also use PPE. The type of PPE required depends on the level of risk. Millions of high-grade NHS masks withdrawn over safety concerns Guidelines say all hospital staff,externalshould wear a face mask, while people visiting hospital or attending outpatient departments should wear a face covering. Face coverings, unlike surgical face masks,are not classed as PPE,externalas they are not usually made to a recognised standard and do not provide a proven level of protection for work. In hospitals, anyone working within 2m (6ft) of a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection. Clinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection. This includes disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors. That would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing. Ambulance staff driving the ambulance (if the cab is closed off from the patient compartment) do not need to wear any PPE. The rest of the crew should wear PPE appropriate to their likely risk of exposure. Pharmacy staff who cannot keep 2m away from possible patients should wear a surgical mask. Some staff in other higher-risk occupations likecleaners,,externalmortuary workers,externalandmembers of the prison service,externalmay need to use PPE and should follow guidelines. The NHS needs billions of items each month. There are about 1.6 million NHS staff in UK hospitals and the community, who need varying amounts of PPE. Ordering is done on a UK-wide level, but different parts of the NHS have different levels of stock. The government says 32 billion items, including masks, visors and gowns, have been bought. Almost three quarters of expected demand for PPE will be met by UK manufacturers, it says. Before coronavirus, in 2019, the NHS and social care sector in England received around 2.4 billion items of PPE. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 8.4 billion items have been delivered to the health and social care system inEngland. That includes body bags, swabs, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent as well as masks, gowns and gloves. Abreakdown of PPE,externaldelivered in the week to 6 November 2020 included: 35.5 million masks 40 million aprons 1.1 million gowns 156 million gloves (supplied and counted individually rather than as pairs) Since March,more than 908 million items of PPE have been delivered,externalin the NHS inScotland. In the week to 30 December, this included: 1.9 million masks 2.3 million aprons 35,000 gowns 5.7 million gloves Since March, nearly630 million items of PPE,externalhave been delivered to the health and social care sectors inWales. In the week to 20 December, this included: 77,000 masks 2.6 million aprons 101,000 gowns 10 million gloves InNorthern Ireland,more than376.5 million items of PPE,externalwere sent between March and the end of January 2021. In the week to 27 November, this included: 1.3 million masks 1.2 million aprons 53,500 gowns 4.6 million gloves Some bits of kit can only be used once per patient. Others can be used for whole sessions, such as during a ward round visit to many patients. All PPE worn during the highest-risk situations - where there will be lots of splatter from infectious droplets - should be single use, unless they can be decontaminated. Aprons, gloves and surgical masks should usually be disposed of after a single use or session. When there are shortages,guidelines say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so,external, even if it is labelled as single use by the manufacturer. The Health and Safety Executive says it recognises ""some compromise"" is needed when there are extreme shortages of kit. For example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused. TheRoyal College of Nursing,externaland theBritish Medical Association,externalsay PPE guidance should take a more precautions to stop airborne spreading. Both say members can refuse to treat patients as a ""last resort"" if there is not adequate PPE. UK anaesthetic and intensive care bodies says doctors should carefully evaluate the risks before deciding whether to provide care.

"Each day, news of more deaths is distressing to people across the country - as well as a tragedy for the families involved. Projections of how bad the outbreak could get have prompted ministers to put the country into lockdown. But what are we learning about the impact of the virus and the deaths it is causing? The death figures being reported daily are hospital cases where a person dies with the coronavirus infection in their body - because it is a notifiable disease cases have to be reported. But what the figures do not tell us is to what extent the virus is causing the death. It could be the major cause, a contributory factor or simply present when they are dying of something else. For example, an 18-year-old in Coventry tested positive for coronavirus the day before he died and was reported as its youngest victim at the time. But the hospital subsequently released a statement saying his death had been due to a separate ""significant"" health condition and not connected to the virus. There are, however, other cases, including health workers, where people have died with no known health conditions. The Office for National Statisticshas tried to shed light on this,external. It looked at nearly 4,000 deaths in England and Wales during March. There were two main findings. Firstly, the virus was the cause of the majority of deaths, not other factors. But secondly, nine in 10 did have pre-existing illnesses, such as heart disease and respiratory problems that put them at heightened risk of death anyway. It is clear that the number of people who are dying is increasing. The ONS has started to track this as well on a weekly basis - and unlike the daily government figures, which largely focus on hospital deaths, it is taking into account deaths in the community. Themost recent data,externalgoes up to the start of April. It shows in the week ending 3 April there were 16,000 deaths - 6,000 more than could be expected at this time of the year when the number of deaths normally starts to fall with winter over. This is the highest death number since these figures were first published in 2005, more than the previous peak seen during the bad flu outbreak of 2015. Not all these extra deaths were down to coronavirus, but a significant number were. What we do not know is what will happen to these numbers in the future and whether in a few months time deaths will drop below expected levels. If that happened, it would suggest coronavirus has brought forward deaths that you would expect to happen over the course of the next year. Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. And the frail and elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus. Nearly 10% of people aged over 80 will die in the next year, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter at the University of Cambridge points out, and the risk of them dying if infected with coronavirus is almost exactly the same. That does not mean there will be no extra deaths - but, Sir David says, there will be ""a substantial overlap"". ""Many people who die of Covid [the disease caused by coronavirus] would have died anyway within a short period,"" he says. Knowing exactly how many is impossible to tell at this stage. Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead modeller at Imperial College London, has suggested it could be up to two-thirds. But while deaths without the virus would be spread over the course of a year, those with the virus could come more quickly - that, of course, was the logic for the lockdown to stop the health service being overwhelmed. When it comes to flu, experts track what are called excess deaths. During recent winters, there have been about 17,000 excess deaths a year, Public Health England says. This, of course, can be done in the future only - it is why the ONS says it is too early to understand the true impact coronavirus is having on deaths. Work also needs to be done to calculate the indirect impact of coronavirus and the lockdown. The 6,000 extra weekly deaths identified by the ONS contained 2,500 which were not reported to be because of coronavirus infections. Experts have suggested they could be related to people being deterred from seeking treatment for medical emergencies such as strokes or heart attacks. This is why the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty was stressing on Thursday the ""NHS was open for business"". Prof Robert Dingwall from Nottingham Trent University says there will certainly be ""collateral damage"" from other factors such as: mental health problems and suicides linked to self-isolation heart problems from lack of activity the impact on health from increased unemployment and reduced living standards Others have also pointed to the health cost from steps such as delaying routine operations and cancer screening. Meanwhile, University of Bristol researchers say the benefit of a long-term lockdown in reducing premature deaths could be outweighed by the lost life expectancy from a prolonged economic dip. And the tipping point, they say, is a 6.4% decline in the size of the economy - on a par with what happened following the 2008 financial crash. It would see a loss of three months of life on average across the population because of factors such declining living standards and poorer health care. The problem the government and its advisers face is that they cannot make decisions with the benefit of hindsight - they have to react to emerging evidence. Currently, the lockdown is aimed at suppressing the spread of the virus. Once the peak has passed decisions will have to be made about what to do next. The virus will not simply have gone away, and with a vaccine at least a year away the challenge will be how to manage it. A balance will need to be struck between keeping it at bay and trying to control its spread to avoid a second peak, while at the same time allowing the country to return to normal. Seeing the full picture in terms of lives saved and lives lost will be essential in getting those calls right. LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do?

"The home secretary has said she is sorry if NHS staff feel there has been a failure to provide protective kit for those treating coronavirus patients. But Priti Patel said there were going to be problems during what she called an ""unprecedented global pandemic"". The British Medical Association earlier said that NHS staff were putting their lives at risk when treating patients. The health secretary said earlier that 19 NHS workers had died with coronavirus since the outbreak began. Speaking at Saturday's coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, the home secretary said: ""I'm sorry if people feel that there have been failings. I will be very, very clear about that. ""But at the same time, we are in an unprecedented global health pandemic right now. It is inevitable that the demand and the pressures on PPE and demand for PPE are going to be exponential."" This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""The central challenge is one of distribution"" On Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was enough kit for everyone and unveiled a plan to address shortages. He said the government was looking into how NHS staff who had died with the virus had been infected - adding that some may have caught it outside of work. ""But that doesn't take away from the bravery of every single NHS worker,"" he said, adding that his ""heart goes out"" to those who have died and their families. Mr Hancock said he was ""particularly struck at the high proportion of people from minority ethnic backgrounds and people who have come to this country to work in the NHS who have died of coranavirus"". ""We should recognise their enormous contribution,"" he added. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) in London and Yorkshire are at ""dangerously low levels"", according to the BMA. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said doctors were being forced into a corner and faced ""heart-breaking decisions"" over whether to carry on without proper protection. He said: ""This is an immensely difficult position to be in, but is ultimately down to the government's chronic failure to supply us with the proper equipment."" Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags Has the NHS got enough PPE? A nurse at Watford General Hospital in Hertfordshire, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC he felt unsafe with the level of PPE he had been given. He said shortages meant those working on wards with coronavirus patients were only being given a surgical mask and plastic apron, rather than a gown covering the whole body. Last week a nursing assistant who had been looking after coronavirus patients at the hospital died. ""We are scared because we are spreading the virus,"" he said. ""We don't deserve it and our patients even more."" The health secretary said 742 million pieces of protective gear had been delivered so far, saying: ""There's enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance. We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is."" Mr Hancock said he was not ""impugning anyone who works for the NHS"" and ""they do an amazing job"". ""But what I am reiterating, stressing, is the importance to use the right amount of PPE,"" he added. However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE"" and the government ""must act"" to ensure sufficient supplies are delivered. For several weeks, the government and NHS leaders have insisted there are enough stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE) and that the problem lay in the distribution from warehouses to the front line. Some hospitals have reported receiving higher consignments of gloves, masks, gowns and aprons. But doctors and nurses have continued to report shortages. Care homes, pharmacies, GP practices and community health teams feel they are at the back of the queue for equipment to protect staff who may come into contact with patients who have Covid-19. There has also been confusion over how safety guidelines should apply. Now Matt Hancock has admitted there are global supply problems and says it is a ""herculean effort"" to get deliveries to health workers and a ""huge task"" to keep it going. He set out a series of measures to step up provision of equipment. He may be given credit for acknowledging the scale of the problem. But NHS and care staff won't take much notice of plans until they are reflected in reality on the ground. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has dismissed any suggestion that healthcare staff have been overusing PPE. RCN chief executive Dame Donna Kinnair told the BBC no PPE was ""more precious a resource than a healthcare worker's life, a nurse's life, a doctor's life"". ""I take offence, actually, that we are saying that healthcare workers are abusing or overusing PPE,"" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that nurses were still telling her they did not have adequate supply of protective equipment. Meanwhile, the business organisation Make It British said the government had not yet taken up offers from some firms to help manufacture PPE. The group said at least 100 companies had responded to an appeal for help four weeks ago but had heard nothing since. How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

"About half of Scotland's privately-run care homes have suspected coronavirus cases, according to industry leaders. Trade body Scottish Care said the impact of the virus on residents alongside staff absence levels of up to 30% had put homes under huge strain. There have been concerns over thenumber of deathsandadequate protective equipmentat care homes. Fears have also been raised over a ""postcode lottery"" when it comes to testing care workers and residents. Scottish Care's members provide the vast majority of Scotland's 36,000 care home beds, with chief executive Dr Donald Macaskill saying the virus had left the sector facing an ""unprecedented challenge on every front"". The outbreak has killed several residents at care homes in Dumbarton, North Lanarkshire and Tranent in recent weeks. And information gathered by Scottish Care from its members suggests that about half of care homes in Scotland have at least one suspected case of coronavirus. Dr Macaskill said concerns about deaths in homes were understandable, but had to be seen in context and treated with caution. He said: ""80% of people in care homes are there for later stage of life care. It is a place where there are, sadly, frequents deaths and we have seen that older people generally are more vulnerable to the virus."" Twelve residents with coronavirus symptoms at Burlington Court Care Home in Glasgow died in one week There is an official count of the number of suspected cases of coronavirus in care homes, but it could be up to three months before it is published. The Care Inspectorate has asked all care homes to notify them when they have a suspected coronavirus case or when a resident dies from the virus, and to keep them updated on staff shortages. However, the taxpayer-funded watchdog is refusing to publish this Scotland-wide data at the height of the crisis. Instead, BBC Scotland has been told its request for the data is being treated as a freedom of information request, which under the emergency coronavirus laws means the Care Inspectorate has three months to respond. The watchdog says it is because of concerns over the ""robustness of the data"" coming from care homes. Despite these concerns, the same data is being given to councils, health boards and the Scottish government to help them ""deliver support across partnership areas and nationally"". Robert Kilgour, owner of Renaissance Care, which has 14 care homes across Scotland and around 1,100 staff, said he has suspected coronavirus cases in about half of his facilities. The firm has had three confirmed cases, two of which were where people died, but ""without access to proper testing"" he is unsure of the full extent of the virus among staff and residents. He said: ""Testing feels like a big issue right now but our experience is there is a postcode lottery where testing in some areas of the country is good and in others it is non-existent. ""Times are tough, the NHS is so vitally important but we have to remember a collapse in social care sector would also spell disaster for the health service."" Dr Macaskill said carers were doing a ""magnificent job under very trying circumstances"" Mr Kilgour said his business was operating with an absence rate of about 15%, but those who were able to come to work were excelling. He explained: ""The response from staff has been nothing short of amazing, a proper Dunkirk spirit. ""For many of them the residents and their colleagues are like a second family and they are pushing on for them. ""I've had reports of a number of staff moving into the care homes to protect their own families and allow them to keep working."" The Scottish government has issuednew guidance on the personal protective equipment to be worn by care workersand health boards have been asked to prioritise testing to enable health and social care staff to get back to work. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has said protecting staff working on the frontline is ""an absolute priority"" for the Scottish government. Experts have warned that the virus has left many care home residents struggling to cope with the collapse of their social networks. Family visits and activities at the majority of homes have been suspended, with many residents also being isolated in their rooms as a precaution against the virus. Prof Adam Gordon, of the British Geriatrics Society, who specialises in how healthcare is delivered in care homes, said: ""We have to remember a care home is a community so a resident might have social relationships with other residents, the staff and of course family visiting. ""Overnight this routine has gone or severely disrupted. ""So for people who have any sort of memory problem it is a really tough time right now, especially if they might not have much understanding of the wider world. ""We know loneliness and social isolation can result in worse outcomes for older people and it is a real concern given how long the lockdown is likely to last."" The suspension of family visits and other activities has left many care home residents struggling Scottish government figures show about 60% of adults in care homes have some form of dementia and Dr Macaskill, of Scottish Care, said the lockdown measures were having a ""profound impact"" on both residents and stretched staff members trying to keep their spirits up. He said: ""People just need to just think about how their own lives have been impacted and then consider the disruption to routine it is having for someone in a care home, perhaps with dementia."" One bright spot has been a Scottish Care drive to increase the use of tablet or mobile phone devices to connect residents with friends or families. ""We've had some wonderful donations of equipment. It is not for everyone, but there have been many heart-warming examples of staff using technology to try and bridge this gap,"" Dr Macaskill explained. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"We have gone weeks without seeing friends and family, without school, holidays or even being able to go to work. On 10 May, Boris Johnson is expected to address lockdown measures, although people should ""not expect big changes."" So what can be lifted and when? This virus remains massively contagious. Before lockdown, one infected person passed it onto at least three others on average (the so called R-number). And less than 5% of the UK population is estimated to have been infected. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable. If we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable. The goal of lockdown has been to cut infections by around 70% to force the R-number below one (the point at which the outbreak starts to decline). That has been achieved. However, it is only just below one. ""There isn't much wiggle room,"" a source within the government's science advisers told me, adding the country ""can't make a huge number of changes"". One set of modelling suggests opening schools - and nothing else - would be enough to almost tip us back into rising cases. The aim is to create more ""wiggle room"" - you identify cases and then perform rapid contact tracing and put those at risk in quarantine. This strategy, also called ""seek and destroy"", will be supported by a voluntary smartphone app which will help identify contacts. The more successfully this is done, the more it will reduce the ability of the virus to spread and the more restrictions can be lifted on day-to-day life. ""At the moment you need, on average, a 60-70% reduction in social interactions to stop the outbreak increasing,"" said Dr Kucharski. ""If we can get that down to 30% that gives you a lot more to play with."" But even this is not life as normal and other measures would still be needed to keep the disease in check. ""It is a more moderate version of where we are now,"" said Dr Kucharski. When will the outbreak end and life get back to normal? How does contact tracing work and is my data safe? Another strategy proposed by some is ""enhanced shielding"". Instead of trying to suppress the coronavirus across every section of society, you could instead aim to stop it completely forthe most vulnerable. Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Very crudely, for 80% of us who are not vulnerable this is a nasty virus, but it wouldn't overwhelm the healthcare system and it wouldn't lock down society. ""If we really bolster that shielding, make a very strong shield indeed, then it buys you a lot more room and it may mean you can relax some measures permanently."" That would mean all staff hospitals, care homes or anyone visiting those deemed vulnerable being regularly tested to ensure they are clear of the virus. Ideally, antibody tests would prove they are immune to it. The danger is, having more virus circulating in the community could put those ""shields"" under intense pressure. Millions of people in the UK will soon be asked to track their movements to limit the spread of coronavirus. Some restrictions are less risky in terms of spreading the virus. ""Essentially we've got a lot of not very good options - it won't be one day and everything will change, but things could open up,"" Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. Dr Kucharski argues lifting different restrictions can be put into three broad categories: Those with low, moderate and substantial risk of increasing transmission of the virus. Low risk includes exercising outdoors, which has been restricted in some countries. Wales has already announced that from 11 May, people will be able able to exercise more than once a day. Moderate risk would include letting some non-essential shops re-open or having occasional gatherings with people outside the household. Substantial increases could come from lifting advice to work from home, reopening schools or isolating sick people and quarantining households. ""I think the order things went in will be reflected in the order things will be lifted,"" he says. There remains a nervousness within the scientific advice to government about lifting restrictions in areas, like pubs, whose whole purpose is to bring people together. And there is an emerging question around primary schools as young children, some studies suggest, cannot be infected as easily. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? R-NUMBER:Is this the crucial number? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? There is a decision about how far we go with suppressing the virus now we've passed the peak. We could drive levels down as low as possible. That will greatly limit the ability of the virus to bounce back in a second wave and make testing and contact tracing more likely to be effective. The trade-off is maintaining the lockdown for longer. Or we could exit lockdown now and accept having a higher number of cases, which creates its own problems. The biggest thing that could come along is a vaccine, as immunising people would mean there was no need for any social distancing measures. That is thought to be more than a year away. Failing that, the concept of herd immunity may kick in when around 70% of the population have been infected and the virus can no longer cause large outbreaks. Effective drugs would also make a huge difference if they could stop Covid-19 progressing from a cough or fever into a serious disease needing intensive care. We might get closer to normality, or at least normality for some, in the months to come. But we are all still in this for the long haul. Download theBBC News Appfor all the latest headlines.

"Tens of thousands of people across the UK have now died with coronavirus, including more than 100 NHS staff and other healthcare workers. The BBC has been tracking their deaths during the pandemic. Among them are a pregnant nurse who died before she could meet her daughter; a father-of-seven whose family say he was let down over a lack of personal protective equipment; and a grandmother who colleagues say was one the unsung heroes of the NHS. Many of them came to the UK from other countries to work for the NHS. Most were working on the frontline and caring for patients, while some were retired but continued to work. Here are 100 of their stories. Renowned surgeon Dr El Tayar worked in the NHS for 11 years before moving back to his native Sudan to help establish a transplant programme. He returned to the UK in 2015, working as a locum surgeon before his death. He gave the ""precious gift of life to so many people around the world"", fellow surgeon Abbas Ghazanfar wrote in a tribute. Dr Zaidi was a managing partner of a GP practice with his wife Dr Talat Zaidi. Their four children all work in the medical profession. His daughter, Dr Sarah Zaidi, said his death was ""reflective of his sacrifice"" and he had a ""vocational attitude to service"". A care co-ordinator in Hillingdon, north-west London, Ms Perugia was a ""lovely woman, who never said no to any requests"", colleagues said. Her mother, sister, brother and fiance all work for the same NHS trust she represented. Ms Sharma, who worked as a pharmacist at Eastbourne District General Hospital, was the ""superstar of the family"", her brother said. ""Her irresistible laugh, sense of humour and good nature would light up our world and fill it with colours. For this I am eternally grateful that Pooja was my sister. ""For me, Pooja would always be the little protector or shield for when I had done something mischievous."" An ear, nose and throat consultant at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, Mr El-Hawrani's family said he was ""a loving and much-loved husband, son, father, brother, and friend"". ""His greatest passions were his family and his profession, and he dedicated his life to both,"" they said. Mr El-Hawrani died at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester on 28 March. Father-of-seven Thomas Harvey, 57, was a healthcare assistant at Goodmayes Hospital in Ilford, east London. His family criticised the NHS for the lack of personal protective equipment provided to staff, saying he ""just had gloves and a flimsy apron"". He died at home on 29 March, after feeling unwell for several days. ""Living legend"" Dr Alfa Saadu, who had returned to work after retirement, died in hospital on 31 March. His family said he had been working part-time at the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn, Hertfordshire, before contracting the virus. His son said the family told him to go to hospital, but his father insisted he ""did not want to take up a hospital bed because others would need it"". The mother-of-two had worked as an administrator for Basildon and Brentwood Clinical Commissioning Group in an NHS career of more than 10 years. ""She was fantastic,"" her husband said. ""She was very loving, caring. ""I'm having stories coming through where she would just randomly meet people at the bus stop, friends that she'd made, just got talking to people, they've laid flowers on the doorstep."" Ms O'Rourke was ""such a kind and caring nurse"" who had ""a really special relationship with her patients and colleagues"", her ward manager said. ""Nursing was something she had always wanted to do, although she came to it relatively late after raising her girls."" The 39-year-old died at the hospital where she worked - the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital, in Margate, Kent. Ms Nasreen worked as a hospital cleaner before gaining her nursing qualification in 2019. She died on 2 April at Walsall Manor Hospital, in the West Midlands - the hospital she had worked at for 16 years. ""We've lost an amazing nurse, but we've lost also an amazing person in life,"" her sister Kazeema Nasreen said. The grandmother ""followed her dream"" and trained as a midwife in later life, her family said in a statement. ""She was a very well-respected midwife who supported many hundreds of women as they welcomed their babies into the world,"" they added. Ms Coventry had worked at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, in Harlow, Essex, for 10 years. She died on 2 April. Prof Shousha was an honorary professor of histopathology at Imperial College, London. He had worked at UK cancer research laboratories at London's Hammersmith and Charing Cross hospitals since 1978. He died on 2 April. Mr Alagos was a nursing assistant who was looking after coronavirus patients. Tracey Carter, chief nurse at the hospital, said: ""John was very popular and will be missed greatly by his colleagues."" Ms Glanister was a ""long-serving"" nurse at the Aintree University Hospital, in Liverpool. ""We are so proud to see just how many people's lives Liz has touched,"" her family said in a statement. Ms Glanister died on 3 April at Royal Liverpool University Hospital. In a statement on its website, Vale Practice in Crouch End, north London, paid tribute to a ""beautiful, caring receptionist"". It said: ""It is with great sadness that we are announcing the death of our beautiful, caring receptionist, Amanda Forde. She sadly lost her battle with Covid-19 on Friday 3rd April 2020. May she rest in peace."" A published historian, Dr Sebastianpillai trained at a medical school in Sri Lanka and went on to specialise in treating elderly people at Kingston Hospital in south-west London. He was ""hugely respected as a consultant and author"", Ed Davey, acting Lib Dem leader, said. Dr Sebastianpillai, who was in his 70s, died on 4 April. A healthcare assistant, Mr Corbin worked at the Park Royal Centre for Mental Health, in north-west London, for more than 25 years. ""He was the 'go to' person who knew everything about the ward and how to get things done,"" said Claire Murdoch, head of the local NHS trust, adding he was the ""backbone"" of his team. Mr Corbin died on 4 April. The nurse had worked in the children's cancer unit at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary before taking up other roles in the health sector. ""She was a devoted friend, an incredible nurse and an unapologetically imperfect person,"" one of her friends said in a Facebook post. Ms Mack was not believed to have been directly dealing with patients before becoming ill. The grandmother, who worked at Royal Liverpool University Hospital, was an ""unsung hero"", her local NHS trust said. Her job was to make arrangements to allow patients to safely leave hospital, having spent most of her career as a care worker for people with disabilities. ""Barbara was a much-loved wife, mum, nan, sister, auntie, friend and beautiful person,"" her family said. Ms Graham was the first reported NHS worker in Scotland to die from coronavirus.

"Streets across India have been deserted because of the lockdown India will extend a strict nationwide lockdown imposed last month to stop the spread of the coronavirus, a top official says. On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video conference with state ministers, and many of them urged the government to prolong the measure. Delhi's chief minister said Mr Modi had agreed to extend the lockdown, due to end on Tuesday, without giving details. It comes amid concerns about how the lockdown has hit the country's poorest. The spread of the virus has been varied in India with some states seeing bigger jumps in cases, despite the shutdown. Millions of migrant workers have been left jobless with the poorest suffering most. India has confirmed about 8,000 infections and 288 deaths, according to a tally by US-based Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the disease globally. The true figures, however, are thought to be far higher. The children struggling to survive India's lockdown Inside India's busiest Covid-19 hospital The race to stop the virus spread in Asia's 'biggest slum' On Twitter, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal saidMr Modi had ""taken [a] correct decision to extend [the] lockdown"",external, without saying for how long the extension would be. ""If it is stopped now, all gains would be lost. To consolidate, it is [important] to extend it."" Later on Saturday,an online post from the prime minister's office said the ""extensive deliberations"" with chief ministers had been fruitful,externaland there ""seems to be a consensus"" to extend the lockdown measures two weeks. Mr Modi also described the next three to four weeks as ""critical"" to seeing the impact of measures taken so far. There has been no official confirmation to extend the national lockdown, but some state-wide extensions have now been announced. On 24 March, India shut its $2.9 trillion (Â£2.3tn) economy, closing its businesses and issuing strict stay-at-home orders to more than a billion people. Air, road and rail transport systems were suspended. As testing has ramped up, the true picture is emerging. The virus is beginning to spread through dense communities and new clusters of infection are being reported every day. Lifting the lockdown could easily risk triggering a fresh wave of infections. A harsh lockdown is certain to slow down the disease. Virologists I spoke to believe India is still at an early stage of the infection. The country still doesn't have enough data on the transmissibility of the virus or even how many people could have been infected and recovered to develop adequate herd immunity. Not surprisingly, the lockdown is already hurting the economy. Many of the early hotspots are economic growth engines and contribute heavily in revenues to the exchequer. Mumbai, India's financial capital and Maharashtra's main city, accounts for more than a third of overall tax collection. Read more from Soutik Earlier, hundreds of angry migrant workers stuck in the western city of Surat in Gujarat defied the restrictions to demand they be allowed to return home after reportedly hearing the shutdown was to be extended. The migrants blocked roads, vandalised properties and set fire to tyres and vehicles while some threw stones. Large numbers of police have been sent to the area, and about 80 migrants have been detained. This video can not be played As cases of coronavirus rise and the virus hits India's congested slums, will the country cope? Mr Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown on 25 March, announced with little warning, leaving millions stranded and without food. The country's 1.3 billion people are banned from leaving their homes, all non-essential businesses have been closed and almost all public gatherings are banned.

"Streets across India have been deserted because of the lockdown India will extend a strict nationwide lockdown imposed last month to stop the spread of the coronavirus, a top official says. On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video conference with state ministers, and many of them urged the government to prolong the measure. Delhi's chief minister said Mr Modi had agreed to extend the lockdown, due to end on Tuesday, without giving details. It comes amid concerns about how the lockdown has hit the country's poorest. The spread of the virus has been varied in India with some states seeing bigger jumps in cases, despite the shutdown. Millions of migrant workers have been left jobless with the poorest suffering most. India has confirmed about 8,000 infections and 288 deaths, according to a tally by US-based Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the disease globally. The true figures, however, are thought to be far higher. The children struggling to survive India's lockdown Inside India's busiest Covid-19 hospital The race to stop the virus spread in Asia's 'biggest slum' On Twitter, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal saidMr Modi had ""taken [a] correct decision to extend [the] lockdown"",external, without saying for how long the extension would be. ""If it is stopped now, all gains would be lost. To consolidate, it is [important] to extend it."" Later on Saturday,an online post from the prime minister's office said the ""extensive deliberations"" with chief ministers had been fruitful,externaland there ""seems to be a consensus"" to extend the lockdown measures two weeks. Mr Modi also described the next three to four weeks as ""critical"" to seeing the impact of measures taken so far. There has been no official confirmation to extend the national lockdown, but some state-wide extensions have now been announced. On 24 March, India shut its $2.9 trillion (Â£2.3tn) economy, closing its businesses and issuing strict stay-at-home orders to more than a billion people. Air, road and rail transport systems were suspended. As testing has ramped up, the true picture is emerging. The virus is beginning to spread through dense communities and new clusters of infection are being reported every day. Lifting the lockdown could easily risk triggering a fresh wave of infections. A harsh lockdown is certain to slow down the disease. Virologists I spoke to believe India is still at an early stage of the infection. The country still doesn't have enough data on the transmissibility of the virus or even how many people could have been infected and recovered to develop adequate herd immunity. Not surprisingly, the lockdown is already hurting the economy. Many of the early hotspots are economic growth engines and contribute heavily in revenues to the exchequer. Mumbai, India's financial capital and Maharashtra's main city, accounts for more than a third of overall tax collection. Read more from Soutik Earlier, hundreds of angry migrant workers stuck in the western city of Surat in Gujarat defied the restrictions to demand they be allowed to return home after reportedly hearing the shutdown was to be extended. The migrants blocked roads, vandalised properties and set fire to tyres and vehicles while some threw stones. Large numbers of police have been sent to the area, and about 80 migrants have been detained. This video can not be played As cases of coronavirus rise and the virus hits India's congested slums, will the country cope? Mr Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown on 25 March, announced with little warning, leaving millions stranded and without food. The country's 1.3 billion people are banned from leaving their homes, all non-essential businesses have been closed and almost all public gatherings are banned.

"GPs are seeing just seven in every 100 patients face-to-face because of the coronavirus outbreak, following a ""remarkable"" shift to online and telephone appointments across England. Fewer than 1% of appointments were done via video link last year, with 80% in person, BBC analysis shows. But the Royal College of GPs (RCGP) said that had been turned on its head because of social distancing. Its chair said most people were ""pretty happy"" with phone appointments. Age UK has, however, urged doctors not to drop home visits and to seek out vulnerable patients ""proactively"". Professor Martin Marshall, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said practices were adapting Professor Martin Marshall, chairman of RCGP and whose own GP surgery is in Newham, east London, said around 40% of patients would normally be triaged before booking an appointment. Now all patients are initially assessed on the phone before booking either a call or video link with a doctor. He said: ""The GP profession has changed dramatically in just three weeks. ""Now 100% are triaged and around 7% or 8% are face-to-face. ""Most of the consultations are taking place on the telephone rather than video link. ""People are pretty happy with doing assessments over the phone and they are proving effective. ""Who would have thought this 150-year-old technology would still be just as useful today?"" He said there were occasions where a video appointment was beneficial, particularly in the case of assessing skin rashes. But with people able to email in pictures of the affected area, he said phone calls have been used in around 90% of cases. Last year, two thirds of all regional NHS commissioning areas carried out no video call appointments, NHS data shows. ""The big question is which elements do we want to embed in our practices in the future?"" Prof Marshall said. ""I don't see us doing all of our consultations over the phone or online, but certainly up to 50% is possible."" There are still occasions where patients need to attend a practice in person, such as where blood pressures or oxygen saturation needs to be read, he said. Regional NHS areas are establishing ""hot and cold"" practices to mitigate the risk of infection. Hot practices assess people with clear Covid-19 symptoms only. In more rural areas, this can take the form of a single room in a surgery. In bigger areas it can be several surgeries. Though Prof Marshall said just as many precautions were being taken at cold sites. Age UK's Tom Gentry has urged practices to be proactive in calling vulnerable patients. Concerns have been raised that people who may not have access to smartphones or a computer will be excluded from seeing their GP during the crisis. Elderly needs charity Age UK has urged practices to be ""proactive"" in contacting people on their registers known to have underlying health conditions. Senior health influencing manager at the charity Tom Gentry said: ""Surgeries have a lot of information at their disposal. Using that, they need to make active care plans for people to enable them to feel supported. ""It's about not waiting for people to deteriorate and it's about reaching out to them first."" Mr Gentry said that surgeries should also not discount the use of home visits, providing adequate precautions are taken. ""No one should be told outright that they should not be visited in their own home,"" he said. Sue Sharp received a video call from her doctor last week without her booking an appointment. Many GP practices have already adopted the proactive approach. Taxi firm administration assistant Sue Sharpe from Calne, Wiltshire, received a video call from her GP last week as she has rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome and multiple myeloma. ""She noted that I have been unwell recently and asked whether or not I was expecting further intervention from my specialist consultant,"" said Mrs Sharp. ""When I said that I was due a trip to the hospital as a day patient she asked whether I had transport for the journey, or did I require any help getting there. Joanna and Clive Williams received a call from their GP last week. ""I think it's brilliant that GP's are contacting at-risk patients in this way."" Fishing tackle supplier Clive Williams, from Horsham in West Sussex, is caring for his wife Joanna, 63, at home as she has a brain tumour. He was worried about going to a  surgery because of the risk of infection - and because he did not want to add extra burden to his stretched local practice. ""I felt it would be a nuisance to get in touch with them,"" the 64-year-old said. ""But my GP is absolutely brilliant. He contacted me out of the blue to have a little chat about my wife as she struggles with her memory.""

"Coronavirus has now infected more than one million people worldwide, but its impact extends far beyond just those who have had it. Even the frequency of use of the word ""unprecedented"" is unprecedented at the moment. According to Google Trends it's been used three times more over the last two weeks than the highest point recorded previously. As governments around the world have enacted new measures and given official advice, we take a look at the impact that it's had on people and the world around them. The approaches to dealing with coronavirus across the world have been wide-rangingto say the least. In Colombia the days that you're allowed to leave the house depend on the number of your national ID card; in Serbia a designated dog-walking hour was introduced; and in Belarus the president has gone against medical advice, recommending vodka and saunas as a way to stay safe. Some of the more common approaches have seen governments issue recommendations on social distancing for part or all of the country, while others have acted to restrict all non-essential internal movement. The latter is often called a lockdown. When the virus was first identified in China in late 2019, lockdown seemed extreme. But as the outbreak has spread around the world, it has become more difficult to manage. More countries have opted to take the strictest measures possible to contain it. Well over 100 countries worldwide had instituted either a full or partial lockdown by the end of March 2020, affecting billions of people. And many others had recommended restricted movement for some or all of their citizens. In regions that have only recently confirmed their first cases of coronavirus, many countries appear to be learning from their Asian and European counterparts. Governments seem to be acting faster and more strictly in Africa as well. China has managed to ease its restrictions after passing through the worst period of climbing cases and deaths, but life is still far from normal. The rest of us may have a long way to go. When the virus first appeared, several countries brought in initial restrictions on flights from China, or required visitors from at-risk areas to be quarantined on arrival. After it had been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, on 11 March, there were more all-encompassing measures. President Trump blocked all non-essential arrivals to the US from the European Union on 15 March, and a day later the EU did the same to all visitors from outside the Schengen free-travel zone. By the end of March, air traffic from some of the world's biggest airports had dropped to a fraction of what it was at the same time last year, or even what it was at the start of this month. The number of commercial flights last month was down by more than a quarter globally,according to flight tracking service Flightradar24,external. In the final week of March, as more and more countries introduced travel restrictions to try to contain the virus, traffic declined 63% from the same period last year. On 25 March, Heathrow - one of the busiest airports in the world serving about 80 million passengers per year - recorded more than 1,000 fewer flights compared with an equivalent day in 2019. It's not just getting from city to city. Travel within major cities across the globe has ground to a halt as restrictions on movement and social contact have come into force. As of 31 March, residents in cities like Madrid, Paris, London and New York were making fewer than one-tenth as many journeys using the app as they did normally, according to data from travel app Citymapper. In Milan in northern Italy, which has been locked down for several weeks now, only 3% of trips were being planned via the Citymapper mobile app, compared with before the outbreak. The data also suggests that people cut down on travel in the days leading up to government-enforced shutdowns. For example, the partial lockdown in Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous city, came into place on 24 March but trips had already declined sharply the week before. Even in cities where authorities have issued recommendations on social distancing and refrained from imposing strict lockdowns, it appears that people are still restricting their travel. ln Stockholm, Sweden, where the government has avoided draconian measures, issuing guidelines rather than strict rules, the Citymapper data suggests planned trips - which can include both walking and public transport - fell by 70%. Stockholm's public transport company reported last week that passenger numbers on subway and commuter trains had halved. Movement is also below normal rates in some of the Asian cities that Citymapper collects data for, like Hong Kong and Singapore, which have not enforced the type of shutdowns seen elsewhere. The South Korean capital Seoul hasn't come to a standstill like European capitals, despite facing huge numbers of coronavirus cases - a sign of the country's decision to focus on widespread testing and contact tracing rather than social distancing. We see the same behaviour with people on the roads. Major cities around the world were already becoming steadily less busy before official lockdown measures came in, congestion data from location technology specialists TomTom shows. In Tokyo there hasn't been an official lockdown yet, but schools have been shut since the beginning of March. That, and a lack of tourists, could explain why traffic there has been marginally below last year's levels without the sharp downturn obvious elsewhere. In Jakarta, Indonesia, where there has also been no official lockdown, congestion has already dropped to almost zero - similar to Los Angeles and New Delhi which shut down on different dates. The congestion score in the graphic below is an indication of how much longer it would take to make a journey through the city compared with when there is no traffic at all. A rating of 50 means that a trip will take 50% more time than it would if the roads were completely free, for example, so a half-hour drive would become 45 minutes. The regular low points on the chart generally come at weekends. In China there are signs that things are beginning to get back to normal. Traffic levels are back to about half the 2019 level in Beijing and Shanghai but have been steadily growing since the beginning of February following extended Chinese New Year celebrations from 25 January. In Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, traffic levels are still next to zero compared with last year. One of the few positive effects of the shutdown is that there seems to have been a drop in pollution in some parts of the world. Levels of NO2 in the atmosphere fluctuate widely with factors like wind speed, and satellites trying to measure these levels can be hampered by cloud cover. This may explain some of the variability seen over Wuhan and northern Italy between January and March 2019 in the maps below. But in these places, shutdowns have been stricter and in place for longer than elsewhere, and the change in NO2 levels between 2019 and the months of 2020 in which the shutdowns have been in effect appears to be significant. In the UK, and in many other places, the available satellite data does not yet show either way whether the ongoing reduction in economic activity is being accompanied by a corresponding fall in emissions, althoughsome other sourcessuggest that it is. As countries have shut down, many workers have had to try to continue their office jobs from home. That means video calls and instant messaging have become invaluable workroom tools. The average number of messages sent by users in New York, Paris, London and Berlin has increased by more than a third in just a few weeks. Not everyone has got used to their new ways of working just yet. But - depending on where you are - there could be a good deal of time left to do so.

"Singapore had been a master class in how to handle the Covid-19 outbreak. Before the disease even had a name, the country had stringent travel restrictions and an efficient contact-tracing operation which contained the virus's spread. But in recent days, the number of confirmed cases has rocketed. Thursday brought the highest day of new infections to date at 287, up from 142 the day before. Mostly, these are coming from densely-packed migrant worker accommodation. Having avoided it for months, Singapore is now under a partial lockdown, with schools and non-essential businesses closed, and people urged to stay at home. Experts say one of the world's wealthiest nations - which seemed to be doing everything right - has important lessons for poorer countries, and there's still time to put them in place. Singapore had its first case of the new coronavirus very early on. It was a Chinese tourist who arrived from Wuhan on 23 January, the same day the virus epicentre was put into a total lockdown. By the time the disease caused by the virus got its official name - Covid-19 - it was already spreading among the population here. But a well-rehearsed response was in place. In addition to health checks at airports, Singapore carried out extensive testing of every suspected case; tracked down anyone who'd come into contact with a confirmed case; and confined those contacts to their homes until they were cleared. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called it ""a good example of an all-of-government approach"". Everyone who arrives in Singapore now has to quarantine in a government facility for 14 days For weeks, Singapore managed to keep its numbers low and trackable, with only small, easily contained clusters, without any real restrictions to daily life. But Prof Dale Fisher, chair of the WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and a professor at the National University of Singapore, told the BBC that whenever he heard people say Singapore was doing well, he'd reply: ""So far."" ""This is a really hard disease to contain,"" he says. The system worked until mid-March, says Prof Yik-Ying Teo, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health in Singapore. That's when, as the gravity of the situation became clear around the world, countries started urging their citizens to get home. Thousands returned to Singapore from countries which had not been as proactive - among them more than 500 people who unwittingly brought the virus back with them. It was by then mandatory for returnees to stay at home for two weeks. But other people in their household were told they could carry on with their lives, as long as no-one showed any symptoms. Singapore quarantines 20,000 migrant workers How Singapore stayed one step ahead of the virus While new cases had been increasing incrementally, by mid-March there were many dozens a day. The majority were imported or linked to imported cases, but for the first time, not all domestic cases could be easily traced. Prof Teo says it's easy to say with hindsight that it was a mistake to not limit returnees' interactions. But the reality is ""right now, we know a lot more about the disease compared to back in March"". ""We now know that asymptomatic spread is entirely possible - it does happen and could be the main driver of transmission for Covid-19,"" says Prof Teo. Precisely because Singapore has kept such detailed records of all cases, it's been able to learn from the domestic spread. ""The measures have evolved with the understanding of where the cases are coming from,"" says Prof Teo. That means, he adds, that countries should be cautious of relying too much on information we have now - for example, believing that people who've recovered are immune from future infection, when it is still far from certain that's the case. The problem of importation is now being dealt with by all new arrivals being sent directly to government quarantine. With a tiny number of people now entering, the number of imported cases has dropped into single figures in recent days. And on Tuesday evening, Singapore passed a new law, which - although it's not using the term - is effectively a partial national lockdown. Singapore's famous hawker centres are off limits for all but takeaways now Everyone is prohibited from leaving their homes except for essential activities and exercise, with fines of up to S$10,000 ($7,000; Â£5,600) or six months in prison. Prof Teo says this will be effective, and stresses that while there may still be an increase in numbers in the short term, it ""is a reflection of what happened in the past seven days - it doesn't mean the measures taken are not working"". But the alarming exponential rise in the last week has been around Singapore's migrant worker population - the hundreds of thousands of men from poorer countries employed in construction, shipping, and maintenance. Singapore is utterly dependent on these workers to keep its economy operating, but they are jobs in which social distancing is all but impossible. On top of that, the workers are required by law to live in dormitories - privately-run facilities which house up to 12 men per room, with shared bathroom, cooking and social facilities. It seems almost inevitable that these dorms would become clusters, and indeed they did.Close to 500 cases have now been confirmed in several dormitory clusters,external- one facility alone makes up 15% of all cases nationally. Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Thursday that if it had been known earlier how quickly the virus could spread ""I would have done things differently"", but that many workers continued at their jobs despite having symptoms. The fear is that in the next week or so, these numbers will explode. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Prof Teo says what has happened in the dorms ""is an indication of what will happen in some other countries, particularly the lower middle income, less well-resourced countries"". ""All you have to do is look at many countries in South Asia, South East Asia, parts of Africa - there are many communities where the living conditions are very similar to dorms."" He says the need now is for all governments to look at their countries with ""a frank and transparent lens"" in terms of what they can do to ""minimise the risk of an uncontrollable outbreak where people are living very closely packed together"". Prof Li Yang Hsu, also at SSH, says there is also a lesson going forward about social equality. ""The virus has been very efficient at highlighting to us the weaknesses of our societies - that's certainly the case for the migrant worker communities,"" he says. The dorms exceed all international requirements for space per resident, says Prof Hsu, but a situation like this ""just shows that they [the requirements] are inadequate"". ""Perhaps a high income country like Singapore can do better to protect the health and improve the welfare of people that are so crucial to our society,"" he says. This video can not be played The BBC visited a dormitory for 17,000 people in 2015 More than 24,000 workers are now confined to their dorms - on full pay and with meals provided. The government says it is also ""aggressively"" testing and has started moving some virus-free residents to empty properties or army camps to try to reduce the density. Comparing the dorms to the cruise ships which have generated such large clusters around the world, advocacy groupTransient Workers Count Too has called this ""a risky strategy"",external, saying the ""infection rate in the dorm could increase dramatically"" and has called for urgent action to provide better accommodation. Manpower Minister Josephine Teo has committed to raising standards in dorms overall,calling it ""the right thing to do"",external. Despite some accusations that it was too slow to bring about a partial lockdown, Prof Fisher says Singapore actually acted far earlier than other countries, while case numbers were still only just above 100 daily. But for a lockdown to be effective, he says, three things need to happen. Firstly for transmission to stop - which will happen if everyone stays home. Then the healthcare system needs the time and space to recover - for beds to be freed up, and medical staff to be able to take time off. ""Third is to get all systems in place - all isolation facilities, quarantine capacity, laws, contact tracing. ""If you just do one and two and then you reopen, history is going to repeat,"" he warns. Singapore is fortunate in this respect - unlike the UK and the US, for example, it has at no point seen its medical system overwhelmed. It also has one completely dominant political party and a compliant media, but Prof Dale says even with ""clear, crisp messaging to a community that trusts the government"" he is concerned that ""the average Singaporean still isn't quite grasping the importance of their individual role"". ""They're probably saying yes Singapore should do this, but I am going to visit my mum."" Within the first two days of the new law, more than 10,000 warnings were issued for infractions like sitting down to eat in a food court instead of taking away, or socialising in public spaces. For countries with bigger populations and more complex politics, it may be many weeks or months before they start to turn a corner. The porous borders where the virus cannot be controlled Clothing makers in Asia give stark virus warning As China opens up, a remote border town locks down A dazed city emerges from the harshest of lockdowns All countries are looking for signs of hope, but the lesson from Singapore is that there is no room for complacency, and that all countries must be prepared to face a second - and possibly third or fourth - wave of infection. Prof Teo says that if reported global coronavirus cases are a fair reflection of its real spread, ""many countries still have a window of opportunity to really try to prepare"", by ring-fencing their vulnerable or overcrowded communities and ""trying to minimise anyone who has the disease interacting with communities"". ""I can only say the world has to look at Singapore very clearly, particularly on the dormitory issue, and start exploring what is happening.

"The home secretary has said she is sorry if NHS staff feel there has been a failure to provide protective kit for those treating coronavirus patients. But Priti Patel said there were going to be problems during what she called an ""unprecedented global pandemic"". The British Medical Association earlier said that NHS staff were putting their lives at risk when treating patients. The health secretary said earlier that 19 NHS workers had died with coronavirus since the outbreak began. Speaking at Saturday's coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, the home secretary said: ""I'm sorry if people feel that there have been failings. I will be very, very clear about that. ""But at the same time, we are in an unprecedented global health pandemic right now. It is inevitable that the demand and the pressures on PPE and demand for PPE are going to be exponential."" This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""The central challenge is one of distribution"" On Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was enough kit for everyone and unveiled a plan to address shortages. He said the government was looking into how NHS staff who had died with the virus had been infected - adding that some may have caught it outside of work. ""But that doesn't take away from the bravery of every single NHS worker,"" he said, adding that his ""heart goes out"" to those who have died and their families. Mr Hancock said he was ""particularly struck at the high proportion of people from minority ethnic backgrounds and people who have come to this country to work in the NHS who have died of coranavirus"". ""We should recognise their enormous contribution,"" he added. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) in London and Yorkshire are at ""dangerously low levels"", according to the BMA. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said doctors were being forced into a corner and faced ""heart-breaking decisions"" over whether to carry on without proper protection. He said: ""This is an immensely difficult position to be in, but is ultimately down to the government's chronic failure to supply us with the proper equipment."" Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags Has the NHS got enough PPE? A nurse at Watford General Hospital in Hertfordshire, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC he felt unsafe with the level of PPE he had been given. He said shortages meant those working on wards with coronavirus patients were only being given a surgical mask and plastic apron, rather than a gown covering the whole body. Last week a nursing assistant who had been looking after coronavirus patients at the hospital died. ""We are scared because we are spreading the virus,"" he said. ""We don't deserve it and our patients even more."" The health secretary said 742 million pieces of protective gear had been delivered so far, saying: ""There's enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance. We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is."" Mr Hancock said he was not ""impugning anyone who works for the NHS"" and ""they do an amazing job"". ""But what I am reiterating, stressing, is the importance to use the right amount of PPE,"" he added. However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE"" and the government ""must act"" to ensure sufficient supplies are delivered. For several weeks, the government and NHS leaders have insisted there are enough stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE) and that the problem lay in the distribution from warehouses to the front line. Some hospitals have reported receiving higher consignments of gloves, masks, gowns and aprons. But doctors and nurses have continued to report shortages. Care homes, pharmacies, GP practices and community health teams feel they are at the back of the queue for equipment to protect staff who may come into contact with patients who have Covid-19. There has also been confusion over how safety guidelines should apply. Now Matt Hancock has admitted there are global supply problems and says it is a ""herculean effort"" to get deliveries to health workers and a ""huge task"" to keep it going. He set out a series of measures to step up provision of equipment. He may be given credit for acknowledging the scale of the problem. But NHS and care staff won't take much notice of plans until they are reflected in reality on the ground. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has dismissed any suggestion that healthcare staff have been overusing PPE. RCN chief executive Dame Donna Kinnair told the BBC no PPE was ""more precious a resource than a healthcare worker's life, a nurse's life, a doctor's life"". ""I take offence, actually, that we are saying that healthcare workers are abusing or overusing PPE,"" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that nurses were still telling her they did not have adequate supply of protective equipment. Meanwhile, the business organisation Make It British said the government had not yet taken up offers from some firms to help manufacture PPE. The group said at least 100 companies had responded to an appeal for help four weeks ago but had heard nothing since. How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

Retired civil servant Ralph Baxter, 74, died while walking his dog in Roade, Northamptonshire, on Wednesday. A 27-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail. In a tribute, Mr Baxter's family said he was a ""loving husband, step-father, step-grandfather, brother, and uncle"". A post-mortem examination into his death carried out at Leicester Royal Infirmary came back as ""unascertained"". Mr Baxter had been walking his dog, Bertie, in Hyde Road at about 16:20 BST when he was assaulted. Residents said there had been a clash between his pet and a larger, husky-type dog. Mr Baxter was treated by paramedics but died a short time later The family tribute said: ""Ralph was a loving husband, step-father, step-grandfather, brother, and uncle."" He had lived in Roade for 35 years and was an avid Northampton Saints supporter. He was awarded an MBE by the Queen for his dedication and commitment to the Civil Service. ""Ralph was also a keen member of the Labour Party and could always be relied on to 'pound the pavement' at canvassing time,"" the tribute added.

"We have gone weeks without seeing friends and family, without school, holidays or even being able to go to work. On 10 May, Boris Johnson is expected to address lockdown measures, although people should ""not expect big changes."" So what can be lifted and when? This virus remains massively contagious. Before lockdown, one infected person passed it onto at least three others on average (the so called R-number). And less than 5% of the UK population is estimated to have been infected. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable. If we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable. The goal of lockdown has been to cut infections by around 70% to force the R-number below one (the point at which the outbreak starts to decline). That has been achieved. However, it is only just below one. ""There isn't much wiggle room,"" a source within the government's science advisers told me, adding the country ""can't make a huge number of changes"". One set of modelling suggests opening schools - and nothing else - would be enough to almost tip us back into rising cases. The aim is to create more ""wiggle room"" - you identify cases and then perform rapid contact tracing and put those at risk in quarantine. This strategy, also called ""seek and destroy"", will be supported by a voluntary smartphone app which will help identify contacts. The more successfully this is done, the more it will reduce the ability of the virus to spread and the more restrictions can be lifted on day-to-day life. ""At the moment you need, on average, a 60-70% reduction in social interactions to stop the outbreak increasing,"" said Dr Kucharski. ""If we can get that down to 30% that gives you a lot more to play with."" But even this is not life as normal and other measures would still be needed to keep the disease in check. ""It is a more moderate version of where we are now,"" said Dr Kucharski. When will the outbreak end and life get back to normal? How does contact tracing work and is my data safe? Another strategy proposed by some is ""enhanced shielding"". Instead of trying to suppress the coronavirus across every section of society, you could instead aim to stop it completely forthe most vulnerable. Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Very crudely, for 80% of us who are not vulnerable this is a nasty virus, but it wouldn't overwhelm the healthcare system and it wouldn't lock down society. ""If we really bolster that shielding, make a very strong shield indeed, then it buys you a lot more room and it may mean you can relax some measures permanently."" That would mean all staff hospitals, care homes or anyone visiting those deemed vulnerable being regularly tested to ensure they are clear of the virus. Ideally, antibody tests would prove they are immune to it. The danger is, having more virus circulating in the community could put those ""shields"" under intense pressure. Millions of people in the UK will soon be asked to track their movements to limit the spread of coronavirus. Some restrictions are less risky in terms of spreading the virus. ""Essentially we've got a lot of not very good options - it won't be one day and everything will change, but things could open up,"" Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. Dr Kucharski argues lifting different restrictions can be put into three broad categories: Those with low, moderate and substantial risk of increasing transmission of the virus. Low risk includes exercising outdoors, which has been restricted in some countries. Wales has already announced that from 11 May, people will be able able to exercise more than once a day. Moderate risk would include letting some non-essential shops re-open or having occasional gatherings with people outside the household. Substantial increases could come from lifting advice to work from home, reopening schools or isolating sick people and quarantining households. ""I think the order things went in will be reflected in the order things will be lifted,"" he says. There remains a nervousness within the scientific advice to government about lifting restrictions in areas, like pubs, whose whole purpose is to bring people together. And there is an emerging question around primary schools as young children, some studies suggest, cannot be infected as easily. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? R-NUMBER:Is this the crucial number? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? There is a decision about how far we go with suppressing the virus now we've passed the peak. We could drive levels down as low as possible. That will greatly limit the ability of the virus to bounce back in a second wave and make testing and contact tracing more likely to be effective. The trade-off is maintaining the lockdown for longer. Or we could exit lockdown now and accept having a higher number of cases, which creates its own problems. The biggest thing that could come along is a vaccine, as immunising people would mean there was no need for any social distancing measures. That is thought to be more than a year away. Failing that, the concept of herd immunity may kick in when around 70% of the population have been infected and the virus can no longer cause large outbreaks. Effective drugs would also make a huge difference if they could stop Covid-19 progressing from a cough or fever into a serious disease needing intensive care. We might get closer to normality, or at least normality for some, in the months to come. But we are all still in this for the long haul. Download theBBC News Appfor all the latest headlines.

"GPs are seeing just seven in every 100 patients face-to-face because of the coronavirus outbreak, following a ""remarkable"" shift to online and telephone appointments across England. Fewer than 1% of appointments were done via video link last year, with 80% in person, BBC analysis shows. But the Royal College of GPs (RCGP) said that had been turned on its head because of social distancing. Its chair said most people were ""pretty happy"" with phone appointments. Age UK has, however, urged doctors not to drop home visits and to seek out vulnerable patients ""proactively"". Professor Martin Marshall, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said practices were adapting Professor Martin Marshall, chairman of RCGP and whose own GP surgery is in Newham, east London, said around 40% of patients would normally be triaged before booking an appointment. Now all patients are initially assessed on the phone before booking either a call or video link with a doctor. He said: ""The GP profession has changed dramatically in just three weeks. ""Now 100% are triaged and around 7% or 8% are face-to-face. ""Most of the consultations are taking place on the telephone rather than video link. ""People are pretty happy with doing assessments over the phone and they are proving effective. ""Who would have thought this 150-year-old technology would still be just as useful today?"" He said there were occasions where a video appointment was beneficial, particularly in the case of assessing skin rashes. But with people able to email in pictures of the affected area, he said phone calls have been used in around 90% of cases. Last year, two thirds of all regional NHS commissioning areas carried out no video call appointments, NHS data shows. ""The big question is which elements do we want to embed in our practices in the future?"" Prof Marshall said. ""I don't see us doing all of our consultations over the phone or online, but certainly up to 50% is possible."" There are still occasions where patients need to attend a practice in person, such as where blood pressures or oxygen saturation needs to be read, he said. Regional NHS areas are establishing ""hot and cold"" practices to mitigate the risk of infection. Hot practices assess people with clear Covid-19 symptoms only. In more rural areas, this can take the form of a single room in a surgery. In bigger areas it can be several surgeries. Though Prof Marshall said just as many precautions were being taken at cold sites. Age UK's Tom Gentry has urged practices to be proactive in calling vulnerable patients. Concerns have been raised that people who may not have access to smartphones or a computer will be excluded from seeing their GP during the crisis. Elderly needs charity Age UK has urged practices to be ""proactive"" in contacting people on their registers known to have underlying health conditions. Senior health influencing manager at the charity Tom Gentry said: ""Surgeries have a lot of information at their disposal. Using that, they need to make active care plans for people to enable them to feel supported. ""It's about not waiting for people to deteriorate and it's about reaching out to them first."" Mr Gentry said that surgeries should also not discount the use of home visits, providing adequate precautions are taken. ""No one should be told outright that they should not be visited in their own home,"" he said. Sue Sharp received a video call from her doctor last week without her booking an appointment. Many GP practices have already adopted the proactive approach. Taxi firm administration assistant Sue Sharpe from Calne, Wiltshire, received a video call from her GP last week as she has rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome and multiple myeloma. ""She noted that I have been unwell recently and asked whether or not I was expecting further intervention from my specialist consultant,"" said Mrs Sharp. ""When I said that I was due a trip to the hospital as a day patient she asked whether I had transport for the journey, or did I require any help getting there. Joanna and Clive Williams received a call from their GP last week. ""I think it's brilliant that GP's are contacting at-risk patients in this way."" Fishing tackle supplier Clive Williams, from Horsham in West Sussex, is caring for his wife Joanna, 63, at home as she has a brain tumour. He was worried about going to a  surgery because of the risk of infection - and because he did not want to add extra burden to his stretched local practice. ""I felt it would be a nuisance to get in touch with them,"" the 64-year-old said. ""But my GP is absolutely brilliant. He contacted me out of the blue to have a little chat about my wife as she struggles with her memory.""

"About half of Scotland's privately-run care homes have suspected coronavirus cases, according to industry leaders. Trade body Scottish Care said the impact of the virus on residents alongside staff absence levels of up to 30% had put homes under huge strain. There have been concerns over thenumber of deathsandadequate protective equipmentat care homes. Fears have also been raised over a ""postcode lottery"" when it comes to testing care workers and residents. Scottish Care's members provide the vast majority of Scotland's 36,000 care home beds, with chief executive Dr Donald Macaskill saying the virus had left the sector facing an ""unprecedented challenge on every front"". The outbreak has killed several residents at care homes in Dumbarton, North Lanarkshire and Tranent in recent weeks. And information gathered by Scottish Care from its members suggests that about half of care homes in Scotland have at least one suspected case of coronavirus. Dr Macaskill said concerns about deaths in homes were understandable, but had to be seen in context and treated with caution. He said: ""80% of people in care homes are there for later stage of life care. It is a place where there are, sadly, frequents deaths and we have seen that older people generally are more vulnerable to the virus."" Twelve residents with coronavirus symptoms at Burlington Court Care Home in Glasgow died in one week There is an official count of the number of suspected cases of coronavirus in care homes, but it could be up to three months before it is published. The Care Inspectorate has asked all care homes to notify them when they have a suspected coronavirus case or when a resident dies from the virus, and to keep them updated on staff shortages. However, the taxpayer-funded watchdog is refusing to publish this Scotland-wide data at the height of the crisis. Instead, BBC Scotland has been told its request for the data is being treated as a freedom of information request, which under the emergency coronavirus laws means the Care Inspectorate has three months to respond. The watchdog says it is because of concerns over the ""robustness of the data"" coming from care homes. Despite these concerns, the same data is being given to councils, health boards and the Scottish government to help them ""deliver support across partnership areas and nationally"". Robert Kilgour, owner of Renaissance Care, which has 14 care homes across Scotland and around 1,100 staff, said he has suspected coronavirus cases in about half of his facilities. The firm has had three confirmed cases, two of which were where people died, but ""without access to proper testing"" he is unsure of the full extent of the virus among staff and residents. He said: ""Testing feels like a big issue right now but our experience is there is a postcode lottery where testing in some areas of the country is good and in others it is non-existent. ""Times are tough, the NHS is so vitally important but we have to remember a collapse in social care sector would also spell disaster for the health service."" Dr Macaskill said carers were doing a ""magnificent job under very trying circumstances"" Mr Kilgour said his business was operating with an absence rate of about 15%, but those who were able to come to work were excelling. He explained: ""The response from staff has been nothing short of amazing, a proper Dunkirk spirit. ""For many of them the residents and their colleagues are like a second family and they are pushing on for them. ""I've had reports of a number of staff moving into the care homes to protect their own families and allow them to keep working."" The Scottish government has issuednew guidance on the personal protective equipment to be worn by care workersand health boards have been asked to prioritise testing to enable health and social care staff to get back to work. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has said protecting staff working on the frontline is ""an absolute priority"" for the Scottish government. Experts have warned that the virus has left many care home residents struggling to cope with the collapse of their social networks. Family visits and activities at the majority of homes have been suspended, with many residents also being isolated in their rooms as a precaution against the virus. Prof Adam Gordon, of the British Geriatrics Society, who specialises in how healthcare is delivered in care homes, said: ""We have to remember a care home is a community so a resident might have social relationships with other residents, the staff and of course family visiting. ""Overnight this routine has gone or severely disrupted. ""So for people who have any sort of memory problem it is a really tough time right now, especially if they might not have much understanding of the wider world. ""We know loneliness and social isolation can result in worse outcomes for older people and it is a real concern given how long the lockdown is likely to last."" The suspension of family visits and other activities has left many care home residents struggling Scottish government figures show about 60% of adults in care homes have some form of dementia and Dr Macaskill, of Scottish Care, said the lockdown measures were having a ""profound impact"" on both residents and stretched staff members trying to keep their spirits up. He said: ""People just need to just think about how their own lives have been impacted and then consider the disruption to routine it is having for someone in a care home, perhaps with dementia."" One bright spot has been a Scottish Care drive to increase the use of tablet or mobile phone devices to connect residents with friends or families. ""We've had some wonderful donations of equipment. It is not for everyone, but there have been many heart-warming examples of staff using technology to try and bridge this gap,"" Dr Macaskill explained. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

and across the world. We leave you with this picture from London, showing a chalk
drawing of a rainbow â a symbol that has fostered hope worldwide. Rainbows have been used to keep spirits up during the pandemic The government is being urged to ""scale up the national food response"" after a survey suggested more than 3 million people in Great Britain may have gone hungry during the coronavirus lockdown. About 6% of 4,343 adults polled by YouGov,externalsaid someone in their household had gone hungry during the first three weeks of the social distancing measures. The Food Foundation, which commissioned the survey with the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission, said this represented more than three million people. The charity is calling for the creation of a national food aid task force to help local authorities scale up welfare assistance schemes and provide food parcels, and to improve home delivery options. It also wants the Department for Work and Pensions to abolish the five-week wait for Universal Credit payments. We've been bringing you updates all day from Broadcasting House in London or, because of social distancing measures, from our laptops at home.

As families across the world spend more time at home, working while there are children around can be challenging for parents. So it proved for Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, whose children made an unexpected appearance live on BBC News on Saturday. The British MP chuckled as he repeatedly told his girls ""I'm on the TV""! Ashworth compared himself to Professor Robert Kelly,an academic who went viral in 2017 when his children crashed his live TV interview with the BBC. You can watch the amusing moment below. This video can not be played Labour's Jonathan Ashworth experiences BBC Dad moment Police in South Africa are operating road blocks in Cape Town as part of the country's lockdown The pandemic seems to be leaving no corner of life untouched - including violent crime. The Associated Press news agency has looked at crime rates globallyin an interesting report,external- it explains that they've dropped and by spectacular levels in some countries. It says:  The drop in crime is being put down to increased policing on the streets, as well as more people staying at home. âThereâs a lot fewer opportunities for criminals to take advantage of,â Joe Giacalone, a former New York Police Department sergeant, told AP. Sadly one area of crime that has soared is domestic violence. So much so that the World Health Organization has called for abuse charities to be designated essential services in order to deal with the volume of cases. Pope Francis urged people not to ""yield to fear"" and focused on a ""message of hope"" as he held an Easter eve Mass from an almost empty St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. He encouraged people to be ""the messengers of life in a time of death"", and urged those better off to help the poor. Women gathered in large numbers in shops and markets on the days when they were allowed to go out Peru's government has revoked a decision to restrict the movement of people in the streets on certain days of the week according to their gender.The ruling was issued on 2 Aprilas part of measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus. Farid Matuk, a member of the government's Covid-19 task force, said the move did not work because Peru was still a patriarchal society where women did most of the domestic work. He said women had gathered in large numbers in shops and markets on the three days of the week when they were allowed to go out. Now only one person per family unit can go out from Monday to Saturday to buy food or medicine, or go to the bank. As with the previous measure, no-one is allowed out on Sundays. On Friday, President MartÃ­n Vizcarra extended the state of emergency and lockdown measures until 26 April. The country has reported 5,897 confirmed coronavirus cases and 169 deaths. Life in Wuhan is slowly returning back to normality, but there's a long way to go yet Itâs been three days since Wuhan, the Chinese city of 11 million where the
pandemic began, emerged from its more than two months in lockdown. But as Wuhan and other parts of the country re-open, Chinese
health officials are worried about a possible second wave of coronavirus cases. âWe canât say that there is no such potential risk,â Wang Xinghuan, the president of a hospital built for coronavirus patients
in Wuhan, told Reuters news agency. In recent days, China has seen a rise in new coronavirus
cases, most of which have been imported from abroad. On Friday, 46 new cases of the virus were reported, up from 42 new cases a day earlier, Chinese health authorities said. Of those new cases reported on Friday, 42 were from abroad. Another 34 asymptomatic cases were reported on Friday too, heightening
concern that cases from abroad may be going undetected. You might be wondering if China's coronavirus figures can trusted.Read our analysis on that here. New York has been one of the hardest-hit cities in the world, recording hundreds of deaths a day this week Hereâs a overview of some key updates from around the world on
Saturday: Remdesivir is being used to treat severely ill patients in international clinical trials The billion-dollar question right now is how soon will we have a coronavirus vaccine. But scientists are also working on treatments for patients who already have the infection. These could save lives and alleviate suffering in the meantime. One of four drugs being tested in experiments overseen by the World Health Organization is remdesivir. Two-thirds of 53 patients given the drug in a US clinical trial showed signs of improvement. The trial began when scientists looked at drugs that had shown promise against the Sars or Mers coronaviruses, which killed hundreds of people in 2003 and 2012, the WHOâs chief scientist, Dr Soumya Swaminathan told the BBC. But she warned that the remdesivir trial had no control group, meaning there were no patients in the experiment who did not take the drug, and therefore no way of comparing the results. Although scientists hope the initial signs will prove to be correct, Dr Swaminathan explained, there was no way of knowing currently if and by how much the drug benefited patients. âWe're doing everything we can to speed up enrolment [in the trial] but I think this epidemic is going to be with us some time,â she warned.

Earlier on Saturday, UK Home Secretary Priti Patel was grilled over the UK government's provision of protective equipment to NHS staff treating coronavirus patients. Patel was asked at a Downing Street press briefing if she would apologise to NHS workers aftermedics said the lack of PPE was putting lives at risk. Here is what she said.

Julie Omar died on Friday morning at home, where she had
been self-isolating after developing coronavirus symptoms. She was a highly experienced trauma and orthopaedics nurse
who had most recently been working as a sister on Ward 14 at Redditchâs
Alexandra Hospital, the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said. Read the full story:Redditch nurse dies after developing Covid-19 symptoms Matthew Hopkins, chief executive of the trust, announced
Omarâs death in a message to his colleagues, describing her as a ""much-loved member of our nursing team"". Addressing NHS staff, he wrote: ""I know that this news will have a profound impact on many of you, not least because it brings the tragic consequences of this outbreak even closer to home than it already was.""

Richard WarryBBC News An analysis of 3,883 Covid-19 patients admitted to 229 critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland up to Thursday has been published by theIntensive Care National Audit & Research Centre,external. Of these patients, 871 have died, 818 have been discharged, and 2,194 were last reported as still receiving critical care. The average age of the patients was 59.8 years. Some 72.5% were male, and 27.5% female. Some 66.4% were white, 14.4% Asian, 11.9% black, and 1.3% of mixed race. Earlier today, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said schools would remain closed until September and the move ""clearly will help us save lives"". But later, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo dismissed his claims and said ""that's his opinion, but he didn't close them and he can't open them... there has been no decision on schools"". A state governor can overrule a decision of an individual city's mayor. Cuomo said it ""made no sense"" for New York City to keep its schools closed if they were allowed to open in other nearby cities. He even went a step further to suggest the decision should be coordinated with other states. ""Legally, I want the metropolitan area coordinated,"" he said. ""I'd like to ideally coordinate that with Connecticut and New Jersey."" We have previously reported that BBC medical drama Holby City has donated working ventilators from its set at Elstree to be used in London's new NHS Nightingale Hospital. We can now tell you that the two machines were part of a donation made almost three weeks ago, which also included all the personal protective equipment (PPE) from the show. Some social media users questioned why a TV drama used real medical equipment. Most of Holby City's equipment is real but the majority - including some of their other ventilators - is old and non-operational. A BBC Studios spokesperson said: âPrior to the coronavirus crisis Holby City Production took delivery of two working anaesthetic machines with ventilators attached but immediately asked our supplier to offer them to the NHS when we became aware of the urgent demand several weeks ago."" Italyâs coronavirus-related deaths increased by 619 on Saturday,
bringing the total toll to 19,468. That death toll is now second to that of the US, which, according to the respected John Hopkins University tally, is the highest in the world. The number of people who have tested positive has reached 152,271 in Italy, an increase of 4,694, or 3.1% day on day. On a positive note, there were 116 fewer people in intensive care with Covid-19 than the previous day. In France, meanwhile, the total death toll rose to 13,832, with 353 more deaths in hospitals and 290 in care homes. But for a third consecutive day, the number of patients in
intensive care with Covid-19 dropped, with 121 fewer cases compared to Fridayâs
figures. Franceâs director of health, JÃ©rÃ´me Salomon, described the
drop in intensive care numbers â the biggest yet â as a âray of sunshineâ. Medical officials see the number of intensive care patients
as an indicator of the pressure on health systems. Alice CuddyBBC News Anthony
Almojera, a senior paramedic in New York City, has written a diary for the BBC
of one day in his working life. He says that day - last Sunday - was the worst
in his 17-year career. Here are his words: ""We arrive at a house and I put on my mask, gown and
gloves. We find a man. His family says he has had a fever and
cough for five days. We start CPR and I watch the medics pass a tube down his
throat to breathe for him. We work on him for about 30 minutes before we pronounce
him dead. I make sure the crews are OK and get back in my truck -
decontaminating everything first. I hit the button to go available. Twenty minutes later, I get another cardiac arrest. Same
symptoms, same procedures, same results. We hit the button, get another one. It is now around 11:00 and I've done about six cardiac
arrests. In normal times, a medic gets two or three in a week,
maybe. You can have a busy day sometimes, but never this. Never this."" Read more of Anthony's account here Earlier we reported that the US death toll was expected to soon overtake Italy as the highest in the world - and that has now happened. There have now been 19,701 deaths reported by the US, according to John Hopkins University. That compares to 19,468 reported by Italy's government. Regardless of which country has reported a greater number of deaths, it is a tragedy for both. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Bettina Biazzoâs sons Rocco and Marco safeguard Easter eggs to be delivered to a hospital in Crawley People across England have been donating chocolate Easter eggs to key workers such as NHS staff to say 'thank you"" during the coronavirus pandemic. From local football clubs to multi-million pound companies, many have said they wanted to show support over the Easter holidays. Chris Collins, who donated eggs on behalf of the sports team he coaches, said it was âour little way of saying thank you very muchâ. Mr Collins, 50, and his wife, Suzy, 40, originally bought 40 eggs to give to the players of the Bootham Futsal Club. Chris and Suzy Collins said they had ""nothing but praise"" for NHS staff after she was treated following a motorcycle crash After the outbreak, with all club fixtures and training suspended, the couple - from York - said it was âonly rightâ to donate the eggs to the nearby York District Hospital. âWe thought, itâs the least we can do for the NHS,â Mr Collins said. âThereâs not a lot of good news around at the moment, people are struggling, but when things go wrong it brings out the good in people,â he added. âItâs such a minor thing weâre doing, but hopefully it will make staff smile while doing what is a horrible job at the moment.â Bettina Biazzo said she couldn't wait to see the faces of NHS staff when she delivered the eggs Bettina Biazzo, 39, started raising money to get 75 Easter eggs to staff at Crawley Hospital. âOne of my friends works at the hospital and said âIâm trying to get eggs for my nursesâ, theyâre working such long hours, they havenât got time to queue up at the shops to get Easter eggs.â Between her and a colleague, Ms Biazzo said they had raised enough to buy 100 eggs each and planned to deliver them as a surprise. âI think we all feel helpless in the lockdown,"" she said. ""Iâm stuck indoors and wanted to do something. I think people, especially those who are self-isolating and havenât got friends or family nearby, want to feel like a part of something.â Adam Everett said delivery of eggs went down well at his local hospital Football coaches Adam Everett, 17, and Jake Garner, 18, from Ely, Cambridgeshire, also donated chocolate eggs meant for players in their girls squads. Mr Everett, whose mother is an NHS nurse, said: âThey've been doing selfless acts for other people's wellbeing, they should be rewarded for that. âI know I donât want to go out and risk myself getting the virus, but theyâve got to.â Surprising staff with the gift at the Princess of Wales Hospital, Mr Everett said: âThey didnât have a clue, I went in and said âIâve got 27 Easter eggs for youâ, they were shocked and really grateful for the act of kindness. âI think everyoneâs starting to realise week to week how severe this virus is, and theyâre starting to look at what they can do for others. ""The issues we have as a country have been put to one side and everyone is having to get along, it feels like a very united country,â he added. Louisa Hobson said NHS staff acted quickly to save her life during a hospital stay in 2017 Louisa Hobson, who lives near Winchester, said she wanted to do something for NHS staff, but rather than give them something âessentialâ like personal protective equipment (PPE), she wanted to âput a smile on their facesâ. The 41-year-old started a crowdfunding page, raising enough to purchase 300 Easter eggs, to be distributed to Winchester Royal County Hospital, Alton Community Hospital and a local GP surgery. âI thought about staff not being able to see their families over Easter and wanted to do something to let them know we were thinking of them,â she said. âItâs something nice to do and itâs also achievable for a lot of people, a lot of us donât know where to get things like PPE, but this is more a morale booster than anything else.â Large retailers and manufacturers have also been stepping up to get Easter treats to NHS and other front line workers.

Mr Gething said: ""It makes sense the four UK nations work together on procurement of PPE rather than compete against each other.""

"This video can not be played ""We're getting the PPE out there but there's clearly a huge task ahead to keep it flowing"" The UK will now ensure daily deliveries of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline workers, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told the daily coronavirus briefing it had been a ""Herculean effort"", after criticism the government was not doing enough to protect critical NHS staff. Officials told the briefing the lockdown was ""beginning to pay off"" but it was still a ""dangerous situation"". The UK recorded another 980 hospital deaths, bringing the total to 8,958. That death toll, which does not include those who died in care homes or the community, has now exceeded the worst daily figures seen in Italy and Spain. But England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, warned it was ""impossible to say we have peaked"", adding that the measures the country was taking with social distancing needed to continue. Live page: Global death toll tops 100,000 NHS doctor who pleaded for virus protection dies Can we 3D-print our way out of the PPE shortage? The total number of deaths worldwide has now passed 100,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University in the US. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said that some NHS and care workers were saying they were still struggling to get protective equipment and they felt unsafe, despite earlier pledges by the government. He asked if Mr Hancock was acknowledging the previous plans were insufficient. The health secretary responded that it had been an ""enormous challenge"", but that 742 million pieces of protective gear had been delivered so far. ""But there's clearly a huge task ahead to keep it flowing and to make sure that those who need it get it,"" he added. Mr Hancock also told the briefing that the protective equipment - such as masks, gloves and aprons - must be used only where it was most needed. ""There's enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance. We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is,"" he said. He also cautioned against using protective gear outside of health and social care settings, saying handwashing, social distancing and staying at home were the best ways for people to stay safe. ""A front door is better than any face mask,"" Mr Hancock said. Those looking after Covid-19 patients are themselves most at risk of catching the virus. Protective gear and testing are vital not only for protecting staff, but also for minimising the spread of Covid-19. There have been constant stories of doctors, nurses or care home staff not getting the protection they need. The government says it has been, in part, a logistical problem. Instead of supplying just over 200 hospital organisations with PPE they are now delivering to 58,000 separate organisations including pharmacies, care homes and GP surgeries. We are still not at the peak of the outbreak, despite some positive signs in the data. However, even if we pass the peak and cases start to fall it won't mean all restrictions can be lifted. The best estimate of the proportion of people infected (and potentially immune in the UK) is 4%. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable to the infection. So lifting the lockdown could lead to another surge in cases. Instead the government will have to decide which restrictions to lift, which to keep and what new strategies to introduce in order to suppress the virus. Mr Hancock said that because of ""huge international demand"" the UK was having to create a domestic manufacturing industry for protective equipment from scratch, as well as buying from abroad. He said Burberry had offered to make protective gowns, Rolls-Royce and McLaren were making visors and hand sanitiser was being made by drinks company Diageo and chemicals producer Ineos. Susan Masters, national director of nursing policy and practice at the Royal College of Nursing, said the amount of PPE being delivered would only be impressive ""when nursing staff stop contacting me to say what they need to use wasn't available"". ""The calls are still coming through - people are petrified. They have seen colleagues die already."" At the government's briefing, chief nursing officer Ruth May paid tribute to frontline staff who had died after contracting coronavirus. ""The NHS is a family and we feel their loss deeply,"" she said. Appealing to the public to continue observing the lockdown rules, she said it was ""frustrating"" for NHS staff to see people failing to observe the social distancing. ""It is enormously frustrating... there's also still occasions where my colleagues are getting abuse from their neighbours for driving off to work,"" she said. ""Our nurses, our healthcare staff, need to be able to get to work, it's right and proper they do, but my ask of everybody, please stay at home, save lives and protect my staff."" By Philippa Roxby, health reporter There is no hiding from the fact that today's announcement of 980 new UK deaths has surpassed Italy and Spain's worst days during this pandemic. Italy's highest death toll was 969; Spain's 950. While these two countries are now seeing daily death figures coming down, the UK's have been closing in on 1,000 for several days - and the true death toll is likely to be higher once deaths not yet reported have been added in. Yet the NHS has not been overwhelmed in the way that Italy's hospitals appeared to be, particularly in the north. The message is that the NHS has spare capacity and intensive care beds not yet used, thanks to planning and everyone's efforts to stay at home. There was even a plea from health officials that anyone with serious and worrying health problems of any kind should contact the NHS as usual. The hope is now that the UK's social distancing measures will have the same effect as Italy and Spain's lockdowns, and deaths will start to fall - not just slow down - in the weeks to come. Mr Hancock was challenged ona report in Health Service Journal,externalthat he had been failing to observe social distancing rules himself, holding regular video calls in his office surrounded by between 10 and 20 colleagues. Senior NHS leaders expressed alarm that the health secretary was providing a bad example, the report said. Mr Hancock insisted that he followed social distancing rules on the occasions when he had to come into the office. It comes after Housing Secretary Robert Jenrickdefended his travel movesfollowing reports he flouted the government's lockdown rules. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Mr Hancock also told the briefing 15 drive-through testing centres had been opened across the UK to enable all frontline NHS and social care staff to be screened for the virus. The 19,100 tests carried out in the last day still fall well short of thehealth secretary's target of 100,000 a day by the end of April. Can the UK do 100,000 coronavirus tests a day? But he said new ""Lighthouse mega-labs"" were on track in Cheshire and Glasgow, and another has opened in Milton Keynes. Pharmaceutical giants AstraZeneca and GSK were opening an additional testing facility in Cambridge, he added. The government also announced new Nightingale temporary hospitals to be opened, with 460 beds in Washington, Tyne and Wear, and a smaller facility in Exeter. It brings the total number to seven, with units in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol and Harrogate as well.

"The home secretary has said she is sorry if NHS staff feel there has been a failure to provide protective kit for those treating coronavirus patients. But Priti Patel said there were going to be problems during what she called an ""unprecedented global pandemic"". The British Medical Association earlier said that NHS staff were putting their lives at risk when treating patients. The health secretary said earlier that 19 NHS workers had died with coronavirus since the outbreak began. Speaking at Saturday's coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, the home secretary said: ""I'm sorry if people feel that there have been failings. I will be very, very clear about that. ""But at the same time, we are in an unprecedented global health pandemic right now. It is inevitable that the demand and the pressures on PPE and demand for PPE are going to be exponential."" This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""The central challenge is one of distribution"" On Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was enough kit for everyone and unveiled a plan to address shortages. He said the government was looking into how NHS staff who had died with the virus had been infected - adding that some may have caught it outside of work. ""But that doesn't take away from the bravery of every single NHS worker,"" he said, adding that his ""heart goes out"" to those who have died and their families. Mr Hancock said he was ""particularly struck at the high proportion of people from minority ethnic backgrounds and people who have come to this country to work in the NHS who have died of coranavirus"". ""We should recognise their enormous contribution,"" he added. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) in London and Yorkshire are at ""dangerously low levels"", according to the BMA. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said doctors were being forced into a corner and faced ""heart-breaking decisions"" over whether to carry on without proper protection. He said: ""This is an immensely difficult position to be in, but is ultimately down to the government's chronic failure to supply us with the proper equipment."" Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags Has the NHS got enough PPE? A nurse at Watford General Hospital in Hertfordshire, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC he felt unsafe with the level of PPE he had been given. He said shortages meant those working on wards with coronavirus patients were only being given a surgical mask and plastic apron, rather than a gown covering the whole body. Last week a nursing assistant who had been looking after coronavirus patients at the hospital died. ""We are scared because we are spreading the virus,"" he said. ""We don't deserve it and our patients even more."" The health secretary said 742 million pieces of protective gear had been delivered so far, saying: ""There's enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance. We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is."" Mr Hancock said he was not ""impugning anyone who works for the NHS"" and ""they do an amazing job"". ""But what I am reiterating, stressing, is the importance to use the right amount of PPE,"" he added. However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE"" and the government ""must act"" to ensure sufficient supplies are delivered. For several weeks, the government and NHS leaders have insisted there are enough stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE) and that the problem lay in the distribution from warehouses to the front line. Some hospitals have reported receiving higher consignments of gloves, masks, gowns and aprons. But doctors and nurses have continued to report shortages. Care homes, pharmacies, GP practices and community health teams feel they are at the back of the queue for equipment to protect staff who may come into contact with patients who have Covid-19. There has also been confusion over how safety guidelines should apply. Now Matt Hancock has admitted there are global supply problems and says it is a ""herculean effort"" to get deliveries to health workers and a ""huge task"" to keep it going. He set out a series of measures to step up provision of equipment. He may be given credit for acknowledging the scale of the problem. But NHS and care staff won't take much notice of plans until they are reflected in reality on the ground. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has dismissed any suggestion that healthcare staff have been overusing PPE. RCN chief executive Dame Donna Kinnair told the BBC no PPE was ""more precious a resource than a healthcare worker's life, a nurse's life, a doctor's life"". ""I take offence, actually, that we are saying that healthcare workers are abusing or overusing PPE,"" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that nurses were still telling her they did not have adequate supply of protective equipment. Meanwhile, the business organisation Make It British said the government had not yet taken up offers from some firms to help manufacture PPE. The group said at least 100 companies had responded to an appeal for help four weeks ago but had heard nothing since. How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

"Refrigerated tractor trailers serve as temporary morgues in New York City The US has become the first country in the world to record more than 2,000 coronavirus deaths in a single day. Figures from Johns Hopkins University show 2,108 people died in the past 24 hours while there are now more than half a million confirmed infections. The US could soon surpass Italy as the country with the most coronavirus deaths worldwide. But experts on the White House Covid-19 task force say the outbreak is starting to level off across the US. Dr Deborah Birx said there were good signs the outbreak was stabilising, but cautioned: ""As encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak.""

""I want to get it open as soon as possible,"" Mr Trump said at a Good Friday briefing at the White House. ""I would say without question it's the biggest decision I've ever had to make."" However, no action would be taken until the government knew the ""country [was] going to be healthy"", he said. ""We don't want to go back and start doing it over again."" By Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York The coronavirus has changed everything about life, and now it's upending the rituals of death. New Yorkers have been shocked by the grim scenes: ambulances constantly blaring down eerily deserted streets, body bags being forklifted into refrigerated trucks outside hospitals and now new trenches being dug on Hart's Island for possible mass burials. The remote cemetery, accessible only by boat, is a place regarded historically with sorrow because of its mass graves with no tombstones, just unclaimed bodies. The city's morgues can only handle so much before temporary burials for Covid-19 victims, once an absolute worst-case scenario, become necessary. Funeral directors talk openly about how scared and depressed the spiking death toll has left them. Even before this week's record number of deaths, some families have had to wait a week or more to bury and cremate their loved ones. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Dr Anthony Fauci, US infectious diseases chief, concurred that the country was ""starting to see the levelling off and coming down"" of cases and deaths. But despite the ""important advance"", he added, mitigation efforts such as social distancing should not be pulled back yet. A new projection by theInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington forecast 60,000 deaths by 4 August,externalassuming that those restrictions remain in place. Last month, Dr Fauci estimated at least 100,000 deaths. Also at the briefing, Dr Birx noted that the rate of increase appeared to be stabilising in hard-hit regions like New York, New Jersey and the city of Chicago. She added that the US mortality rate was ""significantly less than many of the other countries, when you correct them for our population"". But she emphasised the nation had yet to see the peak of the outbreak. ""We need to continue to do what we did yesterday, and the week before, and the week before that because that's what, in the end, is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side.""

On Friday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the latest data showed the state was successfully ""flattening the curve"", but also cautioned that it was too early to relax social distancing measures.

""As a matter of fact, I have been carrying an inhaler in my pocket for 40 years out of fear of having a fatal asthma attack,"" continued Dr Adams, who is African-American. But he caused controversy by urging minorities to stop drinking, smoking and taking drugs to reduce their risk. He was particularly criticised for his use of colloquial language, when he told them to respect social distancing guidelines. ""Do it for your abuela. Do it for your granddaddy. Do it for your Big Mama. Do it for your Pop Pop,"" Dr Adams said. He later advised all Americans to avoid alcohol, tobacco and drugs.

Officials there say the island, which has been used to bury people with no next of kin for over 150 years, is now burying bodies at five times the normal rate. Earlier in the day, Dr Fauci told CNN that officials are currently discussing whether to adopt immunity certificates for Americans who have safely survived the coronavirus and have antibodies in their blood to prove it. The certificates might ""have some merit under certain circumstances"", he said, adding that antibody tests would be available next week.
