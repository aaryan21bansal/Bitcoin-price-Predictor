"Companies that use high-pressure or bullying tactics to sell funeral plans could face fines and criminal charges, the government says. The Treasury has announced proposals to regulate UK funeral providers through the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), offering protection to customers. Evidence shows some providers have used misleading sales tactics, costing vulnerable customers up to Â£5,000. In 2018 about 177,000 pre-paid funeral plans were sold. A spokesperson for the Treasury said there were ""widespread concerns around the conduct of funeral providers"" and the sales tactics used to ""get customers to sign up to plans"". Providers breaching the regulations could also have their authorisation revoked. A consultation on the proposals is now taking place. City minister John Glen said: ""It's shameful that there are those out there who look to prey on people when they are in this often emotional and vulnerable state. ""That's why I've taken the decision to regulate pre-paid funeral plans, so people can have more confidence in the products they're being offered and peace of mind that their affairs will be handled correctly."" The funeral plan industry has grown nearly 200% between 2006 and 2018. It comes as the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) saidessential costs of a funeral have increased by 6% each year,for the last 14 years. Currently funeral plan providers can sign up to an industry regulator voluntarily - so firms can also choose not to sign up to the rules. Under the proposals the FCA would oversee regulation of the sector, and customers would have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Funeral Service provider Dignity welcomed the call for greater regulation, saying it would ""protect consumers from misleading advertising and aggressive sales methods"".

"One raccoon dog was photographed during a confrontation with farm animals Two escaped raccoon dogs that were said to be ""terrorising"" residents have been caught and returned to their owner.

"Sir Elton has previously criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""ridiculous"" attitude to gay rights. Sir Elton John has criticised a Russian film company's decision to cut gay sex scenes from his new biopic Rocketman.

Sir Elton has previously spoken out against Russian laws banning ""gay propaganda"". Elton falls short of Freddie at box office Elton John's best movie moments Russian jails drop yoga ban In a statement shared on his Twitter page late on Friday, he described the censorship of Rocketman as a ""sad reflection of the divided world we still live in and how it can still be so cruelly unaccepting of the love between two people.""

Analysis by Ben Hunte, BBC News, LGBT correspondent We have seen all of this before. The same discussions were had around Bohemian Rhapsody, which was released last year. The film was accused of employing ""straight washing"" and ""queer-erasure"" for international marketability, as Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury portrayal was not out-and-proud about his sexuality. It also happened with Disney's Beauty and the Beast, which almost had a gay moment removed for release in certain markets. Even Eurovision was dragged into the discussion last year, when a Chinese broadcaster censored LGBT elements of the competition. LGBT censorship is happening all over the world. Elton John has long been a gay icon and he is easily one of the world's most well-known activists. Ultimately, this is a film about his life, and people know who he is and what he stands for. Even with some of the most revealing gay scenes being removed from the movie, for many people, his story being told globally in biopic form will still be seen as groundbreaking. Rocketman tells the story of the popular musician's rise to fame. It includes a male sex scene and a photograph in the closing credits of Sir Elton, 72, and his real-life husband. This video can not be played Rocketman is a musical film about Sir Elton John's career and how he broke into the industry After watching the film during an early screening in Moscow, local journalists and critics reported that an estimated five minutes had been removed.

Another journalist who attended the screening, Misha Kozyrev,said scenes depicting drug use had also been removed.,external A spokesman for local film distributor Central Partnership confirmed that it had altered the film,telling Tass it had done so to comply with Russian laws.,external Olga Lyubimova, head of the Culture Ministry's cinema department, told the news agency that no specific demands had been put on the distributor to change the film. ""You know perfectly well that numerous Western and Russian films are related to the problem of drug use... it would be wrong to say that we are engaging in any form of censorship,"" she said. However, she added that films are expected comply with Russian laws on ""paedophilia, ethnic and religious hatred and pornography."" Speaking to the BBC in 2015, Sir Elton criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""ridiculous"" attitude to gay rights. He said he wanted to meet with Mr Putin to discuss the issue.

"This video can not be played Scotland's Flow Country is critical in fighting climate change The Flow Country is a beautiful but precarious habitat which is critical in the fight against the effects of climate change. It is widely considered to be the largest area of blanket bog in the world and acts as a giant carbon sink, soaking up huge amounts of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Dark and dappled, the landscape is of great interest to scientists and more recently to artists, who want to raise awareness of this remarkable place. At first glance the massive expanse of moorland stretching across Caithness and Sutherland appears featureless but, if you stop and listen, it is teeming with life. A skylark shimmers towards the heavens, its song spiralling out over the bog. Tadpoles wiggle in peaty water underneath the shadows of skittering pond skaters. The wind rushes over sphagnum moss and shakes the spiky, sticky sundew, which is slowly digesting the insects it has snared. At first glance the landscape looks featureless ""Underneath our feet in the flow country there is an estimated 400 million tonnes of carbon,"" says Dr Roxane Andersen of the Environmental Research Institute at the University of the Highlands and Islands. That amounts to three times as much carbon than is contained in all the trees in the UK, calculates Dr Andersen, who worries that the bog's role as a carbon sink is under threat. It is though hard to feel a sense of urgency when you stand in the midst of this wild and beguiling country, which stretches for some 1,500 square miles (4,000 sq km) across the far north of the Scottish mainland. Standing amidst the black pools, Kathy Hinde is in her element. Kathy Hinde uses a hydrophone to record sounds from the bog Wearing a gentle smile and bedecked with headphones, sound mixer and huge fluffy microphone, Ms Hinde, who describes herself as a visual artist and composer, is capturing it all. ""What I'm really passionate about is trying to connect people with the natural world,"" says Ms Hinde, who is one of five artists from the Glasgow art house Cryptic who have been working here on the RSPB's Forsinard Flows nature reserve, preparing for a show at this summer's Edinburgh Fringe. ""I've got underwater microphones that I can throw into the bog pools and have a listen. I've also got those hydrophones I can bury into the squelching bog,"" explains Ms Hinde. What does she hear? Aquatic insects such as water boatmen make clicking and popping sounds, she says, while some underwater invertebrates produce ""electronic sounding chirps"" and others undulate like synthesisers. Sundew traps and digests insects The soundscapes which Ms Hinde will produce from her recordings here, along with a water-powered musical sculpture, will be staged in Edinburgh's Royal Botanic Garden along with installations from the other artists. Sculptures created by Heather Lander will house microhabitats made of ceramics, ink, paper and paintings. Visual artist Hannah Imlach will present images referencing the scientific instruments used on the bog. Luci Holland and Matthew Olden will produce soundscapes inspired by natural audio and scientific data gathered here. On top of these installations the show, entitled Below the Blanket, will feature the premiere of a choral work composed by Malcolm Lindsay and sung by the Dunedin Consort, a baroque ensemble. The entire project aims to highlight the importance of a habitat which is often forgotten and which has been neglected in the past. As well as artists and wildlife, the bog is also swarming with scientists. Between 2015 and 2017 there were 13 doctorates written about it, with much of that research focusing on climate change. The area has been put forward for world heritage status An outstanding application for World Heritage Status by the UK government in 2012,describes the Flow Country as ""the largest area of blanket bog in the world"",external. ""The peat is composed of not-quite-rotted-away remains of plants -and plants, when they're growing, take in carbon through photosynthesis. So that's holding carbon in the peat,"" explains Caroline Eccles of the RSPB and the Peatlands Partnership, a group which brings together government agencies, charities and educational establishments. The RSPB's Caroline Eccles wants to bring the delights of the Flow Country to a wider audience. Crouching down she points out the most important plant in this process, the spongy, springy, multi-coloured sphagnum moss. Not for nothing is it nicknamed the bog builder. Ms Eccles says she is thrilled to be involved with the fringe show, which she thinks will bring the delights of the flow country to a wider audience. ""We're hoping that it gives new insights and new ways of looking at the landscape,"" she says. Sphagnum moss is known as the bog builder It will be educational too. Dr Andersen says spreading awareness of the bog's importance in tackling climate change is vital, especially given the history of what many scientists regard as ill-judged political decisions which hampered that effort. In the 1980s celebrities such as the late broadcaster Sir Terry Wogan and snooker player Steve Davis were encouraged byMargaret Thatcher's Conservative government to write off earnings against tax by investing in tree plantations on the bog,external. As the money poured in, hundreds of thousands of non-native species were planted with the aim of creating jobs and boosting forestry. Dr Roxane Andersen says forestry schemes damaged the bog's ability to store carbon dioxide The scheme was not a success says Dr Andersen. In fact she has published evidence that it seriously damaged the bog's ability to store carbon dioxide. Disturbing the peatlands, whether by planting trees then or by the threat of drainage and evaporation as temperatures rise now, risks the loss of carbon ""at a much faster rate than it's been accumulated,"" she warns. ""Effectively it could fuel climate change rather than mitigate it,"" she says. Aware of that risk, the RSPB has been leading efforts to clear the forest and return the bog to pristine condition. The RSPB has built a field centre and observation tower at Forsinard The charity's work and its decision to build a field centre and observation tower at Forsinard, some 15 miles from the northern tip of Great Britain, has at times attracted controversy. Fading graffiti on a large shed near the centre reads ""No to RSPB plans"". The RSPB insists that since the tower opened in 2015 opposition has faded. Now conservationists are working not just to fell trees but to raise the water level by damming forestry drains and furrows. They were encouraged by research recently published by Dr Andersen which concluded that, with carefully-managed deforestation, the bog can return to its natural state as a carbon sink within about 15 years. The aftermath of the wildfire on an area of Forsinard Flows Still, Dr Andersen frets that a drought which hit the area last summer - there have even been serious wildfires here - is a harbinger of what is to come, drying out the peatland in spite of the efforts to preserve it. ""That could be really serious,"" she says, stressing the urgency and importance of the conservation work on the moorlands or mires as they are also known. ""If we can get them to be in the state where they can be wet and have the right type of vegetation again then they might be much more resilient to these droughts and changes in climate pattern,"" says Dr Andersen. Succeeding, she says, is ""absolutely critical"".

"Laurie McAllister said giving up booze gave her clarity on what she wanted and helped her to buy her own home A blogger has told how giving up alcohol for good has helped her to buy her own three-bedroom house. Laurie McAllister, 28, said one month she spent Â£1,000 just on going out, and that her lifestyle in London left her ""struggling with anxiety"". In 2016, while in bed with a hangover, she decided she was ""done"" and started saving to buy a new home in Norfolk. ""There is no way if I hadn't stopped drinking that I would have this house,"" she said. While living in London, Ms McAllister said she would splurge on going out to meet friends and getting taxis home. She would also spend lots on food as she was too tired to take lunch into work the following day. ""I wasn't very happy - I was drinking a lot, going out a lot and not having the best time,"" said Ms McAllister. ""I hated how I felt the next day. ""I hated the times I drank a lot and couldn't remember anything. ""Nights that started well, all dressed up and surrounded by my best friends would end in an argument, regrettable texts or a blackout not remembering how I got home."" Laurie McAllister celebrated her birthday in her new home in Wymondham which she moved in to in March She said although friends would have said she did not have a problem, her alcohol intake was ""bad enough for me to change"". ""I was struggling with anxiety and drinking was exacerbating that,"" she said. ""The final time I drank wasn't a big night out, but I woke up feeling like rubbish and thought, 'I'm done here'."" Laurie McAllister five days after going teetotal in December 2016 That day, she launched herblog Girl and Tonic,external, and wrote about the challenge of remembering she did not need to drink to have fun. Stopping drinking gave her ""clarity"", and she soon also noticed a financial benefit. It's hard being young and sober Binge Drinking: Face the Consequences Does Dry January lead to binge-drinking February? ""I saw quite quickly that I was saving money,"" she said. ""I opened an ISA and put in what I had left over every month, then when I realised I was near [being able to get a deposit] I put in a bit extra."" She said she could have stayed sober in London, but liked the slower pace of life and the countryside where she grew up in Norfolk. Ms McAllister said her blog keeps her ""accountable and sober"" After initially moving back, she lived with her parents for six months before renting a house with her brother. She continued working full-time for a digital marketing agency, but also started teaching yoga. Her family had been really understanding, she said. ""They support my decision to be the happiest person I can be. It's been lovely to have their support and live closer to them."" Ms McAllister later moved back to her home county of Norfolk, and saved Â£10,000 in the first 18 months. She bought her home in Wymondham, near Norwich, two months ago. Ms McAllister said although she did not have particularly strong willpower, she helped maintain her resolve by taking up new habits such as reading and getting a dog. ""I do have a quieter life, but I've got a job I like, I love teaching yoga and I walk my dogs every day. ""I'm in a good financial situation and no longer paying rent."" Ms McAllister shares her new home with a lodger and two miniature dachshunds including Margot (pictured) She said it had also been crucial to tell friends ahead of social events that she would not drink. ""The narrative for me was, 'You're a weirdo if you don't drink' - it wasn't friends saying that but more of a culture. ""I don't really regret anything, but I do look back and think how many nights would have been exactly as fun if I hadn't been drinking. ""I think if people choose to stop, they will also save money. ""I spent it on a house, but I have sober friends who have spent it on travelling. ""For me it's all about choice - you can still be a happy normal person without the booze.""

"Frank Lucas, the notorious Harlem drug lord whose life inspired the 2007 film American Gangster, has died. Born in North Carolina in 1930, he moved to New York where he became a prolific heroin trafficker throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1976 he was sentenced to decades in prison, but later provided evidence to police and was freed after five years. A family member told US media he died from natural causes, aged 88, on Thursday in New Jersey. Lucas, who imported heroin directly from South-East Asia, was known for his lavish lifestyle. In 1975 he had his assets and property seized by police. At one New Jersey address, authorities reportedly found more than $584,000 (Â£462,000) in cash. After his co-operation helped police arrest others in the trade, Lucas had his jail-time radically reduced. Despite returning again to prison for another drug conviction in the 1980s, he had been free for almost 30 years before his death. The film about his life starred actors Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe Notably, he formed a friendship with one of the narcotics agents who had helped arrest him - Richard Roberts. Reflecting on their unusual bond,Roberts told local news website NJ.com he had expected Lucas to ""live forever"".,external Lucas' life story was adapted, and embellished, for the big screen by director Ridley Scott. Actor Denzel Washington played Lucas - who helped out with production. Doubts have since been cast on many details portrayed within the film, such as the smuggling of drugs inside returning Vietnam war coffins. In 2012 Lucas had a final brush with the law. He was given probation after reportedly lying over federal disability payments. Celebrity news website TMZ reports that he is survived by seven children.

"Private Jim Glennie, now 93, was shot in the invasion and became a prisoner of war About 300 D-Day veterans are beginning their pilgrimage to France to mark the 75th anniversary of the Normandy landings. Six Scottish D-Day veterans - all now in their 90s - have shared their stories and been photographed by Legion Scotland and Poppyscotland. You can use the slider on each of the images below to compare how the veterans looked in World War Two and the new portraits of the men who served. If you are using the mobile app, click on each image to view the slider. Mr Churm, from Castle Douglas in Dumfries and Galloway, was a medic on landing craft on D-Day, moving tanks from Newhaven in Sussex to Sword Beach, one of the five landing areas for the Allied invasion. The 94-year-old says: ""My overriding feeling was one of terrible trepidation. Nobody knew what was happening until we got there. The amount of shipping in the Channel was fantastic, though, every type of vessel you could think of was there."" After the war, Mr Churm became a physiotherapist, including a stint as the physio at Blackburn Rovers. Private Glennie is now 93 and living in Aberdeen. He landed at Sword Beach with the Gordon Highlanders, part of the 51st Highland Division. Not long after, he was shot, wounded, captured and spent the rest of the war in POW camp Stalag 4b. He said: ""The overriding thing I remember from being a prisoner of war was the lack of food. We had to steal potato skins from the guards' bin. It amazes me now when I am out for dinner with my family and they order potato skins."" The 94-year-old, from North Lanarkshire, spent more than three months in France during the conflict. He said: ""We were just doing a job and we did what we got told to do. We didn't see ourselves as heroes. ""I always wonder what the French people thought that morning when they woke up and saw all of the ships."" After the war, Mr Gregson became a cooper. Sgt McOwan, from Peebles, was an instrument mechanic servicing repairs as required. The 98-year-old, who served in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical engineers attached to the 8th Army, said: ""My most vivid memory was the Armada of ships lying off-shore. They stretched for as far as the eye could see. ""We waited for what seemed like an interminable amount of time before we could go on shore. We felt like easy targets for the Luftwaffe. ""A couple of ships were hit, and we just hoped and prayed that ours would not be one of the next ones. For some reason, I remember that I did not even get my feet wet when we eventually came on shore as we were on landing craft vehicles."" Mr Horne, from Port Seton in East Lothian, served on board a minesweeper alongside American forces. He said: ""We were the first Allied vessels to arrive, before the D-Day landings. We got some cover from the American warships firing over our heads towards the German placements. ""The noise was deafening. After it started, the shelling went on day and night and we never got any sleep. ""I later heard that 2,000 men were killed on Omaha Beach that morning, so, I do feel lucky that I was one of the ones that came home. During the operation, a minesweeper the same as ours was hit and sank in five minutes."" After the war, Mr Horne returned to life as a fisherman. Sergeant Forsyth, from Hamilton in South Lanarkshire is now 95. In 1944 he was a driver/operator working on reconnaissance for armoured division. He recalls: ""When I first went abroad I, like a lot of others of my age group, thought they were going to change the world, that is what we were going to fight for. ""Unfortunately, that quickly changed to fighting for our own survival, and that was difficult enough, until we arrived at the gates of Belsen. ""That woke us up to realise the depths to which a man can sink, and why we were really there."" After the war, Mr Forsyth became a teacher. Portraits by Wattie Cheung for Poppyscotland.

"The 2019 Champions League final is almost here and while there are still plenty of unknowns to discover, there are also lots of things which are pretty much certain to happen. So, at the end of a season in which so much has been unexpected, let's take a look at some elements of this Tottenham v Liverpool meeting that are comfortingly predictable. Sadio Mane will compete in the Africa Cup of Nations this summer Twelve months ago, Liverpool's build-up to their Champions League final against Real Madrid was dominated by the importance of Mohamed Salah to their chances and,given his team's struggles after he went off injured,rightly so. Now, of the Reds' enviable front three, Sadio Mane has arguably become the key figure. He shared thePremier League's Golden Bootwith Salah and Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but take away penalties and Mane would have been three clear of any other player. The Senegal forward scored Liverpool's only goal in the 2018 final and if he nets against Spurs he will be the first player to score in the final in consecutive years since Franz Roth for Bayern Munich in 1975 and 1976. He comes alive in the knockout stages, with 71% of his Champions League goals coming after the groups - the highest proportion of any player with 10 or more - and his expected goals total of 7.8 (excluding penalties) in this season's tournament is exactly 2.0 higher than any other player in 2018-19 and only 1.1 lower than Manchester United managed in their entire European campaign. Sadio Mane has scored four goals from 24 shots in the Champions League this season. His expected goals total of 7.8 means he should actually have had twice that amount based on the quality of the chances he has had, but it does at least show he is finding himself in excellent scoring positions. As a result, all the signs point to Mane being the most important figure in the match... except one. The man who has scored 80% of his Premier League goals within two miles of the English coast has to perform in a Champions League final being staged in one of the only major European cities not built by a river or a seafront. Will he sink or swim? Harry Kane is in contention to start for Tottenham after recovering from injury Talking of penalties, this will be the first Champions League final to get the luxury VAR (video assistant referee) experience, with the added bonus that it features the teams whose Premier League meetings have produced more spot-kicks (22) than any other fixture. Will the remote referees serve up some 12-yard drama? If they do, then Spurs and Liverpool - in Harry Kane and James Milner - have some of the coolest men in the business, with only six failures between them from 42 attempts in the Premier League and Champions League combined. It's why the rest of the world envies England's penalty technique... Whoever wins the 2019 Champions League, it will go down as an outlier of an edition. It's the first final between two non-group winners since 2010, the first not to feature a team who has actually won their domestic league title in the 21st Century (Liverpool and Spurs' combined league drought of 87 years seems, and is, a lot), and we know that the winning side will end the season with four defeats, a new record for the Champions League in its current format. Manchester United, in 2007-08, remain the most recent team tobecome European champions,externalwithout losing a game, while AC Milan's poor record - at first glance at least - of three defeats in 2006-07 was skewed by losses in their final two group games when the section was won. Liverpool and Tottenham's progress through the group stage was anything but serene, with the Reds losing all three of their away games in the autumn and Tottenham virtually eliminated three matches into their 'group of death', which also included Barcelona, Inter Milan and PSV. They scraped through with a negative goal difference and six months later are one game from immortality. Whoever wins, they will have underlined how unpredictable this season, and the Champions League in general, has become.

"This video can not be played ""We had to pay Â£2,000 to move in"" A ban on ""unfair"" fees charged by lettings agents to tenants in England has started, two-and-a-half years after the plan was first announced. It means tenants will no longer face fees for services including viewings, credit checks, references and setting up a tenancy. Citizens Advice claims people renting privately in England have collectively been paying Â£13m a month in these fees. Landlords say rents could rise and choice fall as a result of the ban. The ban in England was first announced by Chancellor Philip Hammond in November 2016, when the government said it would become law ""as soon as possible"". The detail of the new rules have been fiercely debated by all sides ever since. Can a landlord kick me out? Agency 'locking out tenants and taking belongings' ""The new law means families and other renters don't have to hand over hundreds of pounds every time they move home,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive at Citizens Advice. A ban has been in place in Scotland since 2012, while Wales is set to implementits own rulesin September, but the picture is more complicated in Northern Ireland, where a potential ban requires a sitting assembly to pass it. It has been the case that England's five million private tenants faced various unavoidable fees every time they moved or renewed a tenancy. With renting becoming more widespread,including among middle-aged people, more people were caught up by these mostly upfront costs. The level of fees had to be clearly displayed but varied significantly, with tenants in big cities facing the highest charges. Typically, this cost tenants Â£200 to Â£300 each time, although campaigners claimed the average was higher. Fees may have been charged for administration, references from tenants' employers, inventory checks and so on. Agents, and ultimately landlords, will now have to pick up the cost of this work for new and renewed tenancies under the Tenant Fees Act. The new rules prevent them from simply charging a higher rent for the first month to cover the cost. But Hannah Slater, from lobby group Generation Rent, said that moving house would still be expensive. So-called deposit alternative products - which include a fee - could end up being expensive for tenants, she added. Kirsty McDermott has been forced to move twice when her landlords have sold up, and with each move has come the extra fees. The 22-year-old hotel receptionist from Coventry said her landlords had been good, but the upfront charges had been a challenge. ""We saved up, but it was painful to hear that we had to pay Â£2,000 to move in,"" she said, recalling the rent, deposit and fees. ""For young people, there is a lot of money pressure anyway. It was disappointing because it could have been money we could have put towards our own place."" The new rules, she said, meant the money she would have paid in her next move could be put towards her future. Many young adults have had the same experience. Charlotte Von Crease, a 27-year-old renter,recently told the BBC: ""When we moved into our last property, we were hit with nearly Â£3,500 worth of fees before we even got the keys."" The new law does not mean tenants will not have to pay any upfront fees at all. They will still be expected to pay the first month's rent, and a deposit. Following debate, the government settled on a rule that means security deposits will be limited to five weeks' worth of rent for properties costing less than Â£50,000 annually to rent, or six weeks for higher-value renting. Holding deposits are capped at one week's rent. Additionally, there can be a charge for a lost key replacement, at close to the cost to the landlords themselves. If rent is outstanding for more than 14 days, then agencies can impose a penalty limited to 3% higher than the Bank of England's base rate, which is 0.75% at present. There might also be a fee of about Â£50 if a tenant requests a change to the tenancy, and also one if a tenant wants to leave the contract early. Those who signed a tenancy agreement before 1 June may still face fees in their contract for the next 12 months, including renewal fees. An impact assessment from the government last year suggested the first year of the policy would collectively cost landlords nearly Â£83m, while letting agents would take a hit of Â£157m. An agents' trade body has described the new law as ""the biggest change to hit the lettings industry in decades"". Leona Leung says some landlords may leave the sector Leona Leung, a landlord and lettings agency manager, said that agents would have to cover their cost and pass this on to the landlords. This could then be handed on to tenants in higher rent. Housing charity Shelter argued that experience from the ban in Scotland suggested otherwise, saying that rises in rent had been ""small and short-lived"", despite expectations that rents would increase. Ms Leung said that other tax changes, such as the Insurance Premium Tax, had hit landlords - meaning that they were already facing tough cost pressures. All but the biggest companies could decide to self-manage their property or sell up. ""Many landlords will be asking whether it is a feasible business."" she said. ""The small landlords and local agents could be out of the business very soon. It is a loss for everyone - tenants, landlords and agents."" Many agents are unhappy that they are facing higher costs as a result of overcharging by the unscrupulous few in the past. This is a matter of debate, as the cost of renting a property has been rising on average in the UK. The lower upfront costs will be a benefit, but there remains stiff competition for good-quality rented homes in some parts of the UK. Housing organisations recommend spending no more than 30% of your salary on rent. The average rent of a 1-bedroom home exceeds this for twenty-somethings in two-thirds of Britain.    High demand could push up the cost of renting in these areas, irrespective of the one-off costs they may save on now. Many tenants have also seen their wages remain relatively stagnant in recent years, although this has started to pick up.

"Private Jim Glennie, now 93, was shot in the invasion and became a prisoner of war About 300 D-Day veterans are beginning their pilgrimage to France to mark the 75th anniversary of the Normandy landings. Six Scottish D-Day veterans - all now in their 90s - have shared their stories and been photographed by Legion Scotland and Poppyscotland. You can use the slider on each of the images below to compare how the veterans looked in World War Two and the new portraits of the men who served. If you are using the mobile app, click on each image to view the slider. Mr Churm, from Castle Douglas in Dumfries and Galloway, was a medic on landing craft on D-Day, moving tanks from Newhaven in Sussex to Sword Beach, one of the five landing areas for the Allied invasion. The 94-year-old says: ""My overriding feeling was one of terrible trepidation. Nobody knew what was happening until we got there. The amount of shipping in the Channel was fantastic, though, every type of vessel you could think of was there."" After the war, Mr Churm became a physiotherapist, including a stint as the physio at Blackburn Rovers. Private Glennie is now 93 and living in Aberdeen. He landed at Sword Beach with the Gordon Highlanders, part of the 51st Highland Division. Not long after, he was shot, wounded, captured and spent the rest of the war in POW camp Stalag 4b. He said: ""The overriding thing I remember from being a prisoner of war was the lack of food. We had to steal potato skins from the guards' bin. It amazes me now when I am out for dinner with my family and they order potato skins."" The 94-year-old, from North Lanarkshire, spent more than three months in France during the conflict. He said: ""We were just doing a job and we did what we got told to do. We didn't see ourselves as heroes. ""I always wonder what the French people thought that morning when they woke up and saw all of the ships."" After the war, Mr Gregson became a cooper. Sgt McOwan, from Peebles, was an instrument mechanic servicing repairs as required. The 98-year-old, who served in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical engineers attached to the 8th Army, said: ""My most vivid memory was the Armada of ships lying off-shore. They stretched for as far as the eye could see. ""We waited for what seemed like an interminable amount of time before we could go on shore. We felt like easy targets for the Luftwaffe. ""A couple of ships were hit, and we just hoped and prayed that ours would not be one of the next ones. For some reason, I remember that I did not even get my feet wet when we eventually came on shore as we were on landing craft vehicles."" Mr Horne, from Port Seton in East Lothian, served on board a minesweeper alongside American forces. He said: ""We were the first Allied vessels to arrive, before the D-Day landings. We got some cover from the American warships firing over our heads towards the German placements. ""The noise was deafening. After it started, the shelling went on day and night and we never got any sleep. ""I later heard that 2,000 men were killed on Omaha Beach that morning, so, I do feel lucky that I was one of the ones that came home. During the operation, a minesweeper the same as ours was hit and sank in five minutes."" After the war, Mr Horne returned to life as a fisherman. Sergeant Forsyth, from Hamilton in South Lanarkshire is now 95. In 1944 he was a driver/operator working on reconnaissance for armoured division. He recalls: ""When I first went abroad I, like a lot of others of my age group, thought they were going to change the world, that is what we were going to fight for. ""Unfortunately, that quickly changed to fighting for our own survival, and that was difficult enough, until we arrived at the gates of Belsen. ""That woke us up to realise the depths to which a man can sink, and why we were really there."" After the war, Mr Forsyth became a teacher. Portraits by Wattie Cheung for Poppyscotland.

"Sir Elton has previously criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""ridiculous"" attitude to gay rights. Sir Elton John has criticised a Russian film company's decision to cut gay sex scenes from his new biopic Rocketman. The local film distributor told state news agency Tass it cut scenes from the film to comply with Russian laws. The British singer and the makers of Rocketman issued a statement saying they rejected the censorship ""in the strongest possible terms"". Sir Elton has previously spoken out against Russian laws banning ""gay propaganda"". Elton falls short of Freddie at box office Elton John's best movie moments Russian jails drop yoga ban In a statement shared on his Twitter page late on Friday, he described the censorship of Rocketman as a ""sad reflection of the divided world we still live in and how it can still be so cruelly unaccepting of the love between two people.""

Analysis by Ben Hunte, BBC News, LGBT correspondent We have seen all of this before. The same discussions were had around Bohemian Rhapsody, which was released last year. The film was accused of employing ""straight washing"" and ""queer-erasure"" for international marketability, as Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury portrayal was not out-and-proud about his sexuality. It also happened with Disney's Beauty and the Beast, which almost had a gay moment removed for release in certain markets. Even Eurovision was dragged into the discussion last year, when a Chinese broadcaster censored LGBT elements of the competition. LGBT censorship is happening all over the world. Elton John has long been a gay icon and he is easily one of the world's most well-known activists. Ultimately, this is a film about his life, and people know who he is and what he stands for. Even with some of the most revealing gay scenes being removed from the movie, for many people, his story being told globally in biopic form will still be seen as groundbreaking. Rocketman tells the story of the popular musician's rise to fame. It includes a male sex scene and a photograph in the closing credits of Sir Elton, 72, and his real-life husband. This video can not be played Rocketman is a musical film about Sir Elton John's career and how he broke into the industry After watching the film during an early screening in Moscow, local journalists and critics reported that an estimated five minutes had been removed.

""You know perfectly well that numerous Western and Russian films are related to the problem of drug use... it would be wrong to say that we are engaging in any form of censorship,"" she said. However, she added that films are expected comply with Russian laws on ""paedophilia, ethnic and religious hatred and pornography.""

"Laurie McAllister said giving up booze gave her clarity on what she wanted and helped her to buy her own home A blogger has told how giving up alcohol for good has helped her to buy her own three-bedroom house. Laurie McAllister, 28, said one month she spent Â£1,000 just on going out, and that her lifestyle in London left her ""struggling with anxiety"". In 2016, while in bed with a hangover, she decided she was ""done"" and started saving to buy a new home in Norfolk. ""There is no way if I hadn't stopped drinking that I would have this house,"" she said. While living in London, Ms McAllister said she would splurge on going out to meet friends and getting taxis home. She would also spend lots on food as she was too tired to take lunch into work the following day. ""I wasn't very happy - I was drinking a lot, going out a lot and not having the best time,"" said Ms McAllister. ""I hated how I felt the next day. ""I hated the times I drank a lot and couldn't remember anything. ""Nights that started well, all dressed up and surrounded by my best friends would end in an argument, regrettable texts or a blackout not remembering how I got home."" Laurie McAllister celebrated her birthday in her new home in Wymondham which she moved in to in March She said although friends would have said she did not have a problem, her alcohol intake was ""bad enough for me to change"". ""I was struggling with anxiety and drinking was exacerbating that,"" she said. ""The final time I drank wasn't a big night out, but I woke up feeling like rubbish and thought, 'I'm done here'."" Laurie McAllister five days after going teetotal in December 2016 That day, she launched herblog Girl and Tonic,external, and wrote about the challenge of remembering she did not need to drink to have fun. Stopping drinking gave her ""clarity"", and she soon also noticed a financial benefit. It's hard being young and sober Binge Drinking: Face the Consequences Does Dry January lead to binge-drinking February? ""I saw quite quickly that I was saving money,"" she said. ""I opened an ISA and put in what I had left over every month, then when I realised I was near [being able to get a deposit] I put in a bit extra."" She said she could have stayed sober in London, but liked the slower pace of life and the countryside where she grew up in Norfolk. Ms McAllister said her blog keeps her ""accountable and sober"" After initially moving back, she lived with her parents for six months before renting a house with her brother. She continued working full-time for a digital marketing agency, but also started teaching yoga. Her family had been really understanding, she said. ""They support my decision to be the happiest person I can be. It's been lovely to have their support and live closer to them."" Ms McAllister later moved back to her home county of Norfolk, and saved Â£10,000 in the first 18 months. She bought her home in Wymondham, near Norwich, two months ago. Ms McAllister said although she did not have particularly strong willpower, she helped maintain her resolve by taking up new habits such as reading and getting a dog. ""I do have a quieter life, but I've got a job I like, I love teaching yoga and I walk my dogs every day. ""I'm in a good financial situation and no longer paying rent."" Ms McAllister shares her new home with a lodger and two miniature dachshunds including Margot (pictured) She said it had also been crucial to tell friends ahead of social events that she would not drink. ""The narrative for me was, 'You're a weirdo if you don't drink' - it wasn't friends saying that but more of a culture. ""I don't really regret anything, but I do look back and think how many nights would have been exactly as fun if I hadn't been drinking. ""I think if people choose to stop, they will also save money. ""I spent it on a house, but I have sober friends who have spent it on travelling. ""For me it's all about choice - you can still be a happy normal person without the booze.""

"This video can not be played CCTV captures the moment hundreds of migrants cross into the US Mexico's president has insisted his government will not be provoked, after President Donald Trump announced escalating tariffs on all goods unless Mexico curbed illegal migration. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador described Mr Trump's slogan ""America First"" as a fallacy and said universal justice was more important than borders. Stock markets saw sharp lossesfollowing Mr Trump's announcement. Mr Trump declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border in February. He said it was necessary in order to tackle what he claimed was a crisis with thousands of undocumented migrants crossing the US southern frontier. Threat of Mexico trade war sends markets lower The butterflies that could stop Trumpâs wall Trump's border wall - in seven charts Mr Trump's latest statement came a day after US border authorities in El Paso, Texas, detained a group of more than 1,000 migrants - the largest single group agents had ever encountered. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Friday that Mexico could have done more to stop the group - and others - as they travelled through the country. ""They could have easily broken up this group, arrested them or sent them back home, and they didn't do anything,"" she told reporters. ""We're asking Mexico to enforce their own laws to help stop the people coming in from Central America."" The migrants caught on Wednesday came from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador and included entire families, agents said In tweets later on Friday, President Trump said the tariffs were also to encourage Mexico to ""take back"" the country from drugs cartels.

The president said he had ordered his foreign minister to travel to Washington on Friday. ""I want to insist that we are not going to fall into any provocations, that we are going to act prudently with respect to the authorities of the United States [and] with respect to President Donald Trump,"" he said. In a letter to his US counterpart, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador said Mexico was complying with its responsibility to avoid ""as far as possible and without violating human rights, the passage [of migrants] through our country"". AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said social problems could not be resolved with tariffs ""President Trump: Social problems are not resolved with tariffs or coercive measures,"" he added. ""With all due respect, although you have the sovereign right to express this, the slogan 'United States [America] First' is a fallacy because, until the end of time, and even over and above national frontiers, universal justice and fraternity will prevail."" Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard confirmed on Twitter that he would lead a delegation to Washington, adding: ""The treatment of Mexico is unfair and does not make economic sense to anyone."" He later tweeted that a summit to resolve the dispute would be held in Washington on Wednesday, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo heading the US side. ""We will be firm and defend the dignity of Mexico,"" he said. The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents three million businesses in the US, condemned Mr Trump's plan. Chief policy officer Neil Bradley said the tariffs would ""be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border"". The Business Roundtable, a US body made of chief executives of major US corporations, said it would be ""a grave error"" and urged Mr Trump to reconsider.

President Trump's top trade adviserRobert Lighthizer had opposed the plan, the Wall Street Journal reported,external, also warning that the new trade deal could be affected. One source quoted by the paper said: ""Lighthizer is not happy."" The US president has long accused Mexico of not doing enough to stem the flow of people. Migrants, most of whom say they are fleeing violence in Central American countries, travel through Mexico on their way to the US, where they hope to claim asylum. In a White House statement,Mr Trump said the tariffs would rise by five percentage points each month,externaluntil 1 October, when the rate would reach 25%. The tariffs would stay at that level ""unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory"", he said. ""For years, Mexico has not treated us fairly - but we are now asserting our rights as a sovereign nation,"" the statement said. Allow Twitter content?

The president also took aim at his Democratic opponents, accusing them of a ""total dereliction of duty"" over border security. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is taking legal action to halt the Trump administration's efforts to build a border wall, saying it would be a waste of funds and would not stop illegal immigration.
