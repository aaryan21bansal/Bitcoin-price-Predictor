"Record numbers of GCSE passes mean extra pressure on sixth forms Colleges and sixth forms in England need an extra Â£570m to keep pace with the rising number of students, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The rise in numbers of older teenagers, and higher GCSE grades, is set to push up college numbers. The IFS says funding for 16-to-18 learning fell in real terms by 11% in colleges and 25% in schools since 2010. The government says it has announced an extra Â£291m for 2021-22 in addition to a Â£400m increase in the previous year. The IFS research says further education colleges and sixth forms in England have seen the largest falls in funding in the education sector over the past decade. Colleges' financial health 'fragile', say auditors Universities and colleges 'face cash shortfalls' Imran Tahir, research economist and co-author, said: ""These institutions now also face a plethora of additional challenges created by fast rises in student numbers and the need to help pupils catch up on lost learning."" The government gave the sector an extra Â£400m in 2020-21, a sum it described as ""the single biggest annual uplift since 2010"". But the IFS says with student numbers growing by 5% in 2020 alone, this restores funding back to 2018-19 levels, at best. The IFS calculates that an extra Â£570m will be needed in the 2022-23 academic year, just to keep funding per student at the level it was the previous year. Colleges and sixth forms will need even more money if they are to respond to the major long-term challenges they face, it says. These include helping students catch up on months of learning lost during the pandemic, and a projected rise in the number of 16 and 17-year-olds of 17% or 200,000 in England between 2019 and 2024. The researchers point out that the rate of 16 and 17-year-olds in full-time education had already risen to an historical high of 85% in 2020. This includes especially large rises in 2020 due to ""abnormally"" high GCSE results and reduced opportunities outside education during the pandemic, they say. Given that GCSE results were higher again in 2021, the researchers suggest there is likely to be a further jump in students. At the same time, the number of 16 and 17-year-olds doing apprenticeships fell to an all-time low of 3% in 2020 - with a 30% fall in numbers in 2020 alone. This reflects both the effects of the pandemic and a gradual reduction in take-up over the long term, according to the research. The chief executive of the Association of Colleges, David Hughes, said: ""There is an urgent need for the Department for Education to guarantee full funding for every student recruited by schools and colleges this autumn, much the same way they do for universities as well as seek a commitment in the Spending Review to a longer-term revenue and capital budget that anticipates demographic trends."" A Department for Education spokesman said:""Further education is playing a vital role in delivering the skills young people need to get ahead. So we can meet the needs of all 16-19-year-olds we've announced an extra Â£291m for 2021-22, in addition to the Â£400m increase in 2020-21. ""Funding for future years beyond 2021-22, including anticipated increases in the 16-19 population will be considered as part of the upcoming Spending Review.""

"Miles Routledge says he travelled to Afghanistan as he enjoys ""dark"" and ""extreme"" tourism A UK student who travelled to Afghanistan on holiday says he is now safe in Dubai after being evacuated. Miles Routledge, 21, of Birmingham, has been posting updates on social media about his travels since the Taliban seized control of the country. He told the BBC he was ""exhausted but relieved"" and thanked the British Army who were deployed to support the evacuation of UK nationals from Kabul. His university, Loughborough, said it had offered Mr Routledge its support. The physics student shared on social media he chose Afghanistan because he enjoyed ""dark"" and ""extreme"" tourism. Mr Routledge holidayed in Kabul, and posed next to a gun for a photo, despite warnings against all but essential travel to Afghanistan On Tuesday he told followers he had got a place on a list for evacuation from Kabul, and hours later posted a video of himself and dozens of others landing in what he described as a British Army plane. ""The happy ending: landed in Dubai thanks to the brilliant people at the British army. All safe!"" he wrote. The Ministry of Defence has been approached for comment on the claim. A Foreign & Commonwealth Office spokesperson said they were aware of Mr Routledge's case and had been working to ""offer assistance"". ""The safety of British nationals is our top priority which is why we have been urging British nationals to leave Afghanistan by commercial means since 21 April,"" the spokesperson said. ""On 6 August we updated our advice to urge British nationals to leave immediately and to update us on their plans for departure."" Mr Routledge has attracted criticism online from commentators who question his decision to travel to the country, where authorities have advised against all but essential travel for more than two decades. Striking image captures Afghan exodus Why is Kabul being compared to the fall of Saigon? Latest news from the West Midlands The physics student claims he was given refuge in a Nato-controlled building A friend of the student told the BBC she was not surprised by his decision to travel there, saying: ""If anyone I knew was going to go to Afghanistan, it would be him."" On Monday Mr Routledge told the PA news agency he and other civilians, including some other British citizens, had been given refuge in what he described as a Nato-controlled building in Kabul. A spokesman for Nato was unable to confirm his claim. It came amid chaotic scenes at the city's nearby airport, where hundreds of people attempted to board a US Air Force plane, with several plunging to their death as it took off. Mr Routledge has said on social media he does not regret his decision to travel to the country. Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Richard Fleetwood says the service has been a lifeline for some people Trials of shared banking hubs in two communities where all the branches have closed down are to be extended. The premises, managed by the Post Office, include counter services, ATMs and, crucially, the opportunity for local businesses to deposit cash. The trials, in Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, and Rochford, Essex, were due to finish in October, but have been extended to April 2023. The government is consulting on plans to protect community banking services. Cash access as vital as running water, says Age UK Plan for law to protect neighbourhood cash access The trials allow a member of staff from a different bank to come into the hub once a week to help with trickier transactions. Throughout the week, the counter service and machines allow individuals and small business owners to access accounts, and to withdraw and deposit notes and coins. Shortly after the service opened in Rochford,the BBC was told it had been ""a lifeline""for people living in the area. ""One lady came in to say 'thank you, you have changed my life', and that's not an understatement,"" said Richard Fleetwood, postmaster at the Rochford Bank Hub - a converted carpet shop. An estimated 12,000 people have used the hubs for basic banking needs. ""It is really clear that the hubs have been hugely popular and it would be a bad decision to close them. The banks have therefore taken the view that they want to keep them open, and keep innovating in them so we can refine the model further,"" said Natalie Ceeney, who oversees the trials. The trials are part of a wider project aiming to test ways to ensure people and businesses have access to cash. It also addresses the issue of bank branch closures, which are showing signs of accelerating as the UK emerges from the Covid crisis. Another element of the project to be extended is the prevalence of cashback without having to make a purchase in local stores. So far, an average of Â£28 has been withdrawn from tills, with shoppers often taking out non-round amounts unavailable from ATMs. Hundreds more shops should be offering the service by early next year. Banks are in discussion over many of these projects, including shared hubs, as the government plans to legislate on access to community banking as bank branches close. In their proposals, ministers said that people should not have to travel beyond a reasonable distance to withdraw or deposit money, even if they are in low population areas. Initially, the Treasury suggests that people should not have to travel more than 1km, but that distance could be extended over time if cash becomes less popular. The distance proposal is open to views during consultation. Other considerations include whether the facilities are appropriate for vulnerable people, are accessible for people with disabilities, have adequate opening hours, and are suitably secure for high-value cash deposits.

"Workers at a Home Depot store in Florida US DIY store chain the Home Depot discriminated against a Minneapolis employee for raising issues of racial harassment with colleagues and bosses, a federal watchdog has alleged. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)alleges the chain,externalalso stopped the employee from displaying a Black Lives Matter slogan on his apron. These actions are protected under law, the watchdog said. Home Depot said the complaint ""misrepresents the relevant facts"". ""The Home Depot does not tolerate workplace harassment of any kind and takes all reports of discrimination or harassment seriously, as we did in this case,"" said spokeswoman Sara Gorman. According to the complaint, filed by the Minneapolis office of the NRLB, the employee's actions, including his refusal to remove the BLM slogan, led to his constructive dismissal. It alleges the store unlawfully enforced its otherwise lawful dress code and apron policies. And it accused Home Depot of warning employees not to engage in ""activity regarding racial harassment"". Whole Foods in Black Lives Matter legal claim ""Issues of racial harassment directly impact the working conditions of employees,"" said NRLB regional director Jennifer Hadsall. ""The National Labor Relations Act protects employees' rights to raise these issues with the goal of improving their working conditions. It is this important right we seek to protect in this case."" The independent watchdog said it wanted Home Depot to post notice at all of its US stores advising employees of their rights. But the retailer said the NRLB had mischaracterised the situation and that it looked forward to ""sharing the facts"" with the watchdog. ""Regardless of the outcome, we will continue to be fully committed to diversity and respect for all people,"" Ms Gorman added. Last year, workers at Whole Foods sued the US supermarket for punishing them for wearing Black Lives Matter masks. The federal lawsuit said the firm discriminated against black staff by selectively enforcing its dress code. However, in February, a US District Judge threw out most of the lawsuit, saying Whole Foods and its parent, Amazon, had not engaged in racial discrimination or violated Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act - which specifically prohibits discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment. A number of the plaintiffs who were fired for not changing their dress code have appealed.

"Stephen Watson described the scheme as ""patronising nonsense"" A so-called Citizens' Contract outlining what people could expect from Greater Manchester Police has been torn up by the force's new chief constable. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham endorsed the move by Stephen Watson, who was appointed in May. Underthe scheme, the force implied not all crime could receive the same focus due to strained resources. Mr Watsontold the Manchester Evening News,externalthe contract was ""just complete tosh"" and had been ""scrapped"". He added: ""We just think it's patronising nonsense, which pretty much tells the public, you know, 'can you just stop troubling us because we're really busy and you just don't understand how hard it is for us'."" The Citizens Contract was introduced two-and-a-half years ago as a way of balancing squeezed police resources with increased public demand. The contract will now be replaced following a consultation. The Citizens' Contract was introduced under former chief constable Ian Hopkins When asked about the chief constable's remarks, Mr Burnham said: ""We are very much with the chief."" He said the head of the force had the right to put his ""stamp"" on the organisation and agreed with the idea that officers should be investigating all crime. The scheme saw Greater Manchester Police aim to limit people's expectations amid ongoing budget cuts. However, the document also stressed the public needed to do its bit, with the former chief constable appealing for ""help"". People were urged to use the appropriate numbers to contact the police, to share information and intelligence with them, and to work with their neighbours to create safer communities. In return, the force pledged to be upfront and honest about its priorities and demands. Mr Burnham said recent increases in recruitment would help the under-pressure force. Mr Watson succeeded Ian Hopkins, whostood down in Decemberfollowing a damning watchdog report which revealed the force hadfailed to properly record 80,000 crimes. In June he told how he""absolutely would not"" take the kneein uniform, believing the gesture could undermine officers' impartiality. He said the public were ""getting a little bit fed up of virtue-signalling police officers"" and would ""rather we just locked up burglars"". Mr Watson also said he was concerned police could be overwhelmed by the creation of new ""hate crimes"" which ""sought to criminalise what people think about difficult social issues, as opposed to what they do"".

"The Biden administration's rush for the exit in Afghanistan has been accompanied by a similar rush to judgement among pundits and commentators who, by and large, have castigated the US president for a decision that many see as unnecessary and a betrayal, both of those who served in Afghanistan and of the Afghan people themselves. The heartbreaking images from the airport in Kabul only reinforce this message. And there is justifiably a good deal of emotion to go round. The West has invested a lot of blood, time and money in Afghanistan. The Afghan people, much, much, more. It is hard to argue with the criticism of the Biden administration's precipitate departure. Afghanistan may indeed be un-salvageable, its governing structures too unrepresentative and corrupt. This though only underscores the argument that Afghanistan was not ""lost"" in the past two years but during the previous 20. Nonetheless the decision to cut and run is being seen as a terrible blow to US credibility - to its reliability as a partner, and indeed to its moral standing in world affairs. How does this square with Mr Biden's clarion cry on taking office, that America was back? Comparisons are being made with Vietnam- the similarities with helicopters shuttling US nationals away from a falling city being too much for the newspaper front-pages to resist. But in reality - despite the superficial similarities -there are some important differences, too. South Vietnam collapsed some two years after US troops left. Indeed it looks as though the Americans expected their Afghan allies to soldier on for a significant period without them. The US was humbled by Vietnam - its population deeply divided and its military morale damaged. But while Vietnam turned out to be a tragic side-show in the Cold War, the US still ultimately won that contest. Nato was not weakened. US allies around the globe did not shy away from expecting US support. The US remained the pre-eminent superpower. Afghanistan is altogether different. Internal divisions in the US over this conflict have in no way been comparable to Vietnam's. The Afghanistan mission was certainly unpopular at home but there were no mass rallies against it. This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'I stand squarely behind my decision' Crucially though, today's international context is dramatically different from that of the 1970s. The US - indeed the West in general - is engaged in multiple contests, in few of which they are outright winners. The Afghan collapse is potentially a disaster in the so-called war on terror. But in the wider conflict between democracy and authoritarianism, Washington's failure can only be seen as a serious set-back. There will be smiles in Moscow and Beijing, at least for now. The Western model of liberal interventionism - promoted as a means of spreading democracy and the rule of law - has perhaps been tested to destruction in Afghanistan. One cannot see much enthusiasm for similar undertakings in the future. Those of Washington's allies who joined in the Afghanistan project are smarting. They feel badly let down. Even British ministers, jealous of their oft touted ""special relationship"" with Washington, have been openly critical of President Biden's decision. Ten days that shook Afghanistan Biden's speech on Afghanistan fact-checked And for America's European allies in general, it underscores how dependent they are upon the US and how little their views count once the White House decides to go in one particular direction. So bad news for the West. But how long-lasting will be the smiles in Beijing, Moscow and even Islamabad? It was Pakistan that nurtured and gave safe haven to the Taliban for its own geo-strategic purposes. But if renewed Taliban rule produces a simple turning back of the clock - if international terrorism finds a renewed haven - then Pakistan may find that the growing turbulence in the region has decidedly negative consequences. China is happy to see the US failure. Indeed, if Mr Biden's reason to pull out from Afghanistan was due to his desire to re-focus US national power to rival a rising China, then this step has simply given China an opportunity to expand its own influence in Afghanistan and beyond. China, though, must have concern, too. Its shares a short border with Afghanistan.It is actively persecuting its own Muslim minorityand must be concerned at the possibility that anti-Beijing Islamist terrorists might seek to use Afghanistan as a base. No wonder then that Chinese diplomacy over recent weeks has been so eager to court the Taliban. Russia, too, must have worries about the return of instability and terrorism. Maybe it feels a little better about itself now that the US has similarly been humbled by Afghan tribal fighters, just as the Soviet Union was in the late-1980s. How America watched as Taliban won the war Taliban return raises fears of Afghan haven for terror But its chief interest is the security of a large part of Central Asia, many of whose states are allies of Moscow. This summer Russia moved tanks to the Tajikistan-Afghan frontier for exercises intended to demonstrate its determination to prevent any spill-over from an Afghan collapse. So in the short-term, the Afghan debacle certainly benefits the West's opponents. But their attitudes were not going to change anyway. What really matters are the ramifications among Washington's allies. What will they take away from the Afghan experience? Beyond the immediate crisis, will the NATO countries, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea or Japan see the US as a less reliable partner? If they do, then Mr Biden's decision to quit Afghanistan will prove fateful, indeed. Why is Kabul being compared to the fall of Saigon?

"There's a quote in To Kill A Mockingbird where Jem is told by Miss Maudie that ""things are never as bad as they seem."" For Joe Biden, right now, things do look pretty dark. But if I'm digging into my quotations book, who can better Kipling's If - and that line about treating triumph and failure as the impostors that they are? Politicians have been told down the ages that there is no coming back from this or that catastrophe, and - yet - back they come. The shambolic unravelling of America's withdrawal from Afghanistan comes from a yet to be written textbook of ""how to lose at everything"". Warnings hadn't been heeded, intelligence was clearly totally inadequate, planning was lamentable, execution woeful. LIVE UPDATES -all the latest from Afghanistan Let's just focus in on one thing - although there are any number that are worthy of examination. The withdrawal came during the ""fighting season"" - a phrase I have to say I have always found rather odd. But in Afghanistan there is a fighting season which starts in spring - and then in winter, when the country freezes over, there is a time when the Taliban go home to their tribal homelands. Did no-one think that it might have been better to have ordered the withdrawal for the dead of winter when Taliban forces weren't there, poised to fill the vacuum? Taliban soldiers patrol the streets of Jalalabad on 17 April The end result might have been the same - a Taliban takeover - but it would have almost certainly led to a more orderly drawdown. Yet the Biden administration wanted an eye-catching date. They wanted the withdrawal completed by 11 September. Twenty years on from 9/11 - an artificial, self-imposed deadline. One more quote. After the catastrophic Bay of Pigs invasion, when Cuban emigres backed by the CIA tried to overthrow Fidel Castro, John F Kennedy - the president at the time of that debacle - noted sorrowfully that victory has a hundred fathers, but failure is an orphan. Joe Biden is an orphan right now. And that could have consequences for his presidency; and far more importantly how the rest of the world sees America. VOICES:US veterans ask if war was worth it EXPLAINER:Ten days that shook Afghanistan ANALYSIS:Taliban return raises fears of Afghan haven for terror Biden's election campaign could be boiled down to three messages to distinguish himself from Donald Trump. First, he would be more empathetic. He would be more competent. And instead of ""America First"", it would be replaced by the mantra ""America is back"". But in his address yesterday, there wasn't a whole lot of empathy towards the thousands of Afghans who've helped Americans these past 20 years. On competence, even his biggest cheerleaders would struggle to say the withdrawal of American troops has been anything other than shambolic. And after the bewildering events of the past few days, how exactly is America back? Many see what has unfolded on President Biden's watch in Afghanistan as a linear continuation of Donald Trump's America First policies - and, as some have joked cruelly, not as well organised. That is potentially deeply damaging. Presidents Truman and Kennedy (right) both had to face up to failures But on the policy itself, Joe Biden is utterly defiant. He summoned up his inner Harry Truman and made clear in his speech that the buck stops with him. He was, however, happy to distribute blame in much the same way that a muck spreader disperses manure in all directions. The Afghan leadership weren't up to it, the Afghan armed forces had no fight in them; Donald Trump had negotiated a bad deal. There can be an endearing chirpiness to Joe Biden, but there's also a chippiness. He doesn't like being questioned, and on many foreign policy questions he is convinced of his own rightness. Joe Biden has never been a ""liberal interventionist"", thinking that liberal democracy is something that can be shipped out of Baltimore Harbour in 40ft containers and exported around the world. He thinks the US military should only be overseas to defend vital US interests. And with al-Qaeda largely beaten, Osama Bin Laden dead, it was job done. Time to come home. That is a view, I should add, shared by millions of Americans. But approving of the policy is very different from the dysfunctional implementation. And what if terror groups, feeling emboldened by the Taliban victory, decide to launch their own attacks on Americans abroad - or Americans at home? Then it could be politically catastrophic. AT THE SCENE:Kabul hotel - Taliban guards, no women PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? VOICES:Uncertain times ahead for Afghan women Which brings us to how Western leaders see America now. A fascinating nugget from a briefing that's just been given by Joe Biden's National Security Adviser. Since the fall of Kabul, Jake Sullivan revealed, Biden hadn't spoken to another world leader. Wasn't that just a bit surprising, given that there were a lot of other nations - including Britain - who'd committed vast resources to Afghanistan? Following Sullivan's briefing, the White House announced that Biden had spoken with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. When the G7 gathered in Cornwall and the Nato nations met in Brussels the sense of relief was palpable among the prime ministers and presidents that a more outward looking American president was in charge. But given what has unfolded - how America has been humiliated, how Joe Biden embarked on a policy he was cautioned against by these leaders - there is now a good deal more wariness. And who will feel they have gained most from America's departure - apart from the Taliban, of course? Why, three countries near Afghanistan - Russia, Iran and China.

"Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada is a political and religious leader who is the third Supreme Commander of the Taliban The Taliban took many by surprise as they swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days in August, quickly taking control of towns and cities. The militant group has announced an interim government, declaring the country an ""Islamic Emirate"". The cabinet will be led by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, one of the movement's founders. So, here's what is known about who is leading the Taliban today. PROFILE: Who are the Taliban? EXPLAINER: Ten days that shook Afghanistan VOICES: Uncertain times ahead for Afghan women Hibatullah Akhundzada became the supreme commander of the Taliban in May 2016, and is now leader of the so-called Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. In the 1980s, he participated in the Islamist resistance against the Soviet military campaign in Afghanistan, but his reputation is more that of a religious leader than a military commander. Akhundzada worked as head of the Sharia Courts in the 1990s. After first seizing power in the 1990s, the Taliban introduced and supported punishments according to their strict interpretation of Islamic law: they publicly executed murderers and adulterers and amputated thieves' limbs. Under the leadership of the reclusive Mullah Mohammed Omar (who is thought to have died in 2013), the Taliban also banned television, music, movies, make-up, and stopped girls aged 10 and over from attending school. Very few images exist of former Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who died in 2013 Akhundzada is believed to be in his 60s and has lived most of his life in Afghanistan. However, according to experts, he maintains close ties with the so-called ""Quetta Shura"" - the Afghan Taliban leaders said to be based in the Pakistani city of Quetta. As the group's supreme commander, Akhundzada is in charge of political, military and religious affairs. Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund is one of the four men who founded the Taliban in Afghanistan in 1994. He is a longtime head the Taliban's powerful leadership council, or Rehbari Shura. He served as foreign minister and deputy prime minister during the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan in 1996-2001. He is under UN sanctions for his role in the government during that period. Sirajuddin Haqqani is another of the group's top figures, who is on an FBI most wanted list. After the death of his father, Jalaluddin Haqqani, he became the new leader of the Haqqani network, which has been credited with some of the most violent attacks that have occurred in Afghanistan against Afghan forces and their Western allies in recent years. The Haqqani network is currently one of the region's most powerful and feared militant groups. Some say it is even more influential than the Islamic State group in Afghanistan. The Haqqani network is currently one of the most powerful and feared militant groups in the country The group, designated by the US as a terrorist organisation, oversees the Taliban's financial and military assets along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Haqqani is believed to be around 45. Inan opinion piece in the New York Times,externallast year before the signing of the Doha agreement, Haqqani wrote: ""For more than four decades, precious Afghan lives have been lost every day. Everyone has lost somebody they loved. Everyone is tired of war. I am convinced that the killing and the maiming must stop."" Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is a Taliban co-founder. He became a lynchpin of the insurgency after the militants were toppled by the US-led invasion in 2001. But he was captured in a joint US-Pakistani operation in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi in February 2010. He remained in prison for eight years, until he was released as part of a plan to facilitate the peace process. He has been the head of their political office in Qatar since January 2019. In 2020, Baradar became the first Taliban leader to communicate directly with a US president after having a telephone conversation with Donald Trump. Before that,Baradar signed the Doha agreementon the withdrawal of US troops on behalf of the Taliban. Then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Abdul Ghani Baradar met in September 2020 in Doha Mohammad Yaqoob is the son of the founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar. He is believed to be little more than 30 years old and is currently the leader of the group's military operations. Following the death of former Taliban leader Akhtar Mansour in 2016, some militants wanted to appoint Yaqoob as the group's new supreme commander, but others felt that he was young and lacking in experience. As the Taliban advanced through the country, Yaqoob urged Taliban fighters not to harm members of the Afghan military or government and tostay out of abandoned homes of government and security officials who had fled,external, according to the Associated Press news agency.

"It's one of the most striking images from the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban. Hundreds of Afghans packed into a US military cargo plane as they flee Kabul. The faces, many male but with some women and children, look up towards the camera, their expressions a mixture of anxiety and possibly some relief. The image was initially obtained by the US defence analysis website, Defense One, but was released by the US Air Mobility Command public affairs office on Tuesday. On Sunday, panicked civilians had scrambled up the loading ramp, Defense One quoted a US official as saying, but the crew decided it was best to take off rather than force the Afghans off the plane. The number onboard - 640 - is among the highest carried by that type of plane, a C-17 Globemaster. It's approaching, though still some way off, the record for the number of people transported by any plane - an Israeli Boeing 747 carrying more than 1,000 Jewish migrants from Ethiopia in 1991. The US defence official quoted by Defense One, says the flight from Kabul to Qatar was one of several which managed to extract hundreds of Afghans from Kabul. The photo stands in contrast to the chaotic images which emerged from Kabul airport on Monday as it was overrun by Afghans terrified at the prospect of Taliban rule. US soldiers struggled to keep control. This video can not be played Chaotic scenes at Kabul airport as people try desperately to flee An image of the same type of plane from Monday showed hundreds of Afghans running alongside the moving aircraft, some clinging to the side. Local media reports said at least two fell to their deaths once it took off. Some have questioned why it is predominantly men seen at the airport. One explanation is that many women have been staying indoors, fearing how they will be treated by the Taliban. Another is that many families would want their men to leave first so they can help from outside Afghanistan, financially, and eventually find a way to bring their loved ones out of the country. While the airlifts will be welcomed by many, the numbers could be a drop in the ocean of those who feel compelled to leave in fear of the Taliban. The UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, has called on countries not to force the return of Afghans previously deemed not to need protection. It estimates 550,000 Afghans have been internally displaced by the conflict since the beginning of the year. Between 20,000 and 30,000 are thought to be fleeing across borders every week, the UNHCR's Afghanistan representative, Caroline Van Buren, told CNN. And government figures suggest 120,000 moved to Kabul as Taliban forces closed in. Many of those in fear for their lives have worked with US-led forces, notably as translators or contractors. But the Taliban's treatment of women during its previous rule in the 1990s and its use of barbaric punishments is another major spur to leave. At the beginning of August, the White House announced a plan to allow thousands of Afghans with links to the US to resettle there. On Monday, President Joe Biden announced $500m (Â£362m) in aid for Afghan refugees. The US has relocated some 2,000 Afghans out of the country under its Special Immigrant Visa scheme, officials say, and plans to transport thousands more. Other countries are helping out too, including Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel told party leaders that Germany may need to evacuate some 10,000 people, including 2,500 support staff. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Breakfast that 150 British nationals were flown out on Sunday. Last week, the UK extracted 289 Afghans. Several hundred more will leave in the next 24 hours, he said. But the turmoil in Afghanistan has raised fears in Europe of a new influx of migrants. A stark illustration is Turkey's decision to boost security at its lengthy border with Iran where Turkey is building a concrete wall. Have you or a loved one been evacuated from Afghanistan?

"The Taliban are encouraging people to return to work in Kabul, days after their takeover of the capital Afghans are going back to work and there are more cars on the streets, but people's behaviour is starting to change in Kabul two days after the Taliban takeover. Last night, a group of 28 Taliban men came into my hotel, armed with guns, and asked for food. The staff were nervous. ""Look. We need to secure this place,"" the hotel's security manager said. ""Anybody could come with a gun and claim to be a Taliban, it could be a looter or a thief. So, why don't you just let us know who's with you, so we know who's Taliban and who is not. You know better than us."" Of course, all the men got fed. Later on I tried to order something from room service, but the staff said the Taliban had finished it all. A couple of days ago, they were the enemy. There were uniformed guards in and around the hotel who were supposed to protect us from the Taliban. Now the Taliban are here: standing outside with guns, opening the doors of cars. From what I can see, the male staff at the hotel haven't shaved in the last three days. And all the female staff have gone. At the reception, room service, the cleaners - women are no longer here. The background music at the hotel has also stopped. I asked one of the staff, who replied: ""Friends are here, so no more music."" It's much busier in the city than yesterday. There is much more traffic, a few more shops are open, and people are doing their usual jobs. There have been no reports of violence in the city - no sound of gunfire or helicopters. I can hear a few military jets flying high over the city. I can see the Taliban presence has increased. Fighters have come from different areas of Afghanistan, the majority of them from Logar province south of the capital. They say they are here to keep order. The ones I have seen are behaving nicely with people. Sometimes they even ask if you are alright, or if you need help with anything. IN PICTURES:Kabul after Taliban takeover EXPLAINER:Ten days that shook Afghanistan PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? I spoke with two street vendors in the centre on Tuesday. As poor Afghans, they said it didn't make any difference to them whether it was the Taliban or Americans in charge.

"Afghans trying to flee the country have flocked to Kabul airport The UK's evacuation programme in Afghanistan is ""operating at full pace"" but the changing political situation means it ""can't afford to pause and wait"", a military commander has said. Vice Adm Sir Ben Key, who is running the evacuation, said around 300 people had been flown out so far. But Sir Ben said the operation was dependent on the security situation. Boris Johnson said any recognition of a Taliban government would ""be subject to them upholding"" human rights standards. In total, the UK hopes to help 6,000 to 7,000 British nationals and eligible Afghan staff to leave, he said. Home SecretaryPriti Patel said around 2,000 former Afghan staff and their families,externalhad been resettled in the UK since 22 June under an existing resettlement scheme. And more than 3,300 people have been resettled since 2013, she said. The prime minister spoke to US President Joe Biden on Tuesday evening, Downing Street said - and the pair agreed to work ""closely together"" to evacuate people from Afghanistan. ""The prime minister and President Biden agreed on the need for the global community to come together to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan,"" a spokeswoman said. She added that Mr Johnson outlined the UK's plans to increase humanitarian aid to the region and resettle refugees, and that the pair would discuss the situation at a virtual meeting of G7 leaders ""in the coming days"". Live updates: Anger and fear grow as US defends Kabul pull-out Biden defends 'messy' US pullout from Afghanistan 'My family is stuck and there is nothing I can do' There were chaotic scenes at Kabul airport on Monday, as thousands tried to flee the country after the Taliban seized control of the capital. A number of people died and large crowds on the runway led to all flights being halted for several hours. However, Chief Joint Operations Vice Admiral Sir Ben said the situation was now ""much calmer"". ""I'm very confident that we now have a stable airfield in which we can get on with the business, alongside all of our allies and partners, that we need to do,"" he said. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I expect that we will increase our aid budget for development and humanitarian purposes - probably by 10%, is what I have in mind - on last year. We want to try and make sure it doesn't go through the Taliban."" One would assume by ""last year"" that Mr Raab was referring to aid spending in the 2020-21 financial year, when the UK gave Â£167.5m of aid to Afghanistan. That was before the governmentcut the foreign aid budgetearlier this year. Prior to today, aid to Afghanistan was set to fall to Â£37.5m - an annual reduction of Â£130m. However, if, as Raab has implied, a further 10% were added to the aid given in 2020-21, it would bring the UK's spending in Afghanistan up to Â£184.25m. If a 10% increase was applied to the post-cuts budget then it would represent a massive decrease on the 2020-21 budget. We have asked the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to clarify the position but they have yet to comment. He said three flights had landed in Kabul so far on Tuesday and more were planned. Military aircraft are also flying from Afghanistan to airports across the region, where people can then be put on civilian charter flights, he added. The UK has sent about 900 troops to Afghanistan to help evacuate British nationals and Afghans who are eligible to resettle in the UK. This group includes Afghans who worked for the British government, as well as interpreters, cultural advisers and embassy staff. Others eligible are those deemed to be at high and imminent risk, according to the Ministry of Defence. Ex-marine: I'm not leaving Kabul without my staff UK holidaymaker, 21, evacuated from Afghanistan Sir Ben said the UK wanted to bring as many people back as quickly as possible. ""We will go for as long as it takes us to either meet the demand, or when the security situation means that we're no longer operating with consent,"" he added. However, he said it was up to eligible individuals to make their own way to the airport when they were called to do so and the Taliban were now controlling access points. So far, he said the Taliban had ""seemed acquiescent and understanding of what we're trying to achieve"" - but ""we don't take it for granted"". ""We will try our utmost to bring back everybody we can but we do not own the finish point of this,"" he added. ""We can merely work day by day as hard as we possibly can."" This video can not be played Afghan interpreter: ""I'm so worried about my parents and my sisters' safety"" Sir Ben's comments came as a spokesman for the Taliban said the UK and western allies had a ""moral obligation"" to ""help reconstruct Afghanistan"". Suhail Shaheen told Sky News that the prime minister and other world leaders should respect the ""aspiration and will of the people of Afghanistan, and help the people of Afghanistan in rebuilding the country and providing a prosperous life for the people and economic development"". ""This is their obligation because they were behind the destruction of Afghanistan during the 20 years,"" he added. In a separate news conference, the Taliban claimed that interpreters and others who had helped allied forces would be pardoned. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Mr Johnson had spoken to Pakistan PM Imran Khan on Tuesday afternoon. Pakistan and Afghanistan share a border, and Mr Johnson had stressed the importance of working with other countries ""to avoid a humanitarian disaster"" the spokeswoman said. ""The prime minister underlined that any recognition of the new government in Afghanistan is to happen on an international, not unilateral, basis,"" she added. ""He said that the legitimacy of any future Taliban government will be subject to them upholding internationally-agreed standards on human rights and inclusivity."" Afghans, including those who worked for the US, Nato, the Europe Union and the United Nations, wait to flee The UK government is planning to launch a new resettlement scheme for Afghan refugees, aimed at helping those most in need, including women and girls, to come to the UK. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the UK is looking at a ""bespoke arrangement"", with full details to be set out in due course. He did not confirm how many refugees would be allowed to come, but said the UK was ""a big-hearted nation"". Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would ask the prime minister on Wednesday how the UK planned to get refugees out of Afghanistan. ""I don't think a question of numbers at this stage is a helpful discussion,"" he said. ""The first discussion has to be: is there a plan; is there a strategy of safe and legal routes for refugees to come out of Afghanistan; and how quickly can that be put in place?"" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer said talking about exact numbers was ânot helpfulâ The former immigration minister Caroline Nokes MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the government needed to implement an ""unprecedented"" new resettlement scheme at ""alarming speed"". ""I think we have to be particularly scared for women and we know this is a regime that will oppress and suppress women as much as they possibly can,"" she said. The BBC has been told the new resettlement scheme will be similar to that used to help Syrian refugees. Around 20,000 refugees who fled the conflict in Syria have been resettled in the UK under the scheme since it was launched in 2014. Have you or a loved one been evacuated from Afghanistan?

""I don't think a question of numbers at this stage is a helpful discussion,"" he said. ""The first discussion has to be: is there a plan; is there a strategy of safe and legal routes for refugees to come out of Afghanistan; and how quickly can that be put in place?"" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer said talking about exact numbers was ânot helpfulâ The former immigration minister Caroline Nokes MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the government needed to implement an ""unprecedented"" new resettlement scheme at ""alarming speed"". ""I think we have to be particularly scared for women and we know this is a regime that will oppress and suppress women as much as they possibly can,"" she said. The BBC has been told the new resettlement scheme will be similar to that used to help Syrian refugees. Around 20,000 refugees who fled the conflict in Syria have been resettled in the UK under the scheme since it was launched in 2014. Have you or a loved one been evacuated from Afghanistan?

"The Taliban are establishing themselves after sweeping into Kabul unopposed on Sunday. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has fled the country, reportedly to Uzbekistan. Here are pictures from the capital on Monday. Life appears to be normal in the city centre, says the BBC's Malik Mudassir. There is a lot less traffic, most of the shops are closed. But people look much calmer. At the international airport, though, scenes were catastrophic, said our correspondent. There are currently 2,500 American troops at the airport, with an additional 500 arriving in the coming hours, said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. US troops - seen below -  are still ""working to re-establish security"", the spokesman said, as the Pentagon announced a pause in flights. Footage shared on social media appears to show Afghan civilians clinging to the side of a US military aircraft as it prepares to take off. Amnesty International has called on the international community to act ""decisively to avert further tragedy"". ""What we are witnessing in Afghanistan is a tragedy that should have been foreseen and averted,"" said the organisation's secretary general, Agnes Callamard. All pictures are subject to copyright.

"If you like neat lines, tidiness and admire symmetry, what's not to like about the decision of Joe Biden to pull American combat troops out of Afghanistan by 11 September 2021 - exactly 20 years on from 9/11? In modern day America it often feels that all roads lead back to 9/11; the single most defining - and scarring - event since Pearl Harbor: the surprise attack by the Japanese on America's Pacific fleet, which would ultimately bring America into World War Two. And so it was that 9/11 led to this country's longest military encounter. The attack on the Twin Towers, the plane that flew into the Pentagon, and the one that crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, were initially the spur for a surge of US nationalism. Young people - in fact people of all ages - were going along to armed forces recruitment offices wanting to sign up. America had come under attack; these patriots wanted to fight to defend the country the ""land of the free"", and seek revenge on those who would do the US harm. And don't mistake this for some kind of kneejerk jingoism. It wasn't that. I knew many people - not just Americans - who were of a liberal bent and had been no great fans of all the doings of the US of A but who have a visceral sense this was a moment where you had to pick your team. Were you on the side of the rule of law, free and fair elections, due process, sexual equality, universal education? Or were you on the side of those who would fly planes into buildings, or would stone people to death, or throw homosexuals off of buildings, or deny girls schooling? If that seems a massive over-simplification, maybe it is - but in the devastating aftermath of 9/11, that is how it seemed to many. Biden makes a surprise visit to Afghanistan as vice-president in 2011 But by 2016 it was one of the factors that led to Donald Trump's election: the weariness of the ""endless wars"" as candidate Trump would refer to the quagmires of Afghanistan and Iraq; the wariness of America being able to act as the world's policeman. Americans understandably wanted to pull up the drawbridge, bring the troops home, leave it to the people in those countries to sort out their own problems, and finally give up on the idea that a US model of liberal democracy was an exportable commodity that could be imposed. The liberal interventionist crusade was over. Trump, if he had won last November, would have pulled out US troops, probably quicker. Although Joe Biden inherited Trump's promise to withdraw, in policy terms the easiest thing would have been to continue to sign the cheques to pay for American servicemen and women to stay in Afghanistan for another year. And then another. And another after that. Why the Taliban is gaining ground so quickly Fleeing the Taliban, to sleep on city streets The political pressure was by no means overwhelming. If anything, the reverse. The defence top brass, the foreign policy establishment, America's allies abroad thought anything other than the status quo would be reckless. But one question was gnawing at the new president, and it was the one posed by Hillel the Elder back in biblical times: ""If not now, then when?"" Biden - who advised President Barack Obama not to send more troops in 2009 but lost the argument - went with now, in what could be the most consequential single decision of his presidency. This video can not be played Taliban leaders speak to BBC News about conquer and compromise When 9/11 happened I was the BBC's Paris correspondent, reporting on Eurotunnel's attempt to force the closure of a Red Cross refugee centre called Sangatte  - where many of the world's storm-tossed refugees and migrants congregated before making the final leg of the journey to the UK. I was driving to Calais when I got a call from a colleague telling me to stop at the nearest service station to watch TV, and see what was unfolding. We didn't know what would happen next - or where we would end up. One year into the optimism of a new millennium, there was a narrative and it wasn't a happy one - the war on terror, a clash of civilisations, call it what you will. At the time the two stories could not have been more different, but a lot of the bedraggled people we met on the roads around Calais were from Afghanistan fleeing Taliban rule. It's worth remembering why the US, UK and others went into Afghanistan. The Taliban had - in effect - become a finishing school for Islamist terrorists wanting to wage jihad against the west. Al-Qaeda wannabes were going into the country to train for holy war. The 9/11 terrorists had honed their skills and hatched their plot there. Removing the Taliban and tackling al-Qaeda became critical for global security. Within a few weeks of 9/11, I was in northern Afghanistan, travelling via Delhi and then Dushanbe in Tajikistan to get there. We were moving with the US and UK-backed Northern Alliance troops as they pushed the Taliban out. Ousting the Taliban was considered a global priority 20 years ago, writes the author (right) Our first day was spent travelling from Khoja Bahauddin, then the Northern Alliance HQ along a road where the Taliban had killed a number of journalists in an ambush two days earlier. After one night we ended up in a town called Taleqan. It had fallen the night before we arrived. One of the iconic shots was of a girls-school classroom that had become a weapons dump for Taliban rockets that in their hasty retreat they had left behind. The stubborn last stronghold was Kunduz - a vital communication corridor sitting between Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif and then further north to the border with Uzbekistan. Now both Taleqan and Kunduz have come back under Taliban control, with a third of the country's regional capitals now under their control. And that raises a super-uncomfortable question for Joe Biden and his ""if not now, then when"" policy. Twenty years on and so many lives lost, and so many billions of dollars spent, what was it for? What's been achieved? What do you say to the families of all those servicemen killed by the Taliban now that the US is giving up? What's to stop terror groups from re-establishing their jihad training camps? At the UN Security Council hearing last Friday it was reported that up to 20 different terror groups, involving thousands of foreign fighters were already fighting with Taliban forces. The regions where Jon travelled are now back under Taliban control I'm sure as I am writing this more families will be packing up their possessions fearful of what Taliban control will mean, perhaps heading to Calais and then the UK. Will the girls' schools return to become weapons storage facilities again? The scars of 9/11 are clear everywhere - thousands of servicemen have come back with prosthetic limbs and disturbed minds. Suicide rates have been rising. Families have lost loved ones. On America's streets are men with red plastic beer cups begging for loose change, many of them with signs saying they are veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. US-led forces toppled the Taliban:In 2001 US-led forces overthrew Afghanistan's Taliban rulers after the 9/11 attacks masterminded by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was based there. Twenty years of occupation and military operations followed:The US and allies oversaw elections and built up Afghan security forces, but the Taliban continued to launch attacks. Eventually the US made a deal with the Taliban:They would pull out if the militants agreed not to host terrorist groups. But talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government failed. US-led forces withdrew this year and the Taliban have now retaken most of the country. The desire to stay at home and shut yourself away from a troubling world is completely understandable. There is no surprise that ""America First"" as a slogan had such resonance. George W Bush was not advocating that back in 2001 - but there were no US troops in Afghanistan or Iraq then. And that didn't keep America safe when early that morning, across those gin-clear blue skies passenger aeroplanes were hijacked and became al-Qaeda-guided missiles, flying into their targets killing thousands of people doing nothing more provocative than going about their daily lives. There's also a difference between enforcing your will as the world's policeman, and being a peacekeeper. Thousands of American troops are still stationed in South Korea - even though the Korean war was 70 years ago. The calculation of successive US presidents has been that a tense peace is better than a hot war or a destabilised region. Joe Biden was hoping his decision would result in headlines like ""Afghan War Ends"" or ""America's longest war is over"". But 20 years on, and the Taliban now re-establishing control with all that could flow from that, might historians in future judge that the 20th anniversary marked the start of the second Afghan war?

"Larissa, 26, hopes she will help save lives UK scientists behind the AstraZeneca Covid jab have given the first trial volunteers a new plague vaccine. One of them, Larissa, 26, hopes she can help save lives by volunteering for the research, at the University of Oxford, where she studies genetics. The phase-one trial,externalwill see at least 40 healthy 18- to 55-year-olds test the vaccine, which uses the same technology as the coronavirus jab. Its target is a centuries-old bacterial threat, not the new pandemic virus. For much of the world plague is a history lesson - the most infamous plague pandemic, the Black Death that swept through Europe in the 1300s, killed as much as half of the population. But there are still cases in some rural areas of Africa, Asia and America. And in 2017, an outbreak killed 171 people in Madagascar. Antibiotics can now be used to treat plague, if given early, But many of the regions at risk of outbreaks are very remote. An effective vaccine could offer a new way to protect lives. And the trial will check how well the body recognises and learns to fight the plague after vaccination. Larissa said: ""I'm lucky enough to live in a time where vaccines are being developed. ""And so, when I saw that there was a study aiming at developing a vaccine against a disease that's been around for 2000 years and has killed millions and millions of people, I didn't hesitate, I just wanted to do my bit."" Asked if she was worried about side-effects, Larissa said: ""I'm not too concerned. ""The vaccine that's being assessed today is using the same platform as the Covid vaccine, which has literally been administered to millions of people around the world."" Like the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, the jab uses a weakened version of a common-cold virus - adenovirus - from chimpanzees that has been genetically altered so it cannot cause an infection in people. This vaccine does not contain plague bacterium and so cannot cause plague. But it does include added genes that make proteins from the plague bacteriumYersinia pestis. And this should teach the body's immune system how to fend off the real infection, should it ever need to. The same approach could be used for other diseases too, the investigators say. ""We've already done clinical trials using similar technology against a bacterium, meningitis B, and a virus, Zika,"" Oxford Vaccine Group senior clinical researcher Dr Maheshi Ramasamy said. ""But we're also looking to develop vaccines against new and emerging diseases such as Lassa fever or the Marburg virus The trial, which will run for at least a year, is funded by Innovate UK, part of UK Research and Innovation, the national funding agency investing in science and research in the UK. 5,000-year-old man was 'oldest plague victim' Oxford Vaccine Group Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Job vacancies have hit a record high as the UK's labour market continues to ""rebound robustly"", according to the latest official figures. The number of vacancies hit 953,000 in the three months to July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in the three months to June, while the annual growth in average pay was 7.4%. However, the ONS urged caution in reading too much into the rise in wages. ONS deputy statistician Jonathan Athow told the BBC that while the rise in average pay ""hasn't been that high for a long time"", it also compares to last year when millions of people were on furlough and were not being paid their full wage. ""This time last year we had millions of people on furlough many getting 80% of their wages, other people having their hours cut, and that pushed wages down,"" he said. ""So when we look at wages this year, when people have come back from furlough, it's really been boosted by the fact that last year wages were quite low. Some of this group was just wages returning to the level before the pandemic."" Photographer, farmer and plasterer job ads rise UK economy rebounds as Covid restrictions ease The ONS said payrolls rose by 182,000 between June and July, although at 28.9 million it is still 201,000 lower than before the pandemic struck. The number of people on payroll has now grown over half a million in the past three months, regaining about four-fifths of the fall seen at the start of the pandemic. Ollie Brightman, co-owner of a digital marketing agency in Bristol, says he has been struggling to recruit staff due to the competitive jobs market. The 35-year-old toldRadio 5 Live's Your Call programmehiring freelancers was a good short-term solution for his agency, but ""very expensive"" in the long term. ""We are absolutely desperate for all matter of digital marketing candidates at the moment. Pretty much anyone within those industries we are crying out for,"" he said. However, John Parmenter, a carpenter from Hertfordshire, has been benefitting from the demand for skilled workers. He has seen his hourly rate shoot up from Â£19 on average, to between Â£25 and Â£30 in the past few months. The 53-year-old said he was getting called ""every few hours"" by agencies. ""It's quite a nice feeling,"" he said. ""It's the first time it's ever happened in 30 years. They ask what you want, not what they're paying. It's a nice change. ""During the lockdown, with the pandemic, unfortunately I wasn't entitled to any payments so I'm just trying to reap some money back to try and pay off some existing bills that have escalated. I just don't know what's round the corner so we're just going to surf it and make the most of it."" Overall, Mr Athow said the ""world of work continues to rebound robustly"" from the pandemic. He said that early survey figures show that the number of job vacancies passed one million for the first time ever in July. Arts, leisure and food service firms were among those making a big contribution to the surge in job openings. ""There was no sign of redundancies starting to pick up in our survey data ahead of the furlough scheme beginning to wind down, and Insolvency Service figures for July suggest the same,"" Mr Athow added. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I know there could still be bumps in the road but the data is promising - there are now more employees on payrolls than at any point since March 2020 and the number of people on furlough is the lowest since the scheme launched."" The furlough scheme isset to finish at the end of September. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the jobs data should calm fears that the ending of government support measures could send unemployment higher. ""The figures add weight to our view that there won't be a big shake-out in employment once the furlough scheme expires at the end of September. ""It was encouraging that PAYE employment in July rose by 182,000 month-on-month and the claimant count fell by 7,800 month-on-month leaving the claimant count rate unchanged at 5.7%,"" she said. These figures show a jobs market in robust recovery as the economy reopens and the furlough scheme starts to be phased out. Employment is up on all measures, unemployment down and experimental numbers in the month of July showed there are over one million vacancies. There are record numbers of unfilled jobs, in sectors such as entertainment, accommodation and food, underlining the concerns of industry on labour shortages. The number of payroll jobs reported on the HMRC systems is now very close to its pre pandemic level at 28.9 million now compared with 29 million in March 2020. That number is up 576,000 over the past year and 182,000 up in July alone. The growth in that varies considerably between regions, with holiday areas such as Cornwall and west Wales showing annual rates of growth of around 5%, far above the rates in major cities. The chancellor welcomed the figures as ""promising"". Analysts warned that the unemployment figures would rise as the furlough scheme continued to be phased out. But the peak unemployment rate is on course to be significantly lower than had been expected last year. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: ""The labour market outperformed expectations as the economy accelerated with the relaxation of Covid-related restrictions. ""Changes to the business environment, such as the fall in business travel and the rise in online commerce, increased the need for skills, from IT specialists to hauliers, while at the same time caused an unusually high level of mismatch in the UK's labour market.""

"Nando's says it will lend some of its staff to its suppliers to help ""get things moving"" in the supply chain after shortages hit some of its shops.

Customers were quick to react online, complaining about local closures. ""The UK supply chain is having a bit of a [night]'mare right now,"" Nando's tweeted in reply.

The chain said delivery schedules meant the situation was changing rapidly and suggested customers check the website before they visit. Food and other supply chains across the UK have struggled to operate normally this summer, due to what has been dubbed the ""pingdemic"" -  staff being required to self-isolate if they have come into contact with someone with coronavirus. Staff shortages have also have been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and the furlough scheme keeping some workers out of the jobs market. Dairy giant Arla had to cut back on milk deliveries to supermarkets due to lorry driver shortages last month, leaving some supermarket shelves short of stock. Last week rival fast food chicken store KFC said some items were missing from its menus due to ""disruption"". The problem has also affected carmakers, transport operators, restaurants and pubs. Road haulage firms have been a particular pinch point because the industry was already short of qualified drivers. From this week,fully vaccinated staff no longer have to self-isolate, a rule-change the government hopes will ease the pressure on businesses running short of staff. At the same time Nando's says it is exploring an alternative solution by offering its staff to help suppliers, although it didn't say whether any had accepted the offer, or what work they would be doing. The South African chain, famous for its peri peri sauce, operates more than 400 restaurants across the UK. Nando's said the shortages were not affecting any of their outlets in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

"New Zealand has been largely successful in eliminating the virus from within its borders New Zealand has announced a snap lockdown after a man tested positive for Covid, the first case in six months. The case was detected in Auckland, which will be in lockdown for a week, while the rest of the country will be in lockdown for three days. Authorities say they are working on the assumption that the new case was the Delta variant. Just around 20% of its population has been fully vaccinated. Coromandel, a coastal town where the infected person had visited, will be in lockdown for seven days too. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the toughest ""level 4"" rules were required - closing schools, offices and all businesses with only essential services remaining operational. ""I want to assure New Zealand that we have planned for this eventuality. Going hard and early has worked for us before,"" she said. The patient is a 58-year-old man, who is believed to have been infectious since last Thursday. There are at least 23 potential sites of transmission. There was reportedly a rush at supermarkets in Auckland, as locals anticipated a snap lockdown. Covid cases and deaths by country Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? Officials said there was a need for strong response because of the fear of the Delta variant, and because there was no clear link between the new case and the border or quarantine facilities. Data released by New Zealand's Ministry of Health on Monday showed that all Covid-19 cases detected at the country's border in recent weeks had been Delta. ""We have seen what can happen elsewhere if we fail to get on top of it. We only get one chance,"" Ms Ardern said in a televised national address, calling the Delta strain ""a game changer"". New Zealand has been successful in eliminating the virus from within its borders, although its international borders remain largely closed.

Kaji gave the number puzzle its name after publishing it in his magazine Nikoli in the 1980s. Since then the popular game - involving placing the numbers 1 to 9 in each row, column and square of a 9 by 9 grid - has spread around the globe. Tournaments take place across the world and it is estimated that millions play versions of the game each day. On MondayNikoli published a statement,externalon its website saying Kaji had died at his home in Tokyo from bile duct cancer on 10 August 2021. Kaji was born in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo in 1951. After dropping out of Keio University, he set up the puzzle magazine Nikoli, which published its first edition in August 1980. The origins of Sudoku are unclear. Some credit the 18th Century Swiss mathematician Euler as its creator, while others say it came to the Arab world from China via India in the 8th or 9th Century,according to the New York Times,external. French newspapers published a number of early versions of the game in the late 19th Century, including one called ""le carrÃ© magique diabolique"", or the evil magic square, published by La France newspaper in July 1895. But US architect Howard Garns is often credited as the creator of the modern version of the puzzle in the 1970s, under the name Number Place. It was this game that Kaji spotted in 1984. ""It was a very interesting puzzle, fun to solve,"" he said ina 2008 speech,external. ""But the name, Number Place, did not hit me. I wanted to create a Japanese name."" Kaji landed on Suuji wa dokushin ni kagiru, meaning ""Numbers should be single"". Pushed by colleagues to come up with a catchier name as he rushed to get to a horse race, he said he came up with the name Sudoku ""in about 25 seconds"". The game became popular in Japan but only turned into a global phenomenon in 2004, after The Times of London published a puzzle. Kaji did not trademark the game, and did not gain financially from its huge success. But he said the joy of the puzzle and of others enjoying the game was more important than any monetary reward. ""I get really moved when I see a new idea for a puzzle which has lots of potential,""he told the BBC in 2007,external. ""I get really excited about it. It is like finding treasure.""

"The Taliban are encouraging people to return to work in Kabul, days after their takeover of the capital Afghans are going back to work and there are more cars on the streets, but people's behaviour is starting to change in Kabul two days after the Taliban takeover. Last night, a group of 28 Taliban men came into my hotel, armed with guns, and asked for food. The staff were nervous. ""Look. We need to secure this place,"" the hotel's security manager said. ""Anybody could come with a gun and claim to be a Taliban, it could be a looter or a thief. So, why don't you just let us know who's with you, so we know who's Taliban and who is not. You know better than us."" Of course, all the men got fed. Later on I tried to order something from room service, but the staff said the Taliban had finished it all. A couple of days ago, they were the enemy. There were uniformed guards in and around the hotel who were supposed to protect us from the Taliban. Now the Taliban are here: standing outside with guns, opening the doors of cars. From what I can see, the male staff at the hotel haven't shaved in the last three days. And all the female staff have gone. At the reception, room service, the cleaners - women are no longer here. The background music at the hotel has also stopped. I asked one of the staff, who replied: ""Friends are here, so no more music."" It's much busier in the city than yesterday. There is much more traffic, a few more shops are open, and people are doing their usual jobs. There have been no reports of violence in the city - no sound of gunfire or helicopters. I can hear a few military jets flying high over the city. I can see the Taliban presence has increased. Fighters have come from different areas of Afghanistan, the majority of them from Logar province south of the capital. They say they are here to keep order. The ones I have seen are behaving nicely with people. Sometimes they even ask if you are alright, or if you need help with anything. IN PICTURES:Kabul after Taliban takeover EXPLAINER:Ten days that shook Afghanistan PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? I spoke with two street vendors in the centre on Tuesday. As poor Afghans, they said it didn't make any difference to them whether it was the Taliban or Americans in charge. An unverified Facebook video,externalwent viral on Tuesday, showing women with heads covered protesting on a street in the city.

An NHS worker in Wales who died from coronavirus was unlikely to have caught the virus at work, a coroner has ruled. Alan Macalalad, from Llwynypia, Rhondda Cynon Taf, died on 20 May last year after going into cardiac arrest at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant. The 44-year-old from the Philippines worked as a theatre assistant for Cardiff and Vale health board. An inquest heard he had Type-2 diabetes and needed surgery in 2019 due to having pneumonia and collapsed lungs. The pandemic led Mr Macalalad to raise concerns with his manager and his GP about Covid-19 and his duties were changed and moved to a role where there would be no contact with patients. On 5 May 2020, his wife Elsie, who is a nurse at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda, called to say she had been sent home with Covid-19 symptoms. He was asymptomatic but he was also sent home to self-isolate and did eventually show symptoms. Mr Macalalad was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 20 May where he suffered a blocked blood vessel in the lungs and went into cardiac arrest. Coroner Graeme Hughes said the medical cause of death was Covid-19 pneumonitis leading to coronary thromboembolism and diabetes. You can read morehere. Taking a holiday abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to enjoy a break in the UK this summer. But what are the rules?  However, there are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:  The Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September You can read our full explainerhere. The Scottish government is seeking to make many of its emergency coronavirus powers permanent, including the ability to close schools, introduce lockdowns and operate virtual courts. It is also looking at a change in the law to permanently allow them to release prisoners early or permit a wider range of healthcare workers to administer vaccinations. In June,MSPs agreed to extend the emergency measures until March 2022, with the option of extending them for six months, to September 2022, without passing a new law. Announcing a public consultation on removing the planned expiry date, SNP Deputy First Minister and Covid Recovery Secretary John Swinney insisted that some of the changes have had a ""demonstrable benefit to the people of Scotland"". The consultation published by ministers argues that making many of the measures permanent would ensure ""ministers can respond effectively and rapidly to any future threats to public health in Scotland"" and not just coronavirus. Under the proposals, ministers would also be able to order school closures ""during the remainder of the pandemic"" or for any future outbreak of an infectious disease, so long as they believe it is ""necessary and proportionate"", and the chief medical officer has been consulted. The consultation also suggests a permanent shift to more digital options, including the remote registration of deaths or still births, council meetings and electronic court documents. Mr Swinney said: ""As we enter the recovery phase, we now have a unique opportunity to reimagine how health and social care, learning and justice services can be designed and delivered around the lives and needs of the people who use them."" He added that the government remains ""committed to expiring or suspending any existing provisions that are no longer necessary, and will continue to report to Parliament every two months on the use of any temporary powers"". The public will have 12 weeks until the consultation period ends on 9 November to share their views. Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said: ""These powers were intended to be temporary measures to deal with the pandemic. ""The fact that SNP ministers are now seeking to make many of them permanent is a clear sign they are unwilling to give up their control over people's lives. ""It is a dangerous route to go down to allow ministers to implement sweeping powers upon society on a whim."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The Hong Kong government has
announced that from Friday, arrivals from 15 countries that have beennewly reclassified as âhigh riskâ,externalwill have to quarantine for 21 days. Residents from countries
including the US, France and Spain will have to quarantine for this length of
time, regardless of whether or not they have been vaccinated. This is currently
already the rule for UK arrivals as it is classed as âhigh riskâ due to prevalence of the Delta variant. Accordingto the South China Morning Post,external, the government is also scrapping airport antibody tests for
travellers,
which previously enabled people from âmedium riskâ countries to shorten their
quarantine to as little as seven days. Hong Kong Free Press says these
moves combinedhave triggered âtravel plan chaosâ,externaland that many travellers are now âscrambling to secure a room at one of the
cityâs designated quarantine hotelsâ amid fresh concerns they may not be able
to fly, due to quarantine hotel room shortages. Meanwhile, in nearby Macau,
some local Covid-19 restrictions are set to be relaxed from tomorrow.
Entertainment venues closed across the city at the beginning of the month,
after four people tested positive with the Delta variant. As there have been no new cases
for the last 13 days,the Macau Daily Times says,externalthat from tomorrow, venues
including cinemas, gyms and bars will be allowed to reopen. A further nine people have died in Scotland within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, according to the latest Scottish government figures. Another 1,815 cases were reported, and 338 people were in hospital yesterday with recently confirmed Covid-19. The medicines regulator has said the Moderna Covid vaccine is safe and effective to use in 12 to 17-year-olds across the UK. The vaccine had already been authorised for use in Northern Ireland in July but now has approval in England, Wales in Scotland too. Three Covid vaccines are being used in the UK after being approved: Moderna, Oxford AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech.

The Manx government says drop-in jabs for eligible teenagers will begin on Saturday. The first session, offering the Pfizer jab, takes place between 11:00 and 15:00 BST. A second session will be held the following Wednesday between 14:30 and 16:00. Those attending will be offered a single jab, in line with advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Laura FosterBBC Health correspondent The
medicines regulator has said the Moderna Covid vaccine is safe and effective to
use in 12 to 17 year olds across the UK. The vaccine had already been authorised for use
in Northern Ireland in July but now has approval in England, Wales in Scotland
too. But this does not mean it can be offered immediately
to all teenagers. Now we need to hear what the Joint Committee on
Vaccinations and Immunisations will recommend. Last month, it recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech
jab could be offered to 16 and 17 year olds, over 12s with underlying health
condition or anyone living with others who are at high risk. There are no plans currently to offer the Pfizer
jab to 12 to 15 year olds. We have yet to see whether the Moderna vaccine
will be offered to the same groups, or whether itâll be offered to all 12 to 17 year olds. Boris Johnson has welcomed Tuesday's employment figures - describing the fall in unemployment in the three months to June to 4.7% as ""encouraging"".

Birmingham say they have developed a Covid test that is as sensitive as  PCR screening but can give results in just a few minutes without the need for a laboratory. They hope it will be a potential solution for testing at airports - amid concerns about rising prices and poor service by private testing firms. The test - called RTF-EXPAR - uses the exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR) method to detect results in
less than 10 minutes, even for low levels of virus, the researchers said. At low levels of virus, results were
detected in around 8.75 minutes, while at high concentrations the detection
time was just 3.08 minutes. An internal government review of the pricing and
standards of service from test providers was announced at the weekend, asthe cost of NHS tests for travel was reduced. Fukuoka prefecture is included under the state of emergency measures Japan has extended its state of emergency in Tokyo and other regions and unveiled new measures covering seven more areas to tackle a spike in coronavirus cases, Reuters reports. The current state of emergency had been due to end on 31 August but will now remain in place until 12 September. It comes as the capital Tokyo announced 4,377 positive cases on
Tuesday, after a record 5,773 on Friday. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the Delta variant first identified in India and now spreading around the world was causing ""unprecedented cases"" in Japan. ""Serious cases are
increasing rapidly and severely burdening the medical system,
particularly in the capital region,"" he added. The extended state of emergency will cover almost 60% of Japan's population as the prefectures of
Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Shizuoka, Kyoto, Hyogo and Fukuoka are included. Another 10 prefectures will be put under less strict ""quasi-emergency"" measures. Under the latest restrictions, restaurants will be asked to close early and stop serving alcohol in exchange for a subsidy. The government will also request occupancy limits at
department stores and ask people to reduce the number of times they
go to crowded areas. It comes as organisers of the Tokyo Paralympic Gamesbanned spectators from attending events there due to coronavirus. Fans were barred from venues in the capital for the Olympics, with events held in some other regions allowed up to 50% capacity. Everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine - with 16 and 17-year-olds currently being offered a single dose. There are an estimated 1.4 million people in this age group and NHS England says nearly 16,000 have already received the vaccine. But around athird of 18-29-year-olds in England are still thought not to have had a single jab. People aged over 18 do not need parental consent as they are considered capable of making their own medical treatment decisions. You can't choose which vaccine you receive but if you're under 40 or pregnantyou will be offered Pfizer or Moderna, while under-18s will be offered Pfizer, as Moderna has not yet been licensed for this age group in the UK.

The country music star gave$1m (Â£750,000) to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville- one of the trial sites for the Moderna vaccine. The singer, 75, said she had felt
compelled to help because she sensed ""something bad"" was on its way. She told Absolute Radio Country:
""When the pandemic came out, I just felt led to do something because I
knew something bad was on the rise and I just kind of wanted to help with that,
so I donated to help with that. ""So, mine was a small part, of
course, but I probably get a lot more credit than I deserve, but I was happy to
be part of that, and to be able to try stop something in its tracks that's
really just become such a monster for all of us."" On receiving a dose of the vaccine that she helped to fund back in March,she reworked the lyrics to one of her hit songsto encourage people to take up the offer of the jab. To the tune of Jolene, Parton sang:
""Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, I'm begging of you, please don't
hesitate. Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, because once you're dead, then
that's a bit too late."" There isan urgent call for action on ventilation in schools- to slow the spread of Covid-19 - when pupils return in September. Six education unions have written to England's education secretary, warning of a steep rise in Covid and ""long Covid"" when pupils return to classes. Rules on keeping pupils in ""bubble groups""and face masks were relaxed by Gavin Williamson at the end of last term. But unions say better airflow measures would limit disruption and sickness, and are demanding funding for carbon-dioxide monitors and micro-filters. The Department for Education is yet to comment on the demand - but a parliamentary answer revealed no funding had been allocated specifically to school ventilation since January.

The Manx government says drop-in jabs for eligible teenagers will begin on Saturday. The first session, offering the Pfizer jab, takes place between 11:00 and 15:00 BST. A second session will be held the following Wednesday between 14:30 and 16:00. Those attending will be offered a single jab, in line with advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Laura FosterBBC Health correspondent The
medicines regulator has said the Moderna Covid vaccine is safe and effective to
use in 12 to 17 year olds across the UK. The vaccine had already been authorised for use
in Northern Ireland in July but now has approval in England, Wales in Scotland
too. But this does not mean it can be offered immediately
to all teenagers. Now we need to hear what the Joint Committee on
Vaccinations and Immunisations will recommend. Last month, it recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech
jab could be offered to 16 and 17 year olds, over 12s with underlying health
condition or anyone living with others who are at high risk. There are no plans currently to offer the Pfizer
jab to 12 to 15 year olds. We have yet to see whether the Moderna vaccine
will be offered to the same groups, or whether itâll be offered to all 12 to 17 year olds. Boris Johnson has welcomed Tuesday's employment figures - describing the fall in unemployment in the three months to June to 4.7% as ""encouraging"". The prime minister wrote on Twitter that the economy was ""showing signs of recovery across the country with employment up and unemployment down"". But he cautioned ""there is still work to do"" as he championed the government's ""plan for jobs"".

Birmingham say they have developed a Covid test that is as sensitive as  PCR screening but can give results in just a few minutes without the need for a laboratory. They hope it will be a potential solution for testing at airports - amid concerns about rising prices and poor service by private testing firms. The test - called RTF-EXPAR - uses the exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR) method to detect results in
less than 10 minutes, even for low levels of virus, the researchers said. At low levels of virus, results were
detected in around 8.75 minutes, while at high concentrations the detection
time was just 3.08 minutes. An internal government review of the pricing and

Alan Macalalad, from Llwynypia, Rhondda Cynon Taf, died on 20 May last year after going into cardiac arrest at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant. The 44-year-old from the Philippines worked as a theatre assistant for Cardiff and Vale health board. An inquest heard he had Type-2 diabetes and needed surgery in 2019 due to having pneumonia and collapsed lungs. The pandemic led Mr Macalalad to raise concerns with his manager and his GP about Covid-19 and his duties were changed and moved to a role where there would be no contact with patients. On 5 May 2020, his wife Elsie, who is a nurse at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda, called to say she had been sent home with Covid-19 symptoms. He was asymptomatic but he was also sent home to self-isolate and did eventually show symptoms. Mr Macalalad was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 20 May where he suffered a blocked blood vessel in the lungs and went into cardiac arrest.

Taking a holiday abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to enjoy a break in the UK this summer. But what are the rules?  However, there are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:  The Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September You can read our full explainerhere. The Scottish government is seeking to make many of its emergency coronavirus powers permanent, including the ability to close schools, introduce lockdowns and operate virtual courts. It is also looking at a change in the law to permanently allow them to release prisoners early or permit a wider range of healthcare workers to administer vaccinations. In June,MSPs agreed to extend the emergency measures until March 2022, with the option of extending them for six months, to September 2022, without passing a new law. Announcing a public consultation on removing the planned expiry date, SNP Deputy First Minister and Covid Recovery Secretary John Swinney insisted that some of the changes have had a ""demonstrable benefit to the people of Scotland"". The consultation published by ministers argues that making many of the measures permanent would ensure ""ministers can respond effectively and rapidly to any future threats to public health in Scotland"" and not just coronavirus. Under the proposals, ministers would also be able to order school closures ""during the remainder of the pandemic"" or for any future outbreak of an infectious disease, so long as they believe it is ""necessary and proportionate"", and the chief medical officer has been consulted. The consultation also suggests a permanent shift to more digital options, including the remote registration of deaths or still births, council meetings and electronic court documents. Mr Swinney said: ""As we enter the recovery phase, we now have a unique opportunity to reimagine how health and social care, learning and justice services can be designed and delivered around the lives and needs of the people who use them."" He added that the government remains ""committed to expiring or suspending any existing provisions that are no longer necessary, and will continue to report to Parliament every two months on the use of any temporary powers"". The public will have 12 weeks until the consultation period ends on 9 November to share their views. Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said: ""These powers were intended to be temporary measures to deal with the pandemic. ""The fact that SNP ministers are now seeking to make many of them permanent is a clear sign they are unwilling to give up their control over people's lives. ""It is a dangerous route to go down to allow ministers to implement sweeping powers upon society on a whim."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The Hong Kong government has

Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said reports from hospitals suggested people reporting to emergency departments were ""much sicker and require higher levels of care"" amid Covid pressures.

The Manx government says drop-in jabs for eligible teenagers will begin on Saturday. The first session, offering the Pfizer jab, takes place between 11:00 and 15:00 BST. A second session will be held the following Wednesday between 14:30 and 16:00. Those attending will be offered a single jab, in line with advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Laura FosterBBC Health correspondent The
medicines regulator has said the Moderna Covid vaccine is safe and effective to
use in 12 to 17 year olds across the UK. The vaccine had already been authorised for use
in Northern Ireland in July but now has approval in England, Wales in Scotland
too. But this does not mean it can be offered immediately
to all teenagers. Now we need to hear what the Joint Committee on
Vaccinations and Immunisations will recommend. Last month, it recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech
jab could be offered to 16 and 17 year olds, over 12s with underlying health
condition or anyone living with others who are at high risk. There are no plans currently to offer the Pfizer
jab to 12 to 15 year olds. We have yet to see whether the Moderna vaccine
will be offered to the same groups, or whether itâll be offered to all 12 to 17 year olds. Boris Johnson has welcomed Tuesday's employment figures - describing the fall in unemployment in the three months to June to 4.7% as ""encouraging"". The prime minister wrote on Twitter that the economy was ""showing signs of recovery across the country with employment up and unemployment down"". But he cautioned ""there is still work to do"" as he championed the government's ""plan for jobs"". Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showed job vacancieshave hit a record high as the UK's labour market continues to ""rebound robustly"". Allow Twitter content?

Birmingham say they have developed a Covid test that is as sensitive as  PCR screening but can give results in just a few minutes without the need for a laboratory. They hope it will be a potential solution for testing at airports - amid concerns about rising prices and poor service by private testing firms. The test - called RTF-EXPAR - uses the exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR) method to detect results in
less than 10 minutes, even for low levels of virus, the researchers said. At low levels of virus, results were
detected in around 8.75 minutes, while at high concentrations the detection
time was just 3.08 minutes. An internal government review of the pricing and
standards of service from test providers was announced at the weekend, asthe cost of NHS tests for travel was reduced. Fukuoka prefecture is included under the state of emergency measures Japan has extended its state of emergency in Tokyo and other regions and unveiled new measures covering seven more areas to tackle a spike in coronavirus cases, Reuters reports. The current state of emergency had been due to end on 31 August but will now remain in place until 12 September. It comes as the capital Tokyo announced 4,377 positive cases on
Tuesday, after a record 5,773 on Friday. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the Delta variant first identified in India and now spreading around the world was causing ""unprecedented cases"" in Japan. ""Serious cases are
increasing rapidly and severely burdening the medical system,
particularly in the capital region,"" he added. The extended state of emergency will cover almost 60% of Japan's population as the prefectures of
Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Shizuoka, Kyoto, Hyogo and Fukuoka are included. Another 10 prefectures will be put under less strict ""quasi-emergency"" measures. Under the latest restrictions, restaurants will be asked to close early and stop serving alcohol in exchange for a subsidy. The government will also request occupancy limits at
department stores and ask people to reduce the number of times they
go to crowded areas. It comes as organisers of the Tokyo Paralympic Gamesbanned spectators from attending events there due to coronavirus. Fans were barred from venues in the capital for the Olympics, with events held in some other regions allowed up to 50% capacity. Everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine - with 16 and 17-year-olds currently being offered a single dose. There are an estimated 1.4 million people in this age group and NHS England says nearly 16,000 have already received the vaccine. But around athird of 18-29-year-olds in England are still thought not to have had a single jab. People aged over 18 do not need parental consent as they are considered capable of making their own medical treatment decisions. You can't choose which vaccine you receive but if you're under 40 or pregnantyou will be offered Pfizer or Moderna, while under-18s will be offered Pfizer, as Moderna has not yet been licensed for this age group in the UK.

The country music star gave$1m (Â£750,000) to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville- one of the trial sites for the Moderna vaccine. The singer, 75, said she had felt
compelled to help because she sensed ""something bad"" was on its way. She told Absolute Radio Country:
""When the pandemic came out, I just felt led to do something because I
knew something bad was on the rise and I just kind of wanted to help with that,
so I donated to help with that. ""So, mine was a small part, of
course, but I probably get a lot more credit than I deserve, but I was happy to
be part of that, and to be able to try stop something in its tracks that's
really just become such a monster for all of us."" On receiving a dose of the vaccine that she helped to fund back in March,she reworked the lyrics to one of her hit songsto encourage people to take up the offer of the jab. To the tune of Jolene, Parton sang:
""Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, I'm begging of you, please don't
hesitate. Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, because once you're dead, then
that's a bit too late."" There isan urgent call for action on ventilation in schools- to slow the spread of Covid-19 - when pupils return in September. Six education unions have written to England's education secretary, warning of a steep rise in Covid and ""long Covid"" when pupils return to classes.

"Job vacancies have hit a record high as the UK's labour market continues to ""rebound robustly"", according to the latest official figures. The number of vacancies hit 953,000 in the three months to July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in the three months to June, while the annual growth in average pay was 7.4%. However, the ONS urged caution in reading too much into the rise in wages. ONS deputy statistician Jonathan Athow told the BBC that while the rise in average pay ""hasn't been that high for a long time"", it also compares to last year when millions of people were on furlough and were not being paid their full wage. ""This time last year we had millions of people on furlough many getting 80% of their wages, other people having their hours cut, and that pushed wages down,"" he said. ""So when we look at wages this year, when people have come back from furlough, it's really been boosted by the fact that last year wages were quite low. Some of this group was just wages returning to the level before the pandemic."" Photographer, farmer and plasterer job ads rise UK economy rebounds as Covid restrictions ease The ONS said payrolls rose by 182,000 between June and July, although at 28.9 million it is still 201,000 lower than before the pandemic struck. The number of people on payroll has now grown over half a million in the past three months, regaining about four-fifths of the fall seen at the start of the pandemic. Ollie Brightman, co-owner of a digital marketing agency in Bristol, says he has been struggling to recruit staff due to the competitive jobs market. The 35-year-old toldRadio 5 Live's Your Call programmehiring freelancers was a good short-term solution for his agency, but ""very expensive"" in the long term. ""We are absolutely desperate for all matter of digital marketing candidates at the moment. Pretty much anyone within those industries we are crying out for,"" he said. However, John Parmenter, a carpenter from Hertfordshire, has been benefitting from the demand for skilled workers. He has seen his hourly rate shoot up from Â£19 on average, to between Â£25 and Â£30 in the past few months. The 53-year-old said he was getting called ""every few hours"" by agencies. ""It's quite a nice feeling,"" he said. ""It's the first time it's ever happened in 30 years. They ask what you want, not what they're paying. It's a nice change. ""During the lockdown, with the pandemic, unfortunately I wasn't entitled to any payments so I'm just trying to reap some money back to try and pay off some existing bills that have escalated. I just don't know what's round the corner so we're just going to surf it and make the most of it."" Overall, Mr Athow said the ""world of work continues to rebound robustly"" from the pandemic. He said that early survey figures show that the number of job vacancies passed one million for the first time ever in July. Arts, leisure and food service firms were among those making a big contribution to the surge in job openings. ""There was no sign of redundancies starting to pick up in our survey data ahead of the furlough scheme beginning to wind down, and Insolvency Service figures for July suggest the same,"" Mr Athow added. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I know there could still be bumps in the road but the data is promising - there are now more employees on payrolls than at any point since March 2020 and the number of people on furlough is the lowest since the scheme launched."" The furlough scheme isset to finish at the end of September. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the jobs data should calm fears that the ending of government support measures could send unemployment higher. ""The figures add weight to our view that there won't be a big shake-out in employment once the furlough scheme expires at the end of September. ""It was encouraging that PAYE employment in July rose by 182,000 month-on-month and the claimant count fell by 7,800 month-on-month leaving the claimant count rate unchanged at 5.7%,"" she said. These figures show a jobs market in robust recovery as the economy reopens and the furlough scheme starts to be phased out. Employment is up on all measures, unemployment down and experimental numbers in the month of July showed there are over one million vacancies. There are record numbers of unfilled jobs, in sectors such as entertainment, accommodation and food, underlining the concerns of industry on labour shortages. The number of payroll jobs reported on the HMRC systems is now very close to its pre pandemic level at 28.9 million now compared with 29 million in March 2020. That number is up 576,000 over the past year and 182,000 up in July alone. The growth in that varies considerably between regions, with holiday areas such as Cornwall and west Wales showing annual rates of growth of around 5%, far above the rates in major cities. The chancellor welcomed the figures as ""promising"". Analysts warned that the unemployment figures would rise as the furlough scheme continued to be phased out. But the peak unemployment rate is on course to be significantly lower than had been expected last year. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: ""The labour market outperformed expectations as the economy accelerated with the relaxation of Covid-related restrictions. ""Changes to the business environment, such as the fall in business travel and the rise in online commerce, increased the need for skills, from IT specialists to hauliers, while at the same time caused an unusually high level of mismatch in the UK's labour market.""

"PCR tests for travel have become ""a predictable Covid rip-off"", says the former chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority, Lord Tyrie. Lord Tyrie said the competition regulator had been ""too slow to react"" to complaints about testing providers. Holidaymakers have objected to high prices and poor service from many of the 400-plus test firms listed on the government's website. Tests cost about Â£75 on average, but prices can reach hundreds. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid asked the CMA to investigate ""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. Initially, the CMA said it would take up to a month to report back. But after a chorus of objection from the travel industry, the CMA said it was reviewing the situation ""immediately"". Cost of NHS Covid tests for UK arrivals reduced Watchdog will look at Covid test cost immediately Anger at overflowing Covid test drop boxes Lord Tyrie told the BBC that the CMA ""could and should have been better prepared"". ""It should either be acting already directly using existing powers. Or if deemed inadequate for the job, it should be advising the government on how to obtain a quick remedy, whether by legislation or by other means,"" he said. ""This advice should already be with the government."" Lord Tyrie left the competition watchdog last summer after two years in the post, suggesting the role prevented him leading a more aggressive campaign for change. He added: ""The CMA acted much more quickly to quell price-gouging on hand sanitiser and other Covid-related products 18 months ago. Far from building on this success, boldness appears to have taken a back seat."" Lord Tyrie reflected that ""the CMA is full of able and highly motivated people, keen to tackle detriment like this"". ""Their energies need to be released from an excess of caution at the highest levels,"" he added. At the weekend, the cost of NHS coronavirus tests for international arrivals to the UK was reduced. Test and Trace tests were cut from Â£88 to Â£68 for people arriving from green-listed countries, as well as for those coming from amber-listed countries who are fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, the price of two tests for amber arrivals who have not had both jabs has been cut from Â£170 to Â£136. What are the holiday rules for travel to green, amber and red list countries? It is understood the price cut is an attempt to drive down the cost across the market, so other operators will follow. Criticism of the government's decision to implement PCR Covid testing for all UK arrivals has been significant from the travel sector. Last week, major airports including the Manchester Airport Group and Gatwick Airport, along with tour operator Tui, cited the testing policy as a major barrier to travel restarting and the industry recovering. The government said its top priority was to protect public health and it continued to work with industry to help them navigate this difficult period. Lord Tyrie said that the slow response of the CMA was likely to mean it was too late to offer a full remedy to the market before the peak holiday season comes to a close and people return to work and school in September. But the CMA said: ""These comments are inaccurate."" The watchdog said it gave advice to Department of Health and Social Care officials about the PCR testing market in April and ""we gave further advice to the secretary of state last week"". A spokesperson for the CMA said: ""We continue to work closely with Department of Health and Social Care in reviewing the market and, as we have made clear, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action ourselves if there are breaches of consumer law. ""Since the start of the pandemic, the CMA has secured hundreds of millions of pounds in refunds for people who have been treated unfairly, in sectors including holiday accommodation and package travel.""

"It's one of the most striking images from the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban. Hundreds of Afghans packed into a US military cargo plane as they flee Kabul. The faces, many male but with some women and children, look up towards the camera, their expressions a mixture of anxiety and possibly some relief. The image was initially obtained by the US defence analysis website, Defense One, but was released by the US Air Mobility Command public affairs office on Tuesday. On Sunday, panicked civilians had scrambled up the loading ramp, Defense One quoted a US official as saying, but the crew decided it was best to take off rather than force the Afghans off the plane. The number onboard - 640 - is among the highest carried by that type of plane, a C-17 Globemaster. It's approaching, though still some way off, the record for the number of people transported by any plane - an Israeli Boeing 747 carrying more than 1,000 Jewish migrants from Ethiopia in 1991. The US defence official quoted by Defense One, says the flight from Kabul to Qatar was one of several which managed to extract hundreds of Afghans from Kabul. The photo stands in contrast to the chaotic images which emerged from Kabul airport on Monday as it was overrun by Afghans terrified at the prospect of Taliban rule. US soldiers struggled to keep control. This video can not be played Chaotic scenes at Kabul airport as people try desperately to flee An image of the same type of plane from Monday showed hundreds of Afghans running alongside the moving aircraft, some clinging to the side. Local media reports said at least two fell to their deaths once it took off. Some have questioned why it is predominantly men seen at the airport. One explanation is that many women have been staying indoors, fearing how they will be treated by the Taliban. Another is that many families would want their men to leave first so they can help from outside Afghanistan, financially, and eventually find a way to bring their loved ones out of the country. While the airlifts will be welcomed by many, the numbers could be a drop in the ocean of those who feel compelled to leave in fear of the Taliban. The UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, has called on countries not to force the return of Afghans previously deemed not to need protection. It estimates 550,000 Afghans have been internally displaced by the conflict since the beginning of the year. Between 20,000 and 30,000 are thought to be fleeing across borders every week, the UNHCR's Afghanistan representative, Caroline Van Buren, told CNN. And government figures suggest 120,000 moved to Kabul as Taliban forces closed in. Many of those in fear for their lives have worked with US-led forces, notably as translators or contractors. But the Taliban's treatment of women during its previous rule in the 1990s and its use of barbaric punishments is another major spur to leave. At the beginning of August, the White House announced a plan to allow thousands of Afghans with links to the US to resettle there. On Monday, President Joe Biden announced $500m (Â£362m) in aid for Afghan refugees. The US has relocated some 2,000 Afghans out of the country under its Special Immigrant Visa scheme, officials say, and plans to transport thousands more. Other countries are helping out too, including Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel told party leaders that Germany may need to evacuate some 10,000 people, including 2,500 support staff. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Breakfast that 150 British nationals were flown out on Sunday. Last week, the UK extracted 289 Afghans. Several hundred more will leave in the next 24 hours, he said. But the turmoil in Afghanistan has raised fears in Europe of a new influx of migrants. A stark illustration is Turkey's decision to boost security at its lengthy border with Iran where Turkey is building a concrete wall. Have you or a loved one been evacuated from Afghanistan?

Meanwhile, 47,369,418 people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine - a rise of 35,716 on the previous day. There have been a total of 40,841,971 second doses, a rise of 138,390 on the previous day. So far, more than 89.6% of the adult population have had a first jab, while 77.2% are fully vaccinated. An NHS worker in Wales who died from coronavirus was unlikely to have caught the virus at work, a coroner has ruled. Alan Macalalad, from Llwynypia, Rhondda Cynon Taf, died on 20 May last year after going into cardiac arrest at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant. The 44-year-old from the Philippines worked as a theatre assistant for Cardiff and Vale health board. An inquest heard he had Type-2 diabetes and needed surgery in 2019 due to having pneumonia and collapsed lungs. The pandemic led Mr Macalalad to raise concerns with his manager and his GP about Covid-19 and his duties were changed and moved to a role where there would be no contact with patients. On 5 May 2020, his wife Elsie, who is a nurse at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda, called to say she had been sent home with Covid-19 symptoms. He was asymptomatic but he was also sent home to self-isolate and did eventually show symptoms. Mr Macalalad was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 20 May where he suffered a blocked blood vessel in the lungs and went into cardiac arrest. Coroner Graeme Hughes said the medical cause of death was Covid-19 pneumonitis leading to coronary thromboembolism and diabetes. You can read morehere. Taking a holiday abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to enjoy a break in the UK this summer. But what are the rules?  However, there are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:  The Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September You can read our full explainerhere. The Scottish government is seeking to make many of its emergency coronavirus powers permanent, including the ability to close schools, introduce lockdowns and operate virtual courts. It is also looking at a change in the law to permanently allow them to release prisoners early or permit a wider range of healthcare workers to administer vaccinations. In June,MSPs agreed to extend the emergency measures until March 2022, with the option of extending them for six months, to September 2022, without passing a new law. Announcing a public consultation on removing the planned expiry date, SNP Deputy First Minister and Covid Recovery Secretary John Swinney insisted that some of the changes have had a ""demonstrable benefit to the people of Scotland"". The consultation published by ministers argues that making many of the measures permanent would ensure ""ministers can respond effectively and rapidly to any future threats to public health in Scotland"" and not just coronavirus. Under the proposals, ministers would also be able to order school closures ""during the remainder of the pandemic"" or for any future outbreak of an infectious disease, so long as they believe it is ""necessary and proportionate"", and the chief medical officer has been consulted. The consultation also suggests a permanent shift to more digital options, including the remote registration of deaths or still births, council meetings and electronic court documents. Mr Swinney said: ""As we enter the recovery phase, we now have a unique opportunity to reimagine how health and social care, learning and justice services can be designed and delivered around the lives and needs of the people who use them."" He added that the government remains ""committed to expiring or suspending any existing provisions that are no longer necessary, and will continue to report to Parliament every two months on the use of any temporary powers"". The public will have 12 weeks until the consultation period ends on 9 November to share their views. Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said: ""These powers were intended to be temporary measures to deal with the pandemic. ""The fact that SNP ministers are now seeking to make many of them permanent is a clear sign they are unwilling to give up their control over people's lives. ""It is a dangerous route to go down to allow ministers to implement sweeping powers upon society on a whim."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The Hong Kong government has
announced that from Friday, arrivals from 15 countries that have beennewly reclassified as âhigh riskâ,externalwill have to quarantine for 21 days. Residents from countries
including the US, France and Spain will have to quarantine for this length of
time, regardless of whether or not they have been vaccinated. This is currently
already the rule for UK arrivals as it is classed as âhigh riskâ due to prevalence of the Delta variant. Accordingto the South China Morning Post,external, the government is also scrapping airport antibody tests for
travellers,
which previously enabled people from âmedium riskâ countries to shorten their
quarantine to as little as seven days. Hong Kong Free Press says these
moves combinedhave triggered âtravel plan chaosâ,externaland that many travellers are now âscrambling to secure a room at one of the
cityâs designated quarantine hotelsâ amid fresh concerns they may not be able
to fly, due to quarantine hotel room shortages. Meanwhile, in nearby Macau,
some local Covid-19 restrictions are set to be relaxed from tomorrow.
Entertainment venues closed across the city at the beginning of the month,
after four people tested positive with the Delta variant. As there have been no new cases
for the last 13 days,the Macau Daily Times says,externalthat from tomorrow, venues

A further nine people have died in Scotland within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, according to the latest Scottish government figures. Another 1,815 cases were reported, and 338 people were in hospital yesterday with recently confirmed Covid-19. The medicines regulator has said the Moderna Covid vaccine is safe and effective to use in 12 to 17-year-olds across the UK. The vaccine had already been authorised for use in Northern Ireland in July but now has approval in England, Wales in Scotland too. Three Covid vaccines are being used in the UK after being approved: Moderna, Oxford AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech. But how can approving a vaccine - a process which usually takes at least ten years - be done in less than one? BBC health reporter Laura Foster explains. This video can not be played Covid vaccine: How does a vaccine get approved? The number of people seen within four hours in A&E departments across Scotland has fallen to the lowest level since at least February 2015, new figures show. NHS statistics for the week ending 8 August showed just 76.5% of people were dealt with within the target time. The Scottish government's aim is for 95% to be seen and subsequently admitted or discharged in that time. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said reports from hospitals suggested people reporting to emergency departments were ""much sicker and require higher levels of care"" amid Covid pressures.

The Manx government says drop-in jabs for eligible teenagers will begin on Saturday. The first session, offering the Pfizer jab, takes place between 11:00 and 15:00 BST. A second session will be held the following Wednesday between 14:30 and 16:00. Those attending will be offered a single jab, in line with advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Laura FosterBBC Health correspondent The
medicines regulator has said the Moderna Covid vaccine is safe and effective to
use in 12 to 17 year olds across the UK. The vaccine had already been authorised for use
in Northern Ireland in July but now has approval in England, Wales in Scotland
too. But this does not mean it can be offered immediately
to all teenagers. Now we need to hear what the Joint Committee on
Vaccinations and Immunisations will recommend. Last month, it recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech
jab could be offered to 16 and 17 year olds, over 12s with underlying health
condition or anyone living with others who are at high risk. There are no plans currently to offer the Pfizer
jab to 12 to 15 year olds. We have yet to see whether the Moderna vaccine
will be offered to the same groups, or whether itâll be offered to all 12 to 17 year olds.

Birmingham say they have developed a Covid test that is as sensitive as  PCR screening but can give results in just a few minutes without the need for a laboratory. They hope it will be a potential solution for testing at airports - amid concerns about rising prices and poor service by private testing firms. The test - called RTF-EXPAR - uses the exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR) method to detect results in
less than 10 minutes, even for low levels of virus, the researchers said. At low levels of virus, results were
detected in around 8.75 minutes, while at high concentrations the detection
time was just 3.08 minutes. An internal government review of the pricing and
standards of service from test providers was announced at the weekend, asthe cost of NHS tests for travel was reduced. Fukuoka prefecture is included under the state of emergency measures Japan has extended its state of emergency in Tokyo and other regions and unveiled new measures covering seven more areas to tackle a spike in coronavirus cases, Reuters reports. The current state of emergency had been due to end on 31 August but will now remain in place until 12 September. It comes as the capital Tokyo announced 4,377 positive cases on
Tuesday, after a record 5,773 on Friday. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the Delta variant first identified in India and now spreading around the world was causing ""unprecedented cases"" in Japan. ""Serious cases are
increasing rapidly and severely burdening the medical system,
particularly in the capital region,"" he added. The extended state of emergency will cover almost 60% of Japan's population as the prefectures of
Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Shizuoka, Kyoto, Hyogo and Fukuoka are included. Another 10 prefectures will be put under less strict ""quasi-emergency"" measures. Under the latest restrictions, restaurants will be asked to close early and stop serving alcohol in exchange for a subsidy. The government will also request occupancy limits at
department stores and ask people to reduce the number of times they
go to crowded areas. It comes as organisers of the Tokyo Paralympic Gamesbanned spectators from attending events there due to coronavirus. Fans were barred from venues in the capital for the Olympics, with events held in some other regions allowed up to 50% capacity. Everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine - with 16 and 17-year-olds currently being offered a single dose. There are an estimated 1.4 million people in this age group and NHS England says nearly 16,000 have already received the vaccine. But around athird of 18-29-year-olds in England are still thought not to have had a single jab. People aged over 18 do not need parental consent as they are considered capable of making their own medical treatment decisions. You can't choose which vaccine you receive but if you're under 40 or pregnantyou will be offered Pfizer or Moderna, while under-18s will be offered Pfizer, as Moderna has not yet been licensed for this age group in the UK.

The country music star gave$1m (Â£750,000) to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville- one of the trial sites for the Moderna vaccine. The singer, 75, said she had felt
compelled to help because she sensed ""something bad"" was on its way. She told Absolute Radio Country:
""When the pandemic came out, I just felt led to do something because I
knew something bad was on the rise and I just kind of wanted to help with that,
so I donated to help with that. ""So, mine was a small part, of
course, but I probably get a lot more credit than I deserve, but I was happy to
be part of that, and to be able to try stop something in its tracks that's
really just become such a monster for all of us."" On receiving a dose of the vaccine that she helped to fund back in March,she reworked the lyrics to one of her hit songsto encourage people to take up the offer of the jab. To the tune of Jolene, Parton sang:
""Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, I'm begging of you, please don't
hesitate. Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, because once you're dead, then
that's a bit too late."" There isan urgent call for action on ventilation in schools- to slow the spread of Covid-19 - when pupils return in September. Six education unions have written to England's education secretary, warning of a steep rise in Covid and ""long Covid"" when pupils return to classes.

"Matt, Johnny and their friends are happy to use an app or queue at the bar: whichever is fastest Customers should think carefully about handing over personal data when ordering food and drink via their mobile phones, the UK's body overseeing data privacy suggests. App and web-based ordering has become commonplace during the pandemic. But the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC that customers should be aware they had a choice over whether to share information. Venues should only ask for data that is ""relevant and necessary"", the ICO said. ""I think it's too easy to upload an app and straight away put your name, email address, payment details in, without actually understanding fully where that information may be shared and why it's being used,"" said Suzanne Gordon, director of data protection at the ICO. ""Ultimately this is your data, it's your personal information and you need to be confident when you're handing it over and the reasons why."" Online ordering is popular with many customers, sparing them the crush at the bar and helping to reduce the risk from Covid. But they're popular with businesses too, because they speed up the ordering process and provide an additional way to interact with customers. Apps now handle millions of pounds worth of transactions every day. And it looks as though they are here to stay. Apart from in Northern Ireland, where you still have to be served at the table, restaurants and bars across the UK can now return to pre-pandemic style service at the bar or from waiting staff. But most are keeping their online ordering too. How Covid turbocharged the QR revolution Is there a solution to the hospitality staff crisis? One group of friends, gathered for a drink in the sunshine at the Courtyard in Manchester, said they were happy either to use the app or to order at the bar, whichever would get their pint to them the fastest. But there were downsides to the apps, they admitted. ""You end up with 10 different passwords, I've got so many different apps,"" said Johnny. ""You give your postcode or your email, a lot of it seems irrelevant."" ""It is irrelevant,"" added Matt. ""But it's a cost we kind of have to pay."" But the ICO said sharing personal data was far from obligatory. ""Customers need to understand they do have a choice. We're now coming out of the pandemic and there's the ability to order on the app or in the more traditional way,"" said Ms Gordon. ""I think it is very easy for people just to see the end product, and because they want that, they really don't question the amount of data that they are being asked for,"" she added. The UK's four biggest pub chains, representing a quarter of the market - Wetherspoons, Greene King, Mitchells and Butlers and Stonegate - all now have their own in-house apps. The developers behind apps for independent venues say they have seen huge growth during the pandemic. They all say they follow the guidelines informing customers of their rights and how their data will be dealt with. But those terms and conditions are unlikely to be closely read by a lot of people. Over the last year, lots of businesses have suddenly got a mountain of information about their customers that they didn't have access to before. Your local knows your name, an email address, maybe your date of birth, maybe your home address. For the bar or pub, that's incredibly valuable information, worth much more than the round you just bought. It tells them what you like drinking, what time you're likely to visit, who you were sitting with and how frequently you reorder. Perhaps you're not bothered about the offers and discounts sent by them, but you might be more annoyed by calls from other companies, which could be in the small print of the app. Car insurance companies would be very interested in how much and how frequently you drink, while any number of other businesses would love to get hold of your mobile number. The law says you can always ask a company to stop sending you spam, but it's a lot easier to make sure you tick or untick the right boxes in the app to start with, or just put the phone down and order in person. Most apps work by charging a venue approximately 2% to 3% transaction charge per order. In return, the technology can help streamline the ordering process, but can also offer the chance to learn a little about customers' habits and profiles. ""Hospitality is struggling,"" says Luke Beavon, financial director at one of the independent app providers, GoodEats. ""But the app gives them the ability to follow up with a customer and get them back through the door again."" Once registered, ease of use makes it more likely that customers will have another drink or an additional item, according to Chris Dunkley, director of another independent app, Hopt. ""Hopt hugely increases spend-per-head for the operator,"" he said. However, hospitality firms that do use the new technology should respect some boundaries, said the ICO's Ms Gordon. ""If [firms] are asking for data, they need to understand why they are asking for it and they need to make sure it is relevant and necessary,"" she said. ""It's up to them to make sure it isn't excessive."" Alex Mackenzie and Sadra Hosseini, cofounders of ordering app Butlr, say they've reduced the amount of information it asks users to fill in The app developers appear to be taking that advice on board. The Courtyard, where Matt and Johnny are drinking, uses an app called Butlr, which accounts for about a third of the pub's orders, or more at weekends. But the amount of data the app collects has been reduced since it was first launched in 2018, says Butlr co-founder Alex Mackenzie. ""When we had our first venues go live, it was quite a rigorous sign-up process, but the data we collect from individuals has gradually worn away now,"" said Mr Mackenzie. ""We want to make it as simple and easy as possible."" Prask Sutton, chief executive of another app provider, Onvi, said the business kept ordering as simple as possible. ""We don't believe customers should have to hand over excessive personal information just to grab a pint at the pub. They're going for a drink, not applying for a mortgage.""

"Hydrogen fuel cells can power vehicles Thousands of new jobs could be created by investing in low-carbon hydrogen fuel to power vehicles and heat homes, the government says. Ministers have unveiled a strategy for kick-starting a hydrogen industry, which they say could attract billions of pounds in investment. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the fuel was also essential for UK efforts to reach net zero emissions. He said it had the potential to provide a third of UK energy in future. Because of the current higher cost involved in producing hydrogen compared to existing fuels, subsidies have been proposed to overcome the gap. The government has launched a consultation on this plan. Labour also backs hydrogen's potential, but said the government had failed to invest as much as other countries. Using hydrogen gas as a fuel produces no carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution. It can be used to power fuel cells - devices that generate electricity through an electrochemical reaction - used in a turbine for electricity or burned in a boiler and vehicle engine. As such, it is a low-carbon, versatile fuel that can be used by cars, trucks and trains, heat our homes and generate the power needed for industrial processes such as steel production. Is the hydrogen tech 'revolution' hope or hype? Can hydrogen fuel help drive towards green future? The government plans to deliver 5GW of hydrogen production capacity by 2030, estimating that the industry could be worth Â£900m and support more than 9,000 jobs by the same date. Hydrogen-powered trains are undergoing tests ""Today marks the start of the UK's hydrogen revolution. This home-grown clean energy source has the potential to transform the way we power our lives and will be essential to tackling climate change and reaching net zero,"" said Mr Kwarteng. ""Our strategy positions the UK as first in the global race to ramp up hydrogen technology and seize the thousands of jobs and private investment that come with it."" Reaching net zero by 2050 will involve cutting emissions as much as possible and then balancing out any remaining ones by planting trees or burying CO2 underground. The potential role of hydrogen in achieving this target has been highlighted by a government analysis suggesting 20-35% of the UK's energy consumption by 2050 could be hydrogen-based. A low-carbon hydrogen economy could deliver emissions savings equivalent to the carbon captured by 700 million trees by 2032, the government claims. It would help decarbonise polluting industries such as chemical production and oil refining and heavy transport such as shipping and rail. Experts say there is an urgent need to reduce emissions from home heating Alan Whitehead MP, Labour's shadow minister for energy and the green new deal, said hydrogen power had a ""significant role"" to play in decarbonising the economy. But he added: ""The belated publication of this hydrogen strategy needs to be followed up with urgent action. That is what we will judge the government on because too many of the Tories' warm words and targets on climate change have not been followed up with practical steps. ""It is regrettable that the Conservatives have failed to match the investment shown by other countries and key decisions have been delayed, such as mandating that all boilers must be hydrogen-ready."" The government is proposing subsidies for the hydrogen industry along the lines of those credited with driving down the cost of offshore wind power. It will also review the infrastructure - thought by some to be very costly - needed to underpin hydrogen power in the UK. Ministers want a twin-track approach to hydrogen production. So-called blue hydrogen is made using fossil fuels, but its environmental impact can be mitigated by capturing and storing greenhouse emissions underground. Green hydrogen, meanwhile, is made using renewable energy. This video can not be played The Hydroflex made a 25-mile round-trip in Warwickshire, reaching speeds of up to 50 mph Though blue hydrogen is not as clean as the green form, it is cheaper. Environmental campaigners say there is too much focus in the strategy on blue hydrogen. Jess Ralston, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the government should ""be alive to the risk of gas industry lobbying causing it to commit too heavily to blue hydrogen and so keeping the country locked into fossil fuel based technology"". This, she added, would make reaching net zero more difficult and costly. Philip Dunne MP, chair of the environmental audit committee, commented: ""While the twin track approach proposed, supporting both green and blue hydrogen production, is positive, it is also important that substantial capacity for carbon capture is developed, so as to avert release of damaging emissions currently created in blue hydrogen production."" In fact, one study by researchers in the US has suggested that blue hydrogencould release more carbon than burning natural gas.,external Dr Jan Rosenow, from the Regulatory Assistance Project, an organisation dedicated towards accelerating the transition to clean energy, said: ""As the strategy admits, there won't be significant quantities of low-carbon hydrogen for some time. We need to use it where there are few alternatives and not as a like-for-like replacement of gas. He said the plan confirmed that ""hydrogen for heating our homes will not play a significant role before 2030. The government's strategy shows that less than 0.2% of all homes are expected to use hydrogen to keep warm in the next decade. This means that for reducing emissions this decade, hydrogen will play only a very marginal role. ""But we cannot wait until 2030 before bringing down emissions from heating. The urgency of the climate crisis requires bold policy action now.""

"Job vacancies have hit a record high as the UK's labour market continues to ""rebound robustly"", according to the latest official figures. The number of vacancies hit 953,000 in the three months to July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in the three months to June, while the annual growth in average pay was 7.4%. However, the ONS urged caution in reading too much into the rise in wages. ONS deputy statistician Jonathan Athow told the BBC that while the rise in average pay ""hasn't been that high for a long time"", it also compares to last year when millions of people were on furlough and were not being paid their full wage. ""This time last year we had millions of people on furlough many getting 80% of their wages, other people having their hours cut, and that pushed wages down,"" he said. ""So when we look at wages this year, when people have come back from furlough, it's really been boosted by the fact that last year wages were quite low. Some of this group was just wages returning to the level before the pandemic."" Photographer, farmer and plasterer job ads rise UK economy rebounds as Covid restrictions ease The ONS said payrolls rose by 182,000 between June and July, although at 28.9 million it is still 201,000 lower than before the pandemic struck. The number of people on payroll has now grown over half a million in the past three months, regaining about four-fifths of the fall seen at the start of the pandemic. Ollie Brightman, co-owner of a digital marketing agency in Bristol, says he has been struggling to recruit staff due to the competitive jobs market. The 35-year-old toldRadio 5 Live's Your Call programmehiring freelancers was a good short-term solution for his agency, but ""very expensive"" in the long term. ""We are absolutely desperate for all matter of digital marketing candidates at the moment. Pretty much anyone within those industries we are crying out for,"" he said. However, John Parmenter, a carpenter from Hertfordshire, has been benefitting from the demand for skilled workers. He has seen his hourly rate shoot up from Â£19 on average, to between Â£25 and Â£30 in the past few months. The 53-year-old said he was getting called ""every few hours"" by agencies. ""It's quite a nice feeling,"" he said. ""It's the first time it's ever happened in 30 years. They ask what you want, not what they're paying. It's a nice change. ""During the lockdown, with the pandemic, unfortunately I wasn't entitled to any payments so I'm just trying to reap some money back to try and pay off some existing bills that have escalated. I just don't know what's round the corner so we're just going to surf it and make the most of it."" Overall, Mr Athow said the ""world of work continues to rebound robustly"" from the pandemic. He said that early survey figures show that the number of job vacancies passed one million for the first time ever in July. Arts, leisure and food service firms were among those making a big contribution to the surge in job openings. ""There was no sign of redundancies starting to pick up in our survey data ahead of the furlough scheme beginning to wind down, and Insolvency Service figures for July suggest the same,"" Mr Athow added. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I know there could still be bumps in the road but the data is promising - there are now more employees on payrolls than at any point since March 2020 and the number of people on furlough is the lowest since the scheme launched."" The furlough scheme isset to finish at the end of September. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the jobs data should calm fears that the ending of government support measures could send unemployment higher. ""The figures add weight to our view that there won't be a big shake-out in employment once the furlough scheme expires at the end of September. ""It was encouraging that PAYE employment in July rose by 182,000 month-on-month and the claimant count fell by 7,800 month-on-month leaving the claimant count rate unchanged at 5.7%,"" she said. These figures show a jobs market in robust recovery as the economy reopens and the furlough scheme starts to be phased out. Employment is up on all measures, unemployment down and experimental numbers in the month of July showed there are over one million vacancies. There are record numbers of unfilled jobs, in sectors such as entertainment, accommodation and food, underlining the concerns of industry on labour shortages. The number of payroll jobs reported on the HMRC systems is now very close to its pre pandemic level at 28.9 million now compared with 29 million in March 2020. That number is up 576,000 over the past year and 182,000 up in July alone. The growth in that varies considerably between regions, with holiday areas such as Cornwall and west Wales showing annual rates of growth of around 5%, far above the rates in major cities. The chancellor welcomed the figures as ""promising"". Analysts warned that the unemployment figures would rise as the furlough scheme continued to be phased out. But the peak unemployment rate is on course to be significantly lower than had been expected last year. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: ""The labour market outperformed expectations as the economy accelerated with the relaxation of Covid-related restrictions. ""Changes to the business environment, such as the fall in business travel and the rise in online commerce, increased the need for skills, from IT specialists to hauliers, while at the same time caused an unusually high level of mismatch in the UK's labour market.""

"Wrightbus is to create 300 permanent jobs to build its zero-emission buses. The company said it would also convert 120 temporary jobs into permanent positions at its Ballymena headquarters. Wrightbus said it would have 930 permanent members of staff when the new jobs were filled. Jo Bamford, who bought the company in 2019 after it went into administration, said the company was ""firmly back in business, creating jobs"". In March, it was announced the Ballymena-based manufacturer would receiveÂ£11.2m from the government to develop hydrogen-fuel technology. The company had already started to increase its workforce afterTranslink ordered 100 zero-emission buses in December 2020. Twenty of them will be hydrogen powered and the other 80 will be battery operated.

On Tuesday, the UK governmentunveiled a strategy for kick-starting a hydrogen industry,which they say could attract billions of pounds in investment. Wrightbus managing director Neil Collins said the company had been reinvigorated. ""Our order book is looking very healthy with our zero emission buses in high demand, and we have multiple conversations ongoing with a number of bus operators from across the UK and Ireland,"" he added. ""We're building an incredible team in Ballymena and we want the best people to come and work for us. ""We're aiming to increase bus production again next year, which will in turn lead to the creation of even more permanent jobs."" Mr Bamford said building the workforce from the 56 that remained when he bought the company in 2019 was ""incredibly satisfying"". ""We're continuing to invest not only in employees, but in the technological advances that will keep our buses at the very pinnacle of the industry,"" he added. Last year, Translink put in an order for 20 hydrogen-powered buses North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said it was great news for the local economy. ""Hydrogen technology is the way ahead for zero emissions and a hydrogen hub in Ballymena training engineers and developing products would be a natural fit for the area,"" he said. ""The prospects of this throw out challenges to schools and colleges to encourage engineering and science subjects to local children as there will be significant and skilled jobs available in this sector in the years ahead.""
