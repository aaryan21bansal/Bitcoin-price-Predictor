"Hairdressers fear a future staffing crisis as the pandemic has caused the already decreasing number of apprentices to fall further. The number of people starting hairdressing apprenticeships in England had halved between 2016 and 2020. The National Hair and Beauty Federation (NHBF) expects another drop of 30 to 50% in the coming year. The skills minister said any employer who took on a new apprentice before 30 September 2021 would get Â£3,000. Richard Lambert, the NHBF's chief executive, believes the lack of apprentices now could have a lasting impact. ""We've seen from other industries which have gone through recessions, construction for example, that if you have a period of a gap with apprentices coming in, that gap can then be seen through the whole of the career arc over the next forty years,"" he added. His organisation estimates that the number of people starting hairdressing and barbering apprenticeships has dropped from 15,450 in 2016/17 to around 7,000 in 2019/20. Richard Lambert said the lack of apprentices now could have a lasting impact Mr Lambert said he was concerned that ""hairdressing is not seen any more as a suitable career"". He said: ""Partly it's a concern that schools push the academic route at young people so they tend to be thinking about college and university rather than practical or vocational. ""But then Covid has just exacerbated everything on top of that."" Mr Lambert said opening with reduced capacity following months of lockdowns meant many salons could not afford to recruit people who would not immediately generate income. Dulcie Wilson, 17, started her two- to three-year apprenticeship in September and hopes it will help forge a career. She said: ""I've always been passionate about hair. It just came up as a really good opportunity and I've been enjoying it ever since. I feel I'm part of the real world and helping real people. ""I watch a lot of people and it really does help you learn, watching the stylists. So you're part of the team. ""Hopefully, I'll be a stylist here and work my way up, and just become better and better."" Dulcie said her favourite part was talking to clients and seeing the results of transformations. ""Cleaning the toilet is probably the least fun job, but it's still fun to be part of the team,"" she added. Carolyn Sweeney says she finds it hard to recruit the right people There are other routes to a hairdressing qualification, such as completing a college course. But Carolyn Sweeney, who owns Creations Hair & Beauty in Chichester, feels many who take that path do not arrive ready to start the job. ""What you learn [as an apprentice], from just being around other people, you don't get that at college.  The people skills, all the experience being in the salon."" She did not take on any apprentices in 2020 due to the time her business was closed. This year, she will be taking on three, instead of the usual four or five. One reason is the financial commitment required, at an uncertain time. Another is difficulty recruiting. ""We are finding it really hard to find the right people. It's a job that's all about passion and creativity. You've got to have people who believe in what they're doing because it's really hard work."" She is also concerned about the rise in self-employed practitioners who, according to the NHBF, very rarely employ apprentices. ""Who is investing in the future of our industry? That's a real worry. I just don't know where the hairdressers of the future are going to come from. And good quality, we want good quality people"". In 2016/17,15,450people started hairdressing and barbering apprenticeships in England. By 2017/2018, the figure was11,500, a drop of just over 26% due to changes in apprenticeship standards and funding. In 2018/2019 there was another 13% drop with10,000people registering for the placements. And the latest figures for 2019/20 show around7,000people started the on-the-job training - a drop of 30% compared to the previous year. Source:National Hair and Beauty Federation. Gillian Keegan, Minister for Apprenticeships and Skills, said as well as the Â£3,000 incentive being offered, the government had introduced flexibilities to ensure apprenticeships could continue during the pandemic. She said: ""We are also creating opportunities for young people through our Â£2 billion Kickstart Scheme, expanding our traineeships and sector-based Work Academy Programme and supporting employers to offer more apprenticeships."" Mr Lambert from the NHBF believes there is no quick fix or simple solution - but there are some grounds for optimism. ""People are now valuing their hairdressers much more. Having tried to do it at home themselves they've realised it's a much more skilled job than they thought it was,"" he said. ""It's not just about cutting hair, but the opportunity to start your own business as well."" Why we're not returning to the hairdressers.

"Sajid Javid has been appointed health secretary following the resignation of Matt Hancock who stepped down for breaking social distancing guidelines. Mr Javid previously served as home secretary under former Prime Minister Theresa May, and in 2019 was promoted to chancellor by Boris Johnson. However he only lasted in that role for six months, resigning in February 2020 following tensions with the prime minister's then-advisor Dominic Cummings. Mr Javid was told he would have to sack his own advisors, but he rejected the order saying it was something ""no self-respecting minister"" could accept. Following his resignation as chancellor, Mr Javid returned to life as a backbench MP, but also took up a job with JP Morgan. Since becoming health secretary, Mr Javid has given up his role at the US bank. Matt Hancock resigns after breaking Covid guidance Sajid Javid resigns as chancellor Listen: BBC Radio 4's Profile of Sajid Javid The MP for Bromsgrove since 2010 was born in Rochdale in 1969, one of five sons of parents who had moved to the UK from Pakistan. Mr Javid, a 50-year-old father of four,told the Evening Standard in 2012,external: ""My dad was from a tiny village in Pakistan and came here when he was 17 to look for work. ""He settled in Rochdale and became a cotton-mill worker for Courtaulds. But he was quite ambitious, and saw that bus drivers were better paid. His nickname was Mr Night and Day because he used to work every hour God sent his way."" Mr Javid's father's job was the same as the father of another high-profile politician, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and he congratulated the Labour politician ""from one son of a Pakistani bus driver to another"" after his City Hall victory in 2016. Mr Javid spent his school years in Bristol after his parents took over a ladieswear shop there, with the family living in a two-bed flat above it. Hetold the Daily Mail,externalin 2014 that the school, a local comprehensive, was tough and ""I was naughty, more interested in watching Grange Hill than homework."" But, he said, things changed when his dad read the riot act. ""He said 'this is what I went through, don't let me down'. I felt really bad. My academic work rocketed."" He said that his school did not want to pay for him to do maths O-Level - his dad ended paying for it instead. Sajid Javid previously served in Boris Johnson's cabinet as chancellor He had also developed an interest in financial markets, sparked by the Thatcher government's privatisations. At the age of 14 he went to see his father's bank manager and arranged to borrow Â£500 to invest in shares, becoming a regular reader of the Financial Times. His goal became to work in the City so he passed that maths O-Level and, rejecting his school's suggestion he become a TV repair man, headed off to sixth form college and then to Exeter University to study economics and politics - giving a clear hint of his future career direction. He also met his future wife, Laura, while doing a summer job at Commercial Union. They sat opposite each other and shared a stapler, he told the Daily Mail. Their four children are privately educated: ""We do what's best for them,"" Mr Javid, who has described himself as a non-practising Muslim, told the newspaper. After university, he set his sights on a job in the City. As he told the Standard: ""Some people, in a friendly way, tried to lower my expectations. ""They often tell you that unless you wear an old school tie or have the family contacts, you just won't get a chance to work in the City. But they were wrong."" His career move worked out well, although he had to move across the Atlantic to succeed. And by the age of 25, he had become a vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank, later moving to Singapore for a period with Deutsche Bank. He rose to become a managing director before leaving in the summer of 2009 to concentrate on a political career. A Conservative Party supporter from the early 1980s, he had attended his first conference towards the end of the Thatcher years, with Conservative friends from university such as fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon. They got into a bit of trouble at the 1990 conference, handing out leaflets against the then prime minister's decision to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, opposing the policy despite being diehard fans of Mrs Thatcher's. According to aConservativeHome profile,,externalMr Javid, Mr Halfon, another future Tory MP David Burrowes and Tim Montgomerie - founder of ConservativeHome - got up at 07:00 so they could get front-row seats for what turned out to be Mrs Thatcher's final party conference speech. Two decades on and, in 2010, he was elected for the first time, and made swift progress. He began his ministerial career with roles in the Treasury, before becoming the first cabinet minister of Asian descent when he was appointed culture, media and sport secretary in 2014. He did that for a year before moving to business secretary for a year and then moving on to be communities and local government secretary. Sajid Javid (third from left) with the 2014 Budget team Long thought of as a Eurosceptic, it was a surprise to many when Mr Javid came out for Remain during the UK's 2016 referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. That meant, of course, that like then-Home Secretary Theresa May and his one-time mentor, then Chancellor George Osborne, he was on the losing side. There was an ill-fated and very short-lived bid to succeed David Cameron as Conservative leader after the referendum, on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb. (He would have been chancellor to Mr Crabb's prime minister.) He also ran in the 2019 leadership election but was eliminated in the fourth round before Mr Johnson went on to become prime minister. Mr Javid was appointed home secretary in April 2018, following the resignation of Amber Rudd during the fallout fromthe Windrush scandal. At the time, Mr Javidtold the Sunday Telegraph,externalthe scandal ""immediately impacted him"". Mr Javid told the newspaper: ""When I heard about the Windrush issue, I thought that could be my mum, it could be my dad, it could be my uncle, it could be me."" In 2019 he took a hardline stance towardsShamima Begum, who left London to join the Islamic State group aged 15, revoking her British citizenship when she asked to return. The move boosted his popularity amongst some Tories but provoked criticism from others - particularly after her newborn son died in a Syrian refugee camp. Mr Javid talking to Tata Steel workers in 2016 In his previous cabinet roles he avoided major calamity, although he faced questions as business secretaryover Tata steel, and as communities secretary over the government response to theGrenfell disaster,external. However, he had not been afraid to ruffle feathers, with uncompromising messages to some in the business community and local government.

"Matt Hancock had Gina Coladangelo with him when he visited the BBC on 6 June Health Secretary Matt Hancock has resigned after he admitted breaching social distancing guidance, saying ""those of us who make these rules have got to stick by them"". His resignation and apology followedphotos published by the Sun newspaper,externalshowing him in an embrace with a colleague, Gina Coladangelo. The paper says the photos of the pair - both of whom are married - were taken inside the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on 6 May 2021. Labour and the Liberal Democrats had called for the health secretary to be sacked before he quit. Social distancing in workplaces is not a legal requirement, but it is recommended. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE)says,external: ""Where possible you should keep people 2m apart. If this is not viable, keeping 1m apart with risk mitigation is acceptable."" The government'sguidelines,externalsay: ""When you cannot redesign an activity to meet social distance guidelines, ask if your business can continue without that activity."" Face coverings are not mandatory in offices. Guidance says they are ""not a replacement for the other ways of managing risk including ""minimising time spent in contact"". On 6 May, England was still atStage 2 of Covid restrictions. When it came to gatherings indoors, the law stated: ""No person may participate in a gathering... which consists of two or more people and takes place indoors."" There was an exception for work purposes but only if the gathering was ""reasonably necessary"". ""I cannot see how that exception could apply in the circumstances,"" Adam Wagner, a barrister from Doughty Street Chambers who is an expert on the lockdown restrictions told BBC Reality Check. ""Based on what we know, this seems to me to have been an illegal gathering."" The week before the photo is said to have been taken, Mr Hancock said: ""This is no time for complacency, it's a time for caution."" Speaking at aDowning Street press conference,external, he reminded the public to ""remember the basics of hands, face, space, and fresh air"". On 11 May, he said that once restrictions were eased he would be ""trusting people's personal responsibility"" on whether to hug others. He told Sky News: ""It depends on people's circumstances."" On 16 May, he told Sky News: ""Of course, there's people who have been yearning to have some physical contact - you should do that carefully."" On the subject of hugging, he added: ""The thing I'm really looking forward to is hugging my Mum... we'll probably do it outside and keep the ventilation going."" That was the day before hugging was allowed under the guidelines, on 17 May. A year before the photos were taken, he commented on the actions of Prof Neil Ferguson. Prof Ferguson quit as a government adviser afterthe Telegraph reported,externalthat a woman he was said to be in a relationship with had visited his home in lockdown. At the time, Mr Hancock told Sky News that it was ""just not possible"" for Prof Ferguson to continue advising the government. He said the social distancing rules ""are there for everyone"" and are ""deadly serious"". The Ministerial Code,externalsays ministers ""are expected to maintain high standards of behaviour and to behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety"". It also says that they ""must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise"". A DHSC spokesperson was asked about the appointment of Gina Coladangelo (a friend of Mr Hancock since university) as a non-executive director of the health department last year and said: ""This appointment was made in the usual way and followed correct procedure"". Dr Catherine Haddon, from the Institute of Government, says: ""There is a good case to be made that Hancock may have broken some... aspects of the ministerial code"". But she questioned whether an inquiry into this would take place: ""It is still up to the prime minister to decide whether the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Interests can look into a minister"". Downing Street had said Boris Johnson had accepted Mr Hancock's apology and considered the matter closed, before the health secretary stepped down on Saturday, 26 June.

"Below is the full text of Matt Hancock's resignation letter addressed to the Prime Minister: ""I am writing to resign as Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. We have worked so hard as a country to fight the pandemic. The last thing I would want is for my private life to distract attention from the single-minded focus that is leading us out of this crisis. I want to reiterate my apology for breaking the guidance, and apologise to my family and loved ones for putting them through this. I also need (to) be with my children at this time. ""We owe it to people who have sacrificed so much in this pandemic to be honest when we have let them down as I have done by breaching the guidance. ""The NHS is the best gift a nation has ever given itself, and the dedication and courage of the NHS staff and the ceaseless work of the officials in the Department is something we should all be proud of. We didn't get every decision right but I know people understand how hard it is to deal with the unknown, making the difficult trade-offs between freedom, prosperity and health that we have faced. I am so proud that Britain avoided the catastrophe of an overwhelmed NHS and that through foresight and brilliant science we have led the world in the vaccination effort, so we stand on the brink of a return to normality. ""The reforms we have started in the health system will ensure it continues to provide even better care for people in years to come. We are building a better NHS which makes smarter use of technology and data, forming a new UK Health Security Agency, delivering positive changes to mental health care and will fix the problems in social care once and for all. ""Many times I stood at the podium in Downing Street and thanked the team - my own team, the NHS, the volunteers, the Armed Services, our pharmacists GPs, the pharmaceutical industry and the whole British public who have made such sacrifices to help others. Those thanks are heartfelt and sincere and so I must resign. ""It has been the honour of my life to serve in your Cabinet as Secretary of State and I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved. I will of course continue to support you in whatever way I can from the back benches, and I would like to thank you for your unwavering support, your leadership and your optimism, particularly as we worked together to overcome this awful disease."" And here is the Prime Minister Boris Johnson's response in full ""Thank you for your letter this evening, tendering your resignation as Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. I am sorry to receive it. ""You should leave office very proud of what you have achieved - not just in tackling the pandemic, but even before Covid-19 struck us. Under your leadership, the Department has led fundamental reforms to the provision of care in this country. The NHS Long Term Plan was a major milestone in the history of that great institution. Your work on the Health and Care Bill will support our NHS and deliver greater integration between health and social care. And your efforts mean that we have a record numbers of doctors and over 14,800 more nurses working in our NHS than last year. ""Above all, it has been your task to deal with a challenge greater than that faced by any of your predecessors, and in fighting Covid you have risen to that challenge - with the abundant energy, intelligence and determination that are your hallmark. Under your leadership, the Department for Health and Social Care has identified and deployed critical life-saving treatments such as Dexamethasone, rapidly increased hospital capacity through the Nightingale programme, and provided 11.7 billion items of PPE to the frontline at record speed. ""In March 2020, we had the capacity to test 2,000 people a day; now, we have built the largest diagnostic network in British history and have administered over 200 million tests. The vaccine procurement and deployment programme - in my view one of the greatest successes of the modern state - is now forging our path out of the pandemic. ""Through the establishment of the United Kingdom Health Security Agency, you have also built the foundation to ensure the UK is better prepared for any future pandemic. ""You made a considerable contribution to Government before becoming Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. I know that previous Prime Ministers were grateful for your work in ministerial positions in the Department for Business, Innovation, and Skills, the Cabinet Office, and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. You have, across those roles, been a consistent and vigorous champion of the power of digital transformation. ""You should be immensely proud of your service. I am grateful for your support and believe that your contribution to public service is far from over.""

"Arsenal mascot Gunnersaurus has already been jabbed Stadiums, shopping centres and theatres will be among hundreds of walk-in vaccination sites to open across England this weekend in a bid to boost the number of people getting jabbed. The ""grab a jab"" campaign means any adult will be able to get a Covid vaccine without an appointment. NHS England boss Sir Simon Stevens said the country was in a ""race to the finish line"" in its vaccine programme. More than 44 million people in the UK have received at least one dose. A further 18,270 coronavirus cases in the UK were recorded on Saturday, according to the latest government figures, and there were a further 23 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of new cases in the UK is rising, with Saturday's figures the highest since early February. Push to close gap in Covid vaccine uptake How many people have been vaccinated so far? Arsenal stadium tours to encourage vaccine take-up Vaccine sites will be publicised locally so people can choose the location best for them, or they cantype in their postcode,externalto the NHS website to find their nearest site. Sporting grounds involved in the vaccination drive include the Newcastle Eagles basketball arena, Watford's Vicarage Road, Birmingham's Edgbaston cricket ground and Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. People who get a vaccine at the Emirates Stadium between now and Monday are being offered a free tour of the stadium as part of their visit. The event is calledGunner Get Jabbed, and organisers said they hoped to get ""even more people down there than were at Spurs' stadium"". In addition to mass vaccination centres, there will be buses offering jabs in Dudley, Colchester, Ipswich and several other towns. The statistics show 44m - 83.7% of the adult population - have received a first dose of a coronavirus jab and 32m - 61.2% - have had two doses. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon said: ""With more than 63 million jabs already delivered by the NHS in England, we're now in a race to the finish line, and with this new online service, it is easier than ever to find a convenient place to get your vaccine. ""With every jab give, we are one step closer to our summer freedoms."" The government aims to have offered a first dose to all adults by 19 July - the date when the final stage of lockdown easing is scheduled to go ahead. It also hopes to have at least 65% of adults fully vaccinated at that point, which it hopes will enable more big summer events to go ahead safely. This weekend marks the date when the 2021 Glastonbury Festival should have gone ahead and founder Michael Eavis recorded a video highlighting the grab-a-jab opportunities in his area.

London lags behind the rest of England in vaccine uptake, with data showing that an estimated 83.1% of over-50s in London had received both doses of vaccine by 20 June.

And here is the Prime Minister Boris Johnson's response in full ""Thank you for your letter this evening, tendering your resignation as Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. I am sorry to receive it. ""You should leave office very proud of what you have achieved - not just in tackling the pandemic, but even before Covid-19 struck us. Under your leadership, the Department has led fundamental reforms to the provision of care in this country. The NHS Long Term Plan was a major milestone in the history of that great institution. Your work on the Health and Care Bill will support our NHS and deliver greater integration between health and social care. And your efforts mean that we have a record numbers of doctors and over 14,800 more nurses working in our NHS than last year. ""Above all, it has been your task to deal with a challenge greater than that faced by any of your predecessors, and in fighting Covid you have risen to that challenge - with the abundant energy, intelligence and determination that are your hallmark. Under your leadership, the Department for Health and Social Care has identified and deployed critical life-saving treatments such as Dexamethasone, rapidly increased hospital capacity through the Nightingale programme, and provided 11.7 billion items of PPE to the frontline at record speed. ""In March 2020, we had the capacity to test 2,000 people a day; now, we have built the largest diagnostic network in British history and have administered over 200 million tests. The vaccine procurement and deployment programme - in my view one of the greatest successes of the modern state - is now forging our path out of the pandemic. ""Through the establishment of the United Kingdom Health Security Agency, you have also built the foundation to ensure the UK is better prepared for any future pandemic. ""You made a considerable contribution to Government before becoming Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. I know that previous Prime Ministers were grateful for your work in ministerial positions in the Department for Business, Innovation, and Skills, the Cabinet Office, and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. You have, across those roles, been a consistent and vigorous champion of the power of digital transformation. ""You should be immensely proud of your service. I am grateful for your support and believe that your contribution to public service is far from over.""

"Matt Hancock had Gina Coladangelo with him when he visited the BBC on 6 June Health Secretary Matt Hancock has resigned after he admitted breaching social distancing guidance, saying ""those of us who make these rules have got to stick by them"". His resignation and apology followedphotos published by the Sun newspaper,externalshowing him in an embrace with a colleague, Gina Coladangelo. The paper says the photos of the pair - both of whom are married - were taken inside the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on 6 May 2021. Labour and the Liberal Democrats had called for the health secretary to be sacked before he quit. Social distancing in workplaces is not a legal requirement, but it is recommended. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE)says,external: ""Where possible you should keep people 2m apart. If this is not viable, keeping 1m apart with risk mitigation is acceptable."" The government'sguidelines,externalsay: ""When you cannot redesign an activity to meet social distance guidelines, ask if your business can continue without that activity."" Face coverings are not mandatory in offices. Guidance says they are ""not a replacement for the other ways of managing risk including ""minimising time spent in contact"". On 6 May, England was still atStage 2 of Covid restrictions. When it came to gatherings indoors, the law stated: ""No person may participate in a gathering... which consists of two or more people and takes place indoors."" There was an exception for work purposes but only if the gathering was ""reasonably necessary"". ""I cannot see how that exception could apply in the circumstances,"" Adam Wagner, a barrister from Doughty Street Chambers who is an expert on the lockdown restrictions told BBC Reality Check. ""Based on what we know, this seems to me to have been an illegal gathering."" The week before the photo is said to have been taken, Mr Hancock said: ""This is no time for complacency, it's a time for caution."" Speaking at aDowning Street press conference,external, he reminded the public to ""remember the basics of hands, face, space, and fresh air"". On 11 May, he said that once restrictions were eased he would be ""trusting people's personal responsibility"" on whether to hug others. He told Sky News: ""It depends on people's circumstances."" On 16 May, he told Sky News: ""Of course, there's people who have been yearning to have some physical contact - you should do that carefully."" On the subject of hugging, he added: ""The thing I'm really looking forward to is hugging my Mum... we'll probably do it outside and keep the ventilation going."" That was the day before hugging was allowed under the guidelines, on 17 May. A year before the photos were taken, he commented on the actions of Prof Neil Ferguson. Prof Ferguson quit as a government adviser afterthe Telegraph reported,externalthat a woman he was said to be in a relationship with had visited his home in lockdown. At the time, Mr Hancock told Sky News that it was ""just not possible"" for Prof Ferguson to continue advising the government. He said the social distancing rules ""are there for everyone"" and are ""deadly serious"". The Ministerial Code,externalsays ministers ""are expected to maintain high standards of behaviour and to behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety"". It also says that they ""must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise"". A DHSC spokesperson was asked about the appointment of Gina Coladangelo (a friend of Mr Hancock since university) as a non-executive director of the health department last year and said: ""This appointment was made in the usual way and followed correct procedure"". Dr Catherine Haddon, from the Institute of Government, says: ""There is a good case to be made that Hancock may have broken some... aspects of the ministerial code"". But she questioned whether an inquiry into this would take place: ""It is still up to the prime minister to decide whether the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Interests can look into a minister"". Downing Street had said Boris Johnson had accepted Mr Hancock's apology and considered the matter closed, before the health secretary stepped down on Saturday, 26 June.

Guillem BalagueSpanish football journalist Barcelona are pushing for Lionel Messi to sign a new contractbefore his current deal runs out on 1 July. Contrary to reports, not everything has been agreed, but in the past 24 hours the club has raised the level of urgency shown in previous weeks, with a desire to announce the agreement before the start of next month. Messi's contract renewal is new president Joan Laporta's main priority and he is currently negotiating it directly with Messi's father and representative, Jorge Messi. To be able to keep the Argentine, the club will have to reduce their wage bill by around 200m euros (Â£172m) and to meet La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements. Laporta is happy to offer the 34-year-old a new two-year deal. Barcelona think Messi would like to go to Major League Soccer in the USA after the Qatar World Cup in 2022, although they would love to see him return to the club after that in any role or capacity of his choosing.

"Arsenal mascot Gunnersaurus has already been jabbed Stadiums, shopping centres and theatres will be among hundreds of walk-in vaccination sites to open across England this weekend in a bid to boost the number of people getting jabbed. The ""grab a jab"" campaign means any adult will be able to get a Covid vaccine without an appointment. NHS England boss Sir Simon Stevens said the country was in a ""race to the finish line"" in its vaccine programme. More than 44 million people in the UK have received at least one dose. A further 18,270 coronavirus cases in the UK were recorded on Saturday, according to the latest government figures, and there were a further 23 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of new cases in the UK is rising, with Saturday's figures the highest since early February. Push to close gap in Covid vaccine uptake How many people have been vaccinated so far? Arsenal stadium tours to encourage vaccine take-up Vaccine sites will be publicised locally so people can choose the location best for them, or they cantype in their postcode,externalto the NHS website to find their nearest site. Sporting grounds involved in the vaccination drive include the Newcastle Eagles basketball arena, Watford's Vicarage Road, Birmingham's Edgbaston cricket ground and Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. People who get a vaccine at the Emirates Stadium between now and Monday are being offered a free tour of the stadium as part of their visit. The event is calledGunner Get Jabbed, and organisers said they hoped to get ""even more people down there than were at Spurs' stadium"". In addition to mass vaccination centres, there will be buses offering jabs in Dudley, Colchester, Ipswich and several other towns. The statistics show 44m - 83.7% of the adult population - have received a first dose of a coronavirus jab and 32m - 61.2% - have had two doses. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon said: ""With more than 63 million jabs already delivered by the NHS in England, we're now in a race to the finish line, and with this new online service, it is easier than ever to find a convenient place to get your vaccine. ""With every jab give, we are one step closer to our summer freedoms."" The government aims to have offered a first dose to all adults by 19 July - the date when the final stage of lockdown easing is scheduled to go ahead. It also hopes to have at least 65% of adults fully vaccinated at that point, which it hopes will enable more big summer events to go ahead safely. This weekend marks the date when the 2021 Glastonbury Festival should have gone ahead and founder Michael Eavis recorded a video highlighting the grab-a-jab opportunities in his area.

""This weekend fortunately, all the people that have not been vaccinated so far in the country can actually get a jab. And they need to get it done, this weekend. The Glastonbury weekend,"" Mr Eavis said. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi and London Mayor Sadiq Khan joined a London vaccine summit on Friday in a bid to boost jab uptake in the capital. London lags behind the rest of England in vaccine uptake, with data showing that an estimated 83.1% of over-50s in London had received both doses of vaccine by 20 June. All other regions across the country are above 90%, according to the figures published by NHS England. Are you heading to a walk-in vaccination site?

"Matt Hancock was pictured leaving Downing Street with Gina Coladangelo on 1 May Matt Hancock's breach of social distancing guidance when he kissed an aide could damage government messaging on fighting the virus, families of Covid victims have warned. The health secretary has apologised after pictures emerged of him with Gina Coladangelo, reportedly taken on 6 May. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said failing to sack Mr Hancock could lead to a ""Cummings effect"" and people breaking the rules. The PM considers the matter closed. A Downing Street spokesman said Boris Johnson accepted Mr Hancock's apology, adding the prime minister had full confidence in the health secretary. However, some Conservative MPs have expressed anger over the revelations and one former minister said they did not expect the health secretary to survive the scandal, the BBC's political correspondent Jonathan Blake said. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has written to Mr Johnson urging him to sack Mr Hancock if he does not resign, and has questioned whether the health secretary can now hold any moral authority in relation to Covid. Rivka Gottlieb, from the campaign group, told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""If he were to announce another lockdown or further regulations why would anybody listen to someone who doesn't follow the rules themselves? It's a bit like the Cummings effect."" Last March, the prime minister's then-most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, drove 260 miles from his home in London to Durham during lockdown after he and his wife caught Covid - at a time when there were strict limits on travel. Despite widespread condemnation, the PM stood by his key adviser, saying Mr Cummings had ""no alternative"" but to travel. Ms Gottlieb said people had been ""outraged"" by Mr Cummings' actions, and she feared people would be more likely to break the rules if Mr Hancock remained in post. Social distancing at work is not a legal requirement, but the government recommends that peoplekeep 2m apart,externalwhere possible - or 1m with ""risk mitigation"", such as standing side by side or wearing masks. How did Matt Hancock break Covid restrictions? Matt Hancock: A high profile health secretary Queen describes health secretary as 'poor man' Prof Stephen Reicher, from University of St Andrews' School of Psychology, said what made the Cummings scenario ""truly toxic"" was not the government adviser's actions, but rather Mr Johnson's defence of them. ""An individual indiscretion turned into a systemic issue, a sense of there's one rule for us and another rule for them,"" Prof Reicher told BBC Two's Newsnight. ""In the midst of a huge national crisis, we want a government we trust and we want a government that we're going to listen to."" Cabinet colleagues of Mr Hancock have defended the health secretary. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Radio's 4 Any Questions programme: ""There's a task to be done, Matt is on the job doing that, and I think we should allow him to get on with the job."" He added: ""The rules have been hard. It is everybody's duty to follow the rules, but equally I've not been somebody who has criticised and condemned people when they've made mistakes."" International Trade Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC: ""[Mr Hancock] does have my support."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said there was ""a complete difference between what people do in their job... and what they do in their personal lives"". But Conservative commentator Tim Montgomerie, a former adviser to Mr Johnson, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he believed Mr Hancock had been ""a good secretary of state"" but should resign. ""When you undermine your own rules you have to show to the public that you understand the transgression you've made and you resign,"" he said. ""He could come back in 12 to 18 months but if the public don't see some act of contrition, some sense that when rules are broken there are consequences, then confidence in the government, the Covid rules and the Conservative party are diminished."" Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, told Today the extra-marital relationship should have been disclosed. Ms Coladangelo sits as a non-executive director of the Department of Health and ""if that information is kept secret from them that really is unforgiveable"", he said. ""Inevitably, there would have been issues where there was the potential to challenge the secretary of state from the board. If one of those members was having an intimate relationship with the secretary of state, it completely undermines those decisions,"" he added. Labour said Mr Hancock's position had become ""hopelessly untenable"" and has called for him to be sacked. A Labour spokesman said the matter was ""definitely not closed, despite the government's attempts to cover it up"". This video can not be played Labour's Anneliese Dodds on Matt Hancock: The prime minister needs to act In May last year, epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson resigned from the government's scientific advisory group (Sage) after it emerged he had broken lockdown rules when a woman he was reportedly in a relationship with visited his home. At the time, Mr Hancock said: ""Professor Ferguson is a very, very eminent and impressive scientist and the science that he's done has been an important part of what we've listened to and I think that he took the right decision... to resign."" When asked by Sky News whether he thought Prof Ferguson should be kept in his position, Mr Hancock replied: ""That's just not possible in these circumstance."" The Sun, which first published the photos of Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo, taken inside the Department of Health, carries further images of the pair on itsfront page on Saturday,external. The paper says the latest image is of Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo at a restaurant on 23 May - 17 days after the picture of the kiss. Boris Johnson doesn't do ministerial resignations. He resists calls from the opposition, the media - and even his own colleagues. His then aide Dominic Cummings wasn't sacked last spring for his 260-mile trip to Durham during lockdown. Unlike with Mr Cummings, there has been no cacophonous clamour from Mr Hancock's Conservative colleagues for him to go straight away. But there are concerns that he won't have credibility in the Commons or in the country to argue that the existing restrictions should be respected. And in retaining Mr Hancock in office, Boris Johnson has enabled political opponents to revive an attack which they believe has resonance with voters: that there is one rule for ministers - and another for everyone else. Ms Coladangelo, a friend of the health secretary since they worked on a student radio station at Oxford University, was made a non-executive director of the Department of Health last September. The role comes with a Â£15,000 salary and involves 15 to 20 days of work per year.

"Matt Hancock is facing calls to quit as health secretary from fellow Tory MPs after he breached social distancing guidance by kissing a colleague. The health secretary apologised after pictures emerged of him with Gina Coladangelo, reportedly taken on 6 May. Conservative MPs Duncan Baker and Sir Christopher Chope have said he should go, while former secretary of state Esther McVey said she would have quit in Mr Hancock's position. The PM considers the matter closed. A Downing Street spokesman said Boris Johnson accepted Mr Hancock's apology, adding the prime minister had full confidence in the health secretary. Labour and the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group have also called for the health secretary to be sacked. On Friday, The Sun published pictures of Mr Hancock and Ms Coladangelo, who are both married with three children, kissing. It said they had been taken inside the Department of Health on 6 May, leading the health secretary tosay he was ""very sorry"". How did Matt Hancock break Covid restrictions? Matt Hancock: A high profile health secretary Queen describes health secretary as 'poor man' North Norfolk's MP Mr Baker, who was the first Conservative MP to publicly call for Mr Hancock to quit, told hislocal newspaper the Eastern Daily Press,externalthat the health secretary had ""fallen short"" on a number of measures. Ms McVey, Conservative MP for Tatton, told GB News she would have resigned had she been in Mr Hancock's position and hoped he was ""thinking the same thing"". She added that it would be ""viewed more admirably"" if he came forward and did not have to have it ""pushed upon him"". Christchurch MP Sir Christopher told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that Mr Hancock's position had become ""untenable"", saying that his constituents were ""seething"". ""For that reason, the sooner he does the honourable thing and announces his resignation, the better - because otherwise it is not going to go away,"" he said. ""This is going to run and run, and it will impact adversely upon all of those of us who are involved in public life who are trying to set an example."" He added that Mr Hancock had been ""in charge of making the lives of millions of people a relative misery"" but that they had been complying. ""Now he's shown by his actions, that there's one law for him and a different law for everybody else."" Conservative commentator Tim Montgomerie, a former adviser to Mr Johnson, told BBC News Mr Hancock would probably survive in his job as there were concerns in No 10 that his sacking could lead to more scrutiny around other ministers and create a ""domino effect"". Meanwhile, the families of Covid victims warned the breach of social-distancing guidelines could damage government messaging on fighting the virus. Rivka Gottlieb, from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""If he were to announce another lockdown or further regulations why would anybody listen to someone who doesn't follow the rules themselves?"" She compared it to the prime minister's former senior adviser Dominic Cummings' trip from London to Durham during lockdown last March, when, despite widespread condemnation, Mr Johnson stuck by his aide. Cabinet colleagues have defended the health secretary with Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps all backing him publicly. The reaction to Matt Hancock's rule-breaking certainly has echoes of Dominic Cummings' trip to Barnard Castle: The health secretary is facing similar accusations of ""one rule for them"" hypocrisy. The prime minister has so far stood by him in a similar way. Some Conservatives are worried the public reaction could be similar too but, unlike with Dominic Cummings, most Tories have so far been notably silent. There is no co-ordinated public call for Matt Hancock to go. There is no big show of support either. Perhaps the more important question might be what they are saying to him privately over the coming days. Matt Hancock is an MP with ambition, so what his colleagues in Parliament think will matter. If he goes, it is much more likely to be through a resignation than a sacking. If MPs' inboxes begin to fill up with angry correspondence though, will the mood change? Concerns have also been raised about the process which saw Ms Coladangelo appointed as a non-executive director of the Department of Health. Ms Coladangelo - a friend of the health secretary since they worked on a student radio station at Oxford University - was appointed to the role - which comes with a Â£15,000 salary and involves 15 to 20 days of work per year - last September. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner has written to the cabinet secretary - the UK's most senior civil servant - asking him to investigate whether Mr Hancock broke ministerial rules by failing to declare the relationship. A No 10 spokesman insisted the ""correct procedure"" had been followed but refused to go into detail. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, told Today the relationship should have been disclosed, ""if that information is kept secret from them that really is unforgiveable"", he said. ""Inevitably, there would have been issues where there was the potential to challenge the secretary of state from the board. If one of those members was having an intimate relationship with the secretary of state, it completely undermines those decisions,"" he added. Labour said Mr Hancock's position had become ""hopelessly untenable"" and has called for him to be sacked. SNP Westminster deputy leader Kirsten Oswald said the prime minister ""risks jeopardising vital public health measures"" by retaining Mr Hancock as health secretary, saying there must be public confidence in those setting the rules. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey tweeted: ""Matt Hancock told millions of people that they couldn't hug their loved ones, and now refuses to resign even though he broke his own guidelines. The fact the prime minister has failed to take action shows the utter contempt this government has for the British people.""

Guillem BalagueSpanish football journalist Barcelona are pushing for Lionel Messi to sign a new contractbefore his current deal runs out on 1 July. Contrary to reports, not everything has been agreed, but in the past 24 hours the club has raised the level of urgency shown in previous weeks, with a desire to announce the agreement before the start of next month. Messi's contract renewal is new president Joan Laporta's main priority and he is currently negotiating it directly with Messi's father and representative, Jorge Messi. To be able to keep the Argentine, the club will have to reduce their wage bill by around 200m euros (Â£172m) and to meet La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements. Laporta is happy to offer the 34-year-old a new two-year deal. Barcelona think Messi would like to go to Major League Soccer in the USA after the Qatar World Cup in 2022, although they would love to see him return to the club after that in any role or capacity of his choosing.
