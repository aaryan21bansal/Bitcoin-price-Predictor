"This video can not be played BBC Weather's Simon King has the UK forecast A man has died after being swept out to sea in Kent as heavy rain, winds and ""unseasonably cold"" weather hit parts of the UK. Two other men were taken to hospital after being washed from East Pier in Ramsgate by a large wave, police said. A yellow warning,externalfor heavy rain and strong winds remains in place for southern and eastern parts of England for the whole of Monday. Forecasters said some areas could see more than a month's rainfall in a day. Some trains in the south-east of England were cancelled and roads have been blocked by fallen trees. The RNLI, whose crews were called to help the three men at Royal Harbour in Ramsgate, called the conditions ""atrocious"". They said they rescued two men from the water but one was pronounced dead at the scene. The third man had been knocked over on the harbour wall by the wave and has been airlifted to hospital. Strong winds have caused large waves across coastal areas in the south east, including in Ramsgate in Kent Also in Kent, firefighters rescued two adults and a baby from a car which was stuck in flood water in Sutton Valence, while another man in Herne Bay was trapped when a tree fell on his car. Meanwhile, two flood warnings - which means flooding is expected - remain in place along the River Nene, east of Peterborough, and on the coast in North Shields in north-east England. Flood warnings and alerts,external, issued by the Environment Agency, are in force across England and staff are maintaining defences at at-risk spots. By 07:00 BST, Kent had seen more than 20mm of rain in 24 hours - nearly half of the monthly average for this time of year - and gusts of 50mph have been recorded. Some services on Southeastern Railway were cancelled and others diverted because of flooding and a tree blocking the line at Charing in Kent. Southern Rail faced disruption because of speed restrictions due to the weather and a fallen tree, while a tree hanging over the line between Woking and Weybridge also affected some South Western Railway services. Several flights leavingLondon City Airport,externalhave been delayed. A spokesman for the airport said air traffic control restricted the number of flights that can take off and land because of the poor weather conditions. Strong winds have brought down trees across the south-east, including in Streatham, south London UK Power Networks, which covers part of the south-east of England, said although there are outages it was a ""normal day"" with no widespread problems due to the weather. The wet and windy weather is the result of an area of low pressure moving northwards overnight on Sunday. It will feel ""unseasonably cold"" for the time of year, the BBC Weather Centre said, with maximum temperatures about 6 to 7C in these areas, but feeling much colder under the rain and wind.

"Labour MP John Woodcock said he did not intend to discuss details of the issue ahead of any hearing An MP has been suspended by the Labour Party amid claims he sent inappropriate messages to a former female member of staff. Barrow and Furness MP John Woodcock said he was told in December that the complaint was being referred as a potential breach of the Labour Party's policy on sexual harassment. The Mirror reported that the aide felt uncomfortable,externaland left her job. Mr Woodcock has said he ""does not accept"" the allegation. A Labour Party spokesperson said he had been suspended ""pending due process"" and added ""it would not be appropriate to comment further on an ongoing case"". In a statement, Mr Woodcock said the complaint had been referred to Labour's national constitutional committee. ""I do not accept the charge being brought against me but have been co-operating fully with the process and remain committed to a thorough and fair investigation of the case,"" he said. ""I am therefore very concerned that one of the very few individuals with knowledge of the case chose to place selective details of it in newspapers this weekend. Labour's new general secretary has cited this publicity as a reason to suspend me from the Labour whip. ""The decision at this politically charged time to place details of my case in the press and then suspend me places a serious question mark over the integrity of the process, which serves neither those making complaints nor those facing allegations."" A Labour Party spokesperson said ""all allegations are fully investigated"" and any disciplinary action is ""taken in line with the party's rule book and procedures"".

"A postcard believed to have been sent by Jack the Ripper warning of two murders has been sold at auction. The note, which was sent to Ealing police station, warns the killer's knife ""is still in good order"". The card is dated 29 October 1888, which was 11 days before Mary Kelly - believed to be Jack the Ripper's final victim - was murdered on 9 November. The 2.75-inch by 4.75-inch card, sold for Â£22,000. The card once belonged to a Metropolitan Police constable who was given it when he retired from the force in 1966. The card, which had an estimate of Â£600 to Â£900 prior to sale, states: ""Beware there is two women I want here and I mean to have them my knife is still in good order it is a students knife and I hope you liked the kidney. ""I am Jack the Ripper."" Jonathan Riley of Grand Auctions in Folkestone, Kent, said a British private collector won a bidding war with an American for the rare letter, ""the likes of which have never come up for sale before"". The final price will be closer to Â£30,000 once an auction premium is paid, Mr Riley said, adding the sale shows ""how much interest in the Ripper there still is"". The card once belonged to a Metropolitan Police constable who was given it as a memento when he retired from the force in 1966. It was sold by his widow. The auctioneers state: ""There is mention of his 'students' knife in our card. Some believe that the ripper had some medical training from the way he cut up his victims, but this is not universally accepted. ""The kidney that was mentioned also appears in the 'Letter from Hell',another Ripper letter, where the writer stated he had fried one of his victim's kidneys and 'it tasted nice'. ""The card is definitely of the period and has police provenance."" Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London Jack the Ripper's murders remain the most notorious unsolved mystery in British criminal history. Between August and November 1888 he murdered five women in the Whitechapel area of east London. Dozens of letters signed ""Jack the Ripper"" were sent at the time, but many were - and still are - regarded as hoaxes. Speculation about his identity was rife at the time and remains so to this day.

"Jan Koum co-founded WhatsApp in 2009 WhatsApp chief executive Jan Koum is to quit the popular messaging service he co-founded. In a post on Facebook, he said he was ""taking some time off to do things I enjoy outside of technology"". However, according to aWashington Post report,externalearlier on Monday, Mr Koum had clashed with parent company Facebook over WhatsApp's strategy. He also objected to Facebook attempts to use WhatsApp's personal data and weaken its encryption standards. In his statement Mr Koum said: ""It's been almost a decade since Brian [Acton] and I started WhatsApp, and it's been an amazing journey with some of the best people. But it is time for me to move on. ""The team is stronger than ever and it'll continue to do amazing things... And I'll still be cheering WhatsApp on - just from the outside."" Stanford alumnus Brian Acton and Ukrainian immigrant Mr Koum co-founded WhatsApp in 2009, before selling it to Facebook in 2014 for $19bn (Â£13.8bn). The pair had long prized the protection and independence of WhatsApp user data, and made preserving it a condition of the Facebook takeover. WhatsApp is the largest messaging service in the world However, their relationship with Facebook has soured recently, according to reports. Read more about Facebook's privacy crisis: Zuckerberg faces angry Facebook developers Facebook 'downvote' button in new test Facebook to vet UK political ads for 2019 vote Reality Check: Was Facebook data's value 'literally nothing'? Mr Acton left the company in November and has joined other former executives in criticising Facebook. In March he endorsed the #deletefacebook social media campaign that took off after reports ofCambridge Analytica using Facebook's user datacame to light. Facebook has since revealed that the data of up to 87 million people was improperly shared with the consultancy and used for political purposes. Both men were also said to oppose Facebook efforts to commercialise WhatsApp, which has no advertising. According to the Washington Post, this included a Facebook plan to access the phone numbers of WhatsApp users along with other data. Facebook has since been prevented from making use of UK citizens' WhatsApp data for purposes beyond the chat app itself. Last year the EU also fined Facebook $122m for ""providing incorrect or misleading information"" about its intentions at the time of the WhatsApp acquisition. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg commented on Mr Koum's post, saying he was grateful for what Mr Koum taught him about encryption ""and its ability to take power from centralized systems and put it back in people's hands. Those values will always be at the heart of WhatsApp."" WhatsApp, with 1.5 billion monthly users, is the largest messaging service in the world. Allow Facebook content?

""We are doing all we can to support his family at this very difficult time."" Khost police chief Abdul Hanan told BBC Afghan that Shah had been shot by unidentified armed men. He said police were investigating the motive. Locals told the BBC that Shah had been on his bicycle when the attack happened. He was then taken to hospital, where he died of his injuries. The hell of losing loved ones in Afghanistan Remembering photographer Shah Marai He was in a normally safe area he was familiar with when the attack happened, the BBC's News and Current Affairs Director Fran Unsworth said. Last year,Afghanistan was ranked the third most dangerous country,externalin the world for journalists by Reporters without Borders. It said nine journalists had been killed in three separate attacks. Shah is the fifth BBC staff member to have been killed in Afghanistan since the country's devastating civil war in the 1990s. The others are: Mirwais Jalil, 25, who was attacked by four gunmen in 1994 Abdul Samad Rohaniwho was shot dead in Helmand Province in 2008 Ahmed Omed Khpulwak, 25, who was mistakenly killed by Nato-led forces in 2011 Mohammed Nazir, a BBC driver who was killed in a bomb attack in 2017 Khost, where the attack happened, borders Pakistan and was an important theatre in the conflict with militants after US-led forces invaded Afghanistan in 2001. The Taliban still has a presence in parts of the province but attacks are rare now. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, 26 people were killed in two bombings in the capital, Kabul. Nine journalists and photographers, and four police officers, were among those killed, officials say. Some 45 people were reported injured in the attacks. This video can not be played The second explosion targeted those at the scene of the first The first explosion was carried out by an attacker on a motorbike. A second followed about 15 minutes later after a crowd, including several reporters, had gathered at the scene. The AFP news agency said the second blast had deliberately targeted the group of journalists, including its photographer Shah Marai. The Islamic State group (IS) said it had carried out the attack. The intelligence services headquarters had been the target, IS said in a statement released through its self-styled news outlet Amaq. The Shashdarak district also houses the Defence Ministry and a Nato compound. And in a third attack, 11 children were killed in a suicide bombing intended to target Nato troops in Kandahar province.

"Peppa Pig is the latest subject of China's censors A popular British cartoon has been removed from one of China's most popular social media platforms, with state media saying that the character is being used subversively. Social media users in the country noticed video clips of the cartoon were being removed on Saturday, and on Monday, state newspaper Global Times said that the #PeppaPig hashtag had been removed from the Douyin video website, while searches for ""Peppa Pig"" on the site produced no results. Many papers also note that the platform appears to have added ""Peppa Pig"" to its list of blacklisted content. The Peppa Pig cartoon is hugely popular in China, but despite being targeted at a pre-school audience, it has found mass appeal with Chinese adults in recent months. Its characters have become a common feature in memes, including sexually suggestive content. ""After Peppa Pig started to take on this subversive hue and subsequently go viral, some experts said the popularity of the cartoon demonstrates the social psychology of hunting for novelty and spoofing, which could potentially hamper positive societal morale,""Global Times said,external. Beijing appears keen to quell subversive enthusiasm for the cartoon by trying to promote friendly domestic pig cartoons instead. Peppa Pig has been long popular with children in China, and has attracted some 34 billion views on domestic online video platforms. It was exported to China in the early 2000s, and over 100 translated episodes have aired in the mainland. Peppa Pig first aired on TV in 2004 It is shown on the children's channel of state broadcaster CCTV, and also hosted on a number of digital platforms, such as the Netflix-like website iQiyi. In recent weeks, however, mainstream media have noticed a mass appeal of the Peppa Pig cartoon among adults. Verified Chinese media outlets are sharing screengrabs showing ""Peppa Pig"" is blacklisted on Douyin Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post notes that there has been a recent frenzy for Peppa Pig products online, with users paying hundreds of yuan for goods such as ""antique-style"" Peppa Pig porcelain bowls. The Sina Entertainment website has also noted the popularity of the cartoon's plush toys and fairytale cakes among actresses Yang Mi, Nana Ou-yang and Zhao Liying, among others. It is not only women with a squeaky clean image that have caught what Sina calls ""the Peppa Pig virus""; the website shares a number of edgy male actors and singers showing off Peppa Pig, plus toys and transfer tattoos. The wave sparked a trend of adult Chinese Sina Weibo users sharing pictures of their own Peppa Pig merchandise. Thousands of female users have shared pictures of pink fans and hair accessories adorned with the lead character, while male users have shared pictures of their stickers and watches. In recent months, state media have signalled their increasing discomfort about the growing influence of the cartoon. They have noted that its characters have become the subject of what they call deviance and manipulation among Chinese youths. Nationalist newspaper Global Times noted in January that social media users had been circulating ""explicit fake versions"" of the cartoon online, making references to paedophiles and sexual organs. And a recent article on the popular news portal Sohu notes that there's been a particular surge of social media users making personalised emojis and memes out of stills of the cartoon. It says that this has been particularly the case on the Snapchat-like mobile application Douyin - potentially leading to the ban. Thousands of Weibo users are posting pictures of themselves with ""Little Dodo"" the pig Douyin's removal of the popular cartoon from its platform is possibly just the start of a wider clampdown. It comes as part of a wider crackdown on online content the Beijing government deems vulgar or pornographic. In recent months, Chinese microblogs such as Sina Weibo have been extensively removing such content from their platforms, stressing that such material is not in keeping with a healthy online culture. Given China's millions of online users, it is extremely difficult to simply censor all content when a TV show or personality has proven so popular. Beijing normally takes steps to launch a domestically-approved version, and this is what has happened with Peppa Pig. One Chinese mobile app, Suishoupai, has launched the character ""Little Pig Dodo"", which the Sina Weibo microblog has widely publicised. It encourages users of Douyin to switch to Suishoupai, and to switch their Peppa Pig fascination for a Dodo the pig. Thousands of users have subsequently registered, and posted pictures of themselves next to emojis of the state-approved pig.

"A postcard believed to have been sent by Jack the Ripper warning of two murders has been sold at auction. The note, which was sent to Ealing police station, warns the killer's knife ""is still in good order"". The card is dated 29 October 1888, which was 11 days before Mary Kelly - believed to be Jack the Ripper's final victim - was murdered on 9 November. The 2.75-inch by 4.75-inch card, sold for Â£22,000. The card once belonged to a Metropolitan Police constable who was given it when he retired from the force in 1966. The card, which had an estimate of Â£600 to Â£900 prior to sale, states: ""Beware there is two women I want here and I mean to have them my knife is still in good order it is a students knife and I hope you liked the kidney. ""I am Jack the Ripper."" Jonathan Riley of Grand Auctions in Folkestone, Kent, said a British private collector won a bidding war with an American for the rare letter, ""the likes of which have never come up for sale before"". The final price will be closer to Â£30,000 once an auction premium is paid, Mr Riley said, adding the sale shows ""how much interest in the Ripper there still is"". The card once belonged to a Metropolitan Police constable who was given it as a memento when he retired from the force in 1966. It was sold by his widow. The auctioneers state: ""There is mention of his 'students' knife in our card. Some believe that the ripper had some medical training from the way he cut up his victims, but this is not universally accepted. ""The kidney that was mentioned also appears in the 'Letter from Hell',another Ripper letter, where the writer stated he had fried one of his victim's kidneys and 'it tasted nice'. ""The card is definitely of the period and has police provenance."" Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London Jack the Ripper's murders remain the most notorious unsolved mystery in British criminal history. Between August and November 1888 he murdered five women in the Whitechapel area of east London. Dozens of letters signed ""Jack the Ripper"" were sent at the time, but many were - and still are - regarded as hoaxes. Speculation about his identity was rife at the time and remains so to this day.

"Labour MP John Woodcock said he did not intend to discuss details of the issue ahead of any hearing An MP has been suspended by the Labour Party amid claims he sent inappropriate messages to a former female member of staff. Barrow and Furness MP John Woodcock said he was told in December that the complaint was being referred as a potential breach of the Labour Party's policy on sexual harassment. The Mirror reported that the aide felt uncomfortable,externaland left her job. Mr Woodcock has said he ""does not accept"" the allegation. A Labour Party spokesperson said he had been suspended ""pending due process"" and added ""it would not be appropriate to comment further on an ongoing case"". In a statement, Mr Woodcock said the complaint had been referred to Labour's national constitutional committee. ""I do not accept the charge being brought against me but have been co-operating fully with the process and remain committed to a thorough and fair investigation of the case,"" he said. ""I am therefore very concerned that one of the very few individuals with knowledge of the case chose to place selective details of it in newspapers this weekend. Labour's new general secretary has cited this publicity as a reason to suspend me from the Labour whip. ""The decision at this politically charged time to place details of my case in the press and then suspend me places a serious question mark over the integrity of the process, which serves neither those making complaints nor those facing allegations."" A Labour Party spokesperson said ""all allegations are fully investigated"" and any disciplinary action is ""taken in line with the party's rule book and procedures"".

"Politically neat, generally welcomed by colleagues -  in the recent canon of Tory events the relatively smooth landing of this appointment is an achievement in itself. But moving Sajid Javid in, after Amber Rudd took herself out, does not end the prime minister's problems. She and Mr Javid need to move fast to cauterise the political wounds from Windrush. Javid replaces Rudd at Home Office What went wrong for Amber Rudd? He can, and did, make a more compelling and personal case in the House of Commons, showing what seems real anger about what has happened to those caught up in Windrush, and unafraid to use his own family story to display it too. Colleagues have called him a ""good operator"", and ""compassionate and empathetic"". Many in Westminster are pointing to his own family history as the ultimate Tory dream - the boy whose dad arrived in Britain with Â£1 in his pocket, who through hard work ended up in the cabinet, with a portrait of Margaret Thatcher on his wall. His appointment is also a landmark, he is the first politician from an ethnic minority to take on one of the great offices of state - the biggest jobs in cabinet. But whatever the presentation and the political messaging, the realities of the Windrush fiasco affect real lives. It's not going to be fixed with a new face or a more sympathetic soundbite. For once, you might say, this is not just a Westminster soap opera, but a mess that innocent Brits have been caught up in through no fault of their own - an unintended consequence of a ratcheting up of government pressure on immigration over the years. This video can not be played New Home Secretary Sajid Javid: ""We will do right by the Windrush generation."" Mr Javid's first job is to get a grip of that, and fast. He could not tell MPs today whether the Home Office had carried out any deportations, despite testimony from MPs that they are hearing those stories in their constituencies. He could only say that the government would consult on its plans for compensation, which will be overseen by an outsider. This is the start of the cleanup, not the end of the mess. Yet he is an experienced minister, who has experienced significant pressure before - even calls for him to quit when Tata Steel was up for sale and he, as business secretary, was on the other side of the world. And, as communities secretary, he's been trying to deal with the fallout of the Grenfell tragedy and the understandable anger and frustration of those affected. The Home Office however is a different undertaking altogether, described by one former minister as a ""glittering coffin"" for political careers. And it isn't just the challenge of sorting out the Windrush mess that is on his desk - serious crime, modern slavery, the huge question of immigration policy after Brexit, police reform, the list goes on. And he'll have a key seat at the table in the government's continuing machinations over how to manage customs and the border after we leave the EU. Hanging in the air though a different challenge - how much can he break away, how much does he want to escape, from his boss's legacy in Marsham Street? Amber Rudd too had to deal with that inheritance. Although she may have had different views to the prime minister in several areas, even some who know her well believe that she didn't always stand up to Theresa May enough. Who is Sajid Javid, the new home secretary? Others admire her loyalty and integrity - even if she was not always on the same page as Theresa May, she had her back. As wediscussed last weekshe might have used this crisis to move away from that legacy. But she was a newer politician, promoted by Theresa May - part of her project, even deputising for her in major TV debates back in the last election. Mr Javid is a rather different character. He was not, to start with, a natural ally of the prime minister. In fact, he is understood to have been rather surprised that she kept him on. As housing secretary he pushed hard, ultimately unsuccessfully, to make bolder moves than Number 10 and 11 would accept. Already today he has made plain that he's ready to junk existing policy. In the Commons, Mr Javid rejected the language of the ""hostile environment"" - the Home Office term for trying to make life difficult for illegal immigrants in the UK so they want to leave. His friends say he has an understanding with Number 10, that although the policies he inherits were largely designed by the prime minister, he will be his own man. But that ""understanding"" could rankle Number 10 over time if he strays too far from the prime minister's line. Sources suggest like most of the cabinet he is no fan of the overall immigration target to get the net numbers under 100,000. As and when he is asked about it, will he have the guts and the political capital to say its time might be up? Would he, again like many of his colleagues would hope, feel bold enough to say publicly that he wants students to be exempt from the pressure of that target? Mr Javid talking to Tata Steel workers in 2016 As a former business secretary he will be well versed in those arguments. As housing secretary he said that if brickies were needed from abroad, immigration restrictions must not stand in the way of building the houses the country desperately needs. The home secretary though is not a deliberate disrupter. And going on his department's recent record, it's hard to imagine the damage from Windrush can be made suddenly to disappear. But he is a politician with ambition, and a huge opportunity in front of him that could make him a very serious contender for the top job, if, and it's a big if, he is able to get it done. Someone who worked alongside him said ""ultimately Sajid will do what is in Sajid's interests"". Theresa May might find a colleague rather eager to break with her past, and make his own mark instead.

"There are many complex tasks to be across in the Home Office brief The new Home Secretary Sajid Javid faces a massive task. And none of it - from terrorism through to the Windrush crisis - is easy to fix. The Home Office sits at the heart of some of the most complex and challenging decisions in government - and, if his predecessors' experiences are any guide, Mr Javid should probably give up now on the hope of having much of a life beyond his red ministerial boxes. I'll come back to immigration in a moment, but first on the list for any incoming home secretary is appreciating the scale of the security threat. Every day, he will see a dozen dossiers from the police and intelligence agencies asking for permission to intercept the communications of people who are a threat to the UK. There are regular top secret security briefings on the latest possible terror plot. This is his first responsibility: keeping the UK safe. Sajid Javid to be new home secretary Live: Reaction as Javid replaces Rudd Why has the home secretary resigned? Mr Javid inherits very thorny issues over the future of the security and intelligence agencies. MI5 is under pressure to share more of what it knows with local agencies like social services, in the hope they will uncover potential extremists more quickly. Local police chiefs and counter-terrorism coordinators also regard neighbourhood teams as the frontline of counter-terrorism intelligence gathering. They want more cash to keep those officers on the beat. This, in turn, feeds into the questions of police funding - with figures showing rising knife and violent crime. One of Ms Rudd's last acts was to launch the Home Office's latest strategy to end serious violence. It's not clearhow it really differs from what has gone before. Will Mr Javid rip it up and start again? She was also particularly focused on overhauling protection for victims of domestic violence - and the Home Office isconsulting on new laws,external. Will this legislation stay on track, or fall by the wayside if Mr Javid comes under pressure to put all his energies into reforming the immigration system? Then there are unexpected events. Nobody foresaw the Salisbury poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. As and when the domestic intelligence agencies uncover new details of how it happened, Mr Javid will need to be clear about how he wants to respond. Similarly, while there is a tried-and-tested plan to respond to terrorism attacks, if the worst were to happen again, he will be expected to take a lead, even though he has absolutely no experience in this area. One of the biggest challenges in the in-tray is making sure that the UK secures co-operation with the EU member states on crime and security before Brexit becomes reality. Amber Rudd's team have been working on a new security treaty. This isn't headline-writing stuff - but it is crucial to every nation's mutual security. Amid the politics of Brexit, Mr Javid, who said he voted to remain but is also considered a Eurosceptic, will have to play a careful hand to keep continental partners on side. Ultimately, the biggest job he faces is sorting out immigration. From removal targets to a plan for EU citizens; from staff for a stretched NHS through to students and the net migration target; the task is enormous. Almost exactly 12 years ago, another Home Secretary - Labour's Charles Clarke - lost his job over his department's failure to properly manage the removal of foreign national offenders. In between his sacking and the resignation of Amber Rudd on Sunday, there has been a string of reorganisations of the immigration system. But the same problems remain: damning reports underlining that the system is creaking, underfunded and struggling with backlogs, poor decision-making and, now, the accusation that the Windrush generation became an easy target to improve the statistics. In the week that Parliament was awash with anger over the treatment ofpeople like Paulette Wilson, who came to the UK from Jamaica as a child in the 1960s, an Iraqi man called Rbar Mala was jailed for helping hundreds of IS fighters. The Home Office had told himhe had no right to be in the UK. For many critics, why Mrs Wilson was labelled an illegal immigrant, but a man like Mala was not deported goes right to the questions of trust and competence. I have lost count of the number of people who have said to me down the years that the Home Office is ""too big to manage"" - and therefore incapable of caring. That is unfair to the many civil servants who are trying to make a positive difference but find their efforts constantly battered by political winds and the sheer bureaucracy of the place. Perhaps Sajid Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, who became a successful investment banker, will finally bring not just new management skills but a human touch to the Home Office.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd faced criticism over the existence of Home Office removals targets and her knowledge of them Amber Rudd's resignation over the question of whether she knew about targets to remove illegal immigrants has shown once again that being home secretary remains one of the most high-risk jobs in government. Although Theresa May lasted more than six years in the job and used it as a springboard to Downing Street, her successor joins a long list of others, including David Blunkett, Jacqui Smith and Charles Clarke, who ended up paying the price for personal or administrative failings with their jobs. Before the full extent of the Windrush controversy became clear, shining an unflattering light on the workings and culture of her department and Ms Rudd's own command of her brief, the 54-year-old had been regarded as one of the Conservatives' rising stars. Her views on Europe - she is one of the cabinet's most pro-European voices and her brother Roland helped run the Remain campaign - were not to everyone's tastes within the party but despite this she was seen as being capable, tough and - until recent weeks - unflappable. In her early years in Parliament after being elected in 2010, she was regarded as being a protege of George Osborne on the liberal-modernising wing of the party, a member of the so-called ""friends of George"". Ms Rudd at a constituency event in 2011 - she scraped home in last year's election despite a significant swing to Labour She was promoted rapidly under David Cameron, working for a while in the Treasury and becoming energy and climate change secretary after the Conservatives' surprise victory in the 2015 general election. Her growing reputation was further enhanced during the 2016 Brexit referendum. She was one of the star performers during the main TV debate - caustically taking Boris Johnson to task and suggesting he was ""not the kind of man that you would want to drive you home at the end of the evening"". She not only survived Theresa May's clearout of Cameron/Osborne supporters after she became PM but was rewarded with the plum job of home secretary, stepping into her boss's shoes. Her first year in the Home Office went smoothly enough although dealing with the succession of terror attacks that took place during 2017 was a harrowing experience. The 54-year old was appointed home secretary in July 2016 She has been MP for Hastings and Rye in East Sussex since 2010 She won the seat in 2017 by just 346 votes She was a Remain supporter in 2016 referendum - her brother helped fund campaign She was married for five years to the late journalist and writer AA Gill An Edinburgh University graduate, she previously worked in banking and recruitment She was credited as a consultant on the 1994 hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral Ms Rudd earned plenty of plaudits after deputising for Mrs May in the 2017 general election leadership debate, despite her father Tony - a stockbroker and businessman - having died a few days before. She used up one of her political lives on election night when it looked, for several hours, as if she had lost her Hastings and Rye seat and ended up only scraping home by 346 votes. This video can not be played Amber Rudd and Jeremy Corbyn in the General election 2017 debate She remained in the Home Office after the election and with questions over Mrs May's future swirling around, she was talked of as a potential successor who could appeal to both wings of the party. But in the face of daily revelations about the plight of Windrush migrants and their families, Ms Rudd appeared slow to respond and, despite numerous apologies, to appreciate the scale and significance of the crisis. Previously regarded as having more liberal views on immigration than her predecessor, she was soon accused of making the government's ""hostile environment"" policy for illegal immigrants even tougher, with disastrous repercussions for thousands of people in the country legally. More significantly, she was forced to publicly backtrack on claims that the Home Office did not have targets for removing immigration offenders, admitting to MPs she had been wrong. She was appointed energy and climate change secretary by David Cameron after the Tories' 2015 election win The opposition soon called for her head, describing her as a ""human shield"" for the prime minister. But there was no appetite on the Tory benches - either from Brexiters or Remainers - for her to go, with three cabinet ministers already having had to quit in the past six months. The final nail in her coffin was when her claim to the Commons that she was not aware of the targets was contradicted not only by a memo she had been sent by a top Home Office official, published by the Guardian, but also a letterMs Rudd herself sent to the prime minister,externalsetting out ""ambitious but deliverable"" deportation targets. Ms Rudd published a strategy earlier this month on tackling violent crime, after a rise in deaths in London Before entering politics, Ms Rudd had successful careers working in finance, journalism and executive recruitment - as well as somewhat incongruously being ""aristocracy consultant"" on the hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral. She was married for five years to the late writer and Sunday Times columnist AA Gill, with whom she had two children. At a recent lunch for Westminster journalists, she responded to questions about her future leadership ambitions by saying that she merely ""wanted to stay in the game"". She will now have more time to ponder her own future in that game from the backbenches and also to reflect on the conventional wisdom in Westminster - seemingly dispelled by Mrs May - that the Home Office is the graveyard of many a political career. The British troopship HMT Empire Windrush anchored at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 21 June 1948. It is regarded as the symbolic starting point of a wave of Caribbean migration known as the ""Windrush generation"". Now, despite living and working in the UK for decades, it has emerged that some of the families of these Windrush migrants have been threatened with deportation and denied access to the NHS, benefits and pensions.

"Sajid Javid has been appointed health secretary following the resignation of Matt Hancock who stepped down for breaking social distancing guidelines. Mr Javid previously served as home secretary under former Prime Minister Theresa May, and in 2019 was promoted to chancellor by Boris Johnson. However he only lasted in that role for six months, resigning in February 2020 following tensions with the prime minister's then-advisor Dominic Cummings. Mr Javid was told he would have to sack his own advisors, but he rejected the order saying it was something ""no self-respecting minister"" could accept. Following his resignation as chancellor, Mr Javid returned to life as a backbench MP, but also took up a job with JP Morgan. Since becoming health secretary, Mr Javid has given up his role at the US bank. Matt Hancock resigns after breaking Covid guidance Sajid Javid resigns as chancellor Listen: BBC Radio 4's Profile of Sajid Javid The MP for Bromsgrove since 2010 was born in Rochdale in 1969, one of five sons of parents who had moved to the UK from Pakistan. Mr Javid, a 50-year-old father of four,told the Evening Standard in 2012,external: ""My dad was from a tiny village in Pakistan and came here when he was 17 to look for work. ""He settled in Rochdale and became a cotton-mill worker for Courtaulds. But he was quite ambitious, and saw that bus drivers were better paid. His nickname was Mr Night and Day because he used to work every hour God sent his way."" Mr Javid's father's job was the same as the father of another high-profile politician, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and he congratulated the Labour politician ""from one son of a Pakistani bus driver to another"" after his City Hall victory in 2016. Mr Javid spent his school years in Bristol after his parents took over a ladieswear shop there, with the family living in a two-bed flat above it. Hetold the Daily Mail,externalin 2014 that the school, a local comprehensive, was tough and ""I was naughty, more interested in watching Grange Hill than homework."" But, he said, things changed when his dad read the riot act. ""He said 'this is what I went through, don't let me down'. I felt really bad. My academic work rocketed."" He said that his school did not want to pay for him to do maths O-Level - his dad ended paying for it instead. Sajid Javid previously served in Boris Johnson's cabinet as chancellor He had also developed an interest in financial markets, sparked by the Thatcher government's privatisations. At the age of 14 he went to see his father's bank manager and arranged to borrow Â£500 to invest in shares, becoming a regular reader of the Financial Times. His goal became to work in the City so he passed that maths O-Level and, rejecting his school's suggestion he become a TV repair man, headed off to sixth form college and then to Exeter University to study economics and politics - giving a clear hint of his future career direction. He also met his future wife, Laura, while doing a summer job at Commercial Union. They sat opposite each other and shared a stapler, he told the Daily Mail. Their four children are privately educated: ""We do what's best for them,"" Mr Javid, who has described himself as a non-practising Muslim, told the newspaper. After university, he set his sights on a job in the City. As he told the Standard: ""Some people, in a friendly way, tried to lower my expectations. ""They often tell you that unless you wear an old school tie or have the family contacts, you just won't get a chance to work in the City. But they were wrong."" His career move worked out well, although he had to move across the Atlantic to succeed. And by the age of 25, he had become a vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank, later moving to Singapore for a period with Deutsche Bank. He rose to become a managing director before leaving in the summer of 2009 to concentrate on a political career. A Conservative Party supporter from the early 1980s, he had attended his first conference towards the end of the Thatcher years, with Conservative friends from university such as fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon. They got into a bit of trouble at the 1990 conference, handing out leaflets against the then prime minister's decision to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, opposing the policy despite being diehard fans of Mrs Thatcher's. According to aConservativeHome profile,,externalMr Javid, Mr Halfon, another future Tory MP David Burrowes and Tim Montgomerie - founder of ConservativeHome - got up at 07:00 so they could get front-row seats for what turned out to be Mrs Thatcher's final party conference speech. Two decades on and, in 2010, he was elected for the first time, and made swift progress. He began his ministerial career with roles in the Treasury, before becoming the first cabinet minister of Asian descent when he was appointed culture, media and sport secretary in 2014. He did that for a year before moving to business secretary for a year and then moving on to be communities and local government secretary. Sajid Javid (third from left) with the 2014 Budget team Long thought of as a Eurosceptic, it was a surprise to many when Mr Javid came out for Remain during the UK's 2016 referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. That meant, of course, that like then-Home Secretary Theresa May and his one-time mentor, then Chancellor George Osborne, he was on the losing side. There was an ill-fated and very short-lived bid to succeed David Cameron as Conservative leader after the referendum, on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb. (He would have been chancellor to Mr Crabb's prime minister.) He also ran in the 2019 leadership election but was eliminated in the fourth round before Mr Johnson went on to become prime minister. Mr Javid was appointed home secretary in April 2018, following the resignation of Amber Rudd during the fallout fromthe Windrush scandal. At the time, Mr Javidtold the Sunday Telegraph,externalthe scandal ""immediately impacted him"". Mr Javid told the newspaper: ""When I heard about the Windrush issue, I thought that could be my mum, it could be my dad, it could be my uncle, it could be me."" In 2019 he took a hardline stance towardsShamima Begum, who left London to join the Islamic State group aged 15, revoking her British citizenship when she asked to return. The move boosted his popularity amongst some Tories but provoked criticism from others - particularly after her newborn son died in a Syrian refugee camp. Mr Javid talking to Tata Steel workers in 2016 In his previous cabinet roles he avoided major calamity, although he faced questions as business secretaryover Tata steel, and as communities secretary over the government response to theGrenfell disaster,external. However, he had not been afraid to ruffle feathers, with uncompromising messages to some in the business community and local government.

"Politically neat, generally welcomed by colleagues -  in the recent canon of Tory events the relatively smooth landing of this appointment is an achievement in itself. But moving Sajid Javid in, after Amber Rudd took herself out, does not end the prime minister's problems. She and Mr Javid need to move fast to cauterise the political wounds from Windrush. Javid replaces Rudd at Home Office What went wrong for Amber Rudd? He can, and did, make a more compelling and personal case in the House of Commons, showing what seems real anger about what has happened to those caught up in Windrush, and unafraid to use his own family story to display it too. Colleagues have called him a ""good operator"", and ""compassionate and empathetic"". Many in Westminster are pointing to his own family history as the ultimate Tory dream - the boy whose dad arrived in Britain with Â£1 in his pocket, who through hard work ended up in the cabinet, with a portrait of Margaret Thatcher on his wall. His appointment is also a landmark, he is the first politician from an ethnic minority to take on one of the great offices of state - the biggest jobs in cabinet. But whatever the presentation and the political messaging, the realities of the Windrush fiasco affect real lives. It's not going to be fixed with a new face or a more sympathetic soundbite. For once, you might say, this is not just a Westminster soap opera, but a mess that innocent Brits have been caught up in through no fault of their own - an unintended consequence of a ratcheting up of government pressure on immigration over the years. This video can not be played New Home Secretary Sajid Javid: ""We will do right by the Windrush generation."" Mr Javid's first job is to get a grip of that, and fast. He could not tell MPs today whether the Home Office had carried out any deportations, despite testimony from MPs that they are hearing those stories in their constituencies. He could only say that the government would consult on its plans for compensation, which will be overseen by an outsider. This is the start of the cleanup, not the end of the mess. Yet he is an experienced minister, who has experienced significant pressure before - even calls for him to quit when Tata Steel was up for sale and he, as business secretary, was on the other side of the world. And, as communities secretary, he's been trying to deal with the fallout of the Grenfell tragedy and the understandable anger and frustration of those affected. The Home Office however is a different undertaking altogether, described by one former minister as a ""glittering coffin"" for political careers. And it isn't just the challenge of sorting out the Windrush mess that is on his desk - serious crime, modern slavery, the huge question of immigration policy after Brexit, police reform, the list goes on. And he'll have a key seat at the table in the government's continuing machinations over how to manage customs and the border after we leave the EU. Hanging in the air though a different challenge - how much can he break away, how much does he want to escape, from his boss's legacy in Marsham Street? Amber Rudd too had to deal with that inheritance. Although she may have had different views to the prime minister in several areas, even some who know her well believe that she didn't always stand up to Theresa May enough. Who is Sajid Javid, the new home secretary? Others admire her loyalty and integrity - even if she was not always on the same page as Theresa May, she had her back. As wediscussed last weekshe might have used this crisis to move away from that legacy. But she was a newer politician, promoted by Theresa May - part of her project, even deputising for her in major TV debates back in the last election. Mr Javid is a rather different character. He was not, to start with, a natural ally of the prime minister. In fact, he is understood to have been rather surprised that she kept him on. As housing secretary he pushed hard, ultimately unsuccessfully, to make bolder moves than Number 10 and 11 would accept. Already today he has made plain that he's ready to junk existing policy. In the Commons, Mr Javid rejected the language of the ""hostile environment"" - the Home Office term for trying to make life difficult for illegal immigrants in the UK so they want to leave. His friends say he has an understanding with Number 10, that although the policies he inherits were largely designed by the prime minister, he will be his own man. But that ""understanding"" could rankle Number 10 over time if he strays too far from the prime minister's line. Sources suggest like most of the cabinet he is no fan of the overall immigration target to get the net numbers under 100,000. As and when he is asked about it, will he have the guts and the political capital to say its time might be up? Would he, again like many of his colleagues would hope, feel bold enough to say publicly that he wants students to be exempt from the pressure of that target? Mr Javid talking to Tata Steel workers in 2016 As a former business secretary he will be well versed in those arguments. As housing secretary he said that if brickies were needed from abroad, immigration restrictions must not stand in the way of building the houses the country desperately needs. The home secretary though is not a deliberate disrupter. And going on his department's recent record, it's hard to imagine the damage from Windrush can be made suddenly to disappear. But he is a politician with ambition, and a huge opportunity in front of him that could make him a very serious contender for the top job, if, and it's a big if, he is able to get it done. Someone who worked alongside him said ""ultimately Sajid will do what is in Sajid's interests"". Theresa May might find a colleague rather eager to break with her past, and make his own mark instead.

But whatever the presentation and the political messaging, the realities of the Windrush fiasco affect real lives. It's not going to be fixed with a new face or a more sympathetic soundbite. Read the full blog here Ms Rudd's departure came after she faced mounting criticism over her handling of the Windrush scandal and immigration policy. The Windrush generation settled legally in post-war Britain and automatically got the right-to-remain in the UK - but the UK government did not keep a record of everyone in that position. Some people who do not have the paperwork to prove they are in the UK legally have been detained, lost their jobs and denied access to medical care. This has prompted calls for the government to abandon its ""hostile environment"" policy on illegal immigration, which Ms Rudd and Mrs May continued to defend, although Mr Javid told MPs he preferred the phrase ""compliant environment"". No easy fixes for new home secretary Windrush: Who exactly was on board? What went wrong for Amber Rudd? Rudd's resignation letter in full He told MPs Windrush cases were being investigated ""as a matter of urgency"", with more than 100 processed so far and 500 appointments scheduled. Responding for Labour, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""The Windrush generation was my parents' generation. I believe - and most British people believe - that they have been treated appallingly. She added that Mr Javid ""will be judged not on the statements he makes this afternoon: he will be judged on what he does to put the situation right and get justice for the Windrush generation"". To anger from Labour benches, the home secretary replied that Ms Abbott did not ""have a monopoly"" on anger at the situation. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The new home secretary faces a massive task. And none of it - from terrorism through to the Windrush crisis - is easy to fix, writes BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani. The Home Office sits at the heart of some of the most complex and challenging decisions in government - and, if his predecessors' experiences are any guide, Sajid Javid should probably give up now on the hope of having much of a life beyond his red ministerial boxes. First on the list for any incoming home secretary is appreciating the scale of the security threat. Every day, he will see a dozen dossiers from the police and intelligence agencies asking for permission to intercept the communications of people who are a threat to the UK. This is his first responsibility: keeping the UK safe. Read Dominic's blog here. This video can not be played Diane Abbott: The prime minister has questions to answer on Windrush Opposition parties have targeted Mrs May - under whose Home Office tenure the ""hostile environment"" policy was introduced - over the Windrush row. Ms Abbott said ""all roads lead back"" to the prime minister who, as the ""architect of this crisis"" - must come before the Commons to explain ""whether she knew that Amber Rudd was misleading Parliament and the public last week"". ""Many of the elements of this hostile environment originated under Theresa May and, most important of all, it was in 2014 that she passed legislation which removed the protection from deportation which up until then had applied to Commonwealth citizens,"" Ms Abbott told BBC One's Breakfast. The SNP's home affairs spokeswoman Joanna Cherry said: ""It is the prime minister who has created the fundamental reasons for the Windrush scandal."" Following Mr Javid's promotion, No 10 also announced former Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire was returning to the cabinet as housing, communities and local government secretary while International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt would take Ms Rudd's other role as women's and equalities minister. This video can not be played Amber Rudd faced criticism over the existence of Home Office removals targets and her knowledge of them When Ms Rudd was being grilled by a committee of MPs on Wednesday about the Windrush saga she told them there were no removals targets for illegal immigrants - comments subsequently contradicted by a 2015 inspection report. She later admitted ""local"" targets for voluntary removals had been set but she told the Commons on Thursday she had not been aware of them. But the Guardian reported a June 2017 memo from an official, copied to Ms Rudd, that referred to targets. The newspaper also published a letter at the weekend, from January 2017, where Ms Rudd told Theresa May about plans to restructure her department and increase removals ""over the next few years"". Sources told the BBC that on Saturday and Sunday Ms Rudd and her officials did a thorough search of all documents and found other references to operational targets which she felt she should have been aware of. Who are the Windrush generation? What is the 'hostile environment policy'? Whitfield Francis - here with his eldest daughter Maria - came to England with his parents at the age of nine Some of the people who have been caught up in the migration saga that led to Ms Rudd's resignation have been giving their views. Winston Walker, who came to the UK from Jamaica as a toddler in 1966, said the home secretary had been ""a bit of a scapegoat for something that her predecessor created"". ""We have to wait and see if anything changes,"" he said. ""I don't know. It's us that are sat in limbo waiting."" Tanya Simms, who was born in the UK to parents who came from Jamaica in the 1960s and had her passport application rejected, said the situation ""still needs to be handled"". ""Until we've got an outcome and something has actually changed, it's not a victory. It's not a victory until everybody is out of this situation,"" she said. ""It's not fair. People have been kept prisoner in the country they are born in. Their lives have stopped."" Whitfield Francis, who came to England aged nine and has been unable to work for four years because he does not have the necessary documentation, added: ""Unfortunately Rudd's lost her job but she'll probably be able to find a new job quicker than I can.""

"This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has revealed what he says are ""secret nuclear files"" proving Iran once covertly pursued nuclear weapons. He said thousands of pages of material obtained by Israel showed Iran had deceived the world by denying it had ever sought nuclear weapons. Iran agreed in 2015 to curb its nuclear energy programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. It maintained that it had only been pursuing nuclear energy. But Mr Netanyahu accused Iran of conducting a secret weapons programme until 2003 codenamed ""Project Amad"". He claimed Iran continued to pursue nuclear weapons knowledge after Project Amad was shuttered. Iran pushed back against the claims. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted to say the evidence was a ""rehash of old allegations"" which had already been dealt with by the United Nations nuclear watchdog. Iran's foreign minister accused Mr Netanyahu of a ""childish"" stunt to influence President Donald Trump's decision on whether to remain in a nuclear deal with Iran. The US along with five other international powers struck a deal with Iran in 2015 to curb the country's nuclear programme. Mr Trump, who has long threatened to scrap the Obama-era deal, said he had viewed part of Mr Netanyahu's presentation and said the situation was ""not acceptable"". He said he would make a decision on whether to retain the deal on or before 12 May. A White House statement said there were ""new and compelling details"" in Mr Netanyahu's material. ""These facts are consistent with what the United States has long known: Iran has a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons programme that it has tried and failed to hide from the world and from its own people,"" the statement went on. However, European powers have said they are committed to upholding the accord. ""We have never been naive about Iran and its nuclear intentions,"" said a UK government spokesperson late on Monday. ""That is why the IAEA inspection regime agreed as part of the Iran nuclear deal is one of the most extensive and robust in the history of international nuclear accords."" Mr Netanyahu said he had spoken to the leaders of France and Germany about Israel's intelligence and planned to send representatives to the two countries to discuss it. A German government spokesman said the country would carry out a detailed analysis of Israel's intelligence, Reuters reported. John Hughes, a former deputy director for sanctions at the US State Department who worked on the Iran deal, said he had not seen anything in the Israeli presentation that would change the deal. ""I think, frankly, this was a political statement meant to try to influence President Trump's decision on whether to pull out of the deal,"" Mr Hughes said. ""I think it's mostly recycled material."" Could the nuclear deal collapse? Why the bomb is back By Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic correspondent, BBC News This was political theatre from the Israeli prime minister, but to what extent was it revelation? Israel's claim to have been able to steal or access files and documents from what it says was the  secret Iranian nuclear archive located in a warehouse in south Tehran may be a tale of daring espionage in itself but, beyond that, what is really new? Iran of course has insisted consistently that it never had a nuclear weapons programme but there were growing international concerns about its nuclear activities. That is precisely why the major powers entered into the 2015 agreement with Tehran in the first place, both to contain its nuclear programme and to introduce a greater level of outside scrutiny. France, Germany and Britain who all back the maintenance of the agreement have had their say with Mr Trump - the US president must decide upon its fate in mid-May.  Now Mr Netanyahu has had his turn to put the contrary view. Speaking in English from Israel's defence ministry in Tel Aviv, Mr Netanyahu showed off what he said were ""exact copies"" of documents obtained by Israeli intelligence from a secret storage facility in Tehran. There were, he said, 55,000 pages of evidence and a further 55,000 files on 183 CDs relating to Project Amad. The project, he said, had had the explicit goal of producing five warheads, each with the yield of 10 kilotonnes of TNT. ""These files conclusively prove that Iran was brazenly lying when it said it never had a nuclear weapons programme."" The files had been shared with the US, Mr Netanyahu said, and would be submitted to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A 2007 US National Intelligence Estimate assessed ""with high confidence"" that Iran did have a nuclear weapons programme,externalup until 2003 but that Iran had stopped it after its discovery. On Monday the Israeli prime minister argued the existence of the alleged files proved Iran had been ""secretly storing Project Amad material to use at a time of its choice to develop nuclear weapons"". The agreement signed between Iran and six world powers lifted crippling economic sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear programme. There had been fears that Iran would use the programme to create a nuclear weapon. Under the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran is committed  to slashing the number of its centrifuges, which are machines used to enrich uranium. It is also meant to cut its stockpile of enriched uranium drastically and not enrich remaining uranium to the level needed to produce nuclear weapons. The number of centrifuges installed at Iran's Natanz and Fordo sites was cut drastically soon after the deal while tonnes of low-enriched uranium were shipped to Russia. Furthermore, monitors from the IAEA have been able to carry out snap inspections at Iranian nuclear sites. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Tension between the long-standing enemies has grown steadily since Iran built up its military presence in Syria, Israel's north-eastern neighbour. Iran has also been accused of supplying weaponry to Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group Hezbollah, an enemy of Israel, and also smuggling arms to Palestinian militants. Mr Netanyahu has long vowed to stop Iran from strengthening its military presence in Syria. On Sunday night, a wave of unclaimed air strikes on targets in Syria reportedly killed a number of Iranians. Sites allegedly linked to a covert Syrian chemical weapons programme were bombed by Western nations earlier this month. Israel has also carried out, or is believed to have carried out, dozens of air strikes on facilities in Syria used by Iranian forces.

"President Donald Trump has ended the United States's participation in a landmark nuclear deal with Iran and begun reimposing sanctions. The 2015 accord - his predecessor Barack Obama's signature foreign policy achievement - saw Iran limit its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),externalwas agreed by Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany (the P5+1). Iran limited its sensitive nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief It sets limits to Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel, but also nuclear weapons - until 2031 and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium until 2026. Iran also agreed to modify a heavy-water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb. The deal was endorsed bySecurity Council resolution 2231,externaland its implementation began on January 2016, after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) certified that Iran had fulfilled its key commitments. Iran nuclear deal: Key details In a televised address in May,the president denounced the JCPOA as a ""horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"".,external Rather than protecting the US and its allies, it had placed ""very weak limits on the regime's nuclear activity and no limits at all on its other malign behaviour, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen and other places all around the world"", he said. This video can not be played Iran nuclear deal: Trump announces US pull-out Mr Trump also said intelligence documents published by Israel in April had proven that ""at the heart of the Iran deal is a fiction that Iran only desired a peaceful nuclear energy programme"". Iranian officials have consistently insisted their intentions are peaceful. The president added that the accord's so-called ""sunset clauses"" - under which key limits on Iran's nuclear programme will start to expire - were ""totally unacceptable""; that it did not deal with Iran's development of ballistic missiles; and that its mechanism for inspections and verification was not strong enough. Three reasons behind Trump ditching Iran deal The president vowed to ""find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution"" that would ""include efforts to eliminate the threat of Iran's ballistic missile programme, to stop its terrorist activities worldwide, and to block its menacing activity across the Middle East"". ""Iran's leaders will naturally say that they refuse to negotiate a new deal, they refuse and that's fine,"" he said. ""But the fact is, they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people."" This video can not be played US-Iran sanctions: What do they mean? In August, he signed an executive order that reimposed sanctions,externaltargeting the Iranian government's purchase of US dollars, Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals, and its automotive sector. In November, a second batch of potentially more damaging sanctions will be reinstated on Iran's port operators, and the energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors. Also affected are Iran's petroleum-related transactions, and transactions by foreign financial institutions with the Central Bank of Iran.

He also said there would be ""no preconditions"", but the White House later insisted that the Iranian government would first have to ""change its behaviour in the ways we've identified"".

If that was not possible, he warned, Iran would step up uranium enrichment and restart other curbed nuclear activities. When the US reinstated the first batch of economic sanctions, Mr Rouhani accused the Trump administration of pursuing ""psychological warfare"" intended to ""sow division among Iranians"". The US will reimpose sanctions on Iran's central bank, intended to target its oil exports The foreign ministers of Germany, the UK and France meanwhile released ajoint statement along with the European Union's foreign policy chief saying the nuclear deal was working,externaland remained ""crucial for the security of Europe, the [Middle East], and the entire world"". They also unveiled a ""blocking statute"",externalintended to mitigate the impact of the US sanctions on European firms doing legitimate business with Iran. However, a senior US official said it was ""not particularly concerned"" by the move. The EU previously insisted that it is ""not in the hands of any single country"" to terminate a deal that has been endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution. IAEA inspectors have certified that Iran is fulfilling its nuclear-related commitments The IAEA has said it has the ""world's most robust verification regime in place in Iran"",external, and itsinspectors have certified 10 times since 2016 that Iran is fulfilling its nuclear-related commitments,externalunder the JCPOA. However, the watchdog has recorded several technical violations. For instance,Iran has twice exceeded its heavy-water production cap,external. In both cases, Iran shipped the excess out of the country. The IAEA has also said its inspectors were granted access to all locations they needed to visit in 2017. However, they did not seek to enter any military sites, which Iranian officials declared off-limits -a move the US said raised doubts over Iranian compliance,external. The US and European powers also say Iran has carried out ballistic missile tests in violation of resolution 2231. It ""calls upon"" Iran not to ""undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons"". Iran denies that it has tested such missiles.

"Theresa May has reshuffled her cabinet following the resignations of Dominic Raab and Esther McVey. Here is a guide to her new top team. Despite speculation that he would be sacked after the June 2017 General Election, Philip Hammond has remained chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. Mr Hammond was a Remain supporter in the EU referendum and is seen as one of the leading cabinet voices for a softer version of Brexit than that advocated by Leave supporting colleagues. He is known by some around Westminster as ""box office Phil"" for his perceived dull delivery. After becoming an MP in 2010, Sajid Javid has risen swiftly through the ranks of the Conservative Party and government to become the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background. Landing the job followingAmber Rudd's resignation,the son of Pakistani immigrants left behind his role as communities secretary. Mr Javid, a former executive at Deutsche Bank, has also had brief stints as business secretary and culture secretary. He stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the 2016 leadership contest, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM. Jeremy Hunt became foreign secretary after Boris Johnson resigned over Brexit policy in July 2018.  It meant an end to his marathon stint as health secretary, a job he took in David Cameron's 2012 reshuffle, having previously served as culture secretary. He weathered a number of controversies including a 2015 battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes. He is thought to have resisted an attempt by Theresa May to move him to another job in her January 2018 reshuffle and succeeded in adding responsibility for social care - something previously overseen by local government - to his portfolio. A major promotion for Stephen Barclay, 46, who becomes the third Brexit secretary in six months. Mr Barclay, who was previously a junior minister in the health and social care department, replaces Dominic Raab, who resigned in protest at Theresa May's draft EU withdrawal bill. Despite being regarded as a rising star Mr Barclay, who has served as MP for North East Cambridgeshire since 2010, was reportedly not Mrs May's first choice for the role, with Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox also in the frame. And the job has essentially been downgraded to focus on domestic preparations for the UK's departure, with Theresa May personally assuming responsibility for the remaining negotiations with the EU. A close ally of Theresa May, the former chief whip ruffled a few Tory feathers when he was handed the role of defence secretary in November 2017, with some claiming he lacked the experience for such a vital role. He replaced Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned amid allegations over his past conduct. The appointment was Mr Williamson's first cabinet post. The MP for South Staffordshire was elected to parliament in 2010, and was previously an aide to David Cameron. One of the government's great survivors, Chris Grayling has been in the cabinet since 2012, when he was made Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, before going on to serve as Commons leader. A leading voice in the Leave campaign, he was made transport secretary by Theresa May in July 2016. He defied predictions he would be sacked or moved in Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle, after attracting criticism over rising rail fares, Southern Rail's disrupted services and rail franchising difficulties. The former BBC and Channel 4 TV producer has been MP for Epsom and Ewell, in Surrey, since 2001. A veteran right winger and ardent Brexiteer, Liam Fox was put in charge of the newly-created department for international trade by Theresa May after she became PM, with the job of forging post-Brexit trade deals with other nations. He was David Cameron's first defence secretary but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas. Mr Fox - who was a GP before entering politics - stood in the 2016 leadership race against Theresa May, but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs. Michael Gove's was a dramatic comeback in June 2017, when the prime minister brought him back into cabinet as environment secretary. That was just a year after his ministerial ambitions appeared to be over when he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle which followed Mrs May's arrival as prime minister. Before that stint as justice secretary he had previously served as David Cameron's education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. His longtime friendship with Mr Cameron ended as he became probably the then cabinet's biggest name to decide to campaign for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit and initially backing him, Mr Gove withdrew his support for Mr Johnson as Tory leader mid-contest, choosing instead to stand himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third. A former protege of Theresa May at the Home Office, Karen Bradley was handed the role of culture secretary in Mrs May's first cabinet. Her time in that job was dominated by her decision to refer Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox's takeover bid for Sky to the media and competition regulators, something that will be at the top of her successor's in-tray. She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010. She replaces James Brokenshire as Northern Ireland Secretary,who resigned for health reasons David Gauke became the sixth justice secretary in six years - and the first solicitor to take the role - in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. His appointment breaks a run of four consecutive non-legally qualified MPs to hold the position of the government's chief law officer. He was previously work and pensions secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury. The former City lawyer has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005. Matt Hancock was promoted to become health secretary in the wake of the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson over Brexit policy. After only a few months as culture secretary, he got the call to move up the rankings to health when Jeremy Hunt was promoted from health to foreign secretary. Mr Hancock, who was close to the former chancellor George Osborne during the David Cameron years, is a former Bank of England economist has been MP for West Suffolk since 2010. He is the first MP in modern times to win a horse race, having raced to victory at Newmarket in August 2012. And his later appearances as culture secretary included attempting to moonwalk and jumping off a wall while having a go at parkour. Greg Clark is another minister who has survived the transition from the Cameron to the May years. In his case he has been business secretary since July 2016, after a year or so looking after the local government brief. It had been widely speculated that he was to be moved in the January 2018 reshuffle to make way for Jeremy Hunt - but it did not happen after the health secretary successfully argued the case to stay put. The Middlesbrough-born former business consultant, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, started his political journey as president of the Liberal Democrat student branch at Magdalene College, Cambridge. James Brokenshire returned to the cabinet following the reshuffle prompted by Amber Rudd's resignation as home secretary. The former Northern Ireland secretaryhad stepped down in Januarydue to ill health after being diagnosed with the early stages of lung cancer - but was back in Parliament a month later after ""recovering strongly"" from lung surgery. The former lawyer is a close ally of Theresa May, having served under her for five years at the Home Office. Jeremy Wright was promoted from attorney general to be the new culture secretary after Matt Hancock's promotion to health secretary in July 2018. The moves were in Theresa May's reshuffle in the wake of David Davis and Boris Johnson's Brexit resignations. A barrister specialising in criminal law, Mr Wright became an MP in 2005, serving in the whips office for the Conservatives under David Cameron from 2007 to 2012 before becoming a justice minister in 2012 and becoming attorney general in 2014. Penny Mordaunt: New International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt replaced Priti Patel in this role in November 2016, after Ms Patel resigned in the wake of disclosures that she had held a series of unofficial meetings with senior Israeli figures. Ms Mordaunt was previously minister of state for disabled people at the Department of Work and Pensions. She was minister for the armed forces under David Cameron, and had been considered a contender to replace Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary. Penny Mordaunt, elected to parliament in 2010 as MP for Portsmouth North, is also known for her strong support of Brexit. Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016 - her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation, headed by controversial journalist Toby Young, which runs the free schools programme. One of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be elected to the Commons in the June 2017 snap election. Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post of Scottish Secretary when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015. In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet minister. Amber Rudd returned to cabinet in November to replace Esther McVey as work and pensions secretary. Mrs Rudd resigned as home secretary in April amid a row over targets to remove illegal immigrants. A strong ally of Theresa May, Amber Rudd is known for her pro-EU views and has a reputation as being tough and capable. She has served as MP for Hastings and Rye since 2010 and was promoted swiftly during David Cameron's time in office. However the 2017 election saw her majority reduced to just 346, diminishing her prospects as a possible future leader. Damian Hinds got an unexpected promotion when he was drafted in to replace Justine Greening,who refused a move to the Department for Work and Pensionsin Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. The former management consultant was a Remain supporter and previously served as employment minister in the DWP and before that a junior Treasury minister and government whip. He has been MP for East Hampshire since May 2010. Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remained in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. The former banker and Welsh assembly member was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport. He became an MP in 2010. Former Commons Leader David Lidington replaced Damian Green, who resigned in December 2017 after misconduct allegations. The Remain supporter did not take on Mr Green's First Secretary of State title but will still play part of that role, standing in for Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions and chairing key cabinet Brexit committees. He is a former justice secretary and Europe minister. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto. The new Conservative Party chairman takes the title of minister without portfolio, allowing him to take a seat in the cabinet. He replaced Sir Patrick McLoughlin, who stood down as Tory chairman. The former housing minister briefly served as immigration minister before taking on the job of rebuilding the Tories' campaigning strength for the next general election. A former barrister and leader of Brentwood council, in Essex, he has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010.

"The film Dr Strangelove satirised fears of a nuclear conflict between the US and the former Soviet Union The film Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb - to give it its full title - remains a comedy classic. Starring Peter Sellers in multiple roles and directed by Stanley Kubrick, it illustrated the way in which the US and the then Soviet Union might unintentionally drift into all-out nuclear war. Back in 1964, when it was first released, it was a very dark comedy indeed. Audiences then lived under the very real shadow of the Cold War nuclear arms race. Mindful of the dangers, over the years, an elaborate series of arms control and arms reduction agreements were concluded between the two superpowers to try to manage their nuclear rivalry. But with the Cold War over, nuclear arsenals were scaled down. The nature of international conflict seemed to change; no longer rivalry between great powers but bitter local wars where countries disintegrated into chaos or terrorist groups sought to capitalise on ungoverned space to mount their nihilist campaigns. But now there are those who fear that the nuclear spectre is becoming all too real again. The US non-governmental organisation Global Zero certainly thinks so. It has brought respected former officials and military men together to campaign for the abolition of nuclear weapons. It is launching a new initiative on Friday in Vienna to establish what it calls the Nuclear Crisis Group, which it hopes will serve as a kind of shadow-Security Council to deal with potential nuclear flashpoints. Tensions have risen over North Korea's nuclear programme As Global Zero Executive Director Derek Johnson told me, ""from Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula, to south Asia and the South China Sea and Taiwan, all of the nuclear-armed states and their allies are tangled up in conflicts and crises that could go nuclear at any moment."" ""It's true,"" he notes, ""that each of these crises has been simmering for a long time, but they're all heating up."" The world, he argues, ""has never been faced with so many nuclear flashpoints simultaneously"". The growing tensions between the US and North Korea are clearly very much on Global Zero's minds. ""The election of Donald Trump,"" says Johnson, ""has injected an alarming new level of incoherence and volatility into a uniquely perilous moment in human history."" How might Donald Trump do a deal with North Korea? What can the outside world do about North Korea? North Korea's nuclear programme: How advanced is it? The message of Global Zero is that mankind is ""simply not equipped to manage existential risks indefinitely"". The new Nuclear Crisis Group will monitor potential flash-points; seek to publish reports to educate and keep these issues in the public eye, while also engaging in behind the scenes diplomacy to try to influence the main players. The NCG is co-chaired by the respected US diplomats and ambassadors Richard Burt and Thomas Pickering, and by a former general, James E Cartwright. It describes itself as embracing ""a cadre of seasoned diplomats, political and military leaders and national security experts from key countries, including China, India, Japan, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, South Korea and the United States"". The NCG and its sponsoring organization - Global Zero - are clearly part of a nuclear disarmament lobby that in many ways feels that it has been pushed to the sidelines. While it would be wrong to speak of a new Cold War, relations between Russia and the US are clearly at a very low-ebb. But their relative positions and capabilities have changed. Russia - despite its military adventure in Syria - is a shadow of the former Soviet Union. President Putin is seeking to modernise Russia's nuclear arsenal Nonetheless Moscow's Syria intervention illustrates that Russia cannot simply be ignored and the deepening tensions come at a time when both Washington and Moscow are seeking to modernise their nuclear arsenals. Indeed Russia's military doctrine places a growing importance on its nuclear arsenal, not least because of the imbalance of conventional forces between it and the West. Donald Trump's own approach to nuclear weapons is unclear - he has spoken in muscular terms about expanding the US nuclear arsenal and has been sceptical about the value of one of the key Cold War arms reduction treaties. Indeed arms control is having a hard time generally. Russia is widely regarded in the West as having breached the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, an agreement that for the first time abolished a whole category of nuclear weapons. Trump's lack of clarity may prove catastrophic US raises stakes over Iran nuclear deal Uncertainty over Mr Trump's policy towards Iran has contributed to the tensions New conventional long-range strike systems look set to complicate the balance of threat and deterrence. And the demise of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq and that of Colonel Gaddafi in Libya seem to have sent a clear signal to the North Korean leadership that you renounce weapons of mass destruction at your peril. Uncertainty about the Trump administration's attitude to the nuclear deal with Iran that has, at least, constrained its nuclear development for a period, adds another element of tension. So nuclear disarmament according to Global Zero should be very much back on the agenda. The developing crisis over North Korea's nuclear programme simply provides added urgency. There is of course no equivalence between the regime of Kim Jong Un and the Trump administration. But the combination of an erratic and unpredictable North Korean leadership with an inexperienced president who seems fascinated with the military is a dangerous one. The possibility of a confrontation between two-nuclear armed countries suddenly seems more real now than it has for decades. Maybe Dr Strangelove would be worth re-viewing.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump attended a rally instead of the correspondents' dinner The US president has lashed out at comedian Michelle Wolf over her performance at Saturday's White House Correspondents' Dinner. Donald Trump, who skipped the event for the second year, said the ""filthy 'comedian' totally bombed"" after she targeted him and his staff. Wolf sparked both praise and condemnation for her scathing ""roasts"". The organisation behind the annual event expressed regret at the divisiveness of the after-dinner act. Margaret Talev, head of the White House Correspondents' Association, said the night was ""meant to offer a unifying message about our common commitment to a vigorous and free press while honouring the civility, great reporting and scholarship winners, not to divide people"". ""Unfortunately, the entertainer's monologue was not in the spirit of that mission,"" she said in a statement.,external Among Wolf's most controversial - and often crude - takedowns was her blistering mockery of White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. The former Daily Show contributor was criticised by some for commenting on Ms Sanders' appearance, comparing her to the matronly disciplinarian Aunt Lydia in The Handmaid's Tale, while others applauded her for attacking White House ""lies"". Wolf has denied she took aim at Ms Sanders looks, and said ""all these jokes were about her despicable behaviour"". Read more:Did comedian's Sarah Sanders 'roast' go too far? The comic shrugged off the controversy in an interview aired by National Public Radio. She said: ""I wouldn't change a single word that I said.

"This video can not be played The second explosion targeted those at the scene of the first At least 26 people have been killed in two bombings in the Afghan capital Kabul, including several journalists documenting the scene. AFP chief photographer in Kabul, Shah Marai, is among the victims. The first explosion was carried out by an attacker on a motorbike. A second followed about 15 minutes later after a crowd, including several reporters, had gathered at the scene. The Islamic State group (IS) said it had carried out the attack. It was one of several fatal incidents on Monday. BBC reporter Ahmad Shah was also killed in a separate attack in the Khost region. And in a third attack, 11 children were killed in a suicide bombing intended to target Nato troops in Kandahar province. In the Kabul attack, the AFP news agency said the second blast had deliberately targeted the group of journalists, including its photographer Shah Marai. Allow Twitter content?

Nine journalists and photographers and four police officers, were among the dead, officials say. So far, 45 people have been reported injured. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty confirmed that three of its journalists,externalwere killed in the attack. Abadullah Hananzai, a journalist and cameraman, had been working on a story about narcotics, while Maharram Durrani worked on the weekly women's programme.

""This is the deadliest day for Afghan media in the past 15 years,"" the head of Tolo News TV, Lotfullah Najafizada, told the BBC. ""We went, all of us, to the blast site. We said: 'If you killed an entire line of journalists reporting here, in five hours time we're back here; the line is longer; the queue is longer and the resolve is greater."" Bombings in the Afghan capital are not uncommon. Earlier in April, a suicide bomb at a voter registration killed almost 60 people and injured 119, in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. The Taliban also remain active in the country, only 30% of which is under full government control,according to BBC research published earlier this year.

A shooting in Khost province resulted in the death of a BBC reporter. ""It is with great sadness that the BBC can confirm the death of BBC Afghan reporter Ahmad Shah following an attack earlier today,"" said Jamie Angus, director of the BBC World Service. Ahmad Shah, 29, was killed by unknown attackers in Khost ""Ahmad Shah was 29.

"Michel Barnier said the Republic of Ireland has the support of all EU member states There can be no Brexit withdrawal agreement without a ""backstop"" option for the Irish border, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator has said. Michel Barnier said the Republic of Ireland has the full support of all EU member states and all EU institutions. The backstop would involve NI, or the UK as a whole, aligning with the EU rules required to support North-South cooperation and an all-island economy. Mr Barnier was speaking atthe start of a two-day visit to Ireland. The UK has accepted the need for a backstop to be written into the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Analysis: Brexit brokers and backstop âbingoâ Q&A: Brexit and the Irish border Long read: The hardest border But it has not agreed what EU rules it should cover. At the beginning of the all-island Brexit forum in Dundalk, County Louth, Mr Barnier said he knows that the so-called backstop has been the subject of ""heated discussions in the UK"". ""To be clear: without a backstop, there can be no withdrawal agreement,"" said Mr Barnier. ""This is an EU issue, not only an Irish issue."" It almost became Brexit bingo - as journalists lost count of how many times Mr Barnier referenced the ""backstop"" option for the Irish border. The backstop would mean that in the absence of any other solution, Northern Ireland, or the UK as a whole, would align with EU rules required to support north-south cooperation and an all-island economy. While in principle the UK signed up to this option, precise detail on it has yet to appear. Mr Barnier's three points were: The UK government has agreed to a backstop and knows that without it there is no withdrawal agreement The EU is not using the backstop as a negotiating tactic The backstop is necessary to protect the integrity of the customs union and single market In brief - the backstop was agreed - so let's get on with it. Read more from Jayne here Mr Barnier also denied claims from Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), that he has been ""aggressive"" towards Northern Ireland unionists in the Brexit talks. The DUP leader said earlier that Mr Barnier did not understand the dispute and was not an ""honest broker"". In response, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator said he was not ready to engage in ""polemics"" with Mrs Foster. Mr Barnier's visit comes amid rising tensions over the future UK-Ireland border. He told a press conference in Dundalk at the beginning of the all-island Brexit forum that his ""door is open"" to Mrs Foster and the DUP. He said he had not approached the negotiations in a ""spirit of revenge"". This video can not be played DUP leader Arlene Foster: Brexit negotiations have 'become aggressive' He added that he regretted the UK had voted to leave the EU, and said he was determined to work with the UK to find a solution to the Irish border issue. The all-island Brexit forum is being hosted by the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and his deputy, Simon Coveney. On Sunday,Mr Barnier said the UKwas contradicting itself over its Irish border policy. But Mrs Foster said she believes Mr Barnier does not understand the dispute and is ""not an honest broker"". In return, he said that Mrs Foster needed to respect that his role was to negotiate on behalf of the EU and not to act as a mediator. Meanwhile the Taoiseach again there needed to be ""meaningful progress"" on the border issue by the June EU summit. Mr Varadkar said otherwise it would be difficult to get thewithdrawal agreementin place by October. The two-day all-island Brexit forum began on Monday In December, the UK and EU reached a political agreement in which the UK committed to protecting north-south cooperation on the island of Ireland. It also guaranteed there would be no hard border, including physical infrastructure or related checks and controls. However, the EU's proposed backstop solution to avoid a hard border - keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union after Brexit - continues to be at odds with what the UK government and the DUP say they would accept. Mrs Foster told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg the DUP would not accept Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK. Arlene Foster has warned Michel Barnier the DUP will not accept Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK She said: ""Michel Barnier's trying to present himself as someone who cares deeply about Northern Ireland and if that is the case he needs to hear the fact that we are part of the United Kingdom [and] will remain part of the United Kingdom constitutionally, politically and economically. ""Therefore his proposal of us being in an all-Ireland regulatory scenario with a border down the Irish Sea simply does not work. ""It does not work constitutionally, politically and it certainly does not work from an economic perspective."" This video can not be played The Irish border bridge where stakes are high Mrs Foster added: ""We've tried to get him to understand the unionist position for the people of Northern Ireland but he hasn't really responded and I'm disappointed about that. ""I don't think he does understand the wider unionist culture of Northern Ireland."" The DUP is also expressing annoyance that Mr Varadkar is visiting Northern Ireland later without giving notice. Mr Barnier is due to meet Mr Varadkar on Monday and will also speak to business leaders on both sides of the Irish border during his trip.

"New failings over the disclosure of evidence in the criminal justice system have emerged after prosecutors charged a man with rape in a case where the woman involved did not want a charge to be brought. The police then failed to list her statement, in which she said she did not believe the man had done anything wrong, in the so-called schedule of unused evidence that could help the defence. The case - one of the latest to expose failings in the system in England and Wales - was uncovered by BBC Panorama. Allcurrent rape and serious sexual offence cases are being reviewedand the Director of Public Prosecutions told the programme some have already been sent back to the police for further investigation. It is the role of the police and prosecution to ensure defence teams have all the evidence that may undermine the case. The allegations involved two men who went home with a young woman after meeting her and a friend on a night out. The CPS charged both men with rape. But both the men's barristers say they were not aware of the woman's statement until the start of the trial in January, although the Crown Prosecution Service says it was sent to the solicitors months earlier. The judge at Snaresbrook Crown Court then asked the Crown Prosecution Service to review its decision and it dropped the case against the man she did not feel should be on trial. All current rape cases 'urgently' reviewed CPS chief insists justice is working The woman ""Jane"" says that the two men started trying to have sex with her back at her flat. Jane, not her real name, told Panorama one of the men involved, Male Two, stopped as soon as she asked him to. The other man, Male One, continued having sex despite her protests. She says Male Two pulled the other man off her. After reporting the incident to police, she made a statement in which she said:  ""I do not believe Male Two should be charged.  I do not believe he did anything wrong on the night. ""I am thankful that Male Two was there as without him I do not know how long Male One would have continued to have sex with me."" The men's barristers say they only found out about the woman's statement at the start of the trial, after they spotted a reference to it in a police notebook. The Director of Public Prosecutions stands by the decision to bring the case The CPS said it sent Jane's statement to the defence solicitors months before. One solicitor now says the statement was received but only found recently. Jane later withdrew her support for the prosecution of the other man, Male One. His defence team requested a further download of material from her phone. She felt it was disproportionate. She was also affected by the delays in the original trial. ""I had so much faith in the judicial system. And now, after this, I've completely lost faith,"" she said. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, told Panorama she stood by the CPS decision to prosecute Male Two. ""We prosecute on the evidence, not on necessarily what a complainant, what her views might or might not be."" She says the CPS dropped the prosecution of Male Two when it got to court because it has a continuing duty to review. Ms Saunders said: ""There were some issues that were raised at the point of that particular suspect's trial and we decided, looking at it again, we shouldn't proceed with it.""

"This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has revealed what he says are ""secret nuclear files"" proving Iran once covertly pursued nuclear weapons. He said thousands of pages of material obtained by Israel showed Iran had deceived the world by denying it had ever sought nuclear weapons. Iran agreed in 2015 to curb its nuclear energy programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. It maintained that it had only been pursuing nuclear energy. But Mr Netanyahu accused Iran of conducting a secret weapons programme until 2003 codenamed ""Project Amad"". He claimed Iran continued to pursue nuclear weapons knowledge after Project Amad was shuttered. Iran pushed back against the claims. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted to say the evidence was a ""rehash of old allegations"" which had already been dealt with by the United Nations nuclear watchdog. Iran's foreign minister accused Mr Netanyahu of a ""childish"" stunt to influence President Donald Trump's decision on whether to remain in a nuclear deal with Iran. The US along with five other international powers struck a deal with Iran in 2015 to curb the country's nuclear programme. Mr Trump, who has long threatened to scrap the Obama-era deal, said he had viewed part of Mr Netanyahu's presentation and said the situation was ""not acceptable"". He said he would make a decision on whether to retain the deal on or before 12 May. A White House statement said there were ""new and compelling details"" in Mr Netanyahu's material. ""These facts are consistent with what the United States has long known: Iran has a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons programme that it has tried and failed to hide from the world and from its own people,"" the statement went on. However, European powers have said they are committed to upholding the accord. ""We have never been naive about Iran and its nuclear intentions,"" said a UK government spokesperson late on Monday. ""That is why the IAEA inspection regime agreed as part of the Iran nuclear deal is one of the most extensive and robust in the history of international nuclear accords."" Mr Netanyahu said he had spoken to the leaders of France and Germany about Israel's intelligence and planned to send representatives to the two countries to discuss it. A German government spokesman said the country would carry out a detailed analysis of Israel's intelligence, Reuters reported. John Hughes, a former deputy director for sanctions at the US State Department who worked on the Iran deal, said he had not seen anything in the Israeli presentation that would change the deal. ""I think, frankly, this was a political statement meant to try to influence President Trump's decision on whether to pull out of the deal,"" Mr Hughes said. ""I think it's mostly recycled material."" Could the nuclear deal collapse? Why the bomb is back By Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic correspondent, BBC News This was political theatre from the Israeli prime minister, but to what extent was it revelation? Israel's claim to have been able to steal or access files and documents from what it says was the  secret Iranian nuclear archive located in a warehouse in south Tehran may be a tale of daring espionage in itself but, beyond that, what is really new? Iran of course has insisted consistently that it never had a nuclear weapons programme but there were growing international concerns about its nuclear activities. That is precisely why the major powers entered into the 2015 agreement with Tehran in the first place, both to contain its nuclear programme and to introduce a greater level of outside scrutiny. France, Germany and Britain who all back the maintenance of the agreement have had their say with Mr Trump - the US president must decide upon its fate in mid-May.  Now Mr Netanyahu has had his turn to put the contrary view. Speaking in English from Israel's defence ministry in Tel Aviv, Mr Netanyahu showed off what he said were ""exact copies"" of documents obtained by Israeli intelligence from a secret storage facility in Tehran. There were, he said, 55,000 pages of evidence and a further 55,000 files on 183 CDs relating to Project Amad. The project, he said, had had the explicit goal of producing five warheads, each with the yield of 10 kilotonnes of TNT. ""These files conclusively prove that Iran was brazenly lying when it said it never had a nuclear weapons programme."" The files had been shared with the US, Mr Netanyahu said, and would be submitted to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A 2007 US National Intelligence Estimate assessed ""with high confidence"" that Iran did have a nuclear weapons programme,externalup until 2003 but that Iran had stopped it after its discovery. On Monday the Israeli prime minister argued the existence of the alleged files proved Iran had been ""secretly storing Project Amad material to use at a time of its choice to develop nuclear weapons"". The agreement signed between Iran and six world powers lifted crippling economic sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear programme. There had been fears that Iran would use the programme to create a nuclear weapon. Under the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran is committed  to slashing the number of its centrifuges, which are machines used to enrich uranium. It is also meant to cut its stockpile of enriched uranium drastically and not enrich remaining uranium to the level needed to produce nuclear weapons. The number of centrifuges installed at Iran's Natanz and Fordo sites was cut drastically soon after the deal while tonnes of low-enriched uranium were shipped to Russia. Furthermore, monitors from the IAEA have been able to carry out snap inspections at Iranian nuclear sites. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Tension between the long-standing enemies has grown steadily since Iran built up its military presence in Syria, Israel's north-eastern neighbour. Iran has also been accused of supplying weaponry to Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group Hezbollah, an enemy of Israel, and also smuggling arms to Palestinian militants. Mr Netanyahu has long vowed to stop Iran from strengthening its military presence in Syria. On Sunday night, a wave of unclaimed air strikes on targets in Syria reportedly killed a number of Iranians. Sites allegedly linked to a covert Syrian chemical weapons programme were bombed by Western nations earlier this month. Israel has also carried out, or is believed to have carried out, dozens of air strikes on facilities in Syria used by Iranian forces.

"An anti-Brexit protester outside the Houses of Parliament Peers have defeated the government in voting to give Parliament a potentially decisive say over Brexit. An amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill giving MPs the power to stop the UK from leaving without a deal, or to make Theresa May return to negotiations, was approved by 335 votes to 244. Its supporters said Parliament, not ministers, must ""determine the future of the country"". The government will now try to persuade MPs to strike out the change. Remain-backing MPs seize on Davis comment Brexit: All you need to know A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill UK will leave customs union, insists No 10 Ministers said giving Parliament a decisive say on the Brexit deal risked ""weakening"" the UK's hand in negotiations. But Labour said the vote marked a ""hugely significant moment"" in the fight to ensure Parliament has a ""proper role"" in the Brexit negotiations and a no-deal situation was avoided. It was one of three government defeats on the Brexit bill on Monday evening. So far, the government has framed Parliament's vote on a final Brexit deal as a stark choice; take it or leave it. The implication - if MPs reject whatever terms are negotiated - the UK would leave the EU without a deal on future relations. But this amendment agreed by the House of Lords could prevent that, by giving Parliament the power to decide what happens if MPs turn down the final agreement. The result will embolden those pushing for a greater role for Parliament in the process. The bill will return to the Commons before anything is finalised - and with some Tory peers again proving their readiness to defy their party vote with the opposition, the question is how many Conservative MPs are prepared to do the same. Please upgrade your browser The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019. Both sides hope to negotiate the UK's withdrawal agreement by this October in order to give the UK and European Parliaments enough time to debate and vote on it before the moment of departure. The amendment proposed by Conservative Viscount Hailsham would allow Parliament to determine the government's course of action if MPs rejected the deal or if the UK and EU were not able to reach an agreement of any kind. It would also give Parliament control of the process if the legislation enshrining the withdrawal treaty promised by ministers was not approved by 29 March 2019. The peer, who as Douglas Hogg was an MP for many years, told the House of Lords the principle of parliamentary sovereignty was ""fundamental to our liberties and must not be betrayed"" when it came to Brexit. ""Whatever our party affiliation, our duty as parliamentarians is to our country and our conscience,"" he said. But former Conservative leader Lord Howard said the idea of effectively giving Parliament a veto over Brexit - which the public voted for in a 2016 referendum - was ""fundamentally misconceived"". ""I'm afraid it reveals the appalling lengths to which the die-hard Remainers are prepared to go to achieve their aims,"" he said. During the debate, government spokesman Lord Callanan said Parliament's vote would be binding and if it did reject the deal, the Article 50 process - determining the timetable for leaving - would ""kick in"" and the UK would leave. Speaking afterwards, he said ministers would consider the implications of the vote. ""What this amendment would do is weaken the UK's hand in our negotiations with the EU by giving Parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the government to do anything with regard to the negotiations - including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely."" In December, MPs voted in favour of a legal right to have their say on the withdrawal deal. Last week Brexit Secretary David Davis said the motion to be considered by MPs on the final deal would be amendable - raising the prospect of MPs having greater influence over the process. The government suffered another defeat later on Monday, as peers voted by 270 to 233 in favour of an amendment requiring ministers to get approval from Parliament for their aims in talks about the UK's future relationship with the EU. The Brexit department said it was ""disappointed"" that the Lords had backed the amendment, saying Parliament had been ""updated regularly throughout the negotiations"". The government, which does not have a majority in the Lords, also lost a vote on family reunification for asylum seekers after Brexit after peers backed an amendment by Labour's Lord Dubs.

"This video can not be played The second explosion targeted those at the scene of the first At least 26 people have been killed in two bombings in the Afghan capital Kabul, including several journalists documenting the scene. AFP chief photographer in Kabul, Shah Marai, is among the victims. The first explosion was carried out by an attacker on a motorbike. A second followed about 15 minutes later after a crowd, including several reporters, had gathered at the scene. The Islamic State group (IS) said it had carried out the attack. It was one of several fatal incidents on Monday. BBC reporter Ahmad Shah was also killed in a separate attack in the Khost region. And in a third attack, 11 children were killed in a suicide bombing intended to target Nato troops in Kandahar province. In the Kabul attack, the AFP news agency said the second blast had deliberately targeted the group of journalists, including its photographer Shah Marai. Allow Twitter content?

Nine journalists and photographers and four police officers, were among the dead, officials say. So far, 45 people have been reported injured. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty confirmed that three of its journalists,externalwere killed in the attack. Abadullah Hananzai, a journalist and cameraman, had been working on a story about narcotics, while Maharram Durrani worked on the weekly women's programme.

""This is the deadliest day for Afghan media in the past 15 years,"" the head of Tolo News TV, Lotfullah Najafizada, told the BBC. ""We went, all of us, to the blast site. We said: 'If you killed an entire line of journalists reporting here, in five hours time we're back here; the line is longer; the queue is longer and the resolve is greater."" Bombings in the Afghan capital are not uncommon. Earlier in April, a suicide bomb at a voter registration killed almost 60 people and injured 119, in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. The Taliban also remain active in the country, only 30% of which is under full government control,according to BBC research published earlier this year. Photo by Shah Marai: An Afghan girl scavenges for recyclables, 2011 AFP paid tribute to Shah Marai, who it said had six children, including a newborn baby. ""This is a devastating blow,"" global news director Michele Leridon said. ""We can only honour the extraordinary strength, courage and generosity of a photographer who covered often traumatic, horrific events with sensitivity and consummate professionalism."" A shooting in Khost province resulted in the death of a BBC reporter. ""It is with great sadness that the BBC can confirm the death of BBC Afghan reporter Ahmad Shah following an attack earlier today,"" said Jamie Angus, director of the BBC World Service. Ahmad Shah, 29, was killed by unknown attackers in Khost ""Ahmad Shah was 29.  He had worked for the BBC Afghan service for more than a year and had already established himself as a highly capable journalist who was a respected and popular member of the team. ""This is a devastating loss and I send my sincere condolences to Ahmad Shah's friends and family and the whole BBC Afghan team. ""We are doing all we can to support his family at this very difficult time."" Local police are investigating a motive. Also on Monday, a suicide bomb attack in the Kandahar region killed 11 schoolchildren and injured many more. The bomber appeared to have been targeting a military vehicle convoy in Daman district, but the explosion struck a nearby religious school.

"Large explosions were reportedly seen coming from a military facility south of Hama Missile strikes on military sites in northern Syria overnight reportedly killed a number of pro-government fighters, including Iranians. The Syrian military said facilities in Hama and Aleppo provinces were struck. It did not say if there were any casualties. But a UK-based monitoring group said four Syrians and 22 foreigners, mostly Iranians, died. It is not known who was behind the attacks. But Western nations and Israel have previously hit sites in Syria. Earlier this month, the US, UK and France bombed three facilities they said were associated with the Syrian government's alleged chemical weapons programme. Israel is meanwhile alleged to have hit an airbase reportedly serving as an Iranian drone command centre and containing an advanced Iranian air defence system. The office of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will issue a statement on Monday evening on a ""significant development"" regarding the nuclear deal between Western powers and Iran. Mr Netanyahu has been a staunch opponent of the deal, arguing that it should be ""fixed"" or scrapped. US President Donald Trump is due to decide on 12 May whether or not to reimpose nuclear-related sanctions on Iran, a move which would put the agreement in jeopardy. US-led strikes on Syria: What was hit? Israel blamed for Syria airfield attack Why is there a war in Syria? A Syrian military source cited bythe official Sana news agency did not identify any specific locations, saying only that the military sites were ""exposed... to a new aggression"",externalat 22:30 (19:30 GMT). The source added that the strikes came after ""terrorist organisations"" had suffered defeats in the countryside around the capital, Damascus, an apparent reference to the recent recapture of the Eastern Ghouta region from rebel groups. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, said one strike appeared to have targeted a depot for surface-to-surface missiles at the 47th Brigade military base, south of the city of Hama. The pro-opposition Orient News website also reported thatlarge explosions were seen coming from what were believed to be ammunition caches at the base,external. Allow Facebook content?

Opposition media activist Mohammed Rasheed told the Associated Press thatdebris from the explosion at the depot struck parts of Hama,externaland that residents of areas near the base fled their homes. Missiles are also reported to have hit locations in the Salhab area, west of Hama city, and the area surrounding Nairab military airport, which is close to the city of Aleppo and its international airport. The SOHR cited its sources as saying 26 pro-government fighters were killed in the missile strikes, most of them Iranians. It added that the death toll might rise as 60 fighters were wounded, some of them seriously, and that others were missing. An official from a pro-Assad military alliance that includes Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement told the New York Times thatthe strike on the 47th Brigade base destroyed 200 missiles and killed 16 people, including 11 Iranians,external. Iran's semi-official Fars news agency cited its sources as saying thatthe missiles struck weapons depots in southern Hama and an area north of Aleppo's airport,external, but they denied that Iranian military advisers were killed. Iran's Tasnim news agency also saidan ""informed"" source had dismissed as ""baseless"" the reports that Iranian facilities were hit and Iranians killed,external. A Syrian state-owned newspaper quoted sources as saying the missiles were fired from US-British bases in northern Jordan. But the SOHR said that given the nature of the reported targets, the missiles were probably fired by Israel. Israeli Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz said on Monday morning that he was ""not aware"" of any strikes. ""All the violence and instability in Syria is the result of Iran's attempts to establish a military presence there. Israel will not allow the opening of a northern front in Syria,"" he told Israel's Army Radio. The Israeli government has repeatedly vowed to stop Iran from strengthening its military presence in Syria, where it has deployed hundreds of troops to help keep President Bashar al-Assad in power since the country's civil war began in 2011. Thousands of Shia Muslim militiamen armed, trained and financed by Iran - mostly from Hezbollah, but also Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen - are also fighting alongside the Syrian army. By Ali Hashem, Iranian affairs correspondent, BBC Arabic, Beirut Up to now it is not clear who carried out the strikes, nor who exactly was killed. While a UK-based monitoring group said the casualties were mostly Iranian, sources in Iran denied that any of its bases were hit or any of its ""military advisers"" died. Analysts have speculated about Israeli or US involvement. Syrian media quoted a senior military source as saying that nine missiles were fired from a US-British base in Jordan. Iranian MP Alaeddin Boroujerdi met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad hours after the strikes It is very unlikely that a US-led attack would be carried out without Washington admitting to it. On 8 April, an air strike - believed to be Israeli (though not officially acknowledged) - targeted an Iranian facility at the T4 airbase in Homs province, killing seven Iranian personnel. Iranian officials vowed to respond to that attack, and on MondayIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned the US that the ""the time of hitting and running is gone"",external.

"Sajid Javid has been appointed health secretary following the resignation of Matt Hancock who stepped down for breaking social distancing guidelines. Mr Javid previously served as home secretary under former Prime Minister Theresa May, and in 2019 was promoted to chancellor by Boris Johnson. However he only lasted in that role for six months, resigning in February 2020 following tensions with the prime minister's then-advisor Dominic Cummings. Mr Javid was told he would have to sack his own advisors, but he rejected the order saying it was something ""no self-respecting minister"" could accept. Following his resignation as chancellor, Mr Javid returned to life as a backbench MP, but also took up a job with JP Morgan.

Mr Javid, a 50-year-old father of four,told the Evening Standard in 2012,external: ""My dad was from a tiny village in Pakistan and came here when he was 17 to look for work. ""He settled in Rochdale and became a cotton-mill worker for Courtaulds. But he was quite ambitious, and saw that bus drivers were better paid. His nickname was Mr Night and Day because he used to work every hour God sent his way."" Mr Javid's father's job was the same as the father of another high-profile politician, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and he congratulated the Labour politician ""from one son of a Pakistani bus driver to another"" after his City Hall victory in 2016. Mr Javid spent his school years in Bristol after his parents took over a ladieswear shop there, with the family living in a two-bed flat above it. Hetold the Daily Mail,externalin 2014 that the school, a local comprehensive, was tough and ""I was naughty, more interested in watching Grange Hill than homework."" But, he said, things changed when his dad read the riot act. ""He said 'this is what I went through, don't let me down'. I felt really bad. My academic work rocketed."" He said that his school did not want to pay for him to do maths O-Level - his dad ended paying for it instead. Sajid Javid previously served in Boris Johnson's cabinet as chancellor He had also developed an interest in financial markets, sparked by the Thatcher government's privatisations. At the age of 14 he went to see his father's bank manager and arranged to borrow Â£500 to invest in shares, becoming a regular reader of the Financial Times. His goal became to work in the City so he passed that maths O-Level and, rejecting his school's suggestion he become a TV repair man, headed off to sixth form college and then to Exeter University to study economics and politics - giving a clear hint of his future career direction. He also met his future wife, Laura, while doing a summer job at Commercial Union. They sat opposite each other and shared a stapler, he told the Daily Mail. Their four children are privately educated: ""We do what's best for them,"" Mr Javid, who has described himself as a non-practising Muslim, told the newspaper. After university, he set his sights on a job in the City. As he told the Standard: ""Some people, in a friendly way, tried to lower my expectations. ""They often tell you that unless you wear an old school tie or have the family contacts, you just won't get a chance to work in the City. But they were wrong."" His career move worked out well, although he had to move across the Atlantic to succeed. And by the age of 25, he had become a vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank, later moving to Singapore for a period with Deutsche Bank. He rose to become a managing director before leaving in the summer of 2009 to concentrate on a political career. A Conservative Party supporter from the early 1980s, he had attended his first conference towards the end of the Thatcher years, with Conservative friends from university such as fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon. They got into a bit of trouble at the 1990 conference, handing out leaflets against the then prime minister's decision to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, opposing the policy despite being diehard fans of Mrs Thatcher's. According to aConservativeHome profile,,externalMr Javid, Mr Halfon, another future Tory MP David Burrowes and Tim Montgomerie - founder of ConservativeHome - got up at 07:00 so they could get front-row seats for what turned out to be Mrs Thatcher's final party conference speech. Two decades on and, in 2010, he was elected for the first time, and made swift progress. He began his ministerial career with roles in the Treasury, before becoming the first cabinet minister of Asian descent when he was appointed culture, media and sport secretary in 2014. He did that for a year before moving to business secretary for a year and then moving on to be communities and local government secretary. Sajid Javid (third from left) with the 2014 Budget team Long thought of as a Eurosceptic, it was a surprise to many when Mr Javid came out for Remain during the UK's 2016 referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. That meant, of course, that like then-Home Secretary Theresa May and his one-time mentor, then Chancellor George Osborne, he was on the losing side. There was an ill-fated and very short-lived bid to succeed David Cameron as Conservative leader after the referendum, on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb. (He would have been chancellor to Mr Crabb's prime minister.) He also ran in the 2019 leadership election but was eliminated in the fourth round before Mr Johnson went on to become prime minister. Mr Javid was appointed home secretary in April 2018, following the resignation of Amber Rudd during the fallout fromthe Windrush scandal. At the time, Mr Javidtold the Sunday Telegraph,externalthe scandal ""immediately impacted him"". Mr Javid told the newspaper: ""When I heard about the Windrush issue, I thought that could be my mum, it could be my dad, it could be my uncle, it could be me."" In 2019 he took a hardline stance towardsShamima Begum, who left London to join the Islamic State group aged 15, revoking her British citizenship when she asked to return. The move boosted his popularity amongst some Tories but provoked criticism from others - particularly after her newborn son died in a Syrian refugee camp. Mr Javid talking to Tata Steel workers in 2016 In his previous cabinet roles he avoided major calamity, although he faced questions as business secretaryover Tata steel, and as communities secretary over the government response to theGrenfell disaster,external. However, he had not been afraid to ruffle feathers, with uncompromising messages to some in the business community and local government.

"There are many complex tasks to be across in the Home Office brief The new Home Secretary Sajid Javid faces a massive task. And none of it - from terrorism through to the Windrush crisis - is easy to fix. The Home Office sits at the heart of some of the most complex and challenging decisions in government - and, if his predecessors' experiences are any guide, Mr Javid should probably give up now on the hope of having much of a life beyond his red ministerial boxes. I'll come back to immigration in a moment, but first on the list for any incoming home secretary is appreciating the scale of the security threat. Every day, he will see a dozen dossiers from the police and intelligence agencies asking for permission to intercept the communications of people who are a threat to the UK. There are regular top secret security briefings on the latest possible terror plot. This is his first responsibility: keeping the UK safe. Sajid Javid to be new home secretary Live: Reaction as Javid replaces Rudd Why has the home secretary resigned? Mr Javid inherits very thorny issues over the future of the security and intelligence agencies. MI5 is under pressure to share more of what it knows with local agencies like social services, in the hope they will uncover potential extremists more quickly. Local police chiefs and counter-terrorism coordinators also regard neighbourhood teams as the frontline of counter-terrorism intelligence gathering. They want more cash to keep those officers on the beat. This, in turn, feeds into the questions of police funding - with figures showing rising knife and violent crime. One of Ms Rudd's last acts was to launch the Home Office's latest strategy to end serious violence. It's not clearhow it really differs from what has gone before. Will Mr Javid rip it up and start again? She was also particularly focused on overhauling protection for victims of domestic violence - and the Home Office isconsulting on new laws,external. Will this legislation stay on track, or fall by the wayside if Mr Javid comes under pressure to put all his energies into reforming the immigration system? Then there are unexpected events. Nobody foresaw the Salisbury poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. As and when the domestic intelligence agencies uncover new details of how it happened, Mr Javid will need to be clear about how he wants to respond. Similarly, while there is a tried-and-tested plan to respond to terrorism attacks, if the worst were to happen again, he will be expected to take a lead, even though he has absolutely no experience in this area. One of the biggest challenges in the in-tray is making sure that the UK secures co-operation with the EU member states on crime and security before Brexit becomes reality. Amber Rudd's team have been working on a new security treaty. This isn't headline-writing stuff - but it is crucial to every nation's mutual security. Amid the politics of Brexit, Mr Javid, who said he voted to remain but is also considered a Eurosceptic, will have to play a careful hand to keep continental partners on side. Ultimately, the biggest job he faces is sorting out immigration. From removal targets to a plan for EU citizens; from staff for a stretched NHS through to students and the net migration target; the task is enormous. Almost exactly 12 years ago, another Home Secretary - Labour's Charles Clarke - lost his job over his department's failure to properly manage the removal of foreign national offenders. In between his sacking and the resignation of Amber Rudd on Sunday, there has been a string of reorganisations of the immigration system. But the same problems remain: damning reports underlining that the system is creaking, underfunded and struggling with backlogs, poor decision-making and, now, the accusation that the Windrush generation became an easy target to improve the statistics. In the week that Parliament was awash with anger over the treatment ofpeople like Paulette Wilson, who came to the UK from Jamaica as a child in the 1960s, an Iraqi man called Rbar Mala was jailed for helping hundreds of IS fighters. The Home Office had told himhe had no right to be in the UK. For many critics, why Mrs Wilson was labelled an illegal immigrant, but a man like Mala was not deported goes right to the questions of trust and competence. I have lost count of the number of people who have said to me down the years that the Home Office is ""too big to manage"" - and therefore incapable of caring. That is unfair to the many civil servants who are trying to make a positive difference but find their efforts constantly battered by political winds and the sheer bureaucracy of the place. Perhaps Sajid Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, who became a successful investment banker, will finally bring not just new management skills but a human touch to the Home Office.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd faced criticism over the existence of Home Office removals targets and her knowledge of them Amber Rudd's resignation over the question of whether she knew about targets to remove illegal immigrants has shown once again that being home secretary remains one of the most high-risk jobs in government. Although Theresa May lasted more than six years in the job and used it as a springboard to Downing Street, her successor joins a long list of others, including David Blunkett, Jacqui Smith and Charles Clarke, who ended up paying the price for personal or administrative failings with their jobs. Before the full extent of the Windrush controversy became clear, shining an unflattering light on the workings and culture of her department and Ms Rudd's own command of her brief, the 54-year-old had been regarded as one of the Conservatives' rising stars. Her views on Europe - she is one of the cabinet's most pro-European voices and her brother Roland helped run the Remain campaign - were not to everyone's tastes within the party but despite this she was seen as being capable, tough and - until recent weeks - unflappable. In her early years in Parliament after being elected in 2010, she was regarded as being a protege of George Osborne on the liberal-modernising wing of the party, a member of the so-called ""friends of George"". Ms Rudd at a constituency event in 2011 - she scraped home in last year's election despite a significant swing to Labour She was promoted rapidly under David Cameron, working for a while in the Treasury and becoming energy and climate change secretary after the Conservatives' surprise victory in the 2015 general election. Her growing reputation was further enhanced during the 2016 Brexit referendum. She was one of the star performers during the main TV debate - caustically taking Boris Johnson to task and suggesting he was ""not the kind of man that you would want to drive you home at the end of the evening"". She not only survived Theresa May's clearout of Cameron/Osborne supporters after she became PM but was rewarded with the plum job of home secretary, stepping into her boss's shoes. Her first year in the Home Office went smoothly enough although dealing with the succession of terror attacks that took place during 2017 was a harrowing experience. The 54-year old was appointed home secretary in July 2016 She has been MP for Hastings and Rye in East Sussex since 2010 She won the seat in 2017 by just 346 votes She was a Remain supporter in 2016 referendum - her brother helped fund campaign She was married for five years to the late journalist and writer AA Gill An Edinburgh University graduate, she previously worked in banking and recruitment She was credited as a consultant on the 1994 hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral Ms Rudd earned plenty of plaudits after deputising for Mrs May in the 2017 general election leadership debate, despite her father Tony - a stockbroker and businessman - having died a few days before. She used up one of her political lives on election night when it looked, for several hours, as if she had lost her Hastings and Rye seat and ended up only scraping home by 346 votes. This video can not be played Amber Rudd and Jeremy Corbyn in the General election 2017 debate She remained in the Home Office after the election and with questions over Mrs May's future swirling around, she was talked of as a potential successor who could appeal to both wings of the party. But in the face of daily revelations about the plight of Windrush migrants and their families, Ms Rudd appeared slow to respond and, despite numerous apologies, to appreciate the scale and significance of the crisis. Previously regarded as having more liberal views on immigration than her predecessor, she was soon accused of making the government's ""hostile environment"" policy for illegal immigrants even tougher, with disastrous repercussions for thousands of people in the country legally. More significantly, she was forced to publicly backtrack on claims that the Home Office did not have targets for removing immigration offenders, admitting to MPs she had been wrong. She was appointed energy and climate change secretary by David Cameron after the Tories' 2015 election win The opposition soon called for her head, describing her as a ""human shield"" for the prime minister. But there was no appetite on the Tory benches - either from Brexiters or Remainers - for her to go, with three cabinet ministers already having had to quit in the past six months. The final nail in her coffin was when her claim to the Commons that she was not aware of the targets was contradicted not only by a memo she had been sent by a top Home Office official, published by the Guardian, but also a letterMs Rudd herself sent to the prime minister,externalsetting out ""ambitious but deliverable"" deportation targets. Ms Rudd published a strategy earlier this month on tackling violent crime, after a rise in deaths in London Before entering politics, Ms Rudd had successful careers working in finance, journalism and executive recruitment - as well as somewhat incongruously being ""aristocracy consultant"" on the hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral. She was married for five years to the late writer and Sunday Times columnist AA Gill, with whom she had two children. At a recent lunch for Westminster journalists, she responded to questions about her future leadership ambitions by saying that she merely ""wanted to stay in the game"". She will now have more time to ponder her own future in that game from the backbenches and also to reflect on the conventional wisdom in Westminster - seemingly dispelled by Mrs May - that the Home Office is the graveyard of many a political career. The British troopship HMT Empire Windrush anchored at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 21 June 1948. It is regarded as the symbolic starting point of a wave of Caribbean migration known as the ""Windrush generation"". Now, despite living and working in the UK for decades, it has emerged that some of the families of these Windrush migrants have been threatened with deportation and denied access to the NHS, benefits and pensions.

"Michel Barnier said the Republic of Ireland has the support of all EU member states There can be no Brexit withdrawal agreement without a ""backstop"" option for the Irish border, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator has said. Michel Barnier said the Republic of Ireland has the full support of all EU member states and all EU institutions. The backstop would involve NI, or the UK as a whole, aligning with the EU rules required to support North-South cooperation and an all-island economy. Mr Barnier was speaking atthe start of a two-day visit to Ireland. The UK has accepted the need for a backstop to be written into the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Analysis: Brexit brokers and backstop âbingoâ Q&A: Brexit and the Irish border Long read: The hardest border But it has not agreed what EU rules it should cover. At the beginning of the all-island Brexit forum in Dundalk, County Louth, Mr Barnier said he knows that the so-called backstop has been the subject of ""heated discussions in the UK"". ""To be clear: without a backstop, there can be no withdrawal agreement,"" said Mr Barnier. ""This is an EU issue, not only an Irish issue."" It almost became Brexit bingo - as journalists lost count of how many times Mr Barnier referenced the ""backstop"" option for the Irish border. The backstop would mean that in the absence of any other solution, Northern Ireland, or the UK as a whole, would align with EU rules required to support north-south cooperation and an all-island economy. While in principle the UK signed up to this option, precise detail on it has yet to appear. Mr Barnier's three points were: The UK government has agreed to a backstop and knows that without it there is no withdrawal agreement The EU is not using the backstop as a negotiating tactic The backstop is necessary to protect the integrity of the customs union and single market In brief - the backstop was agreed - so let's get on with it. Read more from Jayne here Mr Barnier also denied claims from Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), that he has been ""aggressive"" towards Northern Ireland unionists in the Brexit talks. The DUP leader said earlier that Mr Barnier did not understand the dispute and was not an ""honest broker"". In response, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator said he was not ready to engage in ""polemics"" with Mrs Foster. Mr Barnier's visit comes amid rising tensions over the future UK-Ireland border. He told a press conference in Dundalk at the beginning of the all-island Brexit forum that his ""door is open"" to Mrs Foster and the DUP. He said he had not approached the negotiations in a ""spirit of revenge"". This video can not be played DUP leader Arlene Foster: Brexit negotiations have 'become aggressive' He added that he regretted the UK had voted to leave the EU, and said he was determined to work with the UK to find a solution to the Irish border issue. The all-island Brexit forum is being hosted by the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and his deputy, Simon Coveney. On Sunday,Mr Barnier said the UKwas contradicting itself over its Irish border policy. But Mrs Foster said she believes Mr Barnier does not understand the dispute and is ""not an honest broker"". In return, he said that Mrs Foster needed to respect that his role was to negotiate on behalf of the EU and not to act as a mediator. Meanwhile the Taoiseach again there needed to be ""meaningful progress"" on the border issue by the June EU summit. Mr Varadkar said otherwise it would be difficult to get thewithdrawal agreementin place by October. The two-day all-island Brexit forum began on Monday In December, the UK and EU reached a political agreement in which the UK committed to protecting north-south cooperation on the island of Ireland. It also guaranteed there would be no hard border, including physical infrastructure or related checks and controls. However, the EU's proposed backstop solution to avoid a hard border - keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union after Brexit - continues to be at odds with what the UK government and the DUP say they would accept. Mrs Foster told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg the DUP would not accept Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK. Arlene Foster has warned Michel Barnier the DUP will not accept Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK She said: ""Michel Barnier's trying to present himself as someone who cares deeply about Northern Ireland and if that is the case he needs to hear the fact that we are part of the United Kingdom [and] will remain part of the United Kingdom constitutionally, politically and economically. ""Therefore his proposal of us being in an all-Ireland regulatory scenario with a border down the Irish Sea simply does not work. ""It does not work constitutionally, politically and it certainly does not work from an economic perspective."" This video can not be played The Irish border bridge where stakes are high Mrs Foster added: ""We've tried to get him to understand the unionist position for the people of Northern Ireland but he hasn't really responded and I'm disappointed about that. ""I don't think he does understand the wider unionist culture of Northern Ireland."" The DUP is also expressing annoyance that Mr Varadkar is visiting Northern Ireland later without giving notice. Mr Barnier is due to meet Mr Varadkar on Monday and will also speak to business leaders on both sides of the Irish border during his trip.

"Logan Paul's daily vlogs typically attract more than three million views Logan Paul - one of YouTube's most popular and controversial video-makers - has announced he will no longer release material on a ""daily"" basis. The 23-year-old began his Daily Vlogs series in September 2016, and has since built up an audience of 17 million subscribers. He said that his channel would survive, but that he wanted ""to exercise [my] creativity in different ways"". Others who have attempted the format have struggled with its demands. Mr Paul boasted within a video he uploaded on Sunday, that he was responsible for the fastest-ever YouTube channel to attract 10 million subscribers. But he notably had to put the series on a one-month hiatus at the start of the year after posting a video from Japan that featured an apparent suicide victim. The backlash that followed led YouTube to briefly suspend all ads on his videos, and the platform still excludes him from its top-tier Google Preferred ad scheme. Despite apologising for that video, the self-styled maverick has barely tamed his act since. In recent months, the Los Angeles-based film-maker has joked about eating detergent pods; posted a video showing himself lifting a fish from a pond to seemingly pump its heart; and his most recent video features a mock-fight in which a friend repeatedly punches him in the head before he in turn kicks them several times in the ribs. But one expert said that Mr Paul understood his audience, who in turn have enjoyed his posts and bought his merchandise. ""Logan tries to position himself as a kind of thought-leader, but in a sort of fun, boisterous, playful way that appeals to a younger demographic,"" commented Alex Brinnand, co-editor of the news site TenEighty. ""But because of the size of his audience and its age, he's been in a position of authority, and has been a mouthpiece not only for the younger generations but the YouTube community as well."" Logan Paul 'won't be kicked off' YouTube YouTube drops ads from Logan Paul channels YouTube punishes Logan Paul over Japan suicide video Mr Paul posted a total of 536 daily vlogs - although in recent weeks there were several skipped days. That narrowly beat the number posted by the YouTuber generally acknowledged to have done most to popularise the format: Casey Neistat. Mr Neistat managed to post a video every day for 534 consecutive days before taking a rest in August 2016, sayinghe had squeezed the medium like an orange,external""until there's no juice left"".

This video can not be played Shoppers react to supermarket merger Sainsbury's and Asda will remain separate brands and no stores will close, Mr Coupe told the BBC. ""There's been a bit of commentary over the weekend where people have been alluding to the fact that the only way of making this happen is by closing stores - that is not true,"" said Mr Coupe. Following the merger Argos will open outlets within Asda stores, the firms said. Sainsbury's took over Argos in 2016 and has been integrating the catalogue retailer into its own stores. Sainsbury's said it couldn't comment on what would happen to customers' Nectar points after the merger. The combined business will overtake current market leader Tesco, representing around 30% of UK grocery sales. That will give it greater muscle in the market. Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told the BBC she was concerned at the impact on suppliers of the proposed tie-up. The combined group ""will have immense purchasing power, giving them an opportunity to bargain very hard with suppliers,"" she warned. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the firms should explain how they plan to merge their supply chains fairly, and reassure people that cost savings wouldn't be achieved ""simply by milking their small suppliers for all they're worth"". Sainsbury's and Asda executives said one advantage of the merger would be the opportunity to bring in ""the power of Walmart in the form of buying of general merchandise and in the form of their systems and investments"". A competition probe seems inevitable given the size of the two chains and the UK's competition watchdog,the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA),,externalsaid on Monday it was ""likely"" to review the merger. Sainsbury's and Asda have asked for the CMA investigation to be fast-tracked and hope to complete the deal by the autumn of 2019. At the weekend, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the merger risked creating ""even more concentrated local monopolies"" and said the CMA should force the companies to sell off stores if the new giant was dominant in a particular area. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said he thought there was ""a pretty good chance"" that the deal will be allowed to proceed, but the main debate would be over how many stores Sainsbury's and Asda would have to sell ""to placate the CMA"". ""Too many store disposals and the deal won't be worth doing... too few store disposals and the CMA will look toothlessâ¦ hopefully there will be a ""Goldilocks"" scenario for Sainsbury's/Asda."" Sainsbury's and Asda are both being buffeted by competition from budget supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl. On the horizon, Amazon is making initial steps into grocery deliveries. ""I think from a market share perspective, both Sainsbury's and Asda are landlocked to a certain extent. They're not really able to grow at a rapid rate,"" said Steve Dresser, director of the Grocery Insight consultancy. ""If they remain on their own it's difficult to see how they get any real growth beyond standard organic growth, which isn't necessarily going to be enough when Amazon joins the market,"" said Mr Dresser. The two chains are in many ways complementary: Sainsbury's stores are focused more in the south of the UK and target a higher-end market segment. Asda is more concentrated in the north, offering lower-cost groceries. Even after reducing prices for customers, Mike Coupe thinks synergies will generate Â£500m of extra savings, in part through taking advantage of Walmart's clout with suppliers. As for Walmart they will receive Â£3bn as well as their 42% stake in the company. But the deal also offers Walmart the option of exiting the UK market altogether in four years' time.

"This video can not be played Prof David Vaughan: ""I believe this is the biggest field campaign ever run in Antarctica"" It is going to be one of the biggest projects ever undertaken in Antarctica. UK and US scientists will lead a five-year effort to examine the stability of the mighty Thwaites Glacier. This ice stream in the west of the continent is comparable in size to Britain. It is melting and is currently in rapid retreat, accounting for around 4% of global sea-level rise - an amount that has doubled since the mid-1990s. Researchers want to know if Thwaites could collapse. Were it to do so, its lost ice would push up the oceans by 80cm or more. Some computer models have suggested such an outcome is inevitableif conditions continue as they are - albeit on a timescale of centuries. But these simulations need to be anchored in many more real-world observations, which will now be acquired thanks to the joint initiative announced on Monday. ""There is still a question in my view as to whether Thwaites has actually entered an irreversible retreat,"" said Prof David Vaughan, the director of science at the British Antarctic Survey. ""It assumes the melt rates we see today continue into the future and that's not guaranteed. Thwaites is clearly on the verge of an irreversible retreat, but to be sure we need 10 years more data,"" he told BBC News. Antarctica 'gives ground to the ocean' 'Boaty McBoatface' survives ice mission Ice loss spreads up Antarctic glaciers The UK'sNatural Environment Research Council,externaland the USNational Science Foundation,externalare going to deploy about 100 scientists to Thwaites on a series of expeditions. The International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) is the two nations' biggest cooperative venture on the White Continent for more than 70 years - since the end of a mapping project on the Antarctic Peninsula in the late 1940s. Grants for research totalling Â£20m have been awarded. Once the costs of transport and resupply to this remotest of regions is factored in, the total value of the ITGC will probably top Â£40m. Thwaites is a marine-terminating glacier. Snows fall on land and these compact into ice that then flows out to sea. This video can not be played Timelapse satellite images of Thwaites Glacier melting When in balance the quantity of snow at the glacier's head matches the ice lost to the ocean at its front through the calving of icebergs. But Thwaites is out of balance. It has speeded up and is currently flowing at over 4km per year. It is also thinning at a rate of almost 40cm a year. ""When we look at the historical satellite record we can see that this thinning started after 2000, spreading inland at a rate of 10-12km/year at its fastest,"" explained Dr Anna Hogg from Leeds University. ""So on Thwaites Glacier, the increase in ice speed has coincided with a period of rapid ice thinning, and grounding line retreat, which suggests that the observed changes may have been caused by warm ocean water reaching the glacier and accelerating ice melt."" The grounding line refers to the zone where the glacier enters the sea and lifts up to form a buoyant platform of ice. If warm ocean bottom-waters are able to get under this shelf, the grounding line can be eroded and the glacier forced backwards even if local air temperatures are sub-zero. Key to this process in the case of Thwaites is that a large portion of the ice stream sits below sea level, with the rock bed sloping back towards the continent. This can produce what scientists refer to as ""marine ice sheet instability"" - an inherently unstable architecture, which, once knocked, can go into an irreversible decline. ""The other process we're concerned about is something called marine ice cliff instability,"" said Dr Ted Scambos, the principal coordinating investigator on the US side of the project from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. ""This is where a tall cliff that might form at the front of the glacier begins to calve - begins to break away - in a runaway fashion. It hasn't been seen yet in this part of Antarctica; it might be present in some parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, but around Greenland seems to be a path to a very rapid retreat of the ice front."" The floating front of the glacier is hundreds of metres thick The ITGC aims to determine how all of this will play out for Thwaites. Its scientists will map the ice stream's every behaviour. They will monitor the way ocean water moves beneath the floating shelf, and drill sediments from under and just in front of the glacier to find out what it did during past warming events on Earth. The work will involve multiple instruments and techniques, including the use of autonomous vehicles. The yellow submarine known asBoaty McBoatface is expected to explore the cavityunder the buoyant sections of Thwaites. Seals will also be assisting the research. Prof Karen Heywood from the University of East Anglia, working in tandem with St Andrews University, will be attaching sensors to the heads of the animals. She told BBC News: ""The seals dive in the course of their normal life and every time they come to the surface to breathe, the data are transmitted back home. The seals monitor their own environment - where they went, how deep they dived, and how warm the water was they were diving in. At the end of the year, they moult and the tag falls off, so they don't have to live with it forever."" Prof Vaughan said that while the UK and America were leading the project, he thought other countries would want to get involved. ""Funding from NERC and NSF has set this train in motion, but I fully expect other nations now to join their carriages.""

"The web address used to advertise travel packages but now redirects users to a French government site The French government is being sued over the way it has sought to take over the France.com web domain. In 2015, France started legal action against Frenchman Jean-Noel Frydman, who had registered France.com in 1994. Two years later, a French court ruled in France's favour and the government began to lobby domain host web.com to take control away from Mr Frydman. And now Mr Frydman, who built a business around the domain, says France has ""illegally"" seized the site. He says France.com was taken away from him without warning in mid-March. And he has now begun legal action in Virginia in a bid to regain control of it. The French government has been accused of illegally seizing the France.com domain Mr Frydman is suing the French Republic, its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Atout France tourist agency and domain registrar Verisign. He alleges the government did not ask to license or buy the domain and instead ""misused"" the legal system to seize it. ""If it happened to me, it can happen to anyone,"" Mr Frydman toldtechnology news site Ars Technica,external. He said he had run France.com as an information hub for French people and fans of French culture living in the US. And much of the information about French culture and events had been generated with the help of French government agencies, including its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But, despite this continuing official collaboration, the 2015 legal action had alleged that France.com had been acting in ""bad faith"" and did not have official permission to use the domain.

"David Davis and ministers take questions Business statement outlines forthcoming debates General debate on various issues Lords questions at 11am Debate on Brexit sanctions Gary Connor, Esther Webber and Richard Morris The second-generation immigrant son of a bus driver previously served Boris Johnson as chancellor. House of LordsParliament The House of Lords adjourns and will return on 8 May, when peers will have their sixth and final day of report-stage debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill. What happened? House of CommonsParliament With the conclusion of the general debate, the Commons adjourns. The day started with Exiting the EU questions, of which many were tabled along the same lines: what is the progress of negotiations? David Davis insisted that progress had been made on the issues of citizens rights and financial arrangements. The government once again confirmed that they were seeking a special solution to the problem of the Northern Irish border. The Business statement followed, with some legislation to be wrapped up next week. The general debate raised issues over the ongoing row over immigration at the Home Office, NHS funding, young criminal barristers and workers' rights. The Commons is not sitting on Monday due to the May bank holiday, but will return on Tuesday at 2.30pm with Health and Social Care questions. Breast cancer screening statement House of LordsParliament Health Minister Lord O'Shaughnessy is repeating a statement given by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in the Commons yesterday. He announced an independent review into why 450,000 women in England failed to receive invitations for a final routine breast cancer screening between the ages of 68 and 71. Labour spokesperson Baroness Thornton says ""as a woman of my age, we absolutely rely on these tests"", adding: ""Eight years is a long time for an error of this magnitude to go unnoticed."" Lib Dem Baroness Maddock wants to know if the NHS has enough staff to process the screening backlog, stressing ""speed is of the essence"". Lord O'Shaughnessy replies that the government wants to work with other parties to get it right. He says questions over whether the failure could have been detected sooner must be answered by the review, and it must not affect ongoing screening processes. Breast cancer screening: what went wrong? General debate House of CommonsParliament Paul Maynard, government whip, says that an adjournment debate is taking place for ""one day off,"" and calls it ""a treat"". Mr Maynard says that the UK government has been clear on the rights of EU citizens arriving in the UK during the transition period. He says that the justice minister ""is working with the Bar Council"" to raise the issues faced by young criminal barristers, which Conservative MP Bob Stewart raised during his speech. He adds that ""humanity and dignity should be at the heart of everything we do,"" in replying to Chris Stephens' speech, where he raised concerns over the UK's immigration system and workers' rights. General debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Karin Smyth says that in the three weeks since Easter, the government ""has managed to have two scandals and a resignation"" - and she says she is looking forward to a ""quieter"" period over the bank holiday weekend. She agrees with Bob Stewart's speech, on the ""crisis"" at the criminal bar and underfunding of legal aid availability. She agrees with Chris Stephens that the government is confusing people about whether or not the public sector pay cap has been lifted or not. She raises concerns that the NHS is not planning enough for emergency situations. She states that it is one of the most ""undermanaged"" public services for its size in the world. ""We do have a concern now about the level of funding compared to the issues around safety,"" she says, before praising the ""marvellous work of NHS managers across the country"" Sanctions policy House of LordsParliament Foreign Office Minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon says that the UK will continue to cooperate on security with the EU after Brexit. ""This cooperation after we leave... sanctions will continue to be a multilateral tool, and we will continue to seek to impose them with others."" Lord Ahmad adds that it is in both the UK and EU's interest to discuss sanctions in future. ""Through the exchange of analysis and information this will allow us to combine our efforts on sanctions to the greatest effect,"" he says. Sanctions policy House of LordsParliament Responding on behalf of Labour, Lord Collins of Highbury, the party's foreign affairs spokesperson in the House thanks Baroness Verma and the committee for the ""excellent and timely report"". ""Sanctions are not in isolation of our foreign policy. They have to be an integral part of it,"" he says. He says that sanctions in isolation do not work - ""they are gesture politics"". He urges the government to ensure UK and EU co-operation continues after Brexit. A succession of senior ministers challenge Mrs May over one of the UK's preferred customs options. Peers have defeated the government 10 times during the passage of the EU Withdrawal Bill - but what does it mean for the government's Brexit plans? General debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Chris Stephens alleges that, while the prime minister has said that the public sector pay cap has been lifted, it still is being followed as workers are only to expect a 1% pay rise from their departments. He raises concerns that regulations for workers are under threat as there have been job losses in the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, as well as at the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. He says that staff at ACAS are, ironically, wanting to strike themselves over work and pay. Sanctions policy House of LordsParliament Labour peer Lord Anderson of Swansea welcomes the ""highly timely report"". He warns that Russia ""must learn that there is conduct that will not be accepted and will have to pay a price"". The Labour peer disagrees with those who dismiss sanctions as ""gesture politics"". ""Sanctions are indeed biting in Russia,"" he says. General debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Bob Stewart raises concerns on how young criminal barristers are treated in terms of pay and conditions. He raises the case of a young woman who could only take five days of holiday a year, could take no sick days and worked late nights and even weekends. He says she had to represent two different clients often in the same day at different courts. ""She told me there was simply no breaks at all. But it was her vocation and the job she wanted to do in her life,"" he says. After all her expenses, she only earned Â£10,000 in London a year. ""If this continues, we simply will not have enough criminal law barristers,"" he warns. Sanctions policy House of LordsParliament The Lords is beginning a debate on a report from the EU Affairs sub-committee on post-Brexit sanctions policy. The report looked at the UK's current sanctions regime and options for designing an autonomous regime and collaborating with the EU and other international partners after Brexit. The report warns that the effectiveness of UK sanctions will be undermined unless the UK can quickly agree arrangements for future sanctions policy co-operation with the EU. It warns that without agreement, the UK could be left with the choice of imposing ineffective unilateral sanctions or aligning with EU sanctions it has no influence over. General debate House of CommonsParliament Moving the debate, Backbench Business Committee Chair Ian Mearns says that members of the EU negotiating team are expressing ""concern"" about the UK's ability to handle EU immigration cases after the Windrush scandal. He states the case of his constituent who has been refused benefits in the UK since a disabling accident. He says she is struggling to fill out the forms online, as the forms insist she puts down when her children came to the UK - but they were born in the UK. He says that the number of people who have died in work related accidents have reduced since Health and Safety legislation was introduced. He adds that he is concerned that the government wants to remove Health and Safety legislation in the UK. ""HSE are working under great pressure"" in order to carry out their role, he says. Oral questions House of LordsParliament UUP peer Lord Empey is now asking whether the government plans to introduce ID cards. There have been periodic calls for the return of identity cards ever since they were scrapped in the UK in 1952. The most recent - and serious - attempt to bring them back began after the 11 September attacks in the US in 2001, when the Labour government adopted a significantly tougher stance on security and immigration. ""This government has no plans to revisit this decision,"" says minister Baroness Manzoor. General debate House of CommonsParliament MPs move on to their adjournment debate. This is standard practice
before any break in Parliamentary time, as the Commons is not sitting on
Monday. Any matters can be raised during a general debate such as
this. MPs often use the opportunity to tell others about upcoming events in
their constituencies and to raise issues of genuine concern to their
communities. This debate will end at 5pm. Political editor, Evening Standard, tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Minister Baroness Buscombe says that it is important to recognise that help is available ""in a number of ways"".

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd faced criticism over the existence of Home Office removals targets and her knowledge of them Amber Rudd's resignation over the question of whether she knew about targets to remove illegal immigrants has shown once again that being home secretary remains one of the most high-risk jobs in government. Although Theresa May lasted more than six years in the job and used it as a springboard to Downing Street, her successor joins a long list of others, including David Blunkett, Jacqui Smith and Charles Clarke, who ended up paying the price for personal or administrative failings with their jobs. Before the full extent of the Windrush controversy became clear, shining an unflattering light on the workings and culture of her department and Ms Rudd's own command of her brief, the 54-year-old had been regarded as one of the Conservatives' rising stars. Her views on Europe - she is one of the cabinet's most pro-European voices and her brother Roland helped run the Remain campaign - were not to everyone's tastes within the party but despite this she was seen as being capable, tough and - until recent weeks - unflappable. In her early years in Parliament after being elected in 2010, she was regarded as being a protege of George Osborne on the liberal-modernising wing of the party, a member of the so-called ""friends of George"". Ms Rudd at a constituency event in 2011 - she scraped home in last year's election despite a significant swing to Labour She was promoted rapidly under David Cameron, working for a while in the Treasury and becoming energy and climate change secretary after the Conservatives' surprise victory in the 2015 general election. Her growing reputation was further enhanced during the 2016 Brexit referendum. She was one of the star performers during the main TV debate - caustically taking Boris Johnson to task and suggesting he was ""not the kind of man that you would want to drive you home at the end of the evening"". She not only survived Theresa May's clearout of Cameron/Osborne supporters after she became PM but was rewarded with the plum job of home secretary, stepping into her boss's shoes. Her first year in the Home Office went smoothly enough although dealing with the succession of terror attacks that took place during 2017 was a harrowing experience. The 54-year old was appointed home secretary in July 2016 She has been MP for Hastings and Rye in East Sussex since 2010 She won the seat in 2017 by just 346 votes She was a Remain supporter in 2016 referendum - her brother helped fund campaign She was married for five years to the late journalist and writer AA Gill An Edinburgh University graduate, she previously worked in banking and recruitment She was credited as a consultant on the 1994 hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral Ms Rudd earned plenty of plaudits after deputising for Mrs May in the 2017 general election leadership debate, despite her father Tony - a stockbroker and businessman - having died a few days before. She used up one of her political lives on election night when it looked, for several hours, as if she had lost her Hastings and Rye seat and ended up only scraping home by 346 votes. This video can not be played Amber Rudd and Jeremy Corbyn in the General election 2017 debate She remained in the Home Office after the election and with questions over Mrs May's future swirling around, she was talked of as a potential successor who could appeal to both wings of the party. But in the face of daily revelations about the plight of Windrush migrants and their families, Ms Rudd appeared slow to respond and, despite numerous apologies, to appreciate the scale and significance of the crisis. Previously regarded as having more liberal views on immigration than her predecessor, she was soon accused of making the government's ""hostile environment"" policy for illegal immigrants even tougher, with disastrous repercussions for thousands of people in the country legally. More significantly, she was forced to publicly backtrack on claims that the Home Office did not have targets for removing immigration offenders, admitting to MPs she had been wrong. She was appointed energy and climate change secretary by David Cameron after the Tories' 2015 election win The opposition soon called for her head, describing her as a ""human shield"" for the prime minister. But there was no appetite on the Tory benches - either from Brexiters or Remainers - for her to go, with three cabinet ministers already having had to quit in the past six months. The final nail in her coffin was when her claim to the Commons that she was not aware of the targets was contradicted not only by a memo she had been sent by a top Home Office official, published by the Guardian, but also a letterMs Rudd herself sent to the prime minister,externalsetting out ""ambitious but deliverable"" deportation targets. Ms Rudd published a strategy earlier this month on tackling violent crime, after a rise in deaths in London Before entering politics, Ms Rudd had successful careers working in finance, journalism and executive recruitment - as well as somewhat incongruously being ""aristocracy consultant"" on the hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral. She was married for five years to the late writer and Sunday Times columnist AA Gill, with whom she had two children. At a recent lunch for Westminster journalists, she responded to questions about her future leadership ambitions by saying that she merely ""wanted to stay in the game"". She will now have more time to ponder her own future in that game from the backbenches and also to reflect on the conventional wisdom in Westminster - seemingly dispelled by Mrs May - that the Home Office is the graveyard of many a political career. The British troopship HMT Empire Windrush anchored at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 21 June 1948. It is regarded as the symbolic starting point of a wave of Caribbean migration known as the ""Windrush generation"". Now, despite living and working in the UK for decades, it has emerged that some of the families of these Windrush migrants have been threatened with deportation and denied access to the NHS, benefits and pensions.

"There are many complex tasks to be across in the Home Office brief The new Home Secretary Sajid Javid faces a massive task. And none of it - from terrorism through to the Windrush crisis - is easy to fix. The Home Office sits at the heart of some of the most complex and challenging decisions in government - and, if his predecessors' experiences are any guide, Mr Javid should probably give up now on the hope of having much of a life beyond his red ministerial boxes. I'll come back to immigration in a moment, but first on the list for any incoming home secretary is appreciating the scale of the security threat. Every day, he will see a dozen dossiers from the police and intelligence agencies asking for permission to intercept the communications of people who are a threat to the UK. There are regular top secret security briefings on the latest possible terror plot. This is his first responsibility: keeping the UK safe. Sajid Javid to be new home secretary Live: Reaction as Javid replaces Rudd Why has the home secretary resigned? Mr Javid inherits very thorny issues over the future of the security and intelligence agencies. MI5 is under pressure to share more of what it knows with local agencies like social services, in the hope they will uncover potential extremists more quickly. Local police chiefs and counter-terrorism coordinators also regard neighbourhood teams as the frontline of counter-terrorism intelligence gathering. They want more cash to keep those officers on the beat. This, in turn, feeds into the questions of police funding - with figures showing rising knife and violent crime. One of Ms Rudd's last acts was to launch the Home Office's latest strategy to end serious violence. It's not clearhow it really differs from what has gone before. Will Mr Javid rip it up and start again? She was also particularly focused on overhauling protection for victims of domestic violence - and the Home Office isconsulting on new laws,external. Will this legislation stay on track, or fall by the wayside if Mr Javid comes under pressure to put all his energies into reforming the immigration system? Then there are unexpected events. Nobody foresaw the Salisbury poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. As and when the domestic intelligence agencies uncover new details of how it happened, Mr Javid will need to be clear about how he wants to respond. Similarly, while there is a tried-and-tested plan to respond to terrorism attacks, if the worst were to happen again, he will be expected to take a lead, even though he has absolutely no experience in this area. One of the biggest challenges in the in-tray is making sure that the UK secures co-operation with the EU member states on crime and security before Brexit becomes reality. Amber Rudd's team have been working on a new security treaty. This isn't headline-writing stuff - but it is crucial to every nation's mutual security. Amid the politics of Brexit, Mr Javid, who said he voted to remain but is also considered a Eurosceptic, will have to play a careful hand to keep continental partners on side. Ultimately, the biggest job he faces is sorting out immigration. From removal targets to a plan for EU citizens; from staff for a stretched NHS through to students and the net migration target; the task is enormous. Almost exactly 12 years ago, another Home Secretary - Labour's Charles Clarke - lost his job over his department's failure to properly manage the removal of foreign national offenders. In between his sacking and the resignation of Amber Rudd on Sunday, there has been a string of reorganisations of the immigration system. But the same problems remain: damning reports underlining that the system is creaking, underfunded and struggling with backlogs, poor decision-making and, now, the accusation that the Windrush generation became an easy target to improve the statistics. In the week that Parliament was awash with anger over the treatment ofpeople like Paulette Wilson, who came to the UK from Jamaica as a child in the 1960s, an Iraqi man called Rbar Mala was jailed for helping hundreds of IS fighters. The Home Office had told himhe had no right to be in the UK. For many critics, why Mrs Wilson was labelled an illegal immigrant, but a man like Mala was not deported goes right to the questions of trust and competence. I have lost count of the number of people who have said to me down the years that the Home Office is ""too big to manage"" - and therefore incapable of caring. That is unfair to the many civil servants who are trying to make a positive difference but find their efforts constantly battered by political winds and the sheer bureaucracy of the place. Perhaps Sajid Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, who became a successful investment banker, will finally bring not just new management skills but a human touch to the Home Office.

"This video can not be played Prof David Vaughan: ""I believe this is the biggest field campaign ever run in Antarctica"" It is going to be one of the biggest projects ever undertaken in Antarctica. UK and US scientists will lead a five-year effort to examine the stability of the mighty Thwaites Glacier. This ice stream in the west of the continent is comparable in size to Britain. It is melting and is currently in rapid retreat, accounting for around 4% of global sea-level rise - an amount that has doubled since the mid-1990s. Researchers want to know if Thwaites could collapse. Were it to do so, its lost ice would push up the oceans by 80cm or more. Some computer models have suggested such an outcome is inevitableif conditions continue as they are - albeit on a timescale of centuries. But these simulations need to be anchored in many more real-world observations, which will now be acquired thanks to the joint initiative announced on Monday. ""There is still a question in my view as to whether Thwaites has actually entered an irreversible retreat,"" said Prof David Vaughan, the director of science at the British Antarctic Survey. ""It assumes the melt rates we see today continue into the future and that's not guaranteed. Thwaites is clearly on the verge of an irreversible retreat, but to be sure we need 10 years more data,"" he told BBC News. Antarctica 'gives ground to the ocean' 'Boaty McBoatface' survives ice mission Ice loss spreads up Antarctic glaciers The UK'sNatural Environment Research Council,externaland the USNational Science Foundation,externalare going to deploy about 100 scientists to Thwaites on a series of expeditions. The International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) is the two nations' biggest cooperative venture on the White Continent for more than 70 years - since the end of a mapping project on the Antarctic Peninsula in the late 1940s. Grants for research totalling Â£20m have been awarded. Once the costs of transport and resupply to this remotest of regions is factored in, the total value of the ITGC will probably top Â£40m. Thwaites is a marine-terminating glacier. Snows fall on land and these compact into ice that then flows out to sea. This video can not be played Timelapse satellite images of Thwaites Glacier melting When in balance the quantity of snow at the glacier's head matches the ice lost to the ocean at its front through the calving of icebergs. But Thwaites is out of balance. It has speeded up and is currently flowing at over 4km per year. It is also thinning at a rate of almost 40cm a year. ""When we look at the historical satellite record we can see that this thinning started after 2000, spreading inland at a rate of 10-12km/year at its fastest,"" explained Dr Anna Hogg from Leeds University. ""So on Thwaites Glacier, the increase in ice speed has coincided with a period of rapid ice thinning, and grounding line retreat, which suggests that the observed changes may have been caused by warm ocean water reaching the glacier and accelerating ice melt."" The grounding line refers to the zone where the glacier enters the sea and lifts up to form a buoyant platform of ice. If warm ocean bottom-waters are able to get under this shelf, the grounding line can be eroded and the glacier forced backwards even if local air temperatures are sub-zero. Key to this process in the case of Thwaites is that a large portion of the ice stream sits below sea level, with the rock bed sloping back towards the continent. This can produce what scientists refer to as ""marine ice sheet instability"" - an inherently unstable architecture, which, once knocked, can go into an irreversible decline. ""The other process we're concerned about is something called marine ice cliff instability,"" said Dr Ted Scambos, the principal coordinating investigator on the US side of the project from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. ""This is where a tall cliff that might form at the front of the glacier begins to calve - begins to break away - in a runaway fashion. It hasn't been seen yet in this part of Antarctica; it might be present in some parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, but around Greenland seems to be a path to a very rapid retreat of the ice front."" The floating front of the glacier is hundreds of metres thick The ITGC aims to determine how all of this will play out for Thwaites. Its scientists will map the ice stream's every behaviour. They will monitor the way ocean water moves beneath the floating shelf, and drill sediments from under and just in front of the glacier to find out what it did during past warming events on Earth. The work will involve multiple instruments and techniques, including the use of autonomous vehicles. The yellow submarine known asBoaty McBoatface is expected to explore the cavityunder the buoyant sections of Thwaites. Seals will also be assisting the research. Prof Karen Heywood from the University of East Anglia, working in tandem with St Andrews University, will be attaching sensors to the heads of the animals. She told BBC News: ""The seals dive in the course of their normal life and every time they come to the surface to breathe, the data are transmitted back home. The seals monitor their own environment - where they went, how deep they dived, and how warm the water was they were diving in. At the end of the year, they moult and the tag falls off, so they don't have to live with it forever."" Prof Vaughan said that while the UK and America were leading the project, he thought other countries would want to get involved. ""Funding from NERC and NSF has set this train in motion, but I fully expect other nations now to join their carriages.""

"This video can not be played Alec saved his baby son's life using recently-acquired first aid skills A father who saved his baby son's life using recently-acquired CPR skills is urging others to learn first aid. Alec Brown, 29, took part in a first aid workshop in January. Weeks later he put his skills into action when his eight-month-old son Ruaridh stopped breathing at the family home on the Hebridean island of Mull. As Ruraidh turned blue, Mr Brown called an ambulance and carried out CPR. After a short time the baby was sick and started to cry. Ruraidh is thought to have become ill because of a viral infection. Ruaridh Brown suddenly stopped breathing at the family's home Mr Brown, a member of Tobermory RNLI's lifeboat crew, said: ""We're just an ordinary family, living an ordinary life. You hear about these types of stories in the news but you never expect it to happen to you. ""I wanted to attend the first aid training session because I had a young family and because living on an island means that emergency medical support can take a bit longer to arrive than on the mainland. I am so glad that I did. ""When Ruaridh stopped breathing, I went into autopilot and remembered what I had been taught. I checked if he was choking and then checked his airway before beginning CPR. It felt like half an hour before he started breathing again but I suspect it was only a minute. ""I'm just so glad I made the effort to go to the demonstration. ""The ambulance arrived after 20 minutes but had I not known what to do, the ending could have been very different."" After the incident Ruaridh was airlifted from Mull, off the west coast of Scotland, to the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow. He spent three days there, with doctors concluding the episode may have been caused by a viral infection. Mr Brown, who lives in Tobermory with wife Kayleigh, 26, Ruaridh and Callum, three, is urging other people to learn first aid skills. Mr Brown is urging other parents to learn first aid He said: ""I can't recommend strongly enough that people take the time to learn how to do even basic first aid. Many of the sessions are free and it could literally be the difference between life and death. ""We're doing OK. It has definitely shaken us but we're just so happy to still have Ruaridh with us and he's doing well."" Mr Brown is supporting St Andrew's First Aid, which ran the course he attended in Oban as part of its community engagement programme. The charity is launching itsScottish First Aid Awards,external, which showcase the achievements of people who have helped save a life. In a post of Facebook, Tobermory RNLI said: ""We are so proud of our volunteer crew member Alec and even more pleased that Ruaridh has made a full recovery and looking forward to seeing him at the Station barbecue next month.""

"Michel Barnier said the Republic of Ireland has the support of all EU member states There can be no Brexit withdrawal agreement without a ""backstop"" option for the Irish border, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator has said. Michel Barnier said the Republic of Ireland has the full support of all EU member states and all EU institutions. The backstop would involve NI, or the UK as a whole, aligning with the EU rules required to support North-South cooperation and an all-island economy. Mr Barnier was speaking atthe start of a two-day visit to Ireland. The UK has accepted the need for a backstop to be written into the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Analysis: Brexit brokers and backstop âbingoâ Q&A: Brexit and the Irish border Long read: The hardest border But it has not agreed what EU rules it should cover. At the beginning of the all-island Brexit forum in Dundalk, County Louth, Mr Barnier said he knows that the so-called backstop has been the subject of ""heated discussions in the UK"". ""To be clear: without a backstop, there can be no withdrawal agreement,"" said Mr Barnier. ""This is an EU issue, not only an Irish issue."" It almost became Brexit bingo - as journalists lost count of how many times Mr Barnier referenced the ""backstop"" option for the Irish border. The backstop would mean that in the absence of any other solution, Northern Ireland, or the UK as a whole, would align with EU rules required to support north-south cooperation and an all-island economy. While in principle the UK signed up to this option, precise detail on it has yet to appear. Mr Barnier's three points were: The UK government has agreed to a backstop and knows that without it there is no withdrawal agreement The EU is not using the backstop as a negotiating tactic The backstop is necessary to protect the integrity of the customs union and single market In brief - the backstop was agreed - so let's get on with it. Read more from Jayne here Mr Barnier also denied claims from Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), that he has been ""aggressive"" towards Northern Ireland unionists in the Brexit talks. The DUP leader said earlier that Mr Barnier did not understand the dispute and was not an ""honest broker"". In response, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator said he was not ready to engage in ""polemics"" with Mrs Foster. Mr Barnier's visit comes amid rising tensions over the future UK-Ireland border. He told a press conference in Dundalk at the beginning of the all-island Brexit forum that his ""door is open"" to Mrs Foster and the DUP. He said he had not approached the negotiations in a ""spirit of revenge"". This video can not be played DUP leader Arlene Foster: Brexit negotiations have 'become aggressive' He added that he regretted the UK had voted to leave the EU, and said he was determined to work with the UK to find a solution to the Irish border issue. The all-island Brexit forum is being hosted by the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and his deputy, Simon Coveney. On Sunday,Mr Barnier said the UKwas contradicting itself over its Irish border policy. But Mrs Foster said she believes Mr Barnier does not understand the dispute and is ""not an honest broker"". In return, he said that Mrs Foster needed to respect that his role was to negotiate on behalf of the EU and not to act as a mediator. Meanwhile the Taoiseach again there needed to be ""meaningful progress"" on the border issue by the June EU summit. Mr Varadkar said otherwise it would be difficult to get thewithdrawal agreementin place by October. The two-day all-island Brexit forum began on Monday In December, the UK and EU reached a political agreement in which the UK committed to protecting north-south cooperation on the island of Ireland. It also guaranteed there would be no hard border, including physical infrastructure or related checks and controls. However, the EU's proposed backstop solution to avoid a hard border - keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union after Brexit - continues to be at odds with what the UK government and the DUP say they would accept. Mrs Foster told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg the DUP would not accept Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK. Arlene Foster has warned Michel Barnier the DUP will not accept Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK She said: ""Michel Barnier's trying to present himself as someone who cares deeply about Northern Ireland and if that is the case he needs to hear the fact that we are part of the United Kingdom [and] will remain part of the United Kingdom constitutionally, politically and economically. ""Therefore his proposal of us being in an all-Ireland regulatory scenario with a border down the Irish Sea simply does not work. ""It does not work constitutionally, politically and it certainly does not work from an economic perspective."" This video can not be played The Irish border bridge where stakes are high Mrs Foster added: ""We've tried to get him to understand the unionist position for the people of Northern Ireland but he hasn't really responded and I'm disappointed about that. ""I don't think he does understand the wider unionist culture of Northern Ireland."" The DUP is also expressing annoyance that Mr Varadkar is visiting Northern Ireland later without giving notice. Mr Barnier is due to meet Mr Varadkar on Monday and will also speak to business leaders on both sides of the Irish border during his trip.

"This video can not be played Prof David Vaughan: ""I believe this is the biggest field campaign ever run in Antarctica"" It is going to be one of the biggest projects ever undertaken in Antarctica. UK and US scientists will lead a five-year effort to examine the stability of the mighty Thwaites Glacier. This ice stream in the west of the continent is comparable in size to Britain. It is melting and is currently in rapid retreat, accounting for around 4% of global sea-level rise - an amount that has doubled since the mid-1990s. Researchers want to know if Thwaites could collapse. Were it to do so, its lost ice would push up the oceans by 80cm or more. Some computer models have suggested such an outcome is inevitableif conditions continue as they are - albeit on a timescale of centuries. But these simulations need to be anchored in many more real-world observations, which will now be acquired thanks to the joint initiative announced on Monday. ""There is still a question in my view as to whether Thwaites has actually entered an irreversible retreat,"" said Prof David Vaughan, the director of science at the British Antarctic Survey. ""It assumes the melt rates we see today continue into the future and that's not guaranteed. Thwaites is clearly on the verge of an irreversible retreat, but to be sure we need 10 years more data,"" he told BBC News. Antarctica 'gives ground to the ocean' 'Boaty McBoatface' survives ice mission Ice loss spreads up Antarctic glaciers The UK'sNatural Environment Research Council,externaland the USNational Science Foundation,externalare going to deploy about 100 scientists to Thwaites on a series of expeditions. The International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) is the two nations' biggest cooperative venture on the White Continent for more than 70 years - since the end of a mapping project on the Antarctic Peninsula in the late 1940s. Grants for research totalling Â£20m have been awarded. Once the costs of transport and resupply to this remotest of regions is factored in, the total value of the ITGC will probably top Â£40m. Thwaites is a marine-terminating glacier. Snows fall on land and these compact into ice that then flows out to sea. This video can not be played Timelapse satellite images of Thwaites Glacier melting When in balance the quantity of snow at the glacier's head matches the ice lost to the ocean at its front through the calving of icebergs. But Thwaites is out of balance. It has speeded up and is currently flowing at over 4km per year. It is also thinning at a rate of almost 40cm a year. ""When we look at the historical satellite record we can see that this thinning started after 2000, spreading inland at a rate of 10-12km/year at its fastest,"" explained Dr Anna Hogg from Leeds University. ""So on Thwaites Glacier, the increase in ice speed has coincided with a period of rapid ice thinning, and grounding line retreat, which suggests that the observed changes may have been caused by warm ocean water reaching the glacier and accelerating ice melt."" The grounding line refers to the zone where the glacier enters the sea and lifts up to form a buoyant platform of ice. If warm ocean bottom-waters are able to get under this shelf, the grounding line can be eroded and the glacier forced backwards even if local air temperatures are sub-zero. Key to this process in the case of Thwaites is that a large portion of the ice stream sits below sea level, with the rock bed sloping back towards the continent. This can produce what scientists refer to as ""marine ice sheet instability"" - an inherently unstable architecture, which, once knocked, can go into an irreversible decline. ""The other process we're concerned about is something called marine ice cliff instability,"" said Dr Ted Scambos, the principal coordinating investigator on the US side of the project from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. ""This is where a tall cliff that might form at the front of the glacier begins to calve - begins to break away - in a runaway fashion. It hasn't been seen yet in this part of Antarctica; it might be present in some parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, but around Greenland seems to be a path to a very rapid retreat of the ice front."" The floating front of the glacier is hundreds of metres thick The ITGC aims to determine how all of this will play out for Thwaites. Its scientists will map the ice stream's every behaviour. They will monitor the way ocean water moves beneath the floating shelf, and drill sediments from under and just in front of the glacier to find out what it did during past warming events on Earth. The work will involve multiple instruments and techniques, including the use of autonomous vehicles. The yellow submarine known asBoaty McBoatface is expected to explore the cavityunder the buoyant sections of Thwaites. Seals will also be assisting the research. Prof Karen Heywood from the University of East Anglia, working in tandem with St Andrews University, will be attaching sensors to the heads of the animals. She told BBC News: ""The seals dive in the course of their normal life and every time they come to the surface to breathe, the data are transmitted back home. The seals monitor their own environment - where they went, how deep they dived, and how warm the water was they were diving in. At the end of the year, they moult and the tag falls off, so they don't have to live with it forever."" Prof Vaughan said that while the UK and America were leading the project, he thought other countries would want to get involved. ""Funding from NERC and NSF has set this train in motion, but I fully expect other nations now to join their carriages.""

"Katrice Lee went missing on her second birthday while out shopping with her mother Police investigating the disappearance of a Teesside toddler in Germany 36 years ago are to excavate a site close to where she was last seen. Katrice Lee, from Hartlepool, went missing from a Naafi supermarketnear Paderborn, Germany in 1981. Parents Richard Lee, from Hartlepool, and Sharon Lee, from Gosport, have always claimed she was kidnapped. Royal Military Police (RMP) is now to carry out a five-week excavation of the banks of the River Alme in Paderborn. Mr Lee, a former sergeant major who was stationed at the base, welcomed the search, but said it should have been undertaken years ago. He said: ""This should have been done in the early days of the investigation into Katrice's disappearance. ""I'm a little bit upset that it has taken this length of time."" This video can not be played Katrice Lee disappeared on her second birthday from a supermarket in Germany He added: ""However, I understand that they have to do their job, but for the next five weeks this is going to be very stressful."" Katrice went missing on 28 November - her second birthday - while out shopping with her mother. An image of what Katrice may look like now Mr Lee said he was due to fly out to Germany later this week to meet the 100-strong team carrying out the search. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, who described the case as ""heart-wrenching"", said: ""The disappearance of a child is every parent's worst nightmare and I have been struck by the courage and dignity of the Lee family who have never given up on their search for Katrice. ""As this major dig gets under way, the efforts and expertise of the Royal Military Police are behind the family."" Hole opens in car park above old mine Man faces eviction for anti-Brexit sign Runners 'finish' marathon for chef Senior investigating officer Richard O'Leary, of the RMP, added: ""A team of military personnel and civilian forensic experts will be carrying out a detailed excavation of the site. ""The aim of the search is to find evidence that could finally shed light on what happened to Katrice."" Royal Military Police said this man was seen putting a child in a green saloon car near where Katrice Lee disappeared In 2012, RMP chiefs admitted mistakes were made during the initial investigation. Mr Lee said border guards were not informed when Katrice disappeared, statements from shop workers were not taken until six weeks later and information about an eye condition Katrice had was not made known. The River Alme site was identified after the release of an age-progressed photo-fit of a man seen at the Naafi holding a child similar to Katrice.

"There are many complex tasks to be across in the Home Office brief The new Home Secretary Sajid Javid faces a massive task. And none of it - from terrorism through to the Windrush crisis - is easy to fix. The Home Office sits at the heart of some of the most complex and challenging decisions in government - and, if his predecessors' experiences are any guide, Mr Javid should probably give up now on the hope of having much of a life beyond his red ministerial boxes. I'll come back to immigration in a moment, but first on the list for any incoming home secretary is appreciating the scale of the security threat. Every day, he will see a dozen dossiers from the police and intelligence agencies asking for permission to intercept the communications of people who are a threat to the UK. There are regular top secret security briefings on the latest possible terror plot. This is his first responsibility: keeping the UK safe. Sajid Javid to be new home secretary Live: Reaction as Javid replaces Rudd Why has the home secretary resigned? Mr Javid inherits very thorny issues over the future of the security and intelligence agencies. MI5 is under pressure to share more of what it knows with local agencies like social services, in the hope they will uncover potential extremists more quickly. Local police chiefs and counter-terrorism coordinators also regard neighbourhood teams as the frontline of counter-terrorism intelligence gathering. They want more cash to keep those officers on the beat. This, in turn, feeds into the questions of police funding - with figures showing rising knife and violent crime. One of Ms Rudd's last acts was to launch the Home Office's latest strategy to end serious violence. It's not clearhow it really differs from what has gone before. Will Mr Javid rip it up and start again? She was also particularly focused on overhauling protection for victims of domestic violence - and the Home Office isconsulting on new laws,external. Will this legislation stay on track, or fall by the wayside if Mr Javid comes under pressure to put all his energies into reforming the immigration system? Then there are unexpected events. Nobody foresaw the Salisbury poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. As and when the domestic intelligence agencies uncover new details of how it happened, Mr Javid will need to be clear about how he wants to respond. Similarly, while there is a tried-and-tested plan to respond to terrorism attacks, if the worst were to happen again, he will be expected to take a lead, even though he has absolutely no experience in this area. One of the biggest challenges in the in-tray is making sure that the UK secures co-operation with the EU member states on crime and security before Brexit becomes reality. Amber Rudd's team have been working on a new security treaty. This isn't headline-writing stuff - but it is crucial to every nation's mutual security. Amid the politics of Brexit, Mr Javid, who said he voted to remain but is also considered a Eurosceptic, will have to play a careful hand to keep continental partners on side. Ultimately, the biggest job he faces is sorting out immigration. From removal targets to a plan for EU citizens; from staff for a stretched NHS through to students and the net migration target; the task is enormous. Almost exactly 12 years ago, another Home Secretary - Labour's Charles Clarke - lost his job over his department's failure to properly manage the removal of foreign national offenders. In between his sacking and the resignation of Amber Rudd on Sunday, there has been a string of reorganisations of the immigration system. But the same problems remain: damning reports underlining that the system is creaking, underfunded and struggling with backlogs, poor decision-making and, now, the accusation that the Windrush generation became an easy target to improve the statistics. In the week that Parliament was awash with anger over the treatment ofpeople like Paulette Wilson, who came to the UK from Jamaica as a child in the 1960s, an Iraqi man called Rbar Mala was jailed for helping hundreds of IS fighters. The Home Office had told himhe had no right to be in the UK. For many critics, why Mrs Wilson was labelled an illegal immigrant, but a man like Mala was not deported goes right to the questions of trust and competence. I have lost count of the number of people who have said to me down the years that the Home Office is ""too big to manage"" - and therefore incapable of caring. That is unfair to the many civil servants who are trying to make a positive difference but find their efforts constantly battered by political winds and the sheer bureaucracy of the place. Perhaps Sajid Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, who became a successful investment banker, will finally bring not just new management skills but a human touch to the Home Office.

""The other process we're concerned about is something called marine ice cliff instability,"" said Dr Ted Scambos, the principal coordinating investigator on the US side of the project from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. ""This is where a tall cliff that might form at the front of the glacier begins to calve - begins to break away - in a runaway fashion. It hasn't been seen yet in this part of Antarctica; it might be present in some parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, but around Greenland seems to be a path to a very rapid retreat of the ice front."" The floating front of the glacier is hundreds of metres thick The ITGC aims to determine how all of this will play out for Thwaites. Its scientists will map the ice stream's every behaviour. They will monitor the way ocean water moves beneath the floating shelf, and drill sediments from under and just in front of the glacier to find out what it did during past warming events on Earth. The work will involve multiple instruments and techniques, including the use of autonomous vehicles. The yellow submarine known asBoaty McBoatface is expected to explore the cavityunder the buoyant sections of Thwaites. Seals will also be assisting the research. Prof Karen Heywood from the University of East Anglia, working in tandem with St Andrews University, will be attaching sensors to the heads of the animals. She told BBC News: ""The seals dive in the course of their normal life and every time they come to the surface to breathe, the data are transmitted back home. The seals monitor their own environment - where they went, how deep they dived, and how warm the water was they were diving in. At the end of the year, they moult and the tag falls off, so they don't have to live with it forever."" Prof Vaughan said that while the UK and America were leading the project, he thought other countries would want to get involved. ""Funding from NERC and NSF has set this train in motion, but I fully expect other nations now to join their carriages.""

"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be married by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 19 May The BBC has waived the TV licence fee for communities wanting to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding. It means street parties and other special events can screen the wedding live without buying a licence. Usually a premises must be covered by a TV licence for showing live TV or iPlayer, but this can be waived in exceptional circumstances. Hundreds of street party applications have been made to councils to mark the wedding on 19 May, the government said. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said about 60 applications have been made in Bromley, south east London, 54 in Richmond, west London, and 12 in Reading, Berkshire. It said many councils have waived fees for street party road closures and pub opening hours have been extended for the special occasion. Royal wedding: What we know so far Revenge is sweet, says best man William Pipa Doubtfire, the BBC's head of revenue management, said: ""In exceptional circumstances, the BBC can grant a dispensation for the temporary viewing of television, so long as the viewing is for the sole purpose of screening an event which is judged by the BBC to be of national importance. ""The BBC considers that the royal wedding is such an event."" For those communities interested in watching the FA Cup final, which will be broadcast on BBC One at 17:15 BST, a BBC Press Office spokesman said: ""The dispensation is just for watching the royal wedding. On this occasion, it doesn't cover other events on the day, such as the FA Cup final."" Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be married by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, in St George's chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.

"This video can not be played The second explosion targeted those at the scene of the first At least 26 people have been killed in two bombings in the Afghan capital Kabul, including several journalists documenting the scene. AFP chief photographer in Kabul, Shah Marai, is among the victims. The first explosion was carried out by an attacker on a motorbike. A second followed about 15 minutes later after a crowd, including several reporters, had gathered at the scene. The Islamic State group (IS) said it had carried out the attack. It was one of several fatal incidents on Monday. BBC reporter Ahmad Shah was also killed in a separate attack in the Khost region. And in a third attack, 11 children were killed in a suicide bombing intended to target Nato troops in Kandahar province. In the Kabul attack, the AFP news agency said the second blast had deliberately targeted the group of journalists, including its photographer Shah Marai. Allow Twitter content?

Nine journalists and photographers and four police officers, were among the dead, officials say. So far, 45 people have been reported injured. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty confirmed that three of its journalists,externalwere killed in the attack. Abadullah Hananzai, a journalist and cameraman, had been working on a story about narcotics, while Maharram Durrani worked on the weekly women's programme.

""This is the deadliest day for Afghan media in the past 15 years,"" the head of Tolo News TV, Lotfullah Najafizada, told the BBC. ""We went, all of us, to the blast site. We said: 'If you killed an entire line of journalists reporting here, in five hours time we're back here; the line is longer; the queue is longer and the resolve is greater."" Bombings in the Afghan capital are not uncommon. Earlier in April, a suicide bomb at a voter registration killed almost 60 people and injured 119, in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. The Taliban also remain active in the country, only 30% of which is under full government control,according to BBC research published earlier this year. Photo by Shah Marai: An Afghan girl scavenges for recyclables, 2011 AFP paid tribute to Shah Marai, who it said had six children, including a newborn baby. ""This is a devastating blow,"" global news director Michele Leridon said. ""We can only honour the extraordinary strength, courage and generosity of a photographer who covered often traumatic, horrific events with sensitivity and consummate professionalism."" A shooting in Khost province resulted in the death of a BBC reporter. ""It is with great sadness that the BBC can confirm the death of BBC Afghan reporter Ahmad Shah following an attack earlier today,"" said Jamie Angus, director of the BBC World Service. Ahmad Shah, 29, was killed by unknown attackers in Khost ""Ahmad Shah was 29.  He had worked for the BBC Afghan service for more than a year and had already established himself as a highly capable journalist who was a respected and popular member of the team. ""This is a devastating loss and I send my sincere condolences to Ahmad Shah's friends and family and the whole BBC Afghan team. ""We are doing all we can to support his family at this very difficult time."" Local police are investigating a motive. Also on Monday, a suicide bomb attack in the Kandahar region killed 11 schoolchildren and injured many more. The bomber appeared to have been targeting a military vehicle convoy in Daman district, but the explosion struck a nearby religious school. In addition to the dead, more than a dozen children were reported injured in the blast. Nato forces operate from a base in the area, and Nato officials confirmed that some of its people had been injured, as had Afghan police. Eight of the injured were of Romanian nationality, Nato said, but all were in stable condition. No group has yet said it carried out the Kandahar attack.

Two other men were taken to hospital after being washed from East Pier in Ramsgate by a large wave, police said. A yellow warning,externalfor heavy rain and strong winds remains in place for southern and eastern parts of England for the whole of Monday. Forecasters said some areas could see more than a month's rainfall in a day. Some trains in the south-east of England were cancelled and roads have been blocked by fallen trees. The RNLI, whose crews were called to help the three men at Royal Harbour in Ramsgate, called the conditions ""atrocious"". They said they rescued two men from the water but one was pronounced dead at the scene. The third man had been knocked over on the harbour wall by the wave and has been airlifted to hospital. Strong winds have caused large waves across coastal areas in the south east, including in Ramsgate in Kent Also in Kent, firefighters rescued two adults and a baby from a car which was stuck in flood water in Sutton Valence, while another man in Herne Bay was trapped when a tree fell on his car. Meanwhile, two flood warnings - which means flooding is expected - remain in place along the River Nene, east of Peterborough, and on the coast in North Shields in north-east England. Flood warnings and alerts,external, issued by the Environment Agency, are in force across England and staff are maintaining defences at at-risk spots. By 07:00 BST, Kent had seen more than 20mm of rain in 24 hours - nearly half of the monthly average for this time of year - and gusts of 50mph have been recorded. Some services on Southeastern Railway were cancelled and others diverted because of flooding and a tree blocking the line at Charing in Kent. Southern Rail faced disruption because of speed restrictions due to the weather and a fallen tree, while a tree hanging over the line between Woking and Weybridge also affected some South Western Railway services. Several flights leavingLondon City Airport,externalhave been delayed. A spokesman for the airport said air traffic control restricted the number of flights that can take off and land because of the poor weather conditions. Strong winds have brought down trees across the south-east, including in Streatham, south London UK Power Networks, which covers part of the south-east of England, said although there are outages it was a ""normal day"" with no widespread problems due to the weather. The wet and windy weather is the result of an area of low pressure moving northwards overnight on Sunday. It will feel ""unseasonably cold"" for the time of year, the BBC Weather Centre said, with maximum temperatures about 6 to 7C in these areas, but feeling much colder under the rain and wind. Peter Siddle of Essex bowls against Hampshire in the county cricket match on Monday High ground - like the Chilterns and the Cotswolds - could even see sleet and snow, although it will not settle. County cricketers playing at the Ageas Bowl in Hampshire wore woolly hats to keep warm. On social media, people shared photos and videos of flooded roads and large waves in coastal areas.

"Michel Barnier said his ""door is open"" to Arlene Foster and the DUP The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has denied Arlene Foster's claims that he has been ""aggressive"" towards Northern Ireland unionists in the Brexit talks. It comes after the DUP leader said Michel Barnier did not understand the dispute and was not an ""honest broker"". Mr Barnier said he was not ready to engage in ""polemics"" with Mrs Foster. Monday marks the start of hisMichel Barnier's two-day visit to Ireland,which comes amid rising tensions over the future UK-Ireland border. He told a press conference in Dundalk at the beginning of the all-island Brexit forum that his ""door is open"" to Arlene Foster and the DUP. He said he had not approached the negotiations in a ""spirit of revenge"". This video can not be played DUP leader Arlene Foster: Brexit negotiations have 'become aggressive' He added that he regretted Brexit and said he was determined to work with the UK to find a solution to the Irish border issue. The all-island Brexit forum is being hosted by the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his deputy, Simon Coveney. On SundayMr Barnier said the UKwas contradicting itself over its Irish border policy. But Mrs Foster said she believes Mr Barnier does not understand the dispute and is ""not an honest broker"". In return he said that Mrs Foster needed to respect that his role was to negotiate on behalf of the EU and not to act as a mediator. Meanwhile the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) again said that there needs to be ""meaningful progress"" on border issue by the June EU summit. Leo Varadkar said otherwise it will be difficult to get theWithdrawal Agreementin place by October. The two-day all-island Brexit forum began on Monday In December, the UK and EU reached a political agreement in which the UK committed to protecting north-south cooperation on the island of Ireland. It also guaranteed there would be no hard border, including physical infrastructure or related checks and controls. Q&A: Brexit and the Irish border Barnier tells UK to 'resolve contradictions' in border policy Irish border June deadline 'artificial' says David Davis However, the EU's proposed backstop solution to avoid a hard border - keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union after Brexit - continues to be at odds with what the UK government and the DUP say they would accept. Mrs Foster told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg the DUP would not accept Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK. Arlene Foster has warned Michel Barnier the DUP will not accept Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK She said: ""Michel Barnier's trying to present himself as someone who cares deeply about Northern Ireland and if that is the case he needs to hear the fact that we are part of the United Kingdom [and] will remain part of the United Kingdom constitutionally, politically and economically. ""Therefore his proposal of us being in an all-Ireland regulatory scenario with a border down the Irish Sea simply does not work. ""It does not work constitutionally, politically and it certainly does not work from an economic perspective."" This video can not be played The Irish border bridge where stakes are high Mrs Foster added: ""We've tried to get him to understand the unionist position for the people of Northern Ireland but he hasn't really responded and I'm disappointed about that.

"""It's incredible the difference one person can make in your whole life and how empty it feels without them,"" says Carolynn Burke. The 29-year-old wipes a tear as she talks about her friend Kirsty Maxwell, 27, who fell to her death in Benidorm exactly a year ago. Twenty girls were celebrating Carolynn's hen party and had enjoyed a drunken night out. Now four of them have gone back to mark the first anniversary. The women have been putting up posters, handing out flyers and talking to people to see if anyone has information. Kerry, Leslie-Anne, Suzanne and Carolynn revisit the site where Kirsty fell and hand out flyers The women, who are from Livingston, West Lothian, still don't know what happened leading up to her plunging from the 10th floor of a room of the Apartmentos Payma in the holiday resort. Five men from Nottingham were in the room she fell from. They were questioned by Spanish police but never charged. David Swindle, a former detective assisting the family, told Newsbeat: ""The key to this, to me, is in Nottingham. ""There were a large group of men from Nottingham here, there were over 50 of them. ""Some of them were in the room with Kirsty before she died, and some were staying at the Payma Apartments."" Kirsty fell from the tenth floor of a room of the Apartmentos Payma Kerry Langton, 27, walked home with Kirsty and put her to bed that night. ""We got home safe. She was in bed safe. That's the worst thing about all this, we did what we always do, we looked after each other. ""You think you're in your room, she's tucked up in bed, we were safe. ""There are so many 'what ifs'. But we were as sensible as we could have been and yet something as tragic as this still happened."" Kirsty with her husband Adam Nobody knows how Kirsty woke up and ended up in another room. Lesley-Anne Watson, 28, was a bridesmaid for Carolynn, along with Kirsty. ""That night we just had so much fun, having a drink and a dance, taking selfies. ""It's horrible looking back on them now. You never think that when you're taking those pictures that it'll be the last time you're going to have a picture taken with Kirsty. ""You think this isn't real. It's the strangest feeling ever."" Kirsty's family and friends have put up posters around the resort Lesley-Anne says she was haunted by seeing her friend's body that morning. ""That Saturday morning I got woken by a banging on the door. ""There were police officers in the corridor. ""I walked round the apartment to the opposite side and looked out the window and Kirsty was just lying at the pool. ""That's something that I never ever thought I'd have to look at or have to see. ""That image for weeks, if not months, was in my head. Why two hours after it happened she was still lying there, I'll never know. I was in a state of shock."" ""At first we thought it was a mistake. Everyone was in a panic,"" says Kerry. ""That's why we know people must have seen something,"" continues Lesley-Anne. ""We need people to come forward. I'm here for one reason, and that's to get answers. We're a close group and we are together here, even stronger."" Kirsty's friends Leslie, Kerry, Carolynn and Suzanne return to Benidorm in search of answers Carolynn says she struggles with the small things. ""It's the calls, texts, tags in a Facebook post - you have to really remind yourself she's not here anymore. ""I look at everything all the time. All the pictures that we've got, and all the Snapchat memories that we have. ""I got a book made of all our WhatsApp conversations just because I was so scared of losing it, and that I would lose those memories forever."" Kirsty with her friends on her wedding day ""She's always in my thoughts. She was hilarious, and most of the time when we speak about her we are laughing about the fun times but then it is tinged with sadness. ""At least the memories that we've got are the best, they are amazing. ""Watching her get married to Adam was one of the best weeks of my life, out in Cyprus. I've never seen such a beautiful bride, she was just gorgeous."" Adam and Kirsty on their wedding day Suzanne Lothian, 28, tells Newsbeat they are normal girls who were on a normal hen party. When the girls found out Kirsty had fallen to her death, they couldn't comprehend what happened. ""It was absolutely horrendous, but very surreal. I couldn't understand and put the two together, I couldn't understand how this could have happened. ""We didn't know if she was alive, we were told an accident, we didn't know at first. ""When you're asking the police, can you tell me if she is alive? When the answer is 'I'm sorry but no' - everything crumbles around you. It was terrible."" Kirsty's aunt Angela joined the girls in Benidorm on the anniversary of her death Kirsty's aunt Angela also travelled with the girls to help them raise awareness around the anniversary. ""It's been emotional, but positive, we've put up the posters and we've been speaking to people. ""We just want to find the answers. We're trying to get support from anyone who was here last year to come forward. ""It's quite upsetting to look up and know that's where my niece fell to her death. The void is just so huge in our family. That'll never be filled."" Kirsty's friends hope that by raising awareness in the resort, they'll get some answers over her death People are being asked to change their profile picture on social media accounts to one of Kirsty to mark the day. The girls also set up at Snapchat geofilter with #KirstyMaxwell on it, hoping people will use it and hear about what happened.

"Was Amber Rudd's resignation inevitable? Certainly there has been a mismatch between what she told MPs last week and the evidence that emerged. In a different time, and with a minister with enemies, she'd most likely have been out on Friday. This time the Tory party was fighting hard to keep her. But beyond the mess-ups, perhaps part of the issue was also that the home secretary was not necessarily in tune with her predecessor's attitude on immigration - the Home Office's most politically charged brief. It is hard to understand that she wasn't aware of a widespread culture of targets. But no one is suggesting that she deliberately misled MPs last week. So, it is pertinent to ask how much focus she gave to the immigration brief at the Home Office, or whether she was happy to delegate to trusted colleagues and focus on other areas. Those who have worked at junior levels in the Home Office as ministers sometimes joke that they'd never want the big job given how complicated it is. Home secretaries, however tightly they grip everything, can never be sure they won't trip up. But don't forget Ms Rudd's persona was also vital in the delicate Brexit balance of the cabinet. She was a Remainer, and trusted by the PM. A grown up, who was as open as politically possible about the case she would make for the softer end of Brexit privately, hinting at it in public too. Amber Rudd resigns: Live reaction What went wrong for Amber Rudd? Amber Rudd's resignation letter in full Given the fraught politics of the moment, replacing her is not just a matter of promoting a minister who looks competent, but making an appointment that does not tear the already strained Tory truce. And beyond all that, Ms Rudd's departure gives Theresa May not one, but several new potential headaches. It gives an impression of shaky government days before the local elections. Ms Rudd could give the Tory rebel Remainers more authority on the backbenches. And continuing questions about the Windrush fiasco may now be aimed more sharply at the prime minister herself. There are good reasons why Number 10 initially tried to resist this resignation. The pressure on the individual may be gone, but the wider impact may not yet have begun. Stretching to close one gap opens another. Ms Rudd was an important figure in cabinet, not just because she occupied one of the great offices of state, but because she was widely liked inside her party, at the more modern end of the Tory spectrum and a vigorous Remainer whose voice gave ballast to that side of the argument at the top table. The decision to go was - I'm told - entirely hers. Both Number 10 and her other political friends in government tried to persuade her to stay, it's said. It was her judgement that it was untenable to stay it's suggested, because she couldn't be sure that nothing else would emerge from the Home Office filing cabinets that might have made staying on in the job even more awkward than it already was.

"Amber Rudd has resigned as home secretary after a period of political pressure stemming from her handling of the Windrush scandal. Here is the resignation letter she sent to Prime Minister Theresa May. Mrs May's response is also published in full below. Dear Prime Minister, It is with great regret that I am resigning as home secretary. I feel it is necessary to do so because I inadvertently misled the Home Affairs Select Committee over targets for removal of illegal immigrants during their questions on Windrush. Since appearing before the select committee, I have reviewed the advice I was given on this issue and become aware of information provided to my office which makes mention of targets. I should have been aware of this, and I take full responsibility for the fact that I was not. The Windrush scandal has rightly shone a light on an important issue for our country. As so often, the instincts of the British people are right. They want people who have a right to live here to be treated fairly and humanely, which has sometimes not been the case. But they also want the government to remove those who don't have the right to be here. I had hoped in coming months to devise a policy that would allow the government to meet both these vital objectives - including bringing forward urgent legislation to ensure the rights of the Windrush generation are protected. The task force is working well, the residence cards are being issued well within the two weeks promised, and the design of the compensation scheme is making good progress. The Home Office is one of the great offices of state and its job is to keep people safe. It comes with the responsibility to fight terrorism, support and challenge the police and protect people against the abuse, as well as manage migration. It has been a great privilege to serve as your home secretary. I have seen first-hand the second to none commitment and bravery of our police, fire and intelligence services, they truly are the best in the world and we should rightly be extremely proud of them. I have been particularly pleased that we were able to set up the first Global Internet Forum for Counter Terrorism which has led the way with encouraging social media sites to go further and faster in taking down radicalising and terrorist material, which plays such a dangerous part in increasing extremism. Setting out new laws to tackle the scourge of knife crime and acid attacks and helping to steer our young people away from a life of crime and violence by providing them with credible alternatives have been particularly important to me. Opportunities to work on issues that safeguard the vulnerable, champions women and make a lasting impact on people's lives particularly stand out for me. New policies to fight domestic violence and abuse against women are out to consultation, and will lead this country to taking a new approach. Helping to bring thousands of refugees, including child refugees from both Calais and the Middle East region, and meeting some of the families who fled the terrible situation in Syria and have now been given a chance to rebuild their lives here in the UK in safety and security is something we can be proud of. It has been an honour to work on a new security treaty with the EU as part of our new partnership going forward and to participate in your Brexit sub-committee helping to ensure that we have the best possible EU deal for our economy, businesses, jobs and people across the UK. The new Economic Crime Centre that i launched with the first use of unexplained wealth orders will be important to the confidence of London as a financial centre. I will continue to support the Home Office ministerial team whenever possible on all these important subjects, supporting the government from the back benches and continuing to work hard for my constituents of Hastings and Rye. Best wishes, Amber Rudd Here is the prime minister's response: Dear Amber, Thank you for your letter of this evening tendering your resignation as home secretary. I was very sorry to receive it, but understand your reasons for doing so. When you addressed the House of Commons and the Home Affairs Select Committee last week on the issue of illegal immigration, you answered the questions put to you in good faith. People who have entered the United Kingdom illegally or overstayed here should expect to face the full force of the law and know that they will be removed if they will not leave this country voluntarily. Just as importantly, people who have come here legally and enriched the life of our country should not expect the state unreasonably to challenge their presence here; rather, it should help them prove their right to continue living here and contributing to the life of our nation. Under your tenure, the Home Office has been working to enforce a firm but fair immigration policy - working to increase the number of illegal migrants we remove, while ensuring that we continue to recognise the huge contribution of everyone who has come to the UK legally, and remain open to the brightest and best from across the globe. When you spoke in the House of Commons, you said that you had not agreed specific removal targets, but that the Home Office's Immigration Enforcement command had been using local targets for internal performance management. You also said that you were not aware that those operational targets had been set. I understand why, now that you have had chance to review the advice that you have received on this issue, you have made the decision you have made and taken responsibility for inadvertently misleading the Home Affairs Select Committee. I am very sorry to see you leaving the Home Office, but you should take great pride in what you have achieved there - working with internet service providers to set up the first Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism and take extremist and terrorist content offline; countering the cyber threat to British families and businesses; standing up for the victims of crime, abuse and domestic violence; offering shelter to refugees from Syria and elsewhere; and advancing the cause of equality as minister for women and equalities. This comes on top of the considerable contribution you have made to Government since 2012 - first as a whip, then as minister and subsequently secretary of state at the department for energy and climate change - as well as the devoted service you have always given, and will continue to give, to your constituents in Hastings and Rye. As a former home secretary myself, I appreciate the particular demands of that great office of state. You should take great pride in the way you have led the Home Office and its dedicated public servants through a number of serious challenges, including five terrorist incidents and other complex national events. You have done so with great integrity, compassion, and selflessness - notwithstanding the personal and political challenges you have faced during this period. I know that you have a great contribution still to make to national life, and look forward to seeing you do so.

"This video can not be played Reporter Samantha Poling has been investigating Police Scotland Secret police documents leaked to the BBC show attempts were made to ""suppress"" a report containing claims of serious corruption and criticism of Police Scotland's bosses. The report was commissioned by then-Chief Constable Sir Stephen House in 2014, a year after the new force began. Early drafts of the confidential report show the chief constable's office wanted negative comments deleted. A section where officers described a culture of fear was also removed. The BBC also obtained an email from within Police Scotland which showed that, as well as attempting to edit the report, Sir Stephen House - who left his post in 2015 - indicated that he was prepared to ""suppress"" it altogether, unless a specific word was changed. Police Scotland said ""significant changes have been implemented"" since the report was written. However, opposition parties said the revelations raised serious questions and urged Justice Secretary Michael Matheson to come before MSPs and address the matter. The issue will be raised by Tory MSP Liam Kerr during topical questions,watch live at Holyrood Live from 2pm. Sir Stephen stood down from his position at Police Scotland in 2015 A former member of the Scottish Police Authority (SPA), which is the body tasked with overseeing standards at Police Scotland, said changes to the report were concerning. Moi Ali, who resigned from the SPA board last year after a row over transparency at the organisation, told the BBC: ""I am shocked that the chief constable's office should see fit to try to pretty much obliterate any kind of criticism whatsoever because if this is what the report found, then this is what it found and this is what should have been published."" Five previous drafts of the report in total were leaked to the BBC. Internal memos within the first version show details of misconduct and corrupt behaviour by officers. Moi Ali said criticism was pretty much obliterated from the report In one memo, a range of conduct issues which were found in one unit in Tayside are listed. They include officers conducting unauthorised surveillance, threatening and intimidating witnesses, unlawfully detaining suspects, colluding while compiling statements and failing to reveal evidence. Another memo describes how two detectives were captured on a police station's CCTV with a murder suspect. The officers stood either side of him and began to ""informally"" interview him, ""assert his guilt"" and all ""without affording him a common law caution"". Both those memos are gone from the final version of the report. Moi Ali told the BBC that the details of misconduct and corrupt behaviour detailed in the internal memos was ""concerning"". ""I was a member of the complaints and conduct committee which clearly this concerns,"" she said. ""Allegations of this kind of behaviour have not to my knowledge been put to the board."" In total, 334 officers and staff at Police Scotland were asked to give their views on the force and its management anonymously for the report which was entitled 'Police Scotland Quality Assurance Review'. Their responses raised a number of serious issues, from apparently routine misconduct and rule-breaking, to strong criticism of the force's leadership and direction under the then-chief constable, Sir Stephen House. Another issue which is raised repeatedly in a series of damning quotes from officers is that of performance targets and the lengths that are gone to in order to meet them. One says that ""officers on the beat are almost bullied into producing returns to satisfy management,"" and another that ""officers may feel under pressure to fake stop-search returns to boost the figures"". Other testimony suggests that the reporting and recording of crime statistics were manipulated in the early days of the force as a result of the pressure officers felt they were being placed under. One tells the review team that ""in some instances officers felt pressure to charge a person even when there is not enough evidence in order to meet targets,"" while another says they are aware of the use of ""questionable methods such as the re-categorisation of crime to meet targets"". Yet, as with the memos detailing instances of specific misconduct and corrupt practices, these quotes are also missing from the final version of the report. The word ""fear"" was removed from a section of the report One word that is raised by numerous officers in the original version of the report is ""fear"". They say that ""people are driven by fear"", that there is a fear of being criticised, a fear of missing targets and a ""fear of a backlash from the force executive"". However, despite the word 'fear' appearing 10 times across two paragraphs in the original report, that word is removed from that section of the final report entirely. Brian Barbour said it was ""shocking"" to leave out the testimony of the officers Brian Barbour also served on the board of the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) until 2017, when he too resigned, citing interference by the Scottish government in the SPA's work. He told the BBC that the testimony from the officers and its omission from the final report were ""shocking"". ""I understand things go through a process but I would never have envisaged asking people their views and then misrepresenting them,"" he said. A section on ""expressions of fear and anxiety"" was completely changed The leaked documents also show that attempts were made by the then chief constable's office to have some of the words and conclusions of the original report changed. In the fourth version of the report obtained by the BBC, Sir Stephen House's handwriting can be seen, as well as the writing of another official. At one section entitled ""Expressions of Fear and Anxiety,"" a pen scores out these words and replaces them with the phrase ""Culture and Communication"" and this change is included in the final report. Barbour said: ""To take a culture of fear and translate it into a culture of communications isn't something that carries integrity."" Changes are also made to the tense in a series of sentences, for example, the sentence which read ""communication in Police Scotland requires urgent and significant improvement"" is changed to ""communication in Police Scotland required urgent and significant improvement."" The BBC showed the different versions of the report to anti-corruption organisation Transparency International. Its UK director Dr Robert Barrington said: ""What you have over the course of the drafting is something that becomes steadily less transparent, less challenging."" ""When you have a culture that doesn't operate transparently and doesn't encourage people to speak out those are actually the conditions within which corruption can thrive rather than in which it's really exposed."" The BBC has also obtained an email from within Police Scotland which shows that, as well as attempting to edit the report, Sir Stephen House indicated that he was prepared to ""suppress"" it altogether, unless a specific word was changed. The email reads: ""The chief will not allow the report to be tabled unless this is amended."" It goes on to say that the word in question is in the sentence: ""It is clear that much anxiety and uncertainty as to what was expected remains among staff at operational unit level."" The email continues: ""The proposal is to change the word remains to 'existed'."" ""Apparently this was almost a 'last straw' from the chief and there is a danger that he will suppress this unless amended."" The email then states that to change the word ""to existed, doesn't state that these feelings weren't discovered by the review, it just simply doesn't mention that these feelings may still exist."" ""A play on words I know."" Brian Barbour criticised the editing of the report: ""It's been changed and diluted and the message that's come out isn't the view of those who expressed it in the first place. It makes me feel as though I've been part of an organisation that has let people down."" Sir Stephen House said he did not wish to comment on the BBC's investigation. The current chief constable has acknowledged the challenges of the early days of the force In a statement Police Scotland said ""significant changes have been implemented"" since the report was written in 2014 and that ""last year DCC Iain Livingstone, the interim Chief Constable, led the development of and launched a wellbeing strategy for all officers and staff."" It added: ""DCC Livingstone has already acknowledged that in the early days of Police Scotland process was put ahead of people at a time of challenge and difficulty for everyone involved."" The BBC asked for the final version of the Quality Assurance Review report from 2014 in a Freedom of Information request. Police Scotland refused this saying to release the report would ""inhibit substantially the free and frank exchange of views"" within the force. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""The Scottish Police Authority are seeking assurances from Police Scotland that matters raised were dealt with at the time. Clearly any specific allegations of misconduct should be dealt with by the appropriate authorities. ""The current leadership of Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority have made very clear commitments to improvement, including recent changes to how conduct and complaints issues are handled, while officers and support staff continue to work hard to keep our communities safe, having contributed to a fall of over 38% in recorded crime over the last decade. ""This is supported by the Scottish government providing real terms protection to the police resource budget and a commitment to protecting the police resource budget - a boost of Â£100m by 2021.""

"Sophia Peters was strangled at her family home in Blenheim Road in Wimbledon on 3 November A father has been jailed for murdering his daughter by strangling her with a dressing gown cord at their family home in south-west London. Robert Peters, 56, denied murdering Sophia Peters, seven, but changed his plea on the third day of his trial. Sophia was killed just over a month after her depressed and suicidal father was found not to be a risk by a child protection team. Mr Justice Edis jailed Peters at the Old Bailey for a minimum of 24 years. Peters, who ran an antiques firm in Kensington, throttled Sophia at their house on Blenheim Road, Wimbledon, on 3 November. He then called police to report what he had done. Sophia was rushed to St George's Hospital, Tooting, where she died the following day. Robert Peters was jailed for a minimum of 24 years During sentencing, Mr Justice Edis described Peters as ""deceitful and manipulative"" and ""calculating and disingenuous"" in the way he hid his plans. ""This was a determined, premeditated killing in which there was an intention to kill,"" he said. The judge said it was ""impossible to imagine the last few conscious minutes of that child's life"". ""Asleep in bed, she no doubt felt safe and believed that, should she need it, she had the protection of her father."" Sophia was described by Mr Justice Edis as ""a lovely little girl who loved her parents and thought that they loved her"" Sophia's mother Krittiya Peters said in a statement to the court that she had struggled to come to terms with the death of her daughter. ""Since Sophia died I have been on a rollercoaster of emotions. ""Sophia was a beautiful, loving, active, adventurous, brave and outgoing girl. She loved to dance and sing. I would give anything I have to be able to bring my daughter back."" Killer dad 'wanted to do away with family' Man 'strangled daughter after bankruptcy fears' Father admits daughter's strangle murder The jury had heard that Peters told police he had financial worries and his business was going bankrupt - even though later inquiries found he had money in the bank. The former Israeli soldier had also recently ended a two and a half-year affair with a married Home Office official he met online. In the months before the killing, Peters searched the internet for ""serial killers"", ""treatment of child killers in prison"" and ""premeditated murder"". Sophia was found with a dressing gown cord around her neck in her bedroom in the house He chose his opportunity to kill Sophia before she had been due to return to her boarding school after the half-term break. Peters waited until his wife had gone out before he woke Sophia up in bed by tying a cord around her neck and throttling her for up to 30 minutes. She asked him what he was doing and Peters said ""sorry"", but carried on as she struggled, the court heard. Krittiya Peters said in a statement: ""I always think to myself if Robert was ill why didn't he kill himself, why?"" Following the sentencing, Det Insp Helen Rance said: ""The death of a child is something no family should have to go through, but the fact that Sophia Peters died at the hands of her own father makes it truly dreadful. ""Sophia was a loving and much loved child whose loss has devastated all who knew her from her family through to her school friends and teachers."" Merton Council said its Safeguarding Children Board would be meeting to ""consider the lessons to be learned"" from Sophia's death.

"The median annual rent for a two-bed property in England last year was Â£7,800, up from Â£6,600 in 2011. A year's rent takes up every penny earned by full-time workers until the first week of May, analysis by BBC News reveals. A middle income earner in England would work 86 days to rent an average two-bedroom home, five more than in 2011. In Scotland and Wales the number of working days needed to cover their rent fell to 79 and 71 days respectively. The Residential Landlords Association said property owners were not making ""a fortune"" out of tenants. We have created a clickable map showing the change in the number of working days it takes to cover the rent in each local authority area in Great Britain. Scroll down the story to try it. Rising property prices have made it harder for millions of people to buy a home and the number of households renting privately has reached a 30-year high, according to the English Housing Survey. Rebeca Corona and Fernando Garcia said friends had told them renting in England could be very expensive While London has seen the gap between rents and wages widen most, other parts of southern England also cost more to live in than some European capitals. New high-tech and engineering jobs have drawn skilled workers to places like Cambridge. Rising demand and limited supply have pushed rents up. Rebeca Corona, 30, and partner Fernando Garcia, 31, have been renting in the city for about two months, having moved from Madrid. ""We knew before we got here that prices in England were high,"" said Mr Garcia. ""But we hadn't anticipated how quickly properties were let out and how small they are in comparison to Madrid."" Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map by Daniel Wainwright and Clara Guibourg, built by Carto. If you can't see the maptap or click here,external. Ms Corona added: ""I love living in Cambridge, because I can be at work in less than half an hour. ""But we currently pay Â£1,250 a month for a two-bed property in Cambridge and for the same price in Madrid we could get a property that would be twice as big."" Where can I afford to rent? Who chooses to live in a 'glorified student dorm'? Figures compiled by Eurostat show that in 2017 Madrid was one of the cheapest major global cities to rent in, with average rents for two-bed properties half those in London. Analysing the median annual rent for two-bedroom properties and the median income of full-time workers in Great Britain the BBC England Data Unit found: If the typical full-time worker in England, living alone, spent everything they earned after tax and national insurance on their rent, they would have made enough money by 3 May. Similar workers in Scotland would have earned enough money to pay their rent by 24 April and in Wales workers would be rent free by 12 April. Nearly half of local authority areas in Great Britain have seen annual rents for two-bed properties increase faster than the average take home pay. In London the cost of rent eats up 15 more days' pay than it did in 2011. The increase in the time it takes to pay the rent is not repeated across Britain. Tenants in much of the north of England, Scotland and Wales have seen the number of working days fall. In these areas take home pay has broadly increased faster than rental prices, owing to rises in the amount people can earn before paying tax, known as the personal allowance. This allowance increased from Â£7,475 in 2010-11 to Â£11,000 in 2016-17 and is now Â£11,850. The workers squeezed the most by rents rising faster than pay are in the south of England. A private tenant in London would have to work 165 days to earn enough to cover the rent on a two-bed property, compared to 66 days for a worker in the North East. In the capital, even renting a room in a shared property takes a full-time worker until 27 March. A middle-earning worker makes Â£27,150 in the capital after tax and National Insurance. Renting a room at an average of Â£7,200 they would have to work 67 days just to cover the rent. That is nearly three weeks longer than in 2011. In Bristol, rents have increased so much that it takes another month to be able to afford a two-bed property, compared with 2011. The growth of financial services and technology companies in Bristol has seen the median rent increase by 43%. Rich Franklin (second from left) at his leaving party in Bristol, before ""starting his life again"" in Halifax Rich Franklin left the city to move 250 miles north to Halifax so he could afford a place to rent alone while saving to buy. Mr Franklin, 45, earns around the median national wage working in financial services. ""I've shared houses with people, but I now want my own space and if I ever want to retire I need my own home,"" he said. ""The only way I can save up the money to buy a house is by renting in Yorkshire."" 'It's very precarious' - Life as a renter Are you renting? BBC News has set up a new UK Facebook group all about affordable living.Join the Affordable Living group here,external. The typical rent for a two-bed property in Bristol is about Â£11,940, but in Halifax in Calderdale, the rent for a similar size property is Â£5,700 a year. ""I can see why the rental market leaves people angry,"" Mr Franklin said. ""I've left friends behind in Bristol that I've known for 20 or 30 years and to be honest I don't think I'll ever be able to go home. This is the human cost of a housing market that doesn't work for everyone and which has left me having to start my life all over again"". David Smith, policy director for the Residential Landlords Association said the figures reflected how rental markets vary across the country, despite assumptions the rental market in London reflects the picture across the rest of Britain. ""There are local pressures across the country each with different underlying cause,"" he said. ""What we need is a housing policy that is more flexible and we need to remember the vast majority of landlords don't rent out properties to make a fortune off the backs of young people."" Adam Hyslop, of letting agentOpenRent,external, said there were no quick fixes. He said: ""Long-term issues with renting are rooted in the issue of supply and I believe if we can build more new homes and increase the number of properties available this will help bring rental prices down."" The government has said its reforms to building legislation have seen the highest number of first time buyers in more than a decade, while it also plans in England to introducelegislation that would ban letting agents from charging fees,external. The law already exists in Scotland. The BBC England Data Unit analysed data for the median rent of two-bed properties in England, Wales and Scotland, gathered by theValuation Office Agency,externalin England and the governments inScotland,externalandWales,external. There are no comparable figures for Northern Ireland. The total sample size was more than 200,000 private rental agreements. Median wage data for each local authority area in Great Britain is drawn from theOffice for National Statistics,external. The number of days it would take a tenant to pay the annual rent on a private two-bed property is calculated by dividing the median annual rent for a property by the median daily net pay for a full-time worker in each local authority area. Net pay is calculated by taking the gross annual pay for the median worker in each local authority area, accounting for the personal allowance, income tax and national insurance, then dividing the figure by the total number of days the median worker could spend at work. The calculation excludes weekends, eight bank holidays in England and Wales and nine bank holidays in Scotland. Young face renting 'all their lives' Where can I afford to live?

"The proposed merger between two of the big four UK supermarkets - if allowed by the competition authorities and approved by shareholders - will create a giant force in retailing.  Here, we flesh out some of the key facts in chart form. Tesco has dominated the UK's grocery scene since taking over from Sainsbury's as number one in 1995. This merger would shake up the scene and leave that current leader trailing in its wake in terms of market share in groceries. In recent years the only noticeable change in the supermarket landscape has been the rise of the discounters - Aldi and Lidl. The growing presence of these is one of the reasons Sainsbury's and Asda believe the Competition and Markets Authority will view the deal favourably. Traditionally, Sainsbury's is seen as having a bigger presence in the South East of the UK and London, with Asda stronger around its Leeds home turf. But although Sainsbury's is clearly a bigger presence in the South - after all, it began life in London's Drury Lane - these maps make their geographical profile look a lot more similar than that suggests. And if we focus on London, we can see Sainsbury's is clearly dominant. In fact it has some sort of outlet in every one of London's boroughs. The Qatar Investment Authority, a fund linked to the Gulf state's royal family, bought a large stake in Sainsbury's 10 years ago. It has been the biggest shareholder by far since then, and two years ago was on the brink of launching a bid to take over the whole business before it dropped the idea. Investors have been expecting Sainsbury's share price to fall for some time - as seen by this table of the top 10 favourite stocks for shorting. Shorting is an investment strategy employed by investors betting on a fall in a share price. Traders agree to sell shares they don't own at a certain price in the belief they will be able to buy them at a lower price than that in time to fulfil the order. Sainsbury's generally makes bigger profits than Asda, although it has been close in some years. But competition in the sector means profit margins for all players are very thin. Further growth is unlikely so a change in strategy is seen as the best way to squeeze out better profits. Tesco has gone the wholesale route with its recent deal with giant supplier Booker. Sainsbury's and Asda are hoping to gain ground through bigger buying power. The struggle for growth and better profits is clearly seen in this chart, showing investors have been lukewarm about the sector since 2015 amid a general crisis in the sector and the rise of online shopping. The amount of grocery shopping done online is rising steadily and the trajectory is expected to continue. Even so, that method of shopping still accounts for just a small proportion of the grocery market. Sainsbury's vows Asda deal will cut prices Could the big four become the big three?

"Could the big four become the big three? It's a question many had been asking given how the grocery landscape has been changing. All the main supermarket chains have been looking to find new sources of growth because there's not much of it around their own aisles. Not least because discounters like Aldi and Lidl have been hugely disruptive, stealing customers and eating into their market share. And then looming on the horizon is the mighty Amazon and its desire for a bigger slice of the grocery pie.  It's already squeezing them in non food. Sainsbury's and Asda in merger talks Aldi tops supermarket satisfaction survey Tesco profits up as turnaround continues Tesco shook the industry by buying Booker, Britain's biggest wholesaler, to tap into the growing ""out of home"" food market, where people are eating out or buying prepared food to eat at home or on the go. It would also give Tesco even greater scale and buying power with suppliers. Morrisons has done a tie-up with Amazon to supply the online retailer with hundreds of products.  It has also done a deal to supply McColls, the convenience store chain. And then, of course, Sainsbury's bought Argos, giving it a Â£6bn general merchandise business at a stroke. That left Asda. Owned by Walmart of the US, it had been the poorest performer of the big four. The industry has been wondering what its big strategic move might be. Now we know. Combining the two businesses will greatly increase their bargaining clout, providing better economies of scale, although the two brands will remain. If this merger goes through, it will be the biggest shake up in UK grocery retailing since Morrisons took over Safeway in 2004. But will it pass the competition authorities? Asda's former boss, Andy Clarke, told me last year that the CMA's ruling on the Tesco/Booker deal meant it was ""open season"" for further deals in the sector. But this planned merger will get plenty of scrutiny, for sure. This is perhaps the starkest sign yet of how fast the retail world is changing.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd faced criticism over the existence of Home Office removals targets and her knowledge of them Amber Rudd has resigned as home secretary, saying she ""inadvertently misled"" MPs over targets for removing illegal immigrants. The Windrush scandal had heaped pressure on Ms Rudd, who faced renewed criticism after saying she did not know about Home Office removals targets. Her successor is expected to be announced within hours by Theresa May, who was ""very sorry"" to see Ms Rudd go. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Ms Rudd had ""done the right thing"". Ms Abbott added that the ""architect of this crisis"" - the prime minister - must come before the Commons to explain ""whether she knew that Amber Rudd was misleading Parliament and the public last week"". Amber Rudd resigns: Live reaction What went wrong for Amber Rudd? Rudd's resignation letter in full Rudd's resignation dominates front pages Ms Rudd told MPs last week the Home Office did not have targets for removing illegal immigrants, but on Sunday the Guardian published a letter in whichMs Rudd set out her ""ambitious but deliverable"",externalaim to deport 10% more illegal immigrants over the ""next few years"" to Theresa May. Ms Rudd is the fourth person forced to resign from the cabinet in the last six months - following Sir Michael Fallon, Priti Patel and Damian Green. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling denied the government was in chaos, telling BBC Radio 4's Today the spate of recent resignations were ""unwanted noise"" but there were always ""up and downs"" in politics. Ms Rudd, who had been due to make a Commons statement on Monday afternoon, telephoned the prime minister on Sunday evening to tell her of the decision amid intensifying opposition demands for her to quit. In herresignation letter, Ms Rudd said she took ""full responsibility"" for the fact she was not aware of ""information provided to (her) office which makes mention of targets"". In response, Mrs May said she believed Ms Rudd had given her evidence to the Commons ""in good faith"" but that she understood her decision to resign and take ""responsibility for inadvertently misleading the home affairs select committee"". She should ""take great pride"" in what she achieved at the Home Office, Mrs May added. An inevitable resignation? Certainly there has been a mismatch between what she told MPs last week and the evidence that emerged. In a different time, and with a minister with enemies, she'd likely have been out on Friday. This time the Tory party was fighting hard to keep her. But beyond the mess-ups, perhaps part of the issue was also that she was not necessarily in tune with her predecessor's attitude on immigration - the Home Office's most politically charged brief. Read more from Laura The controversy began when it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly declared illegal immigrants. Ms Rudd came under fire for the government's treatment of these people - known as the Windrush generation - and their relatives and the wider impact of its ""hostile environment"" policy designed to deter illegal immigration. She told MPs last Wednesday there were no removals targets for illegal immigrants - comments subsequently contradicted by a 2015 inspection report. She later admitted ""local"" targets for voluntary removals had been set but she told the Commons on Thursday she had not been aware of them. Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush pledges 'must be written into law' Reality Check: Has the 'hostile environment' worked? But the Guardian reported a June 2017 memo from an official, copied to Ms Rudd, that referred to targets. The newspaper also published a letter at the weekend, from January 2017, where Ms Rudd told Theresa May about plans to restructure her department and increase removals ""over the next few years"". Sources told the BBC that on Saturday and Sunday Ms Rudd and her officials did a thorough search of all documents and found other references to operational targets which she felt she should have been aware of. This video can not be played Diane Abbott: The prime minister has questions to answer on Windrush Conservative MPs have been paying tribute to their colleague. Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom called Ms Rudd ""honest and principled"" while Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said she was a ""huge talent"" who would ""no doubt be back in Cabinet soon"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said she had done ""a great job during last year's terrorist attacks and cares deeply about the people she serves"". Allow Twitter content?

Labour MP David Lammy said the home secretary had quit because she ""didn't know what was going on"" in her department and she had clearly ""lost the confidence"" of her officials. He added: ""The real issue is the hostile environment policy that caused this crisis in the first place. That policy must now be reviewed."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable told the BBC Ms Rudd had ""clearly jumped before she was pushed"" while Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said the PM had ""lost her human shield and now looks very exposed"". And UKIP's former leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ""Now that Amber Rudd has resigned we need a Home Secretary that supports Brexit."" Theresa May is expected to name Amber Rudd's successor later on Monday. Names being touted include Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, the son of a Pakistani bus driver whose father came to the UK in the 1960s and who says his family could easily have been affected by the recent crisis. Others potentially in the frame include former Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire, an ally of Mrs May's who left the cabinet in January for an operation but has since returned to front-line politics. Could one of the cabinet's other heavy-hitters get a promotion? Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt have been mentioned. There could also be a swift promotion for Karen Bradley, four months after succeeding Mr Brokenshire as Northern Ireland Secretary. Analysis by BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw With responsibility for immigration, counter-terrorism and policing, the job of home secretary is one of the toughest in government. During one period under Labour, there were six home secretaries in eight years. But Amber Rudd's job was made doubly difficult because she was following Theresa May, who'd survived in the post for more than six years and had set in train a series of plans and objectives that Ms Rudd was expected to stick to, even if she disagreed with them. The former energy secretary was unable to put her stamp on any significant policy during her 21 months at the Home Office; much of her time was spent fire-fighting - dealing with the implications of Brexit, the rise in violent crime and last year's terror attacks. Presentationally, Amber Rudd was impressive.  But she lacked a command of the detail, which her predecessor had mastered, and it proved to be her undoing.

"Sophia Peters was strangled at her family home in Blenheim Road in Wimbledon on 3 November A father has been jailed for murdering his daughter by strangling her with a dressing gown cord at their family home in south-west London. Robert Peters, 56, denied murdering Sophia Peters, seven, but changed his plea on the third day of his trial. Sophia was killed just over a month after her depressed and suicidal father was found not to be a risk by a child protection team. Mr Justice Edis jailed Peters at the Old Bailey for a minimum of 24 years. Peters, who ran an antiques firm in Kensington, throttled Sophia at their house on Blenheim Road, Wimbledon, on 3 November. He then called police to report what he had done. Sophia was rushed to St George's Hospital, Tooting, where she died the following day. Robert Peters was jailed for a minimum of 24 years During sentencing, Mr Justice Edis described Peters as ""deceitful and manipulative"" and ""calculating and disingenuous"" in the way he hid his plans. ""This was a determined, premeditated killing in which there was an intention to kill,"" he said. The judge said it was ""impossible to imagine the last few conscious minutes of that child's life"". ""Asleep in bed, she no doubt felt safe and believed that, should she need it, she had the protection of her father."" Sophia was described by Mr Justice Edis as ""a lovely little girl who loved her parents and thought that they loved her"" Sophia's mother Krittiya Peters said in a statement to the court that she had struggled to come to terms with the death of her daughter. ""Since Sophia died I have been on a rollercoaster of emotions. ""Sophia was a beautiful, loving, active, adventurous, brave and outgoing girl. She loved to dance and sing. I would give anything I have to be able to bring my daughter back."" Killer dad 'wanted to do away with family' Man 'strangled daughter after bankruptcy fears' Father admits daughter's strangle murder The jury had heard that Peters told police he had financial worries and his business was going bankrupt - even though later inquiries found he had money in the bank. The former Israeli soldier had also recently ended a two and a half-year affair with a married Home Office official he met online. In the months before the killing, Peters searched the internet for ""serial killers"", ""treatment of child killers in prison"" and ""premeditated murder"". Sophia was found with a dressing gown cord around her neck in her bedroom in the house He chose his opportunity to kill Sophia before she had been due to return to her boarding school after the half-term break. Peters waited until his wife had gone out before he woke Sophia up in bed by tying a cord around her neck and throttling her for up to 30 minutes. She asked him what he was doing and Peters said ""sorry"", but carried on as she struggled, the court heard. Krittiya Peters said in a statement: ""I always think to myself if Robert was ill why didn't he kill himself, why?"" Following the sentencing, Det Insp Helen Rance said: ""The death of a child is something no family should have to go through, but the fact that Sophia Peters died at the hands of her own father makes it truly dreadful. ""Sophia was a loving and much loved child whose loss has devastated all who knew her from her family through to her school friends and teachers.""

"The two Korean leaders have agreed to begin ""a new age of peace"" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is to visit North Korea this week, after historic talks between the North and South last Friday. The trip comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activityfollowing the landmark day on the peninsula. China is North Korea's only remaining economic ally, but this will be its highest level visit there in years. North Korean leaderKim Jong-un is expected to meet US President Donald Trumpin the coming weeks. South Korea has already spoken to the leaders of US and Japan. According to Beijing, Mr Wang's visit on Wednesday and Thursday is being made at the invitation of the government in Pyongyang. In March, Mr Kim made a surprise visit to Beijing to see President Xi Jinping, his first international trip since taking office, underlining the importance to Pyongyang of its relationship with China. Why Xi's still the one for Kim to see On Friday, the North Korean leader and the South's President Moon Jae-in agreed at a historic summit to ""completely cease all hostile acts against each other"" and to work towards denuclearising the Korean peninsula. This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea The meeting followed months of warlike rhetoric and missile tests from the North. The commitment to denuclearisation talks about the goal of ""a nuclear-free Korean peninsula"". It does not explicitly refer to North Korea halting its nuclear activities. South Korea does not have its own nuclear weapons, but is militarily backed by the US, which has tens of thousands of troops stationed there. According to Seoul, North Korea promised to close its atomic test site next month and invite US weapons experts to the country - a promise not included in the joint declaration from the summit. North Korea has in the past argued it needs nuclear weapons to defend itself against aggression from outside, especially the US. Five key moments from an extraordinary day Panmunjom Declaration in full,external North Korea crisis in 300 words Mr Kim and Mr Moon said they would also pursue talks with the US and China to formally end the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a truce, not formal peace. Friday's summit also prepared the way for direct talks between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump. Mr Trump has since said talks with North Korea could take place ""over the next three or four weeks"". Many analysts, however, remain sceptical about the North's sudden enthusiasm for engagement. Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace? Five conflicts that continued after they ended N Korea nuclear test site 'to shut in May' Welcoming Kim with pomp and peace rituals Also on Monday, South Korea said it would take down its loudspeakers which have historically blasted propaganda into the North over the border. A defence ministry spokesman said it was a ""rudimentary"" step to help build trust between the Koreas, the Yonhap news agency reports. The loudspeakers had already been turned off ahead of Friday's summit. Among the announcements on Friday, Pyongyang said it would change its time zone to run in sync with the South again ""as a first practical step for national reconciliation and unity"". The current Northern time zone - 30 minutes behind the South - was created in 2015 to mark the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese occupation after World War Two.

"The trial of tanker driver Peter Norton collapsed after the prosecution failed to disclose evidence A judge has warned of ""systemic failures"" in disclosing evidence after a Â£500,000 red diesel VAT fraud trial collapsed. A linked trial also had to be abandoned due to errors on the part of investigating officers from HMRC. HMRC said it accepted the failings and was working with the Crown Prosecution Service to learn from the incident. It followsa series of high-profile rape caseswhich have collapsed due to crucial evidence not being disclosed. Judge Robert Trevor-Jones said the fraud case showed ""lamentable negligence"" and was indicative of a more widespread problem. The former Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas blamed disclosure failings on ""cuts of a very high magnitude"" to the criminal justice system. Hundreds of cases dropped over disclosure failings Evidence not disclosed on a daily basis, lawyers say In December 2013, officers from customs and excise (HMRC) raided tanker driver Peter Norton's home. He was charged with others with conspiracy to evade VAT by selling nearly Â£500,000 of laundered so-called red diesel fuel. Red diesel is only legal for off-road vehicles such as tractors, and has a much lower VAT rate. A VAT fraud involving the fuel works by removing the red dye to make it look like regular diesel before the fuel is then sold on fraudulently at the higher VAT rate. Peter Norton has always denied any wrongdoing. If the red dye is removed, the substance looks like normal diesel After a four-year investigation by HMRC, the case went to trial in January at Liverpool Crown Court. But a month into the trial, a vast amount of information that should have been disclosed to the defence was identified on the laptop of the HMRC investigating officer, Daniel Grundy. The prosecution asked for an adjournment to sift through the material that should have been disclosed. Judge Trevor-Jones refused and the trial collapsed. In his ruling, he said: ""I accept that the failure here can properly be described as negligent, but it was negligence to a lamentable degree. ""It is indicative of a more systemic failure going beyond the omissions of just one officer."" He added: ""The competence, even credibility, of the investigative team has clearly been tainted."" The same disclosure failings meant that a linked trial of petrol station owners, due to begin a few weeks later, was also abandoned. Lawyers in the case estimate the two trials cost in excess of Â£2m of public money. Judge Robert Trevor-Jones said the credibility of the investigations team had been ""tainted"" Mr Norton told the BBC: ""When you are in court, you look at the surroundings you are in. ""There are barristers, there are judges, there is a jury, and these people are in charge of my liberty at that time. ""As a defendant, you think that HMRC have done everything in a professional manner and you feel as though, hopefully, everyone has done their job properly to have a fair trial."" In any criminal investigation, the investigating authority - be it the police or HMRC - are bound to gather evidence that leads to the suspect and any that also leads away from him. Critically, the prosecution is under a duty to disclose to the defence any of the material gathered that either assists the defence case or undermines their own. This latest case shows that disclosure failings are not limited to rape and sexual assault cases. The problems are more systemic and investigating authorities other than the police are also failing in their duty to disclose evidence. The former Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas told the BBC he believed ""disclosure failures are pretty widespread"". ""We have, over the last 20 or so years, seen less police officers and other investigating officers go to court, so they don't understand the importance of disclosure."" He added: ""It seems to me that the cuts have gone too far. ""The obvious thing to do is to make sure proper resources are put into this vital aspect of our criminal justice system."" But Attorney General Jeremy Wright QC has denied the current disclosure failures are a ""resources"" issue. An HMRC spokesperson said they ""fully accept"" the failings, but would be working closely with the CPS to ""see what lessons can be learned."" Hundreds of court cases axed over failings All current rape cases 'urgently' reviewed Evidence not being disclosed, lawyers say Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"The British troopship HMT Empire Windrush anchored at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 21 June 1948 carrying hundreds of passengers from the Caribbean hoping for a new life in Britain - alongside hundreds from elsewhere. Who were they? June 2020: To mark this year's Windrush Day, on 22 June, we have retrieved this article from our archives. The former passenger liner's journey up the Thames on that misty June day is now regarded as the symbolic starting point of a wave of Caribbean migration between 1948 and 1971 known as the ""Windrush generation"". Many were enticed to cross the Atlantic by job opportunities amid the UK's post-war labour shortage. But, despite living and working in the UK for decades, it emerged last year that some of the families of these Windrush migrants have been threatened with deportation, denied access to NHS treatment, benefits and pensions and stripped of their jobs.The UK government was forced to apologise and offered compensationfor anyone who had ""suffered loss"". The ship - which dropped anchor on 21 June and released its travellers a day later - was carrying 1,027 passengers, including two stowaways, according to BBC analysisof the ship's records kept by the National Archives.,external Alongside those travelling from the Caribbean for work, there were also Polish nationals displaced by World War Two, members of the RAF and people from Britain. Passenger Lucile Harris, who settled in Britain from the Caribbean, recalled her arrival in Tilbury in aninterview with the BBC in 1998to mark the 50th anniversary of the Windrush sailing. ""It was a lovely day, beautiful, and they [family] were all at the dock waiting for me... I was very excited."" According to the ship's passenger lists, more than half of the 1,027 listed official passengers on board (539) gave their last country of residence as Jamaica, while 139 said Bermuda and 119 stated England. There were also people from Mexico, Scotland, Gibraltar, Burma and Wales. According to Nicholas Boston of the City University of New York, those who gave Mexico as their last country of residence were agroup of Polish refugees,external- mainly women and children - who had been offered permanent residence in Britain. Who are the Windrush generation? Advice for the Windrush generation on what to do next How do you prove you've been living in the UK? Overall, 802 passengers gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean. Many of them had paid Â£28 (about Â£1,000 today) to travel to Britain in response to job adverts in local newspapers. Among them wereJohn Hazel, 21, a boxer, Harold Wilmot, 32, a case maker and John Richards, 22, a carpenter,seen here in a photograph taken on arrival - alongside their records from the National Archives passenger list. Mr Richards,interviewed by the BBC in 1998, was, like many others, shocked to discover the difference between the ""mother country"" he had seen in books and the reality he was confronted with. ""I know a lot about Britain from school days but it was a different picture from that one, when you came face to face with the facts. It was two different things,"" he said. ""They tell you it is the 'mother country', you're all welcome, you all British. When you come here you realise you're a foreigner and that's all there is to it."" According to the ship's records, most of the Windrush's passengers got on in Jamaica, but others also joined the vessel in Trinidad, Tampico and Bermuda. As many of the eyewitness accounts have stated since, the majority of the people on board were men. There were 684 males over the age of 12, alongside 257 females of the same age. There were also 86 children aged 12 and under. The listed occupations on the passenger lists give some indication of the wide range of skills that were on offer. Among those arriving from the Caribbean were mechanics, carpenters, tailors, engineers, welders and musicians. According to the RAF,dozens of the Caribbean passengers were also RAF airmen,externalreturning from leave or veterans re-joining the service. A future Mayor of Southwark,Sam King, who had served in England with the wartime RAF, was among them. Also among the Caribbean passengers was a hatter, a retired judge, a potter, a barrister, two hairdressers, two actresses, two piano repairers, two missionaries, three boxers, five artists and six painters. The most noted occupation, though, was ""HD"" - or ""housing domestic"" - meaning a housewife, servant or cleaner. There were 172 overall on board - 96 from the Caribbean. Among the boxing hopefuls on board wereCharles Smith, 21, a welder and boxer, Vernon ""Boy"" Solas, 18, mechanic and boxer, and boxing manager Mortimer Martin, 31, who was also a welder,captured in this photograph on arrival. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most popular destination recorded by passengers from the Caribbean was London - 296 people gave the city as their planned place of residence. Interestingly, 109 passengers didn't give any address, perhaps indicating they had no fixed plan on arrival. A number of other passengers planned to go to Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Plymouth. Those that had nowhere to stay were temporarily housed in a former air raid shelter at Clapham South underground station. Newspaper reports from the time state how those at the shelter went on to find jobs through the nearest Labour Exchanges (Job Centres), one of which was in Coldharbour Lane, Brixton. Many then moved into rented houses and rooms in the Brixton and Clapham areas, working for employers such as the National Health Service or London Transport. From here, large Caribbean communities developed, contributing to the political, social and musical life of Britain ever since. The ship - full name HMT Empire Windrush - was originally a German passenger liner given to the UK as war reparation in 1945. First called Monte Rosa, it was converted to a troopship and renamed HMT Empire Windrush in 1947. This video can not be played What was life like on-board the Windrush? Oswald ""Columbus"" Denniston, who was the first of the Windrush passengers to get a job according to the Daily Express at the time,told the BBC in 1998 that the atmosphere on the ship was ""jolly"".,external ""We had two or three bands - calypso singers. And Jamaican people are happy-go-lucky people. When you have more than six you have a party."" On leaving the ship on 22 June, the then 35-year-old began work the same day handing out rations at the shelter in Clapham where the Windrush passengers were staying. Mr Denniston, who died in 2000 aged 86, went on to settle in Brixton, where he worked as a street trader. ""Many of us thought we would come here to get a better education and to stay for about five years,"" he said. ""But then some of us have ended staying for 50."" As for the ship itself, it made its final voyage in 1954, catching fire and sinking in the Mediterranean Sea with the loss of four members of crew. All of its passengers were saved.

"This video can not be played The second explosion targeted those at the scene of the first At least 26 people have been killed in two bombings in the Afghan capital Kabul, including several journalists documenting the scene. AFP chief photographer in Kabul, Shah Marai, is among the victims. The first explosion was carried out by an attacker on a motorbike. A second followed about 15 minutes later after a crowd, including several reporters, had gathered at the scene. The Islamic State group (IS) said it had carried out the attack. It was one of several fatal incidents on Monday. BBC reporter Ahmad Shah was also killed in a separate attack in the Khost region. And in a third attack, 11 children were killed in a suicide bombing intended to target Nato troops in Kandahar province. In the Kabul attack, the AFP news agency said the second blast had deliberately targeted the group of journalists, including its photographer Shah Marai. Allow Twitter content?

Nine journalists and photographers and four police officers, were among the dead, officials say. So far, 45 people have been reported injured. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty confirmed that three of its journalists,externalwere killed in the attack. Abadullah Hananzai, a journalist and cameraman, had been working on a story about narcotics, while Maharram Durrani worked on the weekly women's programme.

In pictures: Remembering photographer Shah Marai The hell of losing loved ones in Afghanistan The Shashdarak district also houses the defence ministry and a Nato compound. ""This is the deadliest day for Afghan media in the past 15 years,"" the head of Tolo News TV, Lotfullah Najafizada, told the BBC. ""We went, all of us, to the blast site. We said: 'If you killed an entire line of journalists reporting here, in five hours time we're back here; the line is longer; the queue is longer and the resolve is greater."" Bombings in the Afghan capital are not uncommon. Earlier in April, a suicide bomb at a voter registration killed almost 60 people and injured 119, in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. The Taliban also remain active in the country, only 30% of which is under full government control,according to BBC research published earlier this year. Photo by Shah Marai: An Afghan girl scavenges for recyclables, 2011 AFP paid tribute to Shah Marai, who it said had six children, including a newborn baby. ""This is a devastating blow,"" global news director Michele Leridon said. ""We can only honour the extraordinary strength, courage and generosity of a photographer who covered often traumatic, horrific events with sensitivity and consummate professionalism."" A shooting in Khost province resulted in the death of a BBC reporter. ""It is with great sadness that the BBC can confirm the death of BBC Afghan reporter Ahmad Shah following an attack earlier today,"" said Jamie Angus, director of the BBC World Service. Ahmad Shah, 29, was killed by unknown attackers in Khost ""Ahmad Shah was 29.  He had worked for the BBC Afghan service for more than a year and had already established himself as a highly capable journalist who was a respected and popular member of the team. ""This is a devastating loss and I send my sincere condolences to Ahmad Shah's friends and family and the whole BBC Afghan team. ""We are doing all we can to support his family at this very difficult time."" Local police are investigating a motive. Also on Monday, a suicide bomb attack in the Kandahar region killed 11 schoolchildren and injured many more. The bomber appeared to have been targeting a military vehicle convoy in Daman district, but the explosion struck a nearby religious school. In addition to the dead, more than a dozen children were reported injured in the blast. Nato forces operate from a base in the area, and Nato officials confirmed that some of its people had been injured, as had Afghan police. Eight of the injured were of Romanian nationality, Nato said, but all were in stable condition. No group has yet said it carried out the Kandahar attack.

"""It's incredible the difference one person can make in your whole life and how empty it feels without them,"" says Carolynn Burke. The 29-year-old wipes a tear as she talks about her friend Kirsty Maxwell, 27, who fell to her death in Benidorm exactly a year ago. Twenty girls were celebrating Carolynn's hen party and had enjoyed a drunken night out. Now four of them have gone back to mark the first anniversary. The women have been putting up posters, handing out flyers and talking to people to see if anyone has information. Kerry, Leslie-Anne, Suzanne and Carolynn revisit the site where Kirsty fell and hand out flyers The women, who are from Livingston, West Lothian, still don't know what happened leading up to her plunging from the 10th floor of a room of the Apartmentos Payma in the holiday resort. Five men from Nottingham were in the room she fell from. They were questioned by Spanish police but never charged. David Swindle, a former detective assisting the family, told Newsbeat: ""The key to this, to me, is in Nottingham. ""There were a large group of men from Nottingham here, there were over 50 of them. ""Some of them were in the room with Kirsty before she died, and some were staying at the Payma Apartments."" Kirsty fell from the tenth floor of a room of the Apartmentos Payma Kerry Langton, 27, walked home with Kirsty and put her to bed that night. ""We got home safe. She was in bed safe. That's the worst thing about all this, we did what we always do, we looked after each other. ""You think you're in your room, she's tucked up in bed, we were safe. ""There are so many 'what ifs'. But we were as sensible as we could have been and yet something as tragic as this still happened."" Kirsty with her husband Adam Nobody knows how Kirsty woke up and ended up in another room. Lesley-Anne Watson, 28, was a bridesmaid for Carolynn, along with Kirsty. ""That night we just had so much fun, having a drink and a dance, taking selfies. ""It's horrible looking back on them now. You never think that when you're taking those pictures that it'll be the last time you're going to have a picture taken with Kirsty. ""You think this isn't real. It's the strangest feeling ever."" Kirsty's family and friends have put up posters around the resort Lesley-Anne says she was haunted by seeing her friend's body that morning. ""That Saturday morning I got woken by a banging on the door. ""There were police officers in the corridor. ""I walked round the apartment to the opposite side and looked out the window and Kirsty was just lying at the pool. ""That's something that I never ever thought I'd have to look at or have to see. ""That image for weeks, if not months, was in my head. Why two hours after it happened she was still lying there, I'll never know. I was in a state of shock."" ""At first we thought it was a mistake. Everyone was in a panic,"" says Kerry. ""That's why we know people must have seen something,"" continues Lesley-Anne. ""We need people to come forward. I'm here for one reason, and that's to get answers. We're a close group and we are together here, even stronger."" Kirsty's friends Leslie, Kerry, Carolynn and Suzanne return to Benidorm in search of answers Carolynn says she struggles with the small things. ""It's the calls, texts, tags in a Facebook post - you have to really remind yourself she's not here anymore. ""I look at everything all the time. All the pictures that we've got, and all the Snapchat memories that we have. ""I got a book made of all our WhatsApp conversations just because I was so scared of losing it, and that I would lose those memories forever."" Kirsty with her friends on her wedding day ""She's always in my thoughts. She was hilarious, and most of the time when we speak about her we are laughing about the fun times but then it is tinged with sadness. ""At least the memories that we've got are the best, they are amazing. ""Watching her get married to Adam was one of the best weeks of my life, out in Cyprus. I've never seen such a beautiful bride, she was just gorgeous."" Adam and Kirsty on their wedding day Suzanne Lothian, 28, tells Newsbeat they are normal girls who were on a normal hen party. When the girls found out Kirsty had fallen to her death, they couldn't comprehend what happened. ""It was absolutely horrendous, but very surreal. I couldn't understand and put the two together, I couldn't understand how this could have happened. ""We didn't know if she was alive, we were told an accident, we didn't know at first. ""When you're asking the police, can you tell me if she is alive? When the answer is 'I'm sorry but no' - everything crumbles around you. It was terrible."" Kirsty's aunt Angela joined the girls in Benidorm on the anniversary of her death Kirsty's aunt Angela also travelled with the girls to help them raise awareness around the anniversary. ""It's been emotional, but positive, we've put up the posters and we've been speaking to people. ""We just want to find the answers. We're trying to get support from anyone who was here last year to come forward. ""It's quite upsetting to look up and know that's where my niece fell to her death. The void is just so huge in our family. That'll never be filled."" Kirsty's friends hope that by raising awareness in the resort, they'll get some answers over her death People are being asked to change their profile picture on social media accounts to one of Kirsty to mark the day. The girls also set up at Snapchat geofilter with #KirstyMaxwell on it, hoping people will use it and hear about what happened.

"Was Amber Rudd's resignation inevitable? Certainly there has been a mismatch between what she told MPs last week and the evidence that emerged. In a different time, and with a minister with enemies, she'd most likely have been out on Friday. This time the Tory party was fighting hard to keep her. But beyond the mess-ups, perhaps part of the issue was also that the home secretary was not necessarily in tune with her predecessor's attitude on immigration - the Home Office's most politically charged brief. It is hard to understand that she wasn't aware of a widespread culture of targets. But no one is suggesting that she deliberately misled MPs last week. So, it is pertinent to ask how much focus she gave to the immigration brief at the Home Office, or whether she was happy to delegate to trusted colleagues and focus on other areas. Those who have worked at junior levels in the Home Office as ministers sometimes joke that they'd never want the big job given how complicated it is. Home secretaries, however tightly they grip everything, can never be sure they won't trip up. But don't forget Ms Rudd's persona was also vital in the delicate Brexit balance of the cabinet. She was a Remainer, and trusted by the PM. A grown up, who was as open as politically possible about the case she would make for the softer end of Brexit privately, hinting at it in public too. Amber Rudd resigns: Live reaction What went wrong for Amber Rudd? Amber Rudd's resignation letter in full Given the fraught politics of the moment, replacing her is not just a matter of promoting a minister who looks competent, but making an appointment that does not tear the already strained Tory truce. And beyond all that, Ms Rudd's departure gives Theresa May not one, but several new potential headaches. It gives an impression of shaky government days before the local elections. Ms Rudd could give the Tory rebel Remainers more authority on the backbenches. And continuing questions about the Windrush fiasco may now be aimed more sharply at the prime minister herself. There are good reasons why Number 10 initially tried to resist this resignation. The pressure on the individual may be gone, but the wider impact may not yet have begun. Stretching to close one gap opens another. Ms Rudd was an important figure in cabinet, not just because she occupied one of the great offices of state, but because she was widely liked inside her party, at the more modern end of the Tory spectrum and a vigorous Remainer whose voice gave ballast to that side of the argument at the top table. The decision to go was - I'm told - entirely hers. Both Number 10 and her other political friends in government tried to persuade her to stay, it's said. It was her judgement that it was untenable to stay it's suggested, because she couldn't be sure that nothing else would emerge from the Home Office filing cabinets that might have made staying on in the job even more awkward than it already was.

"Labour said the policy could help 2.7 million people who are stuck with permanent overdrafts Labour says it would cap the total amount anyone could pay in bank overdraft fees or interest repayments. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he wanted to end the ""national scandal"" of low paid families trapped in debt. Labour said the policy could help 2.7 million people who are stuck with permanent overdrafts, saving them the equivalent of Â£86 each per year. The Treasury said it had already tightened the rules to protect debtors and cracked down on payday loans. Call for stricter rules on doorstep loans Sheen tackles high cost of rent-to-own Mr McDonnell said: ""Too many families are having to rely on borrowing just to get to the end of the month, and are facing huge costs from our High Street banks. ""The national scandal of the low paid debt trap has to end. More needs to be done to level the playing field and bring greater fairness in consumer finance."" Actor and campaigner Michael Sheen is supporting the proposal According to Labour, people stuck with permanent overdrafts use them more than 85% of the time while incurring higher charges. The party also said overdraft charges could be up to four times higher than the equivalent borrowing from payday lending. Under the policy, regulators would impose a limit of Â£24 per month per Â£100 borrowed on any interest, fees and charges related to an overdraft. That would be equivalent to the current cap on payday loan interest charges. The proposal was welcomed by the actor and founder of the campaign group End High Cost Credit Alliance, Michael Sheen. Payday lenders like Wonga have faced tougher rules since 2015 The Frost/Nixon star, who is a Labour supporter, said: ""High cost credit is more than just pay day loans, rent to own businesses or doorstep lending. ""Millions of people across the UK are also trapped in their overdrafts by extortionate rates of interest charged by reputable high street banks."" Banks say they have introduced a number of measures to help customers avoid going into their overdrafts and minimise any charges when they do. These include accounts with ""overdraft buffers"", in which no overdraft fees are charged, and alerts for customers who are about to enter into an unarranged overdraft. The government has also taken steps to help vulnerable people in debt. Last year it committed to introducing a six-week grace period in which debtors would be protected from enforcement proceedings and mounting interest charges. And in 2015, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed a cap on payday loan costs following criticism of lenders. The FCA has also raised concerns about overdrafts and plans to consult on possible remedies later this year. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We know that families can struggle with debt. That is why we have tightened the rules to ensure that money can only be lent to people who can afford to repay.

"""It's incredible the difference one person can make in your whole life and how empty it feels without them,"" says Carolynn Burke. The 29-year-old wipes a tear as she talks about her friend Kirsty Maxwell, 27, who fell to her death in Benidorm exactly a year ago. Twenty girls were celebrating Carolynn's hen party and had enjoyed a drunken night out. Now four of them have gone back to mark the first anniversary. The women have been putting up posters, handing out flyers and talking to people to see if anyone has information. Kerry, Leslie-Anne, Suzanne and Carolynn revisit the site where Kirsty fell and hand out flyers The women, who are from Livingston, West Lothian, still don't know what happened leading up to her plunging from the 10th floor of a room of the Apartmentos Payma in the holiday resort. Five men from Nottingham were in the room she fell from. They were questioned by Spanish police but never charged. David Swindle, a former detective assisting the family, told Newsbeat: ""The key to this, to me, is in Nottingham. ""There were a large group of men from Nottingham here, there were over 50 of them. ""Some of them were in the room with Kirsty before she died, and some were staying at the Payma Apartments."" Kirsty fell from the tenth floor of a room of the Apartmentos Payma Kerry Langton, 27, walked home with Kirsty and put her to bed that night. ""We got home safe. She was in bed safe. That's the worst thing about all this, we did what we always do, we looked after each other. ""You think you're in your room, she's tucked up in bed, we were safe. ""There are so many 'what ifs'. But we were as sensible as we could have been and yet something as tragic as this still happened."" Kirsty with her husband Adam Nobody knows how Kirsty woke up and ended up in another room. Lesley-Anne Watson, 28, was a bridesmaid for Carolynn, along with Kirsty. ""That night we just had so much fun, having a drink and a dance, taking selfies. ""It's horrible looking back on them now. You never think that when you're taking those pictures that it'll be the last time you're going to have a picture taken with Kirsty. ""You think this isn't real. It's the strangest feeling ever."" Kirsty's family and friends have put up posters around the resort Lesley-Anne says she was haunted by seeing her friend's body that morning. ""That Saturday morning I got woken by a banging on the door. ""There were police officers in the corridor. ""I walked round the apartment to the opposite side and looked out the window and Kirsty was just lying at the pool. ""That's something that I never ever thought I'd have to look at or have to see. ""That image for weeks, if not months, was in my head. Why two hours after it happened she was still lying there, I'll never know. I was in a state of shock."" ""At first we thought it was a mistake. Everyone was in a panic,"" says Kerry. ""That's why we know people must have seen something,"" continues Lesley-Anne. ""We need people to come forward. I'm here for one reason, and that's to get answers. We're a close group and we are together here, even stronger."" Kirsty's friends Leslie, Kerry, Carolynn and Suzanne return to Benidorm in search of answers Carolynn says she struggles with the small things. ""It's the calls, texts, tags in a Facebook post - you have to really remind yourself she's not here anymore. ""I look at everything all the time. All the pictures that we've got, and all the Snapchat memories that we have. ""I got a book made of all our WhatsApp conversations just because I was so scared of losing it, and that I would lose those memories forever."" Kirsty with her friends on her wedding day ""She's always in my thoughts. She was hilarious, and most of the time when we speak about her we are laughing about the fun times but then it is tinged with sadness. ""At least the memories that we've got are the best, they are amazing. ""Watching her get married to Adam was one of the best weeks of my life, out in Cyprus. I've never seen such a beautiful bride, she was just gorgeous."" Adam and Kirsty on their wedding day Suzanne Lothian, 28, tells Newsbeat they are normal girls who were on a normal hen party. When the girls found out Kirsty had fallen to her death, they couldn't comprehend what happened. ""It was absolutely horrendous, but very surreal. I couldn't understand and put the two together, I couldn't understand how this could have happened. ""We didn't know if she was alive, we were told an accident, we didn't know at first. ""When you're asking the police, can you tell me if she is alive? When the answer is 'I'm sorry but no' - everything crumbles around you. It was terrible."" Kirsty's aunt Angela joined the girls in Benidorm on the anniversary of her death Kirsty's aunt Angela also travelled with the girls to help them raise awareness around the anniversary. ""It's been emotional, but positive, we've put up the posters and we've been speaking to people. ""We just want to find the answers. We're trying to get support from anyone who was here last year to come forward. ""It's quite upsetting to look up and know that's where my niece fell to her death. The void is just so huge in our family. That'll never be filled."" Kirsty's friends hope that by raising awareness in the resort, they'll get some answers over her death People are being asked to change their profile picture on social media accounts to one of Kirsty to mark the day. The girls also set up at Snapchat geofilter with #KirstyMaxwell on it, hoping people will use it and hear about what happened.

"The two Korean leaders have agreed to begin ""a new age of peace"" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is to visit North Korea this week, after historic talks between the North and South last Friday. The trip comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activityfollowing the landmark day on the peninsula. China is North Korea's only remaining economic ally, but this will be its highest level visit there in years. North Korean leaderKim Jong-un is expected to meet US President Donald Trumpin the coming weeks. South Korea has already spoken to the leaders of US and Japan. According to Beijing, Mr Wang's visit on Wednesday and Thursday is being made at the invitation of the government in Pyongyang. In March, Mr Kim made a surprise visit to Beijing to see President Xi Jinping, his first international trip since taking office, underlining the importance to Pyongyang of its relationship with China. Why Xi's still the one for Kim to see On Friday, the North Korean leader and the South's President Moon Jae-in agreed at a historic summit to ""completely cease all hostile acts against each other"" and to work towards denuclearising the Korean peninsula. This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea The meeting followed months of warlike rhetoric and missile tests from the North. The commitment to denuclearisation talks about the goal of ""a nuclear-free Korean peninsula"". It does not explicitly refer to North Korea halting its nuclear activities. South Korea does not have its own nuclear weapons, but is militarily backed by the US, which has tens of thousands of troops stationed there. According to Seoul, North Korea promised to close its atomic test site next month and invite US weapons experts to the country - a promise not included in the joint declaration from the summit. North Korea has in the past argued it needs nuclear weapons to defend itself against aggression from outside, especially the US. Five key moments from an extraordinary day Panmunjom Declaration in full,external North Korea crisis in 300 words Mr Kim and Mr Moon said they would also pursue talks with the US and China to formally end the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a truce, not formal peace. Friday's summit also prepared the way for direct talks between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump. Mr Trump has since said talks with North Korea could take place ""over the next three or four weeks"". Many analysts, however, remain sceptical about the North's sudden enthusiasm for engagement. Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace? Five conflicts that continued after they ended N Korea nuclear test site 'to shut in May' Welcoming Kim with pomp and peace rituals Also on Monday, South Korea said it would take down its loudspeakers which have historically blasted propaganda into the North over the border. A defence ministry spokesman said it was a ""rudimentary"" step to help build trust between the Koreas, the Yonhap news agency reports. The loudspeakers had already been turned off ahead of Friday's summit. Among the announcements on Friday, Pyongyang said it would change its time zone to run in sync with the South again ""as a first practical step for national reconciliation and unity"". The current Northern time zone - 30 minutes behind the South - was created in 2015 to mark the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese occupation after World War Two. According to North Korean state media, Mr Kim said it was ""a painful wrench"" to see clocks showing different times on the wall during the summit.

"Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe The proposed mega merger between Asda and Sainsbury begs five very important questions for the boss of Sainsbury's. They are CEO's Mike Coupe's to answer because Asda has been doing poorly and its owner Walmart will be glad to be shot of it. Sainsbury's owners will be much more sceptical. The biggest questions arise around the stated intent to run both brands side by side with few if any store closures. Sainsbury's is due to make an announcement to the stock market on Monday, shedding more light on the deal. Both say this is going to be good for customers. Does that mean Sainsbury's customers (who currently pay a little bit more for their groceries) will pay the same prices as Asda customers? One of the big ""synergies"" will be combined and greater buying power. Will they buy at one price for both stores and sell according to different price lists? When you have stores side by side won't Sainsbury's shoppers feel ripped off if they are paying more for going through a different door? Are they really guaranteeing no store closures? If they have two large stores in the same town do they really need the combined square footage when the likes of Tesco and others are trying to reduce the amount of retail space? Even if we take them at face value and no stores close - another big cost saving is presumably the logistics and depots they use to stock their stores and fulfil online orders. It strains credulity to imagine this is an area where consolidation and cuts will not occur. Presumably there will be no need for two head office operations. Although Sainsbury's seems to have integrated the Argos brand pretty well, that was a lot easier as Argos is a different category - non-food. Can you run two fascias side by side without blurring the brand identity of both - thereby confusing and potentially losing customers? Even if the competition authorities allow it to go ahead - what about the shareholders? Most of the ones I've spoken to have pretty big reservations. As one said to me - there isn't one positive message about this deal in my inbox. Supermarket merger 'must be investigated' Could the big four become the big three?

"The competition watchdog is being urged by politicians to examine the possible merger of Sainsbury's and Asda. Talks between the two UK supermarket chains are at an ""advanced"" stage, with more details of a potential Â£10bn deal expected on Monday. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, a former business secretary, said the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ""must investigate"". Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey echoed Sir Vince's concerns. Simon Jack: Five big questions for Sainsbury's boss Merger talks 'sign of changing retail world' Aldi tops supermarket satisfaction survey Thousands of jobs at risk at Sainsbury's The combined group would comprise 2,800 stores and would represent 31.4% of the UK grocery market - slightly more than that of market leader Tesco. The two brands are expected to be retained, should a merger go ahead. Sir Vince said the CMA should force the companies to sell off stores if the merger meant the new giant was dominant in a particular area.  He said the move risked creating ""even more concentrated local monopolies"". He later told the BBC: ""The competition inquiry has to focus on the customers, that is their job."" And Ms Long-Bailey warned that the merger risked ""squeezing what little competition there is in the groceries market even further"". Any investigation by the CMA could only be announced once an intention to merge has been formally unveiled. Latest figures show that Tesco has a 25% grocery market share, while Sainsbury's has 13.8% and Asda has 12.9%. Together, they would move just ahead of Tesco, with 26.7% of the grocery market. The merger would have to be backed by the CMA, as the two chains are the UK's second and third biggest grocery chains. Catherine Shuttleworth, shopping and retail expert at agency Savvy,  told BBC Radio 5live: ""The two brands are very different. Sainsbury's is also much stronger in the south, and Asda much stronger in the north."" The two chains are focused on different geographic areas But she said there were similarities, including both having ""quite strong clothing businesses"". She added that any merger talks would get off to a good start as Asda chief executive Roger Burnley used to work for Sainsbury's, and Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe is a former employee of Asda. Mrs Shuttleworth said the proposed merger was being driven by a number of factors, including the possible entry of Amazon into the UK groceries market, and also the challenge to traditional chains from discounters such as Lidl and Aldi. ""In the UK Amazon have started to dip their toe in the waters with food,"" she said. ""They have got a trading agreement with Morrisons, who are their agent. ""But the fear is that if they really went into the UK market, then they will take share. Part of the merger is to make sure they are protected from that, and also from the growing rise of the discounters."" News of the potential deal also caused concern among workers' unions. Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, said: ""Our first priority is to safeguard the job of every single Asda member, both in stores and in distribution. We are demanding an urgent meeting with Asda to get the answers and assurances our members need and deserve."" And Joanne McGuinness, Usdaw national officer, said: ""Our priorities will be to protect our members and ensure any deal between the retailers does not impact on their jobs or incomes."" Asda was founded in Yorkshire in 1965. It was bought by US retail giant Walmart in 1999. The first ever Sainsbury's store opened in 1869 in London's Drury Lane. Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, is now the supermarket's largest shareholder. Analysis: By BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson All the main supermarket chains have been looking to find new sources of growth because there's not much of it around their own aisles. Asda had been the poorest performer of the big four. The industry has been wondering what its big strategic move might be. Now we know. If this merger goes through, it will be the biggest shake up in UK grocery retailing since Morrisons took over Safeway in 2004.

"This video can not be played The second explosion targeted those at the scene of the first At least 26 people have been killed in two bombings in the Afghan capital Kabul, including several journalists documenting the scene. AFP chief photographer in Kabul, Shah Marai, is among the victims. The first explosion was carried out by an attacker on a motorbike. A second followed about 15 minutes later after a crowd, including several reporters, had gathered at the scene. The Islamic State group (IS) said it had carried out the attack. It was one of several fatal incidents on Monday. BBC reporter Ahmad Shah was also killed in a separate attack in the Khost region. And in a third attack, 11 children were killed in a suicide bombing intended to target Nato troops in Kandahar province. In the Kabul attack, the AFP news agency said the second blast had deliberately targeted the group of journalists, including its photographer Shah Marai. Allow Twitter content?

Nine journalists and photographers and four police officers, were among the dead, officials say. So far, 45 people have been reported injured. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty confirmed that three of its journalists,externalwere killed in the attack. Abadullah Hananzai, a journalist and cameraman, had been working on a story about narcotics, while Maharram Durrani worked on the weekly women's programme.

""This is the deadliest day for Afghan media in the past 15 years,"" the head of Tolo News TV, Lotfullah Najafizada, told the BBC. ""We went, all of us, to the blast site. We said: 'If you killed an entire line of journalists reporting here, in five hours time we're back here; the line is longer; the queue is longer and the resolve is greater."" Bombings in the Afghan capital are not uncommon. Earlier in April, a suicide bomb at a voter registration killed almost 60 people and injured 119, in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. The Taliban also remain active in the country, only 30% of which is under full government control,according to BBC research published earlier this year. Photo by Shah Marai: An Afghan girl scavenges for recyclables, 2011 AFP paid tribute to Shah Marai, who it said had six children, including a newborn baby. ""This is a devastating blow,"" global news director Michele Leridon said. ""We can only honour the extraordinary strength, courage and generosity of a photographer who covered often traumatic, horrific events with sensitivity and consummate professionalism."" A shooting in Khost province resulted in the death of a BBC reporter. ""It is with great sadness that the BBC can confirm the death of BBC Afghan reporter Ahmad Shah following an attack earlier today,"" said Jamie Angus, director of the BBC World Service. Ahmad Shah, 29, was killed by unknown attackers in Khost ""Ahmad Shah was 29.  He had worked for the BBC Afghan service for more than a year and had already established himself as a highly capable journalist who was a respected and popular member of the team. ""This is a devastating loss and I send my sincere condolences to Ahmad Shah's friends and family and the whole BBC Afghan team. ""We are doing all we can to support his family at this very difficult time."" Local police are investigating a motive. Also on Monday, a suicide bomb attack in the Kandahar region killed 11 schoolchildren and injured many more. The bomber appeared to have been targeting a military vehicle convoy in Daman district, but the explosion struck a nearby religious school. In addition to the dead, more than a dozen children were reported injured in the blast. Nato forces operate from a base in the area, and Nato officials confirmed that some of its people had been injured, as had Afghan police. Eight of the injured were of Romanian nationality, Nato said, but all were in stable condition. No group has yet said it carried out the Kandahar attack.

"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be married by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 19 May The BBC has waived the TV licence fee for communities wanting to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding. It means street parties and other special events can screen the wedding live without buying a licence. Usually a premises must be covered by a TV licence for showing live TV or iPlayer, but this can be waived in exceptional circumstances. Hundreds of street party applications have been made to councils to mark the wedding on 19 May, the government said. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said about 60 applications have been made in Bromley, south east London, 54 in Richmond, west London, and 12 in Reading, Berkshire. It said many councils have waived fees for street party road closures and pub opening hours have been extended for the special occasion. Royal wedding: What we know so far Revenge is sweet, says best man William Pipa Doubtfire, the BBC's head of revenue management, said: ""In exceptional circumstances, the BBC can grant a dispensation for the temporary viewing of television, so long as the viewing is for the sole purpose of screening an event which is judged by the BBC to be of national importance. ""The BBC considers that the royal wedding is such an event."" For those communities interested in watching the FA Cup final, which will be broadcast on BBC One at 17:15 BST, a BBC Press Office spokesman said: ""The dispensation is just for watching the royal wedding.

"This video can not be played Nigerian president responds to Trump slur US President Donald Trump's reported disparaging of African countries did not come up in his talks with Nigeria's president, the two leaders have said. Muhammadu Buhari sidestepped a reporter's question about Mr Trump's alleged use of the term ""shitholes"" to describe certain developing nations. In their White House news conference, Mr Trump added: ""We didn't discuss it."" The Nigerian was the first sub-Saharan African leader to be invited for talks with the Trump administration. Mr Buhari was asked during Monday's joint press conference about a report in January that Mr Trump had complained about immigrants coming to the US from ""shithole countries"", specifically referring to Haiti, El Salvador and some African nations. Four things Trump and Buhari have in common The Nigerian president diplomatically replied: ""I'm not sure about, you know, the validity of whether that allegation against the president is true or not. ""So the best thing for me is to keep quiet."" Mr Trump did not deny he had used the term in his own reply. US President Donald Trump and Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari held a joint press conference in the Rose Garden of the White House ""The [Nigerian] president knows me and he knows where I'm coming from,"" he said. ""And you do have some countries that are in very bad shape and very tough places to live in."" Mr Trump took the opportunity to rail against US immigration laws, calling them ""obsolete"", ""weak"" and ""pathetic"". ""Our immigration laws in this country are a total disaster,"" he said, renewing calls for a border wall. The White House recently sold 12 counter insurgency aircraft worth $496m (Â£360m) to Nigeria to help in its fight against Boko Haram jihadist insurgents. Boko Haram militants launched their insurgency in 2009 The US previously refused to sell military aircraft to Nigeria, citing human rights concerns. Mr Trump said he hoped the Nigerian authorities would ""protect innocent civilians of all faiths, including Muslims and including Christians"". He also addressed sectarian strife in the African country, where 18 people, including two priests, were killed in an attack last week on a church. ""We've had serious problems with Christians who have been murdered, killed,"" Mr Trump said. ""We're going to work on that problem and working on that problem very, very hard."" BBC Nigeria correspondent Mayeni Jones says an increasingly sectarian conflict is affecting central Nigeria, where nomadic Fulani herdsmen and local farmers have been clashing over grazing land. Fighting terrorism is a priority for both administrations, our correspondent says. Mr Trump also said he hoped Nigeria would remove trade barriers to allow imports of American agricultural produce. This is another contentious issue as the Nigerian government has been trying to develop its own agriculture sector as it seeks to deal with mass unemployment and an economy reliant on oil. At home, President Buhari faces multiple security challenges, including the nine-year-old insurgency by Boko Haram in the north-east, and mounting insecurity in the centre of the country. Nigeria's Boko Haram attacks in numbers Mr Buhari, who is seeking re-election next year,in 2015 became the first opposition leader to be elected president in Nigeria.

"Michel Barnier said his ""door is open"" to Arlene Foster and the DUP The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has denied Arlene Foster's claims that he has been ""aggressive"" towards Northern Ireland unionists in the Brexit talks. It comes after the DUP leader said Michel Barnier did not understand the dispute and was not an ""honest broker"". Mr Barnier said he was not ready to engage in ""polemics"" with Mrs Foster. Monday marks the start of hisMichel Barnier's two-day visit to Ireland,which comes amid rising tensions over the future UK-Ireland border. He told a press conference in Dundalk at the beginning of the all-island Brexit forum that his ""door is open"" to Arlene Foster and the DUP. He said he had not approached the negotiations in a ""spirit of revenge"". This video can not be played DUP leader Arlene Foster: Brexit negotiations have 'become aggressive' He added that he regretted Brexit and said he was determined to work with the UK to find a solution to the Irish border issue. The all-island Brexit forum is being hosted by the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his deputy, Simon Coveney. On SundayMr Barnier said the UKwas contradicting itself over its Irish border policy. But Mrs Foster said she believes Mr Barnier does not understand the dispute and is ""not an honest broker"". In return he said that Mrs Foster needed to respect that his role was to negotiate on behalf of the EU and not to act as a mediator. Meanwhile the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) again said that there needs to be ""meaningful progress"" on border issue by the June EU summit. Leo Varadkar said otherwise it will be difficult to get theWithdrawal Agreementin place by October. The two-day all-island Brexit forum began on Monday In December, the UK and EU reached a political agreement in which the UK committed to protecting north-south cooperation on the island of Ireland. It also guaranteed there would be no hard border, including physical infrastructure or related checks and controls. Q&A: Brexit and the Irish border Barnier tells UK to 'resolve contradictions' in border policy Irish border June deadline 'artificial' says David Davis However, the EU's proposed backstop solution to avoid a hard border - keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union after Brexit - continues to be at odds with what the UK government and the DUP say they would accept. Mrs Foster told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg the DUP would not accept Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK. Arlene Foster has warned Michel Barnier the DUP will not accept Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK She said: ""Michel Barnier's trying to present himself as someone who cares deeply about Northern Ireland and if that is the case he needs to hear the fact that we are part of the United Kingdom [and] will remain part of the United Kingdom constitutionally, politically and economically. ""Therefore his proposal of us being in an all-Ireland regulatory scenario with a border down the Irish Sea simply does not work. ""It does not work constitutionally, politically and it certainly does not work from an economic perspective."" This video can not be played The Irish border bridge where stakes are high Mrs Foster added: ""We've tried to get him to understand the unionist position for the people of Northern Ireland but he hasn't really responded and I'm disappointed about that.

"This video can not be played Sainsbury's boss says cost cuts will bring down prices Sainsbury's has confirmed plans to merge with Asda, which is currently owned by US supermarket giant Walmart. The supermarkets said,externalthat grocery prices would fall in both chains as a result of the merger. Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe also said the deal would not lead to store closures or job losses in stores. The combination of the UK's second and third largest supermarkets would create a giant, representing nearly Â£1 in every Â£3 spent on groceries. Mr Coupe - who will lead the new combined group - said he believed the two supermarkets were ""the best possible fit"". Shares in Sainsbury'sjumped 15% in response to the merger news. Jack: Sainsbury's-Asda merger - one company, two prices? Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts Walmart, which has owned Asda since 1999, will retain 42% of the combined business. The supermarkets say that as a result of the merger, they expect to be able to lower prices ""by around 10% on many of the products customers buy regularly"". This video can not be played Shoppers react to supermarket merger Sainsbury's and Asda will remain separate brands and no stores will close, Mr Coupe told the BBC. ""There's been a bit of commentary over the weekend where people have been alluding to the fact that the only way of making this happen is by closing stores - that is not true,"" said Mr Coupe. Following the merger Argos will open outlets within Asda stores, the firms said. Sainsbury's took over Argos in 2016 and has been integrating the catalogue retailer into its own stores. Sainsbury's said it couldn't comment on what would happen to customers' Nectar points after the merger. The combined business will overtake current market leader Tesco, representing around 30% of UK grocery sales. That will give it greater muscle in the market. Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told the BBC she was concerned at the impact on suppliers of the proposed tie-up. The combined group ""will have immense purchasing power, giving them an opportunity to bargain very hard with suppliers,"" she warned. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the firms should explain how they plan to merge their supply chains fairly, and reassure people that cost savings wouldn't be achieved ""simply by milking their small suppliers for all they're worth"". Sainsbury's and Asda executives said one advantage of the merger would be the opportunity to bring in ""the power of Walmart in the form of buying of general merchandise and in the form of their systems and investments"". A competition probe seems inevitable given the size of the two chains and the UK's competition watchdog,the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA),,externalsaid on Monday it was ""likely"" to review the merger. Sainsbury's and Asda have asked for the CMA investigation to be fast-tracked and hope to complete the deal by the autumn of 2019. At the weekend, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the merger risked creating ""even more concentrated local monopolies"" and said the CMA should force the companies to sell off stores if the new giant was dominant in a particular area. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said he thought there was ""a pretty good chance"" that the deal will be allowed to proceed, but the main debate would be over how many stores Sainsbury's and Asda would have to sell ""to placate the CMA"". ""Too many store disposals and the deal won't be worth doing... too few store disposals and the CMA will look toothlessâ¦ hopefully there will be a ""Goldilocks"" scenario for Sainsbury's/Asda."" Sainsbury's and Asda are both being buffeted by competition from budget supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl. On the horizon, Amazon is making initial steps into grocery deliveries. ""I think from a market share perspective, both Sainsbury's and Asda are landlocked to a certain extent. They're not really able to grow at a rapid rate,"" said Steve Dresser, director of the Grocery Insight consultancy. ""If they remain on their own it's difficult to see how they get any real growth beyond standard organic growth, which isn't necessarily going to be enough when Amazon joins the market,"" said Mr Dresser. The two chains are in many ways complementary: Sainsbury's stores are focused more in the south of the UK and target a higher-end market segment. Asda is more concentrated in the north, offering lower-cost groceries. Even after reducing prices for customers, Mike Coupe thinks synergies will generate Â£500m of extra savings, in part through taking advantage of Walmart's clout with suppliers. As for Walmart they will receive Â£3bn as well as their 42% stake in the company. But the deal also offers Walmart the option of exiting the UK market altogether in four years' time.

"People who borrow money from doorstep lenders should get the same protection as those with payday loans, a charity has argued. Citizens Advice said copying the rules that stop payday loans being rolled over time after time would stop others falling into a spiral of debt. More than 1.6 million people usehome credit loansin the UK. The City regulator is reviewing the rules about high-cost credit, including the effect of building up these loans. In January, the regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - said it was concerned that some people could end up paying a much higher interest rate after merging old and new doorstep loans. Now they have confirmed to the BBC that ""doorstep lending is one of the areas of high cost credit we have identified as having potential issues"". ""As we made clear in January, we have concerns about the impact on consumers who take out repeat loans,"" it added. ""We intend to publish our conclusions in May and take action where we find harm. ""In the meantime we expect all lenders to check loans are affordable for customers rather than just assessing the credit risk to themselves."" Citizens Advice said it had helped 30,000 people with doorstep loan debt in the last year. Only one third of them had a job, it said, and half were in arrears on council tax - a priority bill. Cases included a woman with severe learning difficulties who had debts from a doorstep lender of Â£3,016, and who had received an offer of more loans despite the lender being told by a social worker that that an appropriate adult needed to be present for financial decisions. The charity wants to see new rules for the sector that would follow the regulations covering payday loans, so the number of rollover loans would be limited and borrowers would never pay more than twice the amount that they borrowed. The conclusions of the FCA review into high-cost credit will be published in May. The FCA took over regulation of consumer credit four years ago, and since then has introduced new rules for the payday sector and credit card market.

"Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe The proposed mega merger between Asda and Sainsbury begs five very important questions for the boss of Sainsbury's. They are CEO's Mike Coupe's to answer because Asda has been doing poorly and its owner Walmart will be glad to be shot of it. Sainsbury's owners will be much more sceptical. The biggest questions arise around the stated intent to run both brands side by side with few if any store closures. Sainsbury's is due to make an announcement to the stock market on Monday, shedding more light on the deal. Both say this is going to be good for customers. Does that mean Sainsbury's customers (who currently pay a little bit more for their groceries) will pay the same prices as Asda customers? One of the big ""synergies"" will be combined and greater buying power. Will they buy at one price for both stores and sell according to different price lists? When you have stores side by side won't Sainsbury's shoppers feel ripped off if they are paying more for going through a different door? Are they really guaranteeing no store closures? If they have two large stores in the same town do they really need the combined square footage when the likes of Tesco and others are trying to reduce the amount of retail space? Even if we take them at face value and no stores close - another big cost saving is presumably the logistics and depots they use to stock their stores and fulfil online orders. It strains credulity to imagine this is an area where consolidation and cuts will not occur. Presumably there will be no need for two head office operations. Although Sainsbury's seems to have integrated the Argos brand pretty well, that was a lot easier as Argos is a different category - non-food. Can you run two fascias side by side without blurring the brand identity of both - thereby confusing and potentially losing customers? Even if the competition authorities allow it to go ahead - what about the shareholders? Most of the ones I've spoken to have pretty big reservations.

"Michael Sheen hopes the alliance can drive change to regulation The actor Michael Sheen has founded a new initiative aimed at providing ""fairer alternatives"" to mainstream rent-to-own firms and payday lenders. The End High Cost Credit Alliance aims to create a ""social movement"" that brings together 50 partners. It will invest in not-for-profit companies to ""compete and win against"" high-cost credit providers. The Consumer Finance Association, which represents payday lenders, said they had ""strong affordability rules"". Sheen told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmethe alliance will tackle ""those who unfairly target the most vulnerable in society"". The actor - who has appeared in films including Frost/Nixon and The Queen - describes himself as an activist and has taken on roles as a Unicef ambassador and patron of Social Enterprise UK. Sheen said the initiative would focus on helping those who are excluded from mainstream credit, and see high-cost credit as the most attractive alternative. In 2016, the Victoria Derbyshire programme'sinvestigation into rent-to-own retailer BrightHouse, conducted by former Labour leader Ed Miliband, highlighted the example of a Â£358 washing machine that ended up costing more than Â£1,000. In 2015, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed a cap on payday loan costs following criticism of lenders. But the actor said he also wanted to see ""a shift in the whole sector, that benefits both the borrowers and the lenders"". The alliance will invest in not-for-profit organisations that provide ""fairer alternatives"" for low-income families, helping improve public awareness of their work and enable them to compete with ""high-cost credit competitors"". In bringing together more than 50 voluntary members, including representatives of think tanks, public health bodies and credit experts, it also hopes to create a ""social movement"" that leads to change. It aims to drive change to policy and regulation, and help improve financial education for young people. Sheen said he had been focused on the alliance for a couple of years, and had used his own money to finance it after hearing a ""pattern emerging"" - through his work with support organisations and charities - of the difficulties those using high-cost credit providers had faced. The Financial Conduct Authority said it engaged with ""a wide variety of groups, such as the End High Cost Alliance, to ensure credit is sensibly available to those with lower incomes and means. We want to see more options and the emergence of 'mid-cost credit'."" The CFA said it was clearly not the case ""that every payday loan user was vulnerable"". It added that there were now ""protections in place, such as a price cap and strong affordability rules that will reduce the chances of [customers] getting into trouble"". A spokesman for BrightHouse said: ""We are proud to offer a service to people with low incomes and poor credit histories; the people others are unwilling to serve. For example, we can fit a brand new washing machine into a customer's home for just Â£3 a week.""

"Labour said the policy could help 2.7 million people who are stuck with permanent overdrafts Labour says it would cap the total amount anyone could pay in bank overdraft fees or interest repayments. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he wanted to end the ""national scandal"" of low paid families trapped in debt. Labour said the policy could help 2.7 million people who are stuck with permanent overdrafts, saving them the equivalent of Â£86 each per year. The Treasury said it had already tightened the rules to protect debtors and cracked down on payday loans. Call for stricter rules on doorstep loans Sheen tackles high cost of rent-to-own Mr McDonnell said: ""Too many families are having to rely on borrowing just to get to the end of the month, and are facing huge costs from our High Street banks. ""The national scandal of the low paid debt trap has to end. More needs to be done to level the playing field and bring greater fairness in consumer finance."" Actor and campaigner Michael Sheen is supporting the proposal According to Labour, people stuck with permanent overdrafts use them more than 85% of the time while incurring higher charges. The party also said overdraft charges could be up to four times higher than the equivalent borrowing from payday lending. Under the policy, regulators would impose a limit of Â£24 per month per Â£100 borrowed on any interest, fees and charges related to an overdraft. That would be equivalent to the current cap on payday loan interest charges. The proposal was welcomed by the actor and founder of the campaign group End High Cost Credit Alliance, Michael Sheen. Payday lenders like Wonga have faced tougher rules since 2015 The Frost/Nixon star, who is a Labour supporter, said: ""High cost credit is more than just pay day loans, rent to own businesses or doorstep lending. ""Millions of people across the UK are also trapped in their overdrafts by extortionate rates of interest charged by reputable high street banks."" Banks say they have introduced a number of measures to help customers avoid going into their overdrafts and minimise any charges when they do. These include accounts with ""overdraft buffers"", in which no overdraft fees are charged, and alerts for customers who are about to enter into an unarranged overdraft. The government has also taken steps to help vulnerable people in debt. Last year it committed to introducing a six-week grace period in which debtors would be protected from enforcement proceedings and mounting interest charges. And in 2015, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed a cap on payday loan costs following criticism of lenders. The FCA has also raised concerns about overdrafts and plans to consult on possible remedies later this year. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We know that families can struggle with debt. That is why we have tightened the rules to ensure that money can only be lent to people who can afford to repay. ""We have also cracked down on payday loans, saving borrowers over Â£150m a year, and are introducing an energy cap to help people with household bills.""

"Pictures shared on social media appear to show James White and Alexis Guesto tied up and covered in paint Police say they have had to ""redirect resources towards investigating a serious assault"" after two wanted men were ""kicked and beaten with iron bars,"" in County Armagh . They were then ""further assaulted"" and ""covered in paint"". James White and Alexis Guesto were taken back into custody after they were foundtied up on a bench in Mullaghbawn. They were wanted for offences including breach of licence and warrants. Images shared on social media on Saturday appear to show them tied up and covered in paint. Police said that due to the ""violent actions of a small number of people, we have had to redirect resources and efforts towards investigating a serious assault."" The police said both men had sustained injuries and have been taken to hospital for treatment. One of the men has been arrested and the other remains in hospital. Police said both men will appear in court at the ""earliest opportunity in relation to the matters for which they were being sought"". Police had said Alexis Guesto and James White were wanted for a range of offences Det Ch Insp Jill Duffie, from the PSNI's Public Protection Branch, said:  ""Throughout yesterday as our search for the two men was ongoing, I was pleased with the response from the local community and the assistance being provided to police. ""Unfortunately, now, due to the violent actions of a small number of people, we have had to redirect resources and efforts towards investigating a serious assault. ""There is no excuse for individuals taking the law into their own hands nor for the violent scenes that we witnessed last night."" Earlier on Saturday, the police said it was believed the two men had travelled to Northern Ireland from the Republic. There have been a number of reported sightings of them in south Armagh and Newry, County Down. On Thursday afternoon, police seized a car from a car park on the Chancellors Road in Mullaghbawn after a member of the public expressed concern. SDLP Newry and Armagh MLA Justin McNulty said the incident was ""disgraceful"". ""It is important that the two wanted men can now be brought before the courts so that they can be subjected to the judicial process,"" he said. ""It is disgraceful however that the police now also have to deal with an assault case. ""There can be no middle man in the criminal justice system."" Mr McNulty encouraged anyone with information on criminality to go to the police. ""Those who believe they are unable to do so can contact Crimestoppers anonymously. ""No one is above the law,"" he added.

"This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Windrush Day has been held on 22 June since 2018, to celebrate the contribution Caribbean migrants and their families have made to the UK. HMT Empire Windrush docked in Tilbury, Essex, in 1948, bringing hundreds of passengers from the Caribbean to the UK. In 2018, it emerged that the government had not properly recorded the details of people granted permission to stay in the UK, and many were wrongly mistreated. HMT Empire Windrush became a symbol of a wider mass-migration movement. People in the Caribbean were invited to the UK to help rebuild post-war Britain. According to the National Archives,which holds the ship's passenger list,,externalthere were 1,027 people on board. More than 800 gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean. Several hundred passengers were Jamaican, but others arrived from islands including Trinidad, St Lucia, Grenada and Barbados. These travellers - and those on other ships which came to the UK until 1971 - became known as the Windrush generation. Many had served in the British armed forces in World War Two. In 1948, the British Nationality Act gave people from colonies the right to live and work in Britain. The government needed workers to help fill post-war labour shortages and rebuild the economy. Caribbean countries were also struggling economically, and job vacancies in the UK offered an opportunity. Many of those who came became manual workers, drivers, cleaners, and nurses in the newly established NHS. In Pictures: The Windrush generation Rare Windrush images on display in art trail This video can not be played What was life like for first-generation Windrush migrants? Commemoration events have been held on 22 June every year since 2018. In 2023, the 75th anniversary of the arrival of HMT Windrush was marked witha series of concerts, exhibitions and seminars across the country.,external King Charles, who held a reception at Buckingham Palace to mark the anniversary, hailed the Windrush generation's ""profound and permanent contribution to British life"". 'We have come a long way': Windrush generation on 75th anniversary New 50p coin to mark Windrush anniversary released Poet Benjamin Zephaniah to get posthumous honour on Windrush Day It is unclear how many people from the Windrush generation are still in the UK, but the number is thought to be in the thousands. They are among more than 500,000 UK residents who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971, according to University of Oxford estimates. The 1971 Immigration Act gave Commonwealth citizens living in the UK indefinite leave to remain - the permanent right to live and work in the UK. This included the Windrush generation, but also people from other former British colonies in South Asia and Africa. This video can not be played ""My whole life sunk down to my feet"" - Windrush migrant Michael Braithwaite However, in April 2018, it emerged that the UK Home Office had kept no records of those granted permission to stay, and had not issued the paperwork they needed to confirm their status. It had also destroyed landing cards belonging to Windrush migrants, in 2010. Those affected were unable to prove they were in the country legally and were prevented from accessing healthcare, work and housing. Manywere also threatened with deportation. A review of historical cases also found that at least 83 people who had arrived before 1973 had been wrongly deported.

The inquiry, whichreported in March 2020,,externalsaid that the scandal was both ""foreseeable and avoidable"", and criticised ""a culture of disbelief and carelessness"" in the Home Office. The inquiry made 30 recommendations, including: a full Home Office review of the UK's ""hostile environment"" immigration policy appointing a migrants' commissioner establishing a race advisory board Inquiry author Wendy Williamswarned there was a ""grave risk""of similar problems happening again without government action. Then-Home Secretary Priti Patel accepted the recommendations in full. Then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced plans to scrap three recommendations from Wendy Williams's review But in January 2023, then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced the Home office wasdropping three of the commitments: to appoint a migrants' commissioner responsible for ""speaking up for migrants and those affected by the system directly or indirectly"" to give the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration new powers to hold events with people affected to ""listen and reflect on their stories"" Ms Williams criticised the decision, saying the proposals would have raised the ""confidence of the Windrush community"". TheWindrush Compensation Scheme,externalwas established in April 2019, and about 15,000 people were thought to be eligible. But the scheme has been consistently criticised for processing delays, low offers, and unfair rejections reversed on appeal. In 2021, the Home Affairs Committee of MPsfound the scheme had itself become a further trauma for those eligible.It said many of those affected were ""still too fearful of the Home Office to apply"". In April 2023, Human Rights Watchsaid the scheme was ""failing"" victims,and repeated calls for it to be removed from the Home Office's control. In response, the Home Office said it was ""committed to righting the wrongs of Windrush"". The government insisted it would ensure ""similar injustices can never be repeated and [was] creating a Home Office worthy of every community it serves"".

"T-Mobile boss John Legere broke the news of deal on Twitter. US telecoms giant T-Mobile has agreed to buy its rival Sprint in a $26bn (Â£18.9bn) deal. The merger of America's third and fourth largest mobile carriers is designed to create a more competitive firm with about 130 million customers. However, the deal is expected to attract regulatory scrutiny over its potential impact on customer prices. T-Mobile boss John Legere said the new firm would spend $40bn on building a 5G mobile network in the next three years. ""Together, we will build the highest-capacity mobile network in US history!! I'm talking 30X more capacity than T-Mobile today!!"" he said in one of a series of Tweets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. It comes after months of negotiations between T-Mobile's controlling shareholder, Deutsche Telekom, and Japan's SoftBank, which controls Sprint. Under the deal, Deutsche Telekom will own 42% of the combined company and control its board. Softbank will hold a 27% stake. Mr Legere will lead the new firm which will take the T-Mobile name and have a market value of $146bn. Analysts say the combined company will have more clout to compete with the first and second biggest US telecoms firms, Verizon and AT&T, each of which have more than 100 million subscribers. In particular, they say it will be better positioned in the race to provide America with next generation 5G mobile broadband technology. They also believe that, without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to upgrade its network. Sprint and T-Mobile had been in talks about a potential tie-up since 2014, when the Obama administration scuppered a previous merger attempt over competition concerns. Under the Trump administration, regulators have continued to challenge deals they believe could push up prices and are likely to scrutinise this latest takeover closely. Sprint is the fourth largest mobile broadband provider in the US The US Justice Department is currently trying to block AT&T's deal to buy US media giant Time Warner for $85bn, warning that ""consumers all across America will be worse off"" if it goes ahead. It has also allegedly opened a probe into claims of co-ordination by AT&T, Verizon and a telecoms standards body to hinder consumers from easily switching provider, Reuters reported earlier in April. In a statement, Mr Legere said the merger between Sprint and T-Mobile would lower prices and help the US accelerate its development of 5G, amid fierce competition from China. He also said it would create tens of thousands of jobs in rural America - factors analysts say could help sway officials in the Trump administration. ""This combination will create a fierce competitor with the network scale to deliver more for consumers and businesses in the form of lower prices, more innovation, and a second-to-none network experience - and do it all so much faster than either company could on its own,"" Mr Legere said.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd faced criticism over the existence of Home Office removals targets and her knowledge of them Amber Rudd's resignation over the question of whether she knew about targets to remove illegal immigrants has shown once again that being home secretary remains one of the most high-risk jobs in government. Although Theresa May lasted more than six years in the job and used it as a springboard to Downing Street, her successor joins a long list of others, including David Blunkett, Jacqui Smith and Charles Clarke, who ended up paying the price for personal or administrative failings with their jobs. Before the full extent of the Windrush controversy became clear, shining an unflattering light on the workings and culture of her department and Ms Rudd's own command of her brief, the 54-year-old had been regarded as one of the Conservatives' rising stars. Her views on Europe - she is one of the cabinet's most pro-European voices and her brother Roland helped run the Remain campaign - were not to everyone's tastes within the party but despite this she was seen as being capable, tough and - until recent weeks - unflappable. In her early years in Parliament after being elected in 2010, she was regarded as being a protege of George Osborne on the liberal-modernising wing of the party, a member of the so-called ""friends of George"". Ms Rudd at a constituency event in 2011 - she scraped home in last year's election despite a significant swing to Labour She was promoted rapidly under David Cameron, working for a while in the Treasury and becoming energy and climate change secretary after the Conservatives' surprise victory in the 2015 general election. Her growing reputation was further enhanced during the 2016 Brexit referendum. She was one of the star performers during the main TV debate - caustically taking Boris Johnson to task and suggesting he was ""not the kind of man that you would want to drive you home at the end of the evening"". She not only survived Theresa May's clearout of Cameron/Osborne supporters after she became PM but was rewarded with the plum job of home secretary, stepping into her boss's shoes. Her first year in the Home Office went smoothly enough although dealing with the succession of terror attacks that took place during 2017 was a harrowing experience. The 54-year old was appointed home secretary in July 2016 She has been MP for Hastings and Rye in East Sussex since 2010 She won the seat in 2017 by just 346 votes She was a Remain supporter in 2016 referendum - her brother helped fund campaign She was married for five years to the late journalist and writer AA Gill An Edinburgh University graduate, she previously worked in banking and recruitment She was credited as a consultant on the 1994 hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral Ms Rudd earned plenty of plaudits after deputising for Mrs May in the 2017 general election leadership debate, despite her father Tony - a stockbroker and businessman - having died a few days before. She used up one of her political lives on election night when it looked, for several hours, as if she had lost her Hastings and Rye seat and ended up only scraping home by 346 votes. This video can not be played Amber Rudd and Jeremy Corbyn in the General election 2017 debate She remained in the Home Office after the election and with questions over Mrs May's future swirling around, she was talked of as a potential successor who could appeal to both wings of the party. But in the face of daily revelations about the plight of Windrush migrants and their families, Ms Rudd appeared slow to respond and, despite numerous apologies, to appreciate the scale and significance of the crisis.

"Labour MP David Lammy has been a vocal critic of the government over the Windrush scandal More than 200 MPs have signed a letter to the prime minister calling for government promises to Windrush migrants to be written into law. The letter, co-ordinated by Labour MP David Lammy, said concerns over compensation, housing and legal rights had not been settled. The Home Office said Amber Rudd would speak in Parliament on Monday. The home secretary is accused in the letter of making up immigration policy ""on the hoof"" to defuse the situation. The letter, addressed to Theresa May, said any promises made by the government in response to the Windrush crisis should be enshrined in law ""without delay"". It continued: ""We are calling on you to do this by bringing a statutory instrument before Parliament to ensure that the measures are implemented as quickly as possible."" Windrush: Who exactly was on board? Who are the Windrush generation? 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories The signatories are predominantly Labour MPs but politicians from the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party - as well as one Conservative - also feature. The Windrush row erupted after it emerged some migrants from Commonwealth Caribbean countries who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s, and their relatives, had been declared illegal immigrants. Some of the Windrush generation have been threatened with deportation, lost their jobs, or been refused access to medical treatment. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK In a separate letter, Labour MP and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott has called for a full inquiry into whether the home secretary had breached the ministerial code over government immigration removal targets. Ms Abbott said Ms Rudd's explanations as to why she had told MPs there were no such targets, when in fact there were, ""stretch credulity to the limit"". Downing Street has said there is no need for an investigation because ministerial code only requires a resignation if a minister knowingly misleads parliament - a charge the home secretary denies. Ms Rudd tweeted on Friday nightadmitting she had been copied in on a memo that mentioned migrant deportation targets but insisted that she had not actually read it. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, meanwhile, has appealed to ethnic minority voters not to abandon the Tories in this week's local elections over the Windrush scandal. Mr Javid, whose parents emigrated from Pakistan in the 1960s, said his first reaction when he heard people were being wrongly threatened with deportation was that it could have been his family. However,in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph,external, he said the government was determined to ""put things right"" and he urged ethnic minority voters to look at the ""bigger picture"" when it came to Thursday's vote.

"Was Amber Rudd's resignation inevitable? Certainly there has been a mismatch between what she told MPs last week and the evidence that emerged. In a different time, and with a minister with enemies, she'd most likely have been out on Friday. This time the Tory party was fighting hard to keep her. But beyond the mess-ups, perhaps part of the issue was also that the home secretary was not necessarily in tune with her predecessor's attitude on immigration - the Home Office's most politically charged brief. It is hard to understand that she wasn't aware of a widespread culture of targets. But no one is suggesting that she deliberately misled MPs last week. So, it is pertinent to ask how much focus she gave to the immigration brief at the Home Office, or whether she was happy to delegate to trusted colleagues and focus on other areas. Those who have worked at junior levels in the Home Office as ministers sometimes joke that they'd never want the big job given how complicated it is. Home secretaries, however tightly they grip everything, can never be sure they won't trip up. But don't forget Ms Rudd's persona was also vital in the delicate Brexit balance of the cabinet. She was a Remainer, and trusted by the PM. A grown up, who was as open as politically possible about the case she would make for the softer end of Brexit privately, hinting at it in public too. Amber Rudd resigns: Live reaction What went wrong for Amber Rudd? Amber Rudd's resignation letter in full Given the fraught politics of the moment, replacing her is not just a matter of promoting a minister who looks competent, but making an appointment that does not tear the already strained Tory truce. And beyond all that, Ms Rudd's departure gives Theresa May not one, but several new potential headaches. It gives an impression of shaky government days before the local elections. Ms Rudd could give the Tory rebel Remainers more authority on the backbenches. And continuing questions about the Windrush fiasco may now be aimed more sharply at the prime minister herself. There are good reasons why Number 10 initially tried to resist this resignation. The pressure on the individual may be gone, but the wider impact may not yet have begun. Stretching to close one gap opens another. Ms Rudd was an important figure in cabinet, not just because she occupied one of the great offices of state, but because she was widely liked inside her party, at the more modern end of the Tory spectrum and a vigorous Remainer whose voice gave ballast to that side of the argument at the top table. The decision to go was - I'm told - entirely hers. Both Number 10 and her other political friends in government tried to persuade her to stay, it's said. It was her judgement that it was untenable to stay it's suggested, because she couldn't be sure that nothing else would emerge from the Home Office filing cabinets that might have made staying on in the job even more awkward than it already was.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd faced criticism over the existence of Home Office removals targets and her knowledge of them Amber Rudd's resignation over the question of whether she knew about targets to remove illegal immigrants has shown once again that being home secretary remains one of the most high-risk jobs in government. Although Theresa May lasted more than six years in the job and used it as a springboard to Downing Street, her successor joins a long list of others, including David Blunkett, Jacqui Smith and Charles Clarke, who ended up paying the price for personal or administrative failings with their jobs. Before the full extent of the Windrush controversy became clear, shining an unflattering light on the workings and culture of her department and Ms Rudd's own command of her brief, the 54-year-old had been regarded as one of the Conservatives' rising stars. Her views on Europe - she is one of the cabinet's most pro-European voices and her brother Roland helped run the Remain campaign - were not to everyone's tastes within the party but despite this she was seen as being capable, tough and - until recent weeks - unflappable. In her early years in Parliament after being elected in 2010, she was regarded as being a protege of George Osborne on the liberal-modernising wing of the party, a member of the so-called ""friends of George"". Ms Rudd at a constituency event in 2011 - she scraped home in last year's election despite a significant swing to Labour She was promoted rapidly under David Cameron, working for a while in the Treasury and becoming energy and climate change secretary after the Conservatives' surprise victory in the 2015 general election. Her growing reputation was further enhanced during the 2016 Brexit referendum. She was one of the star performers during the main TV debate - caustically taking Boris Johnson to task and suggesting he was ""not the kind of man that you would want to drive you home at the end of the evening"". She not only survived Theresa May's clearout of Cameron/Osborne supporters after she became PM but was rewarded with the plum job of home secretary, stepping into her boss's shoes. Her first year in the Home Office went smoothly enough although dealing with the succession of terror attacks that took place during 2017 was a harrowing experience. The 54-year old was appointed home secretary in July 2016 She has been MP for Hastings and Rye in East Sussex since 2010 She won the seat in 2017 by just 346 votes She was a Remain supporter in 2016 referendum - her brother helped fund campaign She was married for five years to the late journalist and writer AA Gill An Edinburgh University graduate, she previously worked in banking and recruitment She was credited as a consultant on the 1994 hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral Ms Rudd earned plenty of plaudits after deputising for Mrs May in the 2017 general election leadership debate, despite her father Tony - a stockbroker and businessman - having died a few days before. She used up one of her political lives on election night when it looked, for several hours, as if she had lost her Hastings and Rye seat and ended up only scraping home by 346 votes. This video can not be played Amber Rudd and Jeremy Corbyn in the General election 2017 debate She remained in the Home Office after the election and with questions over Mrs May's future swirling around, she was talked of as a potential successor who could appeal to both wings of the party. But in the face of daily revelations about the plight of Windrush migrants and their families, Ms Rudd appeared slow to respond and, despite numerous apologies, to appreciate the scale and significance of the crisis. Previously regarded as having more liberal views on immigration than her predecessor, she was soon accused of making the government's ""hostile environment"" policy for illegal immigrants even tougher, with disastrous repercussions for thousands of people in the country legally.

"Amber Rudd has resigned as home secretary after a period of political pressure stemming from her handling of the Windrush scandal. Here is the resignation letter she sent to Prime Minister Theresa May. Mrs May's response is also published in full below. Dear Prime Minister, It is with great regret that I am resigning as home secretary. I feel it is necessary to do so because I inadvertently misled the Home Affairs Select Committee over targets for removal of illegal immigrants during their questions on Windrush. Since appearing before the select committee, I have reviewed the advice I was given on this issue and become aware of information provided to my office which makes mention of targets. I should have been aware of this, and I take full responsibility for the fact that I was not. The Windrush scandal has rightly shone a light on an important issue for our country. As so often, the instincts of the British people are right. They want people who have a right to live here to be treated fairly and humanely, which has sometimes not been the case. But they also want the government to remove those who don't have the right to be here. I had hoped in coming months to devise a policy that would allow the government to meet both these vital objectives - including bringing forward urgent legislation to ensure the rights of the Windrush generation are protected. The task force is working well, the residence cards are being issued well within the two weeks promised, and the design of the compensation scheme is making good progress. The Home Office is one of the great offices of state and its job is to keep people safe. It comes with the responsibility to fight terrorism, support and challenge the police and protect people against the abuse, as well as manage migration. It has been a great privilege to serve as your home secretary. I have seen first-hand the second to none commitment and bravery of our police, fire and intelligence services, they truly are the best in the world and we should rightly be extremely proud of them. I have been particularly pleased that we were able to set up the first Global Internet Forum for Counter Terrorism which has led the way with encouraging social media sites to go further and faster in taking down radicalising and terrorist material, which plays such a dangerous part in increasing extremism. Setting out new laws to tackle the scourge of knife crime and acid attacks and helping to steer our young people away from a life of crime and violence by providing them with credible alternatives have been particularly important to me. Opportunities to work on issues that safeguard the vulnerable, champions women and make a lasting impact on people's lives particularly stand out for me. New policies to fight domestic violence and abuse against women are out to consultation, and will lead this country to taking a new approach. Helping to bring thousands of refugees, including child refugees from both Calais and the Middle East region, and meeting some of the families who fled the terrible situation in Syria and have now been given a chance to rebuild their lives here in the UK in safety and security is something we can be proud of. It has been an honour to work on a new security treaty with the EU as part of our new partnership going forward and to participate in your Brexit sub-committee helping to ensure that we have the best possible EU deal for our economy, businesses, jobs and people across the UK. The new Economic Crime Centre that i launched with the first use of unexplained wealth orders will be important to the confidence of London as a financial centre. I will continue to support the Home Office ministerial team whenever possible on all these important subjects, supporting the government from the back benches and continuing to work hard for my constituents of Hastings and Rye. Best wishes, Amber Rudd Here is the prime minister's response: Dear Amber, Thank you for your letter of this evening tendering your resignation as home secretary. I was very sorry to receive it, but understand your reasons for doing so. When you addressed the House of Commons and the Home Affairs Select Committee last week on the issue of illegal immigration, you answered the questions put to you in good faith. People who have entered the United Kingdom illegally or overstayed here should expect to face the full force of the law and know that they will be removed if they will not leave this country voluntarily. Just as importantly, people who have come here legally and enriched the life of our country should not expect the state unreasonably to challenge their presence here; rather, it should help them prove their right to continue living here and contributing to the life of our nation. Under your tenure, the Home Office has been working to enforce a firm but fair immigration policy - working to increase the number of illegal migrants we remove, while ensuring that we continue to recognise the huge contribution of everyone who has come to the UK legally, and remain open to the brightest and best from across the globe. When you spoke in the House of Commons, you said that you had not agreed specific removal targets, but that the Home Office's Immigration Enforcement command had been using local targets for internal performance management. You also said that you were not aware that those operational targets had been set. I understand why, now that you have had chance to review the advice that you have received on this issue, you have made the decision you have made and taken responsibility for inadvertently misleading the Home Affairs Select Committee. I am very sorry to see you leaving the Home Office, but you should take great pride in what you have achieved there - working with internet service providers to set up the first Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism and take extremist and terrorist content offline; countering the cyber threat to British families and businesses; standing up for the victims of crime, abuse and domestic violence; offering shelter to refugees from Syria and elsewhere; and advancing the cause of equality as minister for women and equalities. This comes on top of the considerable contribution you have made to Government since 2012 - first as a whip, then as minister and subsequently secretary of state at the department for energy and climate change - as well as the devoted service you have always given, and will continue to give, to your constituents in Hastings and Rye. As a former home secretary myself, I appreciate the particular demands of that great office of state. You should take great pride in the way you have led the Home Office and its dedicated public servants through a number of serious challenges, including five terrorist incidents and other complex national events. You have done so with great integrity, compassion, and selflessness - notwithstanding the personal and political challenges you have faced during this period. I know that you have a great contribution still to make to national life, and look forward to seeing you do so.

"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006 and every time it has used the Punggye-ri test site. Situated in mountainous terrain in the north-east of the country, it is thought to be the North's main nuclear facility and the only active nuclear testing site in the world. But scientists believe the site has partially collapsed and may be unusable. Much of what we know about it is gleaned from satellite imagery and tracking the movement of equipment at the location. The nuclear tests have taken place in a system of tunnels dug below Mount Mantap, near the Punggye-ri site. North Korea watchers study the details of the excavation of these tunnels to get clues on whether the country is preparing for another nuclear test. Ahead of its most recent nuclear test on 3 September 2017, some had pointed to satellite imagery from August, which showed that the site was in a standby state - indicating readiness for a test. North Korea hails 'perfect' H-bomb test The aftershocks of North Korea's nuclear test 'Tunnel collapse' at nuclear site may provide clues Earlier in the year more tunnelling or excavation work had been detected and unidentified equipment had been placed outside one of the tunnels. The test devices are buried deep at the end of the tunnels, which end in a hook. The tunnel gets backfilled to prevent radioactive leakage and then the device is detonated. Scientists say part of the site collapsedeight and a half minutes after the test in September. It was a ""near-vertical on-site collapse towards the nuclear test centre"", Chinese researchers reported. The US Geological Survey recorded a second seismic event about eight minutes after the test, which it assessed as a ""collapse"" of the cavity. Two aftershocks were detected as late as December, prompting concerns about the stability of the surrounding mountains. We know more about Chinese cities and towns along the border with North Korea than we do about populations that might be closer to the test site inside North Korea. People in several Chinese border cities reported feeling the tremors from the seismic activity at the time of the test. School children ran out into the open in the city of Yanji, which is 10km (6.25 miles) from the border, when they felt the shaking, Global Times reported. Very close to the site is Punngye-ri village and about 80km away is the North Korean city of Chongjin, but it is not known if these towns were evacuated or warned in any way. North Korea claimed that no radiation leaked when it conducted its latest test. China's Nuclear Safety Administration and South Korea's Nuclear Safety and Security Commission do conduct emergency monitoring for radiation immediately after the tests. Experts at the analysis group 38North, who closely track the North's nuclear activities, said that radionuclides, products of the nuclear reactions that are released into the atmosphere, were detected and traced back to a previous nuclear test, in February 2013. They also pointed to the second seismic event. Minutes after the initial seismic event was picked up by sensors when the test occurred, there was another smaller one with a magnitude of 4.6. After previous tests authorities have usually reported very small amounts of radioactive particles or gases in neighbouring countries, although there is no way to test for the amounts inside North Korea.

"Only a small patch of yellow grass is seen where the sapling was planted A tree gifted to President Donald Trump by French President Emmanuel Macron has disappeared from the White House lawn. The pair planted the sapling, taken from the site of a World War One battle in north-east France, last week. Mr Macron said the tree would be a reminder of ""these ties that bind us"". But a Reuters photographer on Saturday took a shot of only a yellow patch of grass where the tree once stood. The French ambassador to the US later tweeted the sapling was in quarantine.

Trump and Macron's most touching moments The tree, a European sessile oak, came from the site of the Battle of Belleau Wood, which took place in the summer of 1918. Nearly 2,000 US soldiers died in the battle north-east of Paris. Yet only four days after it was planted, the sapling has disappeared. The two men helped shovel earth onto the tree on the White House South Lawn With no official reason given for the sapling mystery, speculation began online about the tree's fate. French radio networkFranceinfo quotes gardening site gerbaud.com,external, which says this type of oak is better planted in autumn, giving it time to grow deep roots ""to face the drought of the following summer"". ""The tree may be back in October,"" Franceinfo speculates. Later, French Ambassador Gerard Araud said the sapling had been placed in quarantine. Allow Twitter content?

"The heart was on display in Christ Church Cathedral when it was stolen in 2012 The 800-year-old heart of an Irish saint has been recovered six years after it was stolen from a Dublin cathedral. The heart of St Laurence O'Toole was found undamaged in the city's Phoenix Park by Irish police following ""an intelligence-led investigation"". Thebizarre theft happened at Christ Church Cathedral in 2012. It is believed the thief hid overnight in the cathedral before carrying out the heart heist. The heart-taker is believed to have used cutters to prise open the iron bars protecting the wooden box holding the saint's heart. The individual then lit two peace candles on the Trinity altar in the cathedral before leaving. Speaking at the time, the dean of Christ Church, the Very Reverend Dermot Dunne, described the relic as having ""no economic value"" but that it was a ""priceless treasure that links our present foundation with its founding father"". The newly-recovered relic will be handed over to the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin Dr Michael Jackson by Asst Garda Commissioner Pat Leahy on Thursday evening. From St Laurence O'Toole's heart to the desiccated and decapitated head of St Oliver Plunkett, saintly remnants are a common feature of many Irish churches. The One True Cross relic was an object of veneration at Holycross Abbey for more than 900 years However, St Laurence is not the only saint to have been targeted in an unusual relic raid - in fact, that theft was one of three in quick succession in 2011 and 2012. A month before the theft of the heart, an ornate container usually holding a fragment of St Brigid's skull was stolen from St Brigid's Church in Killester, slightly north of Dublin. The relic was not inside having been removed so the container could be renovated. Just a few months previously, in October 2011,a relic said to be from the cross on which Christ was crucified was taken from an abbey in County Tipperary. It was returned three months later. GardaÃ­ (Irish police) officers made the critical breakthrough in the case in the last few weeks. Officers, including one who had been involved in the search for the heart from the beginning, received credible evidence in relation to the relic. It was then discovered following a surveillance and search operation in Phoenix Park. The relic will be returned to Christ Church Cathedral on Thursday evening Police have conducted fingerprint and forensic tests but no arrests have been made. St Laurence O'Toole was appointed Archbishop of Dublin in 1162 and died in Normandy in 1180. He was canonised in 1225 because of miracles said to have happened at his tomb. His heart was returned to Ireland and had been on display in Christ Church's Chapel of St Laud.

"Everton captain Phil Jagielka carried the robot on to the pitch A 14-year-old Everton fan has made history by becoming football's first ""remote"" match-day mascot - with the aid of a robot. Jack McLinden, who has multiple health conditions, experienced joining his heroes on the pitch before their game against Newcastle United on Monday. Everton captain Phil Jagielka carried the robot, which fed panoramic live images and sound back to Jack's tablet. A microphone enabled him to chat with players in the Goodison Park tunnel. The robot, called AV1, was made by Norwegian firm No Isolation and was designed to help youngsters with long-term illness battle loneliness and attend school from home. This video can not be played Jack has limited mobility but that hasn't stopped him becoming an Everton mascot The company has worked with UK charity WellChild to give Liverpool teenager Jack, who has much-reduced mobility, an unforgettable experience. Jack needs oxygen 24 hours a day which means he can never attend a match at Goodison Park, even though he lives just under two miles away. His mother Michelle Wignall said it was a ""once in a lifetime experience"" for her son. The robot fed panoramic live images and sound back to Jack McLinden's tablet Everton's head of engagement Scott McLeod said: ""We are thrilled to have had the chance to do this for Jack and we hope it has provided him with a memory he will always treasure."" Karen Dolva, chief executive and co-founder of No Isolation, said: ""For Jack, the dream of being a mascot for his favourite football club was not likely to happen given his condition.""

"You'd be forgiven for thinking the privacy emails you've been getting are all because of therecent Facebook scandal- but you'd be wrong. From Twitter to Airbnb, your favourite musicians to the football club you support - you may have noticed they've all been emailing you. The reason is because there's a new European law on its way. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was going to happen before Cambridge Analytica was in the news. Every mailing list you've signed up to, online shop you've bought from, social media website you're part of, probably all store your information. It doesn't mean they've done anything with your details that they shouldn't have. But these new rules, which replace the Data Protection Act 1998, are designed to give you, the customer, better control over who has that data. These emails are essentially telling you that they've rewritten their terms and conditions. Those long terms and conditions documents that most people click past because they are really long and full of jargon will need to be written in language that's easy to understand. You, as the customer, must also specifically 'opt in' to sharing your data and can ask for it to be removed at any time. There's lots ofinformation hereif you want to know more. That's because, just like all the other companies, Facebook has updated its documents to abide by the new law. It has also made many more changes in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But even if all this hadn't happened you'd probably still have received an email from Facebook about the new rules. Not specifically. It's worth being aware of which businesses hold information about you and all these emails will help to do that. And it does provide you with a great opportunity to remove yourself from any mailing lists that you're no longer interested in. Don't remember signing up for news about artisan cheese seven years ago? Now's a good moment to say goodbye. You may have heard of the 'right to be forgotten' and this is all about your data. Anyone can ask for their personal data to be deleted at any time, if it's no longer relevant.

"Was Amber Rudd's resignation inevitable? Certainly there has been a mismatch between what she told MPs last week and the evidence that emerged. In a different time, and with a minister with enemies, she'd most likely have been out on Friday. This time the Tory party was fighting hard to keep her. But beyond the mess-ups, perhaps part of the issue was also that the home secretary was not necessarily in tune with her predecessor's attitude on immigration - the Home Office's most politically charged brief. It is hard to understand that she wasn't aware of a widespread culture of targets. But no one is suggesting that she deliberately misled MPs last week. So, it is pertinent to ask how much focus she gave to the immigration brief at the Home Office, or whether she was happy to delegate to trusted colleagues and focus on other areas. Those who have worked at junior levels in the Home Office as ministers sometimes joke that they'd never want the big job given how complicated it is. Home secretaries, however tightly they grip everything, can never be sure they won't trip up. But don't forget Ms Rudd's persona was also vital in the delicate Brexit balance of the cabinet. She was a Remainer, and trusted by the PM. A grown up, who was as open as politically possible about the case she would make for the softer end of Brexit privately, hinting at it in public too. Amber Rudd resigns: Live reaction What went wrong for Amber Rudd? Amber Rudd's resignation letter in full Given the fraught politics of the moment, replacing her is not just a matter of promoting a minister who looks competent, but making an appointment that does not tear the already strained Tory truce. And beyond all that, Ms Rudd's departure gives Theresa May not one, but several new potential headaches. It gives an impression of shaky government days before the local elections. Ms Rudd could give the Tory rebel Remainers more authority on the backbenches. And continuing questions about the Windrush fiasco may now be aimed more sharply at the prime minister herself. There are good reasons why Number 10 initially tried to resist this resignation. The pressure on the individual may be gone, but the wider impact may not yet have begun. Stretching to close one gap opens another. Ms Rudd was an important figure in cabinet, not just because she occupied one of the great offices of state, but because she was widely liked inside her party, at the more modern end of the Tory spectrum and a vigorous Remainer whose voice gave ballast to that side of the argument at the top table. The decision to go was - I'm told - entirely hers. Both Number 10 and her other political friends in government tried to persuade her to stay, it's said. It was her judgement that it was untenable to stay it's suggested, because she couldn't be sure that nothing else would emerge from the Home Office filing cabinets that might have made staying on in the job even more awkward than it already was.
