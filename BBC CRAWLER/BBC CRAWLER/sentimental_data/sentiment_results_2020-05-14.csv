Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Dr
Donald Macaskill told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie the low pay in the care sector was a ""national scandal,"" even though they are paid the Scottish living wage. He said: ""You can get more money walking a dog in the streets of Edinburgh than you can caring for our elderly citizens."" Reagrding the Care Inspectorate's action against the Home Farm care home, Mr Macaskill said this was an ""immensely serious move"" and he called for staff and residents to be supported. On testing, he said data he has seen found 1-3% of staff had coronavirus - in line with the University of Cambridge research on frontline workers. But he said clear action plans were in place to ensure care home providers, if necessary supported by the NHS, had enough staffing to fill any gaps. Jeanette McKenna (right) featured in a popular TikTok video last month A ""hugely popular"" care home worker found dead in her home may have had coronavirus. Jeanette McKenna, 53, had worked at Whitecraigs care home in Thornliebank, East Renfrewshire for 10 years. She featured in viral TikTok video last month, in which she can be seen dancing with 102-year-old resident Percy Mann. Police found her dead in her home in Barrhead on 7 May. Her death is being treated as ""unexplained"". She had not been tested for Covid-19. The Scottish Sun,externalis reporting that Barrhead Housing Association has carried out a deep-clean of her property and encouraged its residents to seek medical help if unwell. A spokeswoman for the care home said: ""She was absolutely selfless and gave love and support to
all residents and families within her care. She will be greatly missed by
everyone at Whitecraigs."" The Scottish singing legend sends a student nurse Â£5,000 as she recovers from the virus. Giancarlo RinaldiSouth Scotland reporter, BBC news website The local authority in the Borders says more than 6,000 pupils now have iPads provided by the council as part of a project accelerated ahead of lockdown. Chief executive Tracey Logan said it put the region's secondary students in a ""unique position"". The council has also delivered hundreds of iPads to its primary teachers as part of the Inspire Learning programme. Ms Logan said she looked forward to seeing it grow further to benefit more children in the area. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Care home workers are having to choose between putting residents at risk or going without pay, the GMB union has warned. Secretary Gary Smith said staff were worried about being tested because if they return a positive result, they will be sent home on statutory sick pay. ""These are workers that cannot afford not to be working,"" he added. The union has previously warned about employment practices and low pay in private care. Care workers tend to earn the minimum wage or a little above it, and the vast majority are women, Mr Smith highlighted. He said: ""People are terrified. They're worried about killing the people that they love and look after in care homes, but they're terrified about how they're going to be able to feed their families. This was a predictable crisis in care."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Between 30-40% of workers in private care homes have coronavirus but do not display symptoms, the GMB has claimed. GMB Scotland secretary Gary Smith has said ""regular, systematic testing"" in care homes was needed. The Scottish government has rolled out testing for all staff and residents in care homes where someone has tested positive, but these have to be requested by care home operators. Mr Smith suggested there was a ""postcode lottery"" for testing, with some social care partnerships rigorously testing the whole home but others are not. He called for a ""comprehensive plan"" to be put in place which incorporates both public and private sector homes. Nicola Sturgeon used today's Scottish government briefing to outline in detail who is being tested for Covid-19 in Scotland, saying NHS testing is used for: Cheryl Pyott and Heather Findlay have been doing kind deeds for non-NHS key workers While people across the UK get ready to clap for the dedicated staff of the NHS tonight, a group of front line staff will be passing the praise on to other vital services. Two Scottish paramedics, Cheryl Pyott and Heather Findlay found it hard to accept the praise and gratitude bestowed upon them every Thursday and instead decided to pay it forward to the non-NHS key workers who are also going above and beyond during the pandemic. The pair, along with colleague Paul McNab, started a group called NHS Helping Heroes to raise cash to reward shop staff,  
council workers and carers for their hard work. They have been dropping off surprise packages of treats, cards and messages of thanks. And they set up a 5k-a-day in May challenge raising Â£5,000 for five charities: Marie Curie cancer care, Sepsis Research - FEAT, Young Minds, Rainbow Trust children's charity and MND Scotland. Garden centres and recycling centres will open in Northern Ireland next week Garden centres and recycling centres in Northern Ireland can reopen from next Monday as part of the first steps to ease lockdown, Arlene Foster has said. On Tuesday, the executive publisheda five-phase blueprint for lifting restrictionsbut it did not include a timeframe. The first minister said updated medical advice meant the executive could now approve the ""tentative first steps"". Marriage ceremonies where a person is terminally ill will also be allowed. Staff at a Glasgow care home hosted a lockdown birthday party for one Scotland's oldest women - complete with a DJ and a piper. Ellen Gardner turned 107 on Wednesday but the restrictions did not spoil her celebrations. Son Ronnie and his wife Liz were able to see her open her presents from a safe distance in the garden of Orchard Grove Care Home in Toryglen. He said: ""She seems to be keeping remarkably well and is in good health for her age."" Glasgow's Lord Provost, Councillor Philip Braat, also congratulated the great grandmother. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Thousands of frontline NHS staff may unwittingly be treating hospital patients while infected with coronavirus,according to research,external. The University of Cambridge found 3% of hospital workers tested positive for Covid-19 despite reporting fit for duty. Professor Stephen Baker explains they were asymptomatic and this suggests there should probably be more testing of those people who will come into contact with vulnerable people. ""We should be screening people working in healthcare facilities more regularly,"" he says. The researchers tested a range of staff at hospitals, not just doctors and nurses, and positive test results were found throughout. However, the highest levels of infection were unsurprisingly found in red wards - those which treat Covid-19 patients.

Here a look at the latest headlines first: Ina Beaton celebrating her 100th birthday in 2017 The grandson of the seventh resident of a Skye care home to die after contracting Covid-19 has called her his ""best friend and guiding light"". Ina Beaton was 103 when the virus took her life at Home Farm in Portree on 11 May. Born Hectorina Matheson, she was a well known figure on the island and lived in her own home in Balmaqueen until just two years ago. Ina lived through the Great War, the Spanish flu of 1919 and moved to Glasgow during the war years where she worked as a conductress on the trams, surviving the Clydebank Blitz. Ailean Beaton thanked the staff at Home Farm care home who he said ""had been through a lot"".  She was my best friend and guiding light, and we loved each other very much. If you know me, you know how much she meant to me. But the loss is shared across the entire island, especially the north end where she was mum, granny, friend to more than just the Beatons. Her crystal memory and broad experience of life in Skye over several generations meant that she contributed to our shared knowledge of the place we're from, its language and culture. At 103 years old, her perspective is literally irreplaceable. I never could have tired of her company . She was the first person I wanted to visit any time I travelled home. Ailean Beaton, Grandson of Ina Beaton People planning so-called ""picnic protests"" against the coronavirus lockdown are being warned they'll be risking lives and breaking the law. Flyers online urge people to join mass gatherings in parks this weekend - including in Scottish cities - for picnics. This would break Scottish lockdown rules which say people should stay apart and avoid large groups. Nicola Sturgeon says people must stick to the tight constraints in Scotland and warned anyone tempted to join the protest they could ""be putting people's lives at risk. So please don't do it, we're all in this for the same reason to stop people dying unnecessarily, so don't be that person that goes and knowingly put's somebody's life on the line, it's not worth it, so please don't do it.""

"Nadine Dorries has deleted the post from her Twitter timeline Health minister Nadine Dorries and two other Tory MPs have been ordered to ""check the validity"" of social media posts before sharing them. Party bosses spoke to the MPs after they retweeted false allegations about Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. Sir Keir said he was satisfied with the actions taken by the party and the MPs, who have deleted the tweets. ""There are more important things in the world to concentrate on than a doctored video of me,"" he added. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""These tweets have rightly been deleted. ""The MPs involved have been spoken to by the Whips' Office and reminded of their responsibility to check the validity of information before they post on social media sites."" As director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013, Sir Keir was head of the Crown Prosecution Service, the body that decides whether or not to prosecute someone accused of a crime. The clip shared by Ms Dorries and fellow Tory MPs Maria Caulfield and Lucy Allan was from a 2013 Channel 5 interview with Sir Keir. In it, he appeared to be listing a series of reasons for not bringing charges against grooming gangs - including if the alleged victims had been in trouble with the police, or had been abusing drink or drugs. But the clip does not include the reporter's question, which asks Sir Keir about the incorrect use of guidelines being used by the authorities in the reporting and investigating of child sexual abuse allegations. As can be seen fromthe full exchange,external, Sir Keir was talking about how the police wrongly applied the guidelines, and how police culture had to change. Ms Dorries retweeted the edited clip and allegations against Sir Keir, from the right-wing @NJamesWorld account, with the one word comment ""revealing"". Labour MP and shadow Treasury minister Wes Streeting replied: ""What's revealing is that: 1. You've spread fake news and indulged a smear being promoted by the far right. 2. You had time to do this despite being a minister in the Department of Health during a public health crisis. ""It's either malevolence or stupidity. Probably both."" Former senior prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who was involved in bringing a number of cases, said the clip was being used to suggest Sir Keir did not take child sexual abuse seriously, when the opposite was true. ""As national lead, I can assure you that he and I put right the failings of a generation of those who should have safeguarded children. He inherited failure and left success,"" he tweeted. Earlier, a Labour Party source said: ""This is a doctored video tweeted by a far-right social media account. ""As a government minister, we hope Nadine Dorries acknowledges this and takes it down."" The edited video was viewed more than 239,000 times before the @NJamesWorld account was suspended. Ms Caulfield subsequently locked her Twitter account. while Ms Dorries and Ms Allan both deleted their tweets.

"The Guardian is closing its online dating service Guardian Soulmates because it is ""no longer viable"". The service, which has about 35,000 free members and paid subscribers, will close at the end of June, it said. The ""online dating landscape has changed dramatically"" since it launched in 2004, it added - making it a ""very little fish in a very big pool"". The 15 years since its launch has seen the growth of global dating apps such as Tinder, Hinge and Bumble. Guardian Soulmates said on its website: ""There are so many dating apps now, so many ways to meet people, which are often free and very quick. ""To keep up with the changing times we'd need to invest heavily in new technology and develop a new way of operating, and it's just not viable."" Membership to the site is free, but it has seen about a 40% fall in the number of paid subscribers - with access to advanced search and messaging options - over the past six years. Former users took to Twitter to thank the site for helping them find their partners. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"There are more than 100 potential vaccines currently in development The coronavirus ""may never go away"", the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Speaking at a briefing on Wednesday, WHO emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan warned against trying to predict when the virus would disappear. He added that even if a vaccine is found, controlling the virus will require a ""massive effort"". Almost 300,000 people worldwide are reported to have died with coronavirus, and more than 4.3m cases recorded. The UN meanwhile warned the pandemic was causing widespread distress and mental ill health - particularly in countries where there's a lack of investment in mental healthcare. The UN urged governments to make mental health considerations part of their overall response. ""It is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,"" Dr Ryan told the virtual press conference from Geneva. ""HIV has not gone away - but we have come to terms with the virus."" Dr Ryan then said he doesn't believe ""anyone can predict when this disease will disappear"". There are currentlymore than 100 potential vaccinesin development - but Dr Ryan noted there are other illnesses, such as measles, that still haven't been eliminated despite there being vaccines for them. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stressed it was still possible to control the virus, with effort. ""The trajectory is in our hands, and it's everybody's business, and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic,"" he said. WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove also told the briefing: ""We need to get into the mindset that it is going to take some time to come out of this pandemic."" LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? Their stark remarks come as several countries began to gradually ease lockdown measures, and leaders consider the issue of how and when to reopen their economies. Dr Tedros warned that there was no guaranteed way of easing restrictions without triggering a second wave of infections. ""Many countries would like to get out of the different measures,"" the WHO boss said. ""But our recommendation is still the alert at any country should be at the highest level possible."" Dr Ryan added: ""There is some magical thinking going on that lockdowns work perfectly and that unlocking lockdowns will go great. Both are fraught with dangers.""

"Eunice Mwabili works at a private hospital in the Kenyan capital A Kenyan nurse found herself being shunned and harassed after she prepared a patient for a Covid-19 test while she was on a nightshift. Eunice Mwabili says the case was handled professionally - she wore personal protective equipment while dealing with the man, who was placed in an isolation room at the hospital. By the next morning, her friends and neighbours in the capital, Nairobi, had begun to avoid her, fearing she had become infected with coronavirus. It is unclear who leaked the information that she had organised to have the patient tested - but both her name and number were leaked on social media. The patient ended up being negative, but that news never filtered out - the damage was done. She began to receive phone calls from strangers - some wanting to know where she worked - and anxious friends wanting to find out her status. ""Out there it was like I was already a Covid suspect. It really affected me. The story was even on the media. It was on TV,"" Ms Mwabili told the BBC. One neighbour shouted to her: ""I hear you are the one catching coronavirus patients."" An acquaintance told her husband that she really pitied him ""because of what has happened to your wife"". ""Do you imagine, up to today that lady friend has never bothered to call me to find out how I'm doing after that incident,"" she said. Brenda Cherotich was trolled after being interviewed about her recovery from Covid-19 She is not the only Kenyan who has faced coronavirus-linked stigma. Even some of those who have recovered have found it hard to be accepted back into their communities. Recently Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe spoke about someone who had fully recovered but was not allowed to re-join their local choir. The ministry says others have found that after leaving hospital even their families have been stigmatised. And the fear is pervasive. One man I contacted to find out about life in a quarantine centre refused to answer my questions as he feared the stigma he would be subjected to afterwards. He had been sent to the facility as a precautionary measure for 14 days after some people in the apartment block in which he lived tested positive for coronavirus - though he never contracted the virus. This video can not be played Students at this Kenyan university are voluntarily making critical medical kits. Fearing 'money heists' amid coronavirus pandemic Weddings, births and deaths in the age of Covid-19 Even before the country registered its first coronavirus infection, an MP's xenophobic Facebook message went viral in February as he called for his constituents to avoid nationals from China, where the virus originated. In April, Brenda Cherotich, among the first coronavirus patients to recover, was interviewed on television about her experiences. Officials wanted her to be the beacon of hope, to show that people could survive the illness - instead she was subjected to cyberbullying. Not long after that, a 27-year-old man in the coastal city of Mombasa was ""condemned to death by medics"" who abandoned him in his hour of need fearing he had Covid-19, his father told The People Daily newspaper. For the nurse, Ms Mwabili, it all started when Davis Muturi walked into private Catholic Church-run hospital where she worked at the end of March. The 40-year-old chef had returned from the US a week before. He had gone into self-isolation on his return, asking his family to move in with relatives as a precaution. ""I had a one-month-old baby who I had never seen, and my wife was shocked and worried that I was sending the family away and did not want to see them. But after explaining, she understood that it was for the good of the family,"" he told the BBC. After seven days, he went to the hospital for a test because he was scared by reports on social media about the virus - and he wanted to be sure he didn't have it. The East African nation has recorded a little more than 700 cases of coronavirus ""The way they put it is like everyone who came into the country was already affected,"" he said. But after he did the test his name and phone number were also leaked - with people alleging online that he had coronavirus. Even though he had tested negative, he was afraid of leaving his house - scared he would be accused of deliberately trying to infect other people. He contacted Ms Mwabili to see if she knew how their information had been shared: ""She told me that her colleagues were even asking her why she was not isolating herself. But I was not even positive."" Ms Mwabili can only point to a visit by the police on the evening of Mr Muturi's check-up. The officers had wanted information about suspected Covid-19 patients as part of an ongoing investigation into an escape from a coronavirus quarantine centre. Davis Muturi (L) has now met his new baby It seems a police memo about their visit was leaked. ""I don't know exactly how it leaked with my name and details, as well as that of my client,"" she said. The hospital has complained about the leak, and police say the matter is under investigation. Ms Mwabili says what made it more challenging was after the leak, she went down with tonsillitis for a week. ""When I resumed at work, some of my colleagues were asking, 'Did you go on quarantine?'... You can just suspect what was going through their minds."" GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? More than a month later, Ms Mwabili says she is a stronger person after going through the experience. It has made her more determined to do her job well as ""each person, whether positive or negative, needs our services"". For Mr Muturi, the moment he learnt that he was Covid-19-free, he could not wait to meet his new baby. ""That very day, they came back immediately, I couldn't let my family stay for another night away from me.""

"A healthcare professional in Italy shows a test tube with blood for a serological test that can identify who has contracted Covid-19 and has produced antibodies. A new ""fast and accurate"" coronavirus antibody test has been developed by scientists in Scotland and Switzerland. Quotien said each serological screening machine has capacity for up to 3,000 tests a day and produces results in 35 minutes with 99.8% accuracy. The blood-screening firm is now keen to hold talks with UK ministers amid interest from Europe for the machines. The Scottish government said it will explore ""all options"" as they become available. Quotient said the test can spot whether a person has developed antibodies to Covid-19. Understanding immunity could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus. Chief executive Franz Walt was managing director of the Singapore-based Roche Laboratory which developed the first diagnostic test for Sars in 2003. He said: ""We are truly proud to have developed such a fast and accurate test. This is an outstanding performance by our teams in both Edinburgh and Switzerland. ""We now want to make sure that we can help as many people as possible as quickly as possible. We have strong roots in the UK and want to speak to ministers there so MosaiQ can be used in the amazing national effort to tackle coronavirus and relaunch the economy. ""We realise ministers and the NHS are incredibly busy but are keen to talk given the strong interest from across Europe in the product."" Quotient said it has 12 screening machines available which can process up to 36,000 tests a day or 252,000 a week. A further 20 are expected to be ready by the end of the year. The firm's headquarters are in Eysins, Nyon, but its Scottish research division is based in Penicuik, Midlothian. It also has a corporate office in Edinburgh. While the UK government says it has laboratory capability to test for coronavirus immunity, it is currently being used for survey testing of existing blood samples and the capacity is not known. It is also attempting to develop home testing kits, rather than requiring analysis in laboratories, but so far these have proved unreliable. On Friday, Quotient received European regulatory approval for the MosaiQ serological screening machines. It claims they have 100% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity, meaning there is a low chance of a misread or ""false positive"". Ed Farrell, chief operating officer at the Edinburgh office, said: ""We're incredibly proud of all our work here in Scotland and Switzerland. ""We've got such a rich history here and we hope we can now make a difference at this challenging time."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Health Protection Scotland, with key partners, explore all options around new antibody tests as they become available on the market. ""The Scottish government is working closely with the UK government to ensure that everyone is able to access new antibody tests when they become available. ""It is essential that any new tests are reliable, and time is needed to undertake rigorous evaluation so that there is confidence that tests are accurate.""

"Senator Richard Burr has denied wrongdoing amid an insider trading probe The Republican chairman of the US Senate intelligence committee will step down while an insider trading inquiry is carried out. Richard Burr of North Carolina said he had decided to do so because he did not want the investigation to distract the committee from its work. Mr Burr's phone has been seized by the FBI as part of the inquiry. The senator, who denies wrongdoing, allegedly used inside information to avoid market losses from coronavirus. US senator probed for insider trading - reports Senators under fire over virus âinsider tradingâ He declined a request for comment. Mr Burr and his wife sold as much as $1.7m (Â£1.4m) of equities in February, just before markets plunged on fears of an economic crisis. It is illegal for members of Congress to trade based on non-public information gathered during their official duties. Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, as well as Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, also reportedly sold holdings before the downturn, but are not confirmed to be under investigation. Ms Feinstein said she had answered questions from the FBI regarding trades made by her husband, however. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Mr Burr had contacted him to inform of his decision to step aside temporarily. ""We agreed that this decision would be in the best interests of the committee and will be effective at the end of the day tomorrow [Friday],"" Mr McConnell said in a statement. Mr Burr said: ""The work the Intelligence Committee and its members do is too important to risk hindering in any way. I believe this step is necessary to allow the Committee to continue its essential work free of external distractions."" He turned over his mobile phone to authorities after federal agents issued and executed a search warrant at his Washington, DC, home. The justice department began investigating Mr Burr, 64, in March. Public disclosures first investigated by ProPublica show the senator sold more than 30 stocks between late January and mid-February. Some of the stocks were in sectors now devastated by the coronavirus outbreak, such as the hotel, restaurant and shipping industries.Â As chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Mr Burr receives nearly daily briefings on threats to US national security.Â He defended the transactions, saying he had ""relied solely on public news reports"" to instruct his decision to sell.Â Â This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus However, he was criticised for publicly downplaying the seriousness of the virus, even as he privately sold equities and warned a private North Carolina business group of the stark risks it posed. Mr Burr's lawyer, Alice Fisher, said in March the senator welcomed the justice department investigation because it would ""establish that his actions were appropriate"".Â ""The law is clear that any American - including a Senator - may participate in the stock market based on public information, as Senator Burr did, she said.Â The bulk of Mr Burr's sales occurred on 13 February, just before his speech to the wealthy business constituent group about the dire economic impact of the coronavirus, at a time when the Trump administration was publicly downplaying the threat. In an audio recording, obtained by US outlet National Public Radio (NPR) he also told the group to curtail their travel.Â Mr Burr has accused NPR of ""misrepresenting"" his speech.Â First elected to the Senate in 2004, he chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee when it investigated Russian election interference in the 2016 presidential election. The committee endorsed intelligence community findings that Russia had interfered on Donald Trump's behalf.

"The Premier League hopes to resume again on 12 June The government says it is ""opening the door"" for the return of professional football in England in June. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said Thursday's meeting with the Football Association, Premier League and English Football League had ""progressed plans"". He added that plans for the sport to resume should ""include widening access for fans to view live coverage"". Meanwhile, England's deputy chief medical officer said any return would be ""slow"" and ""measured"". The Premier League met on Monday to discuss ""Project Restart"" and hopes for a return to action on 12 June, with matches played behind closed doors. ""We all agreed that we will only go ahead if it is safe to do so and the health and welfare of players, coaches and staff comes first,"" said Dowden. ""It is now up to the football authorities to agree and finalise the detail of their plans, and there is combined goodwill to achieve this for their fans, the football community and the nation as a whole. ""The government and our medical experts will continue to offer guidance and support."" He added that plans to return should ""ensure finances from the game's resumption supportsÂ the wider football family"". The next meeting of Premier League clubs will take place on Monday, when top-flight players may return to initial group training under social distancing protocols. Footballers have so far been limited to individual training but Premier League bosses hope a first phase of team training, under strict guidelines and restricted to 75 minutes, can begin next week. Premier League clubs facing Â£340m TV refund even if season resumes Restrictions in place for team training under 'Project Restart' Premier League clubs confident neutral venues stance to be reversed England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said: ""There will be small, carefully measured, step-wise approaches to see what can be achieved safely. The first of those is to return safely to training, still observing social distancing. ""We will have to see how that goes before we can even think about moving on to the return of competitive football matches."" Monday's meeting will come after a weekend when the Bundesliga, Germany's top flight, becomes the first major league to restart. Bundesliga: What you need to know about this season The Premier League has been suspended since 13 March because of the Covid-19 pandemic and most teams have nine fixtures left to play. Brighton had a third player test positive for coronavirus earlier in May and boss Graham Potter is wary about a return to action. ""We are in uncharted territory. It's a hugely complex situation,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to call one day to the next. The general will from all the clubs is to play out the season as close to the format as possible. Whatever date that is remains to be seen. ""We are sanitising the environment. The players are not coming in for any length of time. ""It will be as safe as it is made to be. The challenge will be when [we have] contact, larger groups and different teams. We need to see where we are on Monday and then Tuesday."" He added:  ""There are concerns, of course. We have come out of lockdown. The situation is not totally resolved. ""I have a young family. My wife's family has health issues. We are human beings."" Meanwhile, the Premier League confirmed clubs had decided that short-term contract extensions could be agreed with players whose deals run out on 30 June, with the season set to go beyond that date. Clubs and players will now have until 23 June to agree extensions which run until whenever the campaign is scheduled to finish. Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said it was decided ""to ensure as far as possible that clubs complete the season with the same squad they had available prior to the suspension of the campaign"". Elsewhere,six League One clubshave united to express their determination to finish the season. Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony has released a statement on behalf of Posh, Oxford, Sunderland, Fleetwood, Portsmouth and Ipswich. League One clubs are due to meet with the EFL board on Friday to discuss options for completing the season. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor The fact the government summoned the three football bodies to a meeting together tells its own story. Ministers want football to think collectively during this crisis, and act in the interests of the whole game. And to understand that any government financial bailouts for the sport are highly unlikely. The Premier League was reminded that if its season does resume next month, it will be expected to do what it can for clubs in the EFL and for grassroots football. And to ensure that, while honouring contracts with its broadcast partners, as many matches as possible are shown free to air, so that as many people as possible can watch them. With the Premier League lobbying government to scrap the idea of neutral stadiums to keep their clubs happy, ministers are now asking for something in return. It was significant today that despite continued police concerns over the risk of fans gathering outside grounds once matches resume, the government reinforced its support for the resumption of matches. But it also warned that games will only take place if the phased return to training goes to plan, and the sense is that 'Project Restart' still hangs in the balance.

The pavement on Castle Street in Cardiff city centre will be widened on Sunday to help social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak. The work will involve the traffic lane next to Cardiff Castle being removed so there is more space for both pedestrians and cyclists to use. This new shared space will run from the Cathedral Road/Cowbridge Road junction, over Canton Bridge, along Castle Street, Duke Street and up to the North Road-Boulevard De Nantes junction. Cardiff Council said: ""This is the first city-centre project that will be installed to keep the public safe and able to socially distance on the highway network."" Earlier works were introduced around Roath Park Lake to create a one-way footpath to aid social distancing, as well as the removal of visitor parking bays nearest to the lake to provide additional space for cyclists and joggers. Councillor Caro Wild said a similar scheme on Wood Street is ""currently being looked into"", while a pilot scheme to enable better social distancing in shopping areas at Wellfield Road in Plasnewydd is expected soon. ""It's not possible for us to transform all public space in the city overnight, but we are doing all that we can, with the resources available, to bring in these social-distancing schemes as quickly as possible,"" she added. The pavement on Cardiff's Castle Street will be widened from Sunday Wales ismore exposed than many other parts of the UK to the economic impact of the coronavirus, according to a research group. The Learning and Work Institute Cymru said almost one in five workers in Wales are employed in sectors that have been shut down during the outbreak. It now fears unemployment could rise to its highest level since devolution. Young people, women and those with few qualifications are most at risk, researchers found. Wales has a higher proportion (18%) of workers employed in industries most affected by lockdown measures, than both England and Northern Ireland, according to the institute, while Scotland has the same. It fears that if just a quarter of those 250,000 people lose their job, it would see unemployment in Wales reach a higher level than during the last recession following the financial crisis of 2008.

"Transport for London has had to significantly reduce Tube services because of coronavirus Transport for London (TfL) has secured Â£1.6bn in emergency funding to keep Tube and bus services running until September. Under the bailout's terms, London mayor Sadiq Khan is expected to restore a full Underground service as soon as possible. He has also agreed to increase bus and Tube fares by 1% above inflation. Mr Khan had urged the government to provide support or risk TfL running out of money. BBC London Political Editor Tim Donovan said other measures agreed included: Placing Stay Alert advertising on the transport network Reporting staff absenteeism rates to civil servants A longer-term review of TfL finances. The BBC has been told a Â£500m loan agreed with the Department for Transport forms part of the total. A mayoral source said the government had ""belatedly agreed financial support for TfL to deal with Covid-19 - as they have for every other train and bus operator in the country"". ""They have forced ordinary Londoners to pay a very heavy price for doing the right thing on Covid-19 by hiking TfL fares, temporarily suspending the Freedom Pass at busy times and loading TfL with debt that Londoners will pay for in the long run."" Mr Khan's offer to raise fares by 1% above inflation goes against a pledge made during this year's mayoral election campaign. In the run-up to the ballot, since deferred until 2021, he had promised ""cost of living"" increases in line with the Retail Price Index. New coronavirus data shows London ethnic breakdown Woman says coronavirus saved her life 'I found out I had cancer on the day of lockdown' TfL had said it would have been forced to issue a Section 114 notice - the equivalent of a public body going bust - if no deal had been reached by the end of the day. TfL said it had not seen such rapidly reducing passenger numbers in 100 years London mayor Conservative candidate Shaun Bailey said the government had had to take control of the TfL board and its finances, adding: ""The coronavirus highlighted existing structural flaws within TfL's balance sheet - the primary cause was our profligate mayor."" What are the mayor of London candidates up to now? TfL welcomed the emergency funding. London's Transport Commissioner Mike Brown, said: ""We have worked closely with the government and mayor as part of the national effort to fight the virus, rapidly reducing passenger numbers to levels not seen for 100 years. ""Enormous challenges remain, including agreeing longer term sustainable funding for transport in the capital.

Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA transport union, said the funding would prevent services ""coming to a halt"". Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train driver's union Aslef, said: ""It would have been a disaster for the capital, and the country, if the Tube network - and London buses - had stopped running."" In 2019-20 Transport for London earned Â£4.9bn from fares -making up 47% of the transport authority's income It costs Â£600m a month to keep the network running on its current reduced service.

The number of bus passengers has also dropped, by 85%, and customers no longer have to tap-in to pay for rides as part of measures to protect drivers.

"Senator Richard Burr has denied wrongdoing amid an insider trading probe The Republican chairman of the US Senate intelligence committee will step down while an insider trading inquiry is carried out. Richard Burr of North Carolina said he had decided to do so because he did not want the investigation to distract the committee from its work. Mr Burr's phone has been seized by the FBI as part of the inquiry. The senator, who denies wrongdoing, allegedly used inside information to avoid market losses from coronavirus. US senator probed for insider trading - reports Senators under fire over virus âinsider tradingâ He declined a request for comment. Mr Burr and his wife sold as much as $1.7m (Â£1.4m) of equities in February, just before markets plunged on fears of an economic crisis. It is illegal for members of Congress to trade based on non-public information gathered during their official duties. Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, as well as Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, also reportedly sold holdings before the downturn, but are not confirmed to be under investigation. Ms Feinstein said she had answered questions from the FBI regarding trades made by her husband, however. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Mr Burr had contacted him to inform of his decision to step aside temporarily. ""We agreed that this decision would be in the best interests of the committee and will be effective at the end of the day tomorrow [Friday],"" Mr McConnell said in a statement. Mr Burr said: ""The work the Intelligence Committee and its members do is too important to risk hindering in any way. I believe this step is necessary to allow the Committee to continue its essential work free of external distractions."" He turned over his mobile phone to authorities after federal agents issued and executed a search warrant at his Washington, DC, home. The justice department began investigating Mr Burr, 64, in March. Public disclosures first investigated by ProPublica show the senator sold more than 30 stocks between late January and mid-February. Some of the stocks were in sectors now devastated by the coronavirus outbreak, such as the hotel, restaurant and shipping industries.Â As chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Mr Burr receives nearly daily briefings on threats to US national security.Â He defended the transactions, saying he had ""relied solely on public news reports"" to instruct his decision to sell.Â Â This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus However, he was criticised for publicly downplaying the seriousness of the virus, even as he privately sold equities and warned a private North Carolina business group of the stark risks it posed.

"Transport for London must cut its Tube and bus networks without emergency funding, the mayor warned. Transport for London (TfL) will be forced to reduce services unless it receives a government grant by the end of the day, Sadiq Khan has claimed. Without financial support, the transport body must cut its Tube and bus networks, the mayor of London said. Mr Khan said TfL had been negotiating with the government for about six weeks. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""optimistic of having a solution"". The BBC has been told TFL -  whichpreviously said it expects to lose Â£4bn this yeardue to the impact of coronavirus - is negotiating a bailout worth several billion pounds. Bosses warned it would declare itself bankrupt without emergency finance by the end of Thursday. The Transport Secretary also said he was encouraging Mr Khan to get bus and train capacity back to 100% in order to avoid overcrowding on services. When asked whether the solution might entail higher fares, Mr Shapps replied it was ""important to provide a rescue package for TfL"" but a 'right balance' needs to be struck. The prime minister's official spokesman said negotiations were at an ""advanced stage"". 'I found out I had cancer on the day of lockdown' New coronavirus data shows London ethnic breakdown Heart condition woman says Covid saved her life Speaking on LBC Radio the Labour mayor said: ""At a time when the government is wanting us to increase services to get into the recovery phase, we might be required to cut services because the Government is failing to give us the grant support we need. ""TfL is legally treated like a local authority, which means we have to be able to balance the books. ""If we don't get the deal done today, the [chief financial officer] of TfL has legal duties that he has to follow."" If no deal is agreed, TfL said, it would have to publish an unbalanced budget under the requirements of the Local Government Act. It would also be forced to issue a Section 114 notice - the equivalent of a public body going bust - which would ban it from spending any new cash. An emergency board meeting would be called, after which the government would have to step in or services could be wound-down, TfL said. Speaking at Thursday's Downing Street press briefing, transport secretary Mr Shapps said: 'We don't know what the long-term will be. ""But in the short-term trains and buses will continue to run."" Sadiq Khan said TfL must ""balance the books"" TfL - which runs the Underground, buses, and some overground rail services - has already used Â£1bn of its reserves to keep the network running. It costs Â£600m a month to keep the network running on its current reduced service. The lockdown has led to a 95% cut in people using the Tube compared to this time last year. The number of bus passengers has also dropped, by 85%, and customers no longer have to tap-in to pay for rides as part of measures to protect drivers. Most TfL services are still running, but 7,000 staff - about 25% of the workforce - have been furloughed to cut costs. Travellers using London buses do not currently need to pay Conservative candidate for mayor of London, Shaun Bailey, said: ""Sadiq Khan has failed in his job as chairman of Transport for London. ""Coronavirus highlighted existing structural flaws within TfL's balance sheet - it is not the primary cause. ""It is simply wrong for Sadiq Khan to then use Londoners - and key workers, making critical journeys - as collateral to get a bailout to cover his mismanagement and bad decision making."" A spokesman for 10 Downing Street said: ""It is a commercial discussion. We remain in close contact with the mayor and TfL to look at how we can support them. ""Our priority is on reaching an agreement which keeps critical services running for those passengers who must use public transport to get work, ensuring we keep London moving safely.""

"The Guardian is closing its online dating service Guardian Soulmates because it is ""no longer viable"". The service, which has about 35,000 free members and paid subscribers, will close at the end of June, it said. The ""online dating landscape has changed dramatically"" since it launched in 2004, it added - making it a ""very little fish in a very big pool"". The 15 years since its launch has seen the growth of global dating apps such as Tinder, Hinge and Bumble. Guardian Soulmates said on its website: ""There are so many dating apps now, so many ways to meet people, which are often free and very quick. ""To keep up with the changing times we'd need to invest heavily in new technology and develop a new way of operating, and it's just not viable."" Membership to the site is free, but it has seen about a 40% fall in the number of paid subscribers - with access to advanced search and messaging options - over the past six years.

"Sanofi's HQ is in Paris and the firm has received French state tax breaks The French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi has rowed back on an apparent promise to prioritise the US market with any potential Covid-19 vaccine. Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson sparked a row by saying the US government had ""the right to the largest pre-order because it's invested in taking the risk"". French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe responded by saying access for all was ""non-negotiable"". Sanofi's chairman has now vowed equal access for everyone. How close to developing a vaccine are we? World leaders pledge billions for vaccine fight Cyber-spies seek coronavirus vaccine secrets ""I am going to be extremely clear: there will be no particular advance for any country,"" Serge Weinberg told France 2 TV. He said Mr Hudson's words had been distorted. Prime Minister Philippe said he had spoken to Mr Weinberg and received ""all the necessary assurance regarding the distribution of an eventual Sanofi vaccine"". President Emmanuel Macron said that recent efforts had proved a vaccine should not be subject to market forces and he is due to meet top Sanofi officials next week. The EU insisted that all countries should get equal access to a vaccine. ""The vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,"" said European Commission spokesman Stefan de Keersmaecker, quoted by AFP news agency. The deadly coronavirus pandemic has made the search for a Covid-19 vaccine the top priority for labs worldwide, with intense pressure to speed up a process that usually take years to develop. Earlier this month the EU chaired a global online summit to boost coronavirus research, and secured pledges of $8bn (Â£6.5bn) from some 40 countries and donors. The funding is aimed at developing a coronavirus vaccine and treatments for Covid-19. The UK co-hosted the summit but the US and Russia did not take part. Sanofi's Covid-19 vaccine research is partly funded by the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) but in recent years Sanofi received tens of millions of euros in tax credits from the French government to help its research. Mr Hudson's remarks in a Bloomberg interview provoked uproar among politicians on the right and left in France. The Socialists estimated that Sanofi had received some â¬150m (Â£133m; $162m) in research tax credit and millions more in other tax credit. Sanofi's chief in France, Olivier Bogillot, said the goal was to have a vaccine ""available to the US as well as France and Europe at the same time"". But speaking on French news channel BFMTV, he said this would only be possible ""if Europeans work as quickly as the Americans"", and added that the US government had pledged to spend ""several hundreds of millions of euros"". The row was reminiscent of reports in March of a US attempt to buy German biotech firm CureVac, which has also been researching a possible vaccine. CureVac insisted there had been no US attempt to buy the firm or its manufacturing capacity. Last month Sanofi also teamed up with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to work on a vaccine, though trials have not yet started.

"The Premier League hopes to resume again on 12 June The government says it is ""opening the door"" for the return of professional football in England in June. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said Thursday's meeting with the Football Association, Premier League and English Football League had ""progressed plans"". He added that plans for the sport to resume should ""include widening access for fans to view live coverage"". Meanwhile, England's deputy chief medical officer said any return would be ""slow"" and ""measured"". The Premier League met on Monday to discuss ""Project Restart"" and hopes for a return to action on 12 June, with matches played behind closed doors. ""We all agreed that we will only go ahead if it is safe to do so and the health and welfare of players, coaches and staff comes first,"" said Dowden. ""It is now up to the football authorities to agree and finalise the detail of their plans, and there is combined goodwill to achieve this for their fans, the football community and the nation as a whole. ""The government and our medical experts will continue to offer guidance and support."" He added that plans to return should ""ensure finances from the game's resumption supportsÂ the wider football family"". The next meeting of Premier League clubs will take place on Monday, when top-flight players may return to initial group training under social distancing protocols. Footballers have so far been limited to individual training but Premier League bosses hope a first phase of team training, under strict guidelines and restricted to 75 minutes, can begin next week. Premier League clubs facing Â£340m TV refund even if season resumes Restrictions in place for team training under 'Project Restart' Premier League clubs confident neutral venues stance to be reversed England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said: ""There will be small, carefully measured, step-wise approaches to see what can be achieved safely. The first of those is to return safely to training, still observing social distancing. ""We will have to see how that goes before we can even think about moving on to the return of competitive football matches."" Monday's meeting will come after a weekend when the Bundesliga, Germany's top flight, becomes the first major league to restart. Bundesliga: What you need to know about this season The Premier League has been suspended since 13 March because of the Covid-19 pandemic and most teams have nine fixtures left to play. Brighton had a third player test positive for coronavirus earlier in May and boss Graham Potter is wary about a return to action. ""We are in uncharted territory. It's a hugely complex situation,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to call one day to the next. The general will from all the clubs is to play out the season as close to the format as possible. Whatever date that is remains to be seen. ""We are sanitising the environment. The players are not coming in for any length of time. ""It will be as safe as it is made to be. The challenge will be when [we have] contact, larger groups and different teams. We need to see where we are on Monday and then Tuesday."" He added:  ""There are concerns, of course. We have come out of lockdown. The situation is not totally resolved. ""I have a young family. My wife's family has health issues. We are human beings."" Meanwhile, the Premier League confirmed clubs had decided that short-term contract extensions could be agreed with players whose deals run out on 30 June, with the season set to go beyond that date. Clubs and players will now have until 23 June to agree extensions which run until whenever the campaign is scheduled to finish. Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said it was decided ""to ensure as far as possible that clubs complete the season with the same squad they had available prior to the suspension of the campaign"". Elsewhere,six League One clubshave united to express their determination to finish the season. Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony has released a statement on behalf of Posh, Oxford, Sunderland, Fleetwood, Portsmouth and Ipswich. League One clubs are due to meet with the EFL board on Friday to discuss options for completing the season. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor The fact the government summoned the three football bodies to a meeting together tells its own story. Ministers want football to think collectively during this crisis, and act in the interests of the whole game. And to understand that any government financial bailouts for the sport are highly unlikely. The Premier League was reminded that if its season does resume next month, it will be expected to do what it can for clubs in the EFL and for grassroots football. And to ensure that, while honouring contracts with its broadcast partners, as many matches as possible are shown free to air, so that as many people as possible can watch them. With the Premier League lobbying government to scrap the idea of neutral stadiums to keep their clubs happy, ministers are now asking for something in return. It was significant today that despite continued police concerns over the risk of fans gathering outside grounds once matches resume, the government reinforced its support for the resumption of matches. But it also warned that games will only take place if the phased return to training goes to plan, and the sense is that 'Project Restart' still hangs in the balance.

"The cost of the government's efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic has risen to Â£123.2bn, according to latest estimates from the government's independent economics forecaster. The Office for Budget Responsibility's previous estimate was Â£103.7bn. The increased cost of the government's furlough scheme is the main cause. It now expects annual borrowing to equal 15.2% of the UK economy. That would be the highest since the 22.1% seen at the end of World War Two. UK furlough scheme extended by four months Chancellor warns of 'significant recession' The extra spending has pushed the deficit identified for 2020-21 in the OBR's reference scenario, which it says is not a formal forecast, above the 15% in 1945-46, which included VE Day. Borrowing for this year is calculated to be Â£298bn, up Â£26bn on the first attempt to calculate the impact of the pandemic a month ago. This is mainly because of the extra costs of extending the furlough scheme to the end of July. Including the extra extension of a modified scheme until October could add an additional Â£20bn, depending on the as yet unannounced details of the scheme. The OBR also reckons that taxpayers could end up footing a big bill for bad bank loans. Some Â£5bn in taxpayer cost from unpaid loans to banks is included in this financial year. An extra Â£1bn is already earmarked for the cost of welfare, mainly spiralling claims for Universal Credit. The OBR's last official forecast at the Budget anticipated annual borrowing by the government of Â£55bn, rather than Â£298bn, says BBC economics editor Faisal Islam. The difference in just two months - the result of the pandemic and shutdowns - is a Â£127bn hit to the money that government takes in, mainly expected tax revenues, and Â£119bn in extra spending to support the economy over the year, our editor adds. As Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, explains, the extra spending is ""fantastic good news"" for ordinary people at the moment, because it means that the government is paying many people's wages when they might otherwise be struggling. But he adds: ""Beyond that, there's a point at which people will have to start thinking, 'How do we pay for all this?' ""That's when it becomes relevant in a bad way further down the line. We will have to pay for it, either by taxes going up or by spending being cut. ""It's a two-step process. In the near term, it's helping people out, but there will be consequences in the future.""

"Eunice Mwabili works at a private hospital in the Kenyan capital A Kenyan nurse found herself being shunned and harassed after she prepared a patient for a Covid-19 test while she was on a nightshift. Eunice Mwabili says the case was handled professionally - she wore personal protective equipment while dealing with the man, who was placed in an isolation room at the hospital. By the next morning, her friends and neighbours in the capital, Nairobi, had begun to avoid her, fearing she had become infected with coronavirus. It is unclear who leaked the information that she had organised to have the patient tested - but both her name and number were leaked on social media. The patient ended up being negative, but that news never filtered out - the damage was done. She began to receive phone calls from strangers - some wanting to know where she worked - and anxious friends wanting to find out her status. ""Out there it was like I was already a Covid suspect. It really affected me. The story was even on the media. It was on TV,"" Ms Mwabili told the BBC. One neighbour shouted to her: ""I hear you are the one catching coronavirus patients."" An acquaintance told her husband that she really pitied him ""because of what has happened to your wife"". ""Do you imagine, up to today that lady friend has never bothered to call me to find out how I'm doing after that incident,"" she said. Brenda Cherotich was trolled after being interviewed about her recovery from Covid-19 She is not the only Kenyan who has faced coronavirus-linked stigma. Even some of those who have recovered have found it hard to be accepted back into their communities. Recently Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe spoke about someone who had fully recovered but was not allowed to re-join their local choir. The ministry says others have found that after leaving hospital even their families have been stigmatised. And the fear is pervasive. One man I contacted to find out about life in a quarantine centre refused to answer my questions as he feared the stigma he would be subjected to afterwards. He had been sent to the facility as a precautionary measure for 14 days after some people in the apartment block in which he lived tested positive for coronavirus - though he never contracted the virus. This video can not be played Students at this Kenyan university are voluntarily making critical medical kits. Fearing 'money heists' amid coronavirus pandemic Weddings, births and deaths in the age of Covid-19 Even before the country registered its first coronavirus infection, an MP's xenophobic Facebook message went viral in February as he called for his constituents to avoid nationals from China, where the virus originated. In April, Brenda Cherotich, among the first coronavirus patients to recover, was interviewed on television about her experiences. Officials wanted her to be the beacon of hope, to show that people could survive the illness - instead she was subjected to cyberbullying. Not long after that, a 27-year-old man in the coastal city of Mombasa was ""condemned to death by medics"" who abandoned him in his hour of need fearing he had Covid-19, his father told The People Daily newspaper. For the nurse, Ms Mwabili, it all started when Davis Muturi walked into private Catholic Church-run hospital where she worked at the end of March. The 40-year-old chef had returned from the US a week before. He had gone into self-isolation on his return, asking his family to move in with relatives as a precaution. ""I had a one-month-old baby who I had never seen, and my wife was shocked and worried that I was sending the family away and did not want to see them. But after explaining, she understood that it was for the good of the family,"" he told the BBC. After seven days, he went to the hospital for a test because he was scared by reports on social media about the virus - and he wanted to be sure he didn't have it. The East African nation has recorded a little more than 700 cases of coronavirus ""The way they put it is like everyone who came into the country was already affected,"" he said. But after he did the test his name and phone number were also leaked - with people alleging online that he had coronavirus. Even though he had tested negative, he was afraid of leaving his house - scared he would be accused of deliberately trying to infect other people. He contacted Ms Mwabili to see if she knew how their information had been shared: ""She told me that her colleagues were even asking her why she was not isolating herself. But I was not even positive."" Ms Mwabili can only point to a visit by the police on the evening of Mr Muturi's check-up. The officers had wanted information about suspected Covid-19 patients as part of an ongoing investigation into an escape from a coronavirus quarantine centre. Davis Muturi (L) has now met his new baby It seems a police memo about their visit was leaked. ""I don't know exactly how it leaked with my name and details, as well as that of my client,"" she said. The hospital has complained about the leak, and police say the matter is under investigation. Ms Mwabili says what made it more challenging was after the leak, she went down with tonsillitis for a week. ""When I resumed at work, some of my colleagues were asking, 'Did you go on quarantine?'... You can just suspect what was going through their minds."" GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? More than a month later, Ms Mwabili says she is a stronger person after going through the experience. It has made her more determined to do her job well as ""each person, whether positive or negative, needs our services"". For Mr Muturi, the moment he learnt that he was Covid-19-free, he could not wait to meet his new baby. ""That very day, they came back immediately, I couldn't let my family stay for another night away from me.""

A checkpoint in Aden, Yemen There have been 385 deaths over the past week of people with ""coronavirus-like symptoms"" in Aden, Yemen, according to figures reported by the Save the Children organisation. The group said such deaths in Aden appeared to have increased fivefold in a week. Only 72 cases and 13 virus-related deaths have officially been confirmed in the war-ravaged country but Save the Children said it appeared the pandemic was ""getting a grip"" on Yemen. The testing rate is extremely low with only four labs nationwide able to carry out the diagnostics. âOur teams on the ground are seeing how people are being sent away from hospitals, breathing heavily or even collapsing. People are dying because they canât get treatment that would normally save their lives,"" the group said in a statement. It added that there were only 500 ventilators in Yemen.

People waiting outside McDonald's in New York City's Times Square yesterday McDonald's has released guidelines for how its restaurants should reopen dining areas in the US. Staff will wear masks and gloves, child play areas will be closed, and some seating will be inaccessible to promote social distancing. Some of the fast food restaurants will even offer masks to customers in cities where they are required. Despite the guidelines, McDonald's has not said when it will reopen eating areas across the US. In the UK, the fast food chain yesterday reopened 15 of its branches for delivery, and it plans to open some drive-thrus next week. Figures released by NHS England have provided a breakdown of specific pre-existing health conditions among those to have died with Covid-19. It showed thatmore than one in four,external(26%) patients who died with Covid-19 in hospitals in England between 31 March and 12 May had diabetes.

There is a shortage of the plastic sheets used to make clear screens that employers have been advised to install for workplace safety, the BBC has learned. Supermarkets have fitted screens at checkouts and government guidance has advised other workplaces, from labs to factories, to take a similar approach, but a spike in demand has led to shortages of plastic sheets. Chris Marmion, managing director of Plastic Shop Screens, told the BBC's Wake up to Money: ""It's quite simple. There isn't enough [plastic] coming into the country to meet the current demand. Come a couple of weeks, I think there may definitely be a shortage.""

"Masks sent to Birmingham City Council have had use-by dates of 2014 A council has asked for government reassurance that a supply of personal protective equipment for staff on the front line against Covid-19 is safe, despite being six years out of date. Birmingham City Council said it received a delivery in April of about 4,000 masks with 2014 use-by dates. The authority claims a further supply was sent to it with plain stickers covering the 2014 date with a 2019 one. A minister overseeing PPE would respond to the council, the government said. It has also emerged more of the same FFP3 masks have been sent out in the past two weeks, bringing to 16,000 the total number of masks the council has in stock but said it could not use. In a letter to housing minister Chris Pincher, who has been co-ordinating the government's efforts to supply local authorities with PPE, council leader Ian Ward said it was first made aware of a potential issue with the masks on 22 April. The Labour-controlled authority had since then been asking ""on a daily basis"" for written confirmation of their safety from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and the Department of Health and Social Care, he added. Mr Ward said it was ""incredibly concerning"" the government had failed to do so, despite the ""severe implications"" of it not providing assurances - specifically that the council had only ""a few"" days' supply of useable FFP3 masks left to distribute. He wrote: ""Our primary objective is to protect the health and safety of those that may need PPE. We will not jeopardise their safety by releasing potentially ineffectual, date-expired stock."" His letter said if the equipment had been tested ""a clear, documented audit trail should be readily available"". SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Mr Ward said: ""It is quite frankly outrageous that we are having to chase the government on this issue. ""Those workers, that are putting themselves in harm's way to help the city get through this crisis, should not be put at even greater risk with the supply of potentially defective PPE. ""Please can we receive the ministry's urgent written assurance that our current stock of date-expired PPE is safe to use?"" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told the BBC Mr Pincher would be ""responding to the letter in due course"".

"The Guardian is closing its online dating service Guardian Soulmates because it is ""no longer viable"". The service, which has about 35,000 free members and paid subscribers, will close at the end of June, it said. The ""online dating landscape has changed dramatically"" since it launched in 2004, it added - making it a ""very little fish in a very big pool"". The 15 years since its launch has seen the growth of global dating apps such as Tinder, Hinge and Bumble.

"Nadine Dorries has deleted the post from her Twitter timeline Health minister Nadine Dorries and two other Tory MPs have been ordered to ""check the validity"" of social media posts before sharing them. Party bosses spoke to the MPs after they retweeted false allegations about Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. Sir Keir said he was satisfied with the actions taken by the party and the MPs, who have deleted the tweets. ""There are more important things in the world to concentrate on than a doctored video of me,"" he added. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""These tweets have rightly been deleted. ""The MPs involved have been spoken to by the Whips' Office and reminded of their responsibility to check the validity of information before they post on social media sites."" As director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013, Sir Keir was head of the Crown Prosecution Service, the body that decides whether or not to prosecute someone accused of a crime. The clip shared by Ms Dorries and fellow Tory MPs Maria Caulfield and Lucy Allan was from a 2013 Channel 5 interview with Sir Keir. In it, he appeared to be listing a series of reasons for not bringing charges against grooming gangs - including if the alleged victims had been in trouble with the police, or had been abusing drink or drugs. But the clip does not include the reporter's question, which asks Sir Keir about the incorrect use of guidelines being used by the authorities in the reporting and investigating of child sexual abuse allegations. As can be seen fromthe full exchange,external, Sir Keir was talking about how the police wrongly applied the guidelines, and how police culture had to change. Ms Dorries retweeted the edited clip and allegations against Sir Keir, from the right-wing @NJamesWorld account, with the one word comment ""revealing"". Labour MP and shadow Treasury minister Wes Streeting replied: ""What's revealing is that: 1. You've spread fake news and indulged a smear being promoted by the far right. 2. You had time to do this despite being a minister in the Department of Health during a public health crisis. ""It's either malevolence or stupidity. Probably both."" Former senior prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who was involved in bringing a number of cases, said the clip was being used to suggest Sir Keir did not take child sexual abuse seriously, when the opposite was true. ""As national lead, I can assure you that he and I put right the failings of a generation of those who should have safeguarded children. He inherited failure and left success,"" he tweeted. Earlier, a Labour Party source said: ""This is a doctored video tweeted by a far-right social media account. ""As a government minister, we hope Nadine Dorries acknowledges this and takes it down."" The edited video was viewed more than 239,000 times before the @NJamesWorld account was suspended. Ms Caulfield subsequently locked her Twitter account. while Ms Dorries and Ms Allan both deleted their tweets.

"Masks sent to Birmingham City Council have had use-by dates of 2014 A council has asked for government reassurance that a supply of personal protective equipment for staff on the front line against Covid-19 is safe, despite being six years out of date. Birmingham City Council said it received a delivery in April of about 4,000 masks with 2014 use-by dates. The authority claims a further supply was sent to it with plain stickers covering the 2014 date with a 2019 one. A minister overseeing PPE would respond to the council, the government said. It has also emerged more of the same FFP3 masks have been sent out in the past two weeks, bringing to 16,000 the total number of masks the council has in stock but said it could not use. In a letter to housing minister Chris Pincher, who has been co-ordinating the government's efforts to supply local authorities with PPE, council leader Ian Ward said it was first made aware of a potential issue with the masks on 22 April. The Labour-controlled authority had since then been asking ""on a daily basis"" for written confirmation of their safety from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and the Department of Health and Social Care, he added. Mr Ward said it was ""incredibly concerning"" the government had failed to do so, despite the ""severe implications"" of it not providing assurances - specifically that the council had only ""a few"" days' supply of useable FFP3 masks left to distribute. He wrote: ""Our primary objective is to protect the health and safety of those that may need PPE. We will not jeopardise their safety by releasing potentially ineffectual, date-expired stock."" His letter said if the equipment had been tested ""a clear, documented audit trail should be readily available"". SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?

Mr Ward said: ""It is quite frankly outrageous that we are having to chase the government on this issue. ""Those workers, that are putting themselves in harm's way to help the city get through this crisis, should not be put at even greater risk with the supply of potentially defective PPE. ""Please can we receive the ministry's urgent written assurance that our current stock of date-expired PPE is safe to use?"" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told the BBC Mr Pincher would be ""responding to the letter in due course"".

"Insurance market Lloyd's of London has said it expects coronavirus-related claims to cost it $3bn to $4.3bn (Â£2.5bn to Â£3.5bn). That means its biggest payout since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US. The losses could rise further if the current lockdown continues into another quarter, Lloyd's said. Insurers around the world have been hit by the cost of the pandemic, although many would-be claimants have found the virus is not covered by their policies. Lloyd's said its payout on coronavirus claims would also equal the combined impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017. Those three hurricanes brought devastation to the Caribbean and parts of the US, in what is reckoned to bethe costliest year for storms on record. Lloyd's chief executive John Neal told the BBC ""it could be two years before everyone really gets their arms around the true cost of this pandemic"". ""We estimate that government borrowing could be as much as $10trn globally to protect the economy for the losses that we've seen,"" he added. He also implied that between $1bn-$1.4bn has been paid by Lloyds members for business interruption claims because of coronavirus, despite the fact that the vast majority of businesses ""don't have the right cover and the right protection in force for this type of event"". Mr Neal said that there were ""some pretty harsh lessons"" to take away from the pandemic, and that the insurance market would need to structure policies and covers differently in future so that businesses are ""protected more completely"". Natural catastrophes, such as Hurricane Harvey, brought devastation to the Caribbean and parts of the US ""Importantly, these natural catastrophes were geographically contained events, occurring over the course of hours and days - vastly different in nature to the global, systemic and longer-term impact of Covid-19,"" Lloyd's said. Mr Neal said the global insurance industry was paying out on ""a very wide range of policies"" to support business and people affected by the pandemic. He added: ""What makes Covid-19 unique is not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock. ""Taking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before, but we will keep focused on supporting our customers and continuing to pay claims over the weeks and months ahead."" 'My business could go bust if insurers don't pay' Insurance firms ordered to pay out or explain Nearly a third of the insurance losses are expected to come from the cancellation or postponement of major events around the world, includingthe Tokyo Olympics, which are now due to take place in 2021. Other major categories include business interruption claims on property insurance. Many small businesses in the UK are at loggerheads with insurers who they say have denied them payments for disruption. The insurers say most small business policies do not cover the pandemic. One Lloyd's of London insurer, Hiscox, has saidit will not pay out on business interruption claimsresulting from the virus outbreak. Lloyd's said its total payouts arising from the 9/11 attacks were $4.7bn, while the 2017 hurricanes led to combined payouts of $4.8bn. The Lloyd's marketplace is a City institution Lloyd's said that once all factors were taken into account, the total impact of coronavirus on the insurance industry as a whole was likely to be far bigger. ""The estimated 2020 underwriting losses covered by the industry as a result of Covid-19 are approximately $107bn,"" it said. ""In addition, unlike other events, the industry will also experience falls in investment portfolios of an estimated $96bn, bringing the total projected loss to the insurance industry to $203bn.""

With more than 1.3 million cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. It has also recorded more than 80,000 deaths. The state of New York has been particularly badly affected, with more than 27,000 deaths. Here are our latest charts and other visualstracking the global outbreak. In the UK, another 428 deaths were announced on Thursday, bringing the official total number of deaths to 33,614.

A checkpoint in Aden, Yemen There have been 385 deaths over the past week of people with ""coronavirus-like symptoms"" in Aden, Yemen, according to figures reported by the Save the Children organisation. The group said such deaths in Aden appeared to have increased fivefold in a week. Only 72 cases and 13 virus-related deaths have officially been confirmed in the war-ravaged country but Save the Children said it appeared the pandemic was ""getting a grip"" on Yemen. The testing rate is extremely low with only four labs nationwide able to carry out the diagnostics. âOur teams on the ground are seeing how people are being sent away from hospitals, breathing heavily or even collapsing. People are dying because they canât get treatment that would normally save their lives,"" the group said in a statement. It added that there were only 500 ventilators in Yemen.

In the UK, the fast food chain yesterday reopened 15 of its branches for delivery, and it plans to open some drive-thrus next week.

There is a shortage of the plastic sheets used to make clear screens that employers have been advised to install for workplace safety, the BBC has learned. Supermarkets have fitted screens at checkouts and government guidance has advised other workplaces, from labs to factories, to take a similar approach, but a spike in demand has led to shortages of plastic sheets. Chris Marmion, managing director of Plastic Shop Screens, told the BBC's Wake up to Money: ""It's quite simple. There isn't enough [plastic] coming into the country to meet the current demand. Come a couple of weeks, I think there may definitely be a shortage.""

Donald Macaskill told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie the low pay in the care sector was a ""national scandal,"" even though they are paid the Scottish living wage. He said: ""You can get more money walking a dog in the streets of Edinburgh than you can caring for our elderly citizens."" Reagrding the Care Inspectorate's action against the Home Farm care home, Mr Macaskill said this was an ""immensely serious move"" and he called for staff and residents to be supported. On testing, he said data he has seen found 1-3% of staff had coronavirus - in line with the University of Cambridge research on frontline workers. But he said clear action plans were in place to ensure care home providers, if necessary supported by the NHS, had enough staffing to fill any gaps.

She featured in viral TikTok video last month, in which she can be seen dancing with 102-year-old resident Percy Mann. Police found her dead in her home in Barrhead on 7 May. Her death is being treated as ""unexplained"". She had not been tested for Covid-19. The Scottish Sun,externalis reporting that Barrhead Housing Association has carried out a deep-clean of her property and encouraged its residents to seek medical help if unwell.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Care home workers are having to choose between putting residents at risk or going without pay, the GMB union has warned. Secretary Gary Smith said staff were worried about being tested because if they return a positive result, they will be sent home on statutory sick pay. ""These are workers that cannot afford not to be working,"" he added. The union has previously warned about employment practices and low pay in private care. Care workers tend to earn the minimum wage or a little above it, and the vast majority are women, Mr Smith highlighted. He said: ""People are terrified. They're worried about killing the people that they love and look after in care homes, but they're terrified about how they're going to be able to feed their families.

GMB Scotland secretary Gary Smith has said ""regular, systematic testing"" in care homes was needed. The Scottish government has rolled out testing for all staff and residents in care homes where someone has tested positive, but these have to be requested by care home operators. Mr Smith suggested there was a ""postcode lottery"" for testing, with some social care partnerships rigorously testing the whole home but others are not.

council workers and carers for their hard work. They have been dropping off surprise packages of treats, cards and messages of thanks. And they set up a 5k-a-day in May challenge raising Â£5,000 for five charities: Marie Curie cancer care, Sepsis Research - FEAT, Young Minds, Rainbow Trust children's charity and MND Scotland. Garden centres and recycling centres will open in Northern Ireland next week Garden centres and recycling centres in Northern Ireland can reopen from next Monday as part of the first steps to ease lockdown, Arlene Foster has said.

The first minister said updated medical advice meant the executive could now approve the ""tentative first steps"". Marriage ceremonies where a person is terminally ill will also be allowed. Staff at a Glasgow care home hosted a lockdown birthday party for one Scotland's oldest women - complete with a DJ and a piper. Ellen Gardner turned 107 on Wednesday but the restrictions did not spoil her celebrations. Son Ronnie and his wife Liz were able to see her open her presents from a safe distance in the garden of Orchard Grove Care Home in Toryglen.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Thousands of frontline NHS staff may unwittingly be treating hospital patients while infected with coronavirus,according to research,external. The University of Cambridge found 3% of hospital workers tested positive for Covid-19 despite reporting fit for duty. Professor Stephen Baker explains they were asymptomatic and this suggests there should probably be more testing of those people who will come into contact with vulnerable people. ""We should be screening people working in healthcare facilities more regularly,"" he says. The researchers tested a range of staff at hospitals, not just doctors and nurses, and positive test results were found throughout. However, the highest levels of infection were unsurprisingly found in red wards - those which treat Covid-19 patients.

Here a look at the latest headlines first: Ina Beaton celebrating her 100th birthday in 2017 The grandson of the seventh resident of a Skye care home to die after contracting Covid-19 has called her his ""best friend and guiding light"". Ina Beaton was 103 when the virus took her life at Home Farm in Portree on 11 May. Born Hectorina Matheson, she was a well known figure on the island and lived in her own home in Balmaqueen until just two years ago. Ina lived through the Great War, the Spanish flu of 1919 and moved to Glasgow during the war years where she worked as a conductress on the trams, surviving the Clydebank Blitz. Ailean Beaton thanked the staff at Home Farm care home who he said ""had been through a lot"".  She was my best friend and guiding light, and we loved each other very much. If you know me, you know how much she meant to me. But the loss is shared across the entire island, especially the north end where she was mum, granny, friend to more than just the Beatons. Her crystal memory and broad experience of life in Skye over several generations meant that she contributed to our shared knowledge of the place we're from, its language and culture. At 103 years old, her perspective is literally irreplaceable. I never could have tired of her company . She was the first person I wanted to visit any time I travelled home. Ailean Beaton, Grandson of Ina Beaton People planning so-called ""picnic protests"" against the coronavirus lockdown are being warned they'll be risking lives and breaking the law. Flyers online urge people to join mass gatherings in parks this weekend - including in Scottish cities - for picnics. This would break Scottish lockdown rules which say people should stay apart and avoid large groups. Nicola Sturgeon says people must stick to the tight constraints in Scotland and warned anyone tempted to join the protest they could ""be putting people's lives at risk. So please don't do it, we're all in this for the same reason to stop people dying unnecessarily, so don't be that person that goes and knowingly put's somebody's life on the line, it's not worth it, so please don't do it.""

"Mr Darling was chancellor during the 2008 financial crisis The economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic will be ""far, far worse"" than the banking crisis in 2008, a former chancellor has warned. Alistair Darling said the country was already in a ""very deep recession"". He predicted that unemployment would start to rise in August despite the UK government's furlough scheme. And he said the government had to start planning now to prevent people being ""simply dumped on the dole"" when furlough ends. Mr Darling was Chancellor of the Exchequer in Gordon Brown's Labour government during the 2008 financial meltdown, which was widely seen as being the world's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s. He was involved in bailing out some of the UK's major banks by taking multi-billion-pound stakes in them. But without access to state support, many companies folded. Coronavirus in Scotland - latest updates Chancellor says UK facing 'significant recession' Mr Darling toldBBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programmethat the collapse in 2008 had been caused by a ""fracture to the banking system that could be fixed, albeit at huge cost and political controversy at the time"". The former chancellor said the current crisis would be considerably worse because it would be some time yet before the virus was brought under control and the economy could begin to recover. And he said there was ""no doubt"" that the country was facing a very deep recession that would take some time to come out of. Mr Darling said the furlough scheme - which has been extended until October by current Chancellor Rishi Sunak - had been excellent for keeping people in work so far. But he warned: ""What will happen in August, when the government moves to a situation where employers begin to share the cost, is you will find that employers will say 'is this job really going to be around'? ""That is when when you will start to see unemployment rise, which is why I think the government needs to plan for that now. ""We can't go back to what it was like in the 1980s when people were simply dumped on the dole - the government has got a role to play here."" Mr Sunak has extended the furlough scheme for a further four months Mr Darling said the UK had managed to deal with levels of debt after the Second World War and could do so again. He added: ""We are a big economy, we have got our own central bank, so I think the government should concentrate on making sure that the economy is intact so that when we get the recovery, we can start to grow."" Mr Sunak said on Wednesday that it was ""very likely"" the UK was in a ""significant recession"", as figures showed the economy contracted at its fastest pace since the financial crisis in the first three months of the year. Economists expect an even bigger slump in the current quarter, which has seen the full economic impact of the lockdown. Mr Darling praised Mr Sunak for focusing on keeping as many people in work as possible - but warned against a return to austerity measures as a way of dealing with the current economic crisis. He said: ""One thing big governments - which is what we've got because we are a big economy - can do is spread the risk over generations so you don't end up clobbering people unnecessarily. ""If you start imposing tax rises now and cuts you will suppress the economy even more, which is the very last thing you want at the moment."" Andrew Wilson, an economist and former SNP MSP, had earlier told the Good Morning Scotland programme that the UK and Scottish governments should discuss the idea of changing the devolution settlement to allow the Scottish government to issue its own bonds as a way of helping to fund universities and other devolved areas. What are bonds and how do they work? Mr Wilson, the author of the SNP's Growth Commission report on the finances of a future independent Scotland, said there was ""no reason"" why this could not happen. Mr Darling, who led the Better Together campaign ahead of the 2014 independence referendum, said he had no problem with this in principle. But he said the reality was that the UK would be able to secure better rates for its bonds than Scotland could, because it has its own central bank which can keep interest rates low and therefore cut the borrowing cost. He added: ""I am practical about this. I want to make sure that wherever you are in the UK, we can benefit from those low cost borrowing bonds. ""And that is what you can do if you are part of a large economy. It has got its own central bank and we've got a record where people can have absolute confidence that if they lend us money, they will get it back.""

"A body representing care homes says it may have been ""wrong"" to prioritise the NHS without protecting elderly residents Care homes felt ""completely abandoned"" as the coronavirus crisis swept across the UK, the National Care Association has said. Nadra Ahmed, chair of the association, said advice to prioritise the NHS without adequately protecting elderly people in care may have been ""wrong"". It comes as the government announced Â£600m to improve infection control in homes. Health minister Edward Argar denied the government had received ""bad advice"". Ms Ahmed told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that care homes had been happy to support the NHS but struggled with a lack of protective equipment as well as with people being discharged from hospital into their facilities without being tested for coronavirus. She said: ""Here we were, suddenly left completely abandoned. And we understand the mantra that was about save the NHS - but our concern was, at what cost was that going to happen?"" The advice to government was ""certainly not well put and, yes, perhaps it was wrong"", because the sector looking after ""the most frail and vulnerable"" should have been shielded. How many people have died in care homes? PM quizzed over 'unexplained' care home deaths Care home virus deaths 'starting to decline' Despite promises that all care home residents and staff can now be tested, she said there were delays in getting results and funding promised for the sector was not yet reaching providers. The government is aiming to have offered tests to all care-home staff and residents by early June and has made 30,000 tests a day available, according to Lord Bethell, minister for innovation in the Department for Health and Social Care. But Labour said the roll-out of testing was too slow, with more than 1.5 million tests needed and only tens of thousands carried out so far. More than 9,700 people with coronavirus have died in care homes, 2,800 of them in the most recent week for which figures have been published. Meanwhile, the UK's overall death toll rose by 428, to 33,614, according to figures from the Department for Heath and Social Care. The numbers also showed 126,064 tests had been carried out or posted out on Wednesday - the third time the government has reached its 100,000 a day target. The NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts and other organisations, said when the crisis was over the UK would need to address the ""national disgrace"" of ""our collective failure to address social care"". Niall Dickson, the confederation's chief executive, said it had been neglected too long and there needed to be ""fundamental reform"" to combine the social care system and NHS. Mr Argar told the BBC the Â£600m announced by government to help stop the virus spreading in care homes had to ""get to the front line"". He acknowledged there were still issues with testing, saying the government would continue to ""ramp up"" its efforts in the coming weeks. He said: ""There is still some capacity there that we need to make available to care homes make sure that everyone can access it quickly and to make sure they can get the results back quickly."" But Labour's shadow housing, communities and local government secretary Steve Reed said the Â£600m  was ""a drop in the ocean"". He said that local authorities faced a Â£10bn shortfall, a third of which was for care homes, and he accused the government of ""backtracking"" on a promise to provide them with ""whatever was necessary to get communities through this crisis"". Mr Argar also denied the government had been badly advised by scientists when it failed to lock down care homes and stop non-essential visits at the same time as Italy on 5 March.

""This was a disease that was new, and every day we were learning something new about how it behaved. And it didn't always behave exactly the same way in different countries."" He said Italy was ""ahead of us in terms of the curve and community transmission"", which Mr Argar said was not occurring in the UK until it moved from the containment phase on 13 March. But on 5 March, Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, told MPsit was ""highly likely"" the virus was being transmitted between people in the UK.

"McLaren is considering raising money by mortgaging its historic car collection and factory to see it through the coronavirus crisis. The Formula One team owner and supercar maker has seen sales and F1 advertising revenues hit as countries globally went into lockdown. Cars on show at McLaren's Surrey HQ include F1 winners from the 1980s and '90s and Le Mans competitors. McLaren would not disclose details, but said it was exploring funding options. A spokesman said: ""Like many other British businesses McLaren has been severely affected by the current pandemic and we are therefore exploring a variety of different funding options to help navigate these short-term business interruptions."" But it is understood a possible option is raising up to Â£300m in loans secured against McLaren's high-tech production factory and racing car collection, including those driven by the legendary Ayrton Senna. The loans would be repaid once car sales pick up and the F1 season, currently suspended, returns to normal McLaren Group consists of three divisions, the F1 racing team, the supercar operation, and the technology research arm. Group revenues last year were up 18% to Â£1.4bn. More than 90% of McLaren's supercars are exported. In addition to the HQ at Woking, McLaren has a composite materials centre in Sheffield. The company, which employs 4,000 people, is using the government's job furlough scheme. But it is thought to have had a request for aid rejected because not enough other fund-raising options had been pursued. However, Sky News,which first reported the latest development,,externalsaid that talks between McLaren and Whitehall continue. McLaren's shareholders include Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund and businessman Mansour Ojjeh. Earlier this year Paul Walsh took over as chairman. He is due to step down as chairman of FTSE 100 catering giant Compass, and his appointment at McLaren sparked speculation the company could float on the stock market.

"Nadine Dorries has deleted the post from her Twitter timeline Health minister Nadine Dorries and two other Tory MPs have been ordered to ""check the validity"" of social media posts before sharing them. Party bosses spoke to the MPs after they retweeted false allegations about Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. Sir Keir said he was satisfied with the actions taken by the party and the MPs, who have deleted the tweets. ""There are more important things in the world to concentrate on than a doctored video of me,"" he added. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""These tweets have rightly been deleted. ""The MPs involved have been spoken to by the Whips' Office and reminded of their responsibility to check the validity of information before they post on social media sites."" As director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013, Sir Keir was head of the Crown Prosecution Service, the body that decides whether or not to prosecute someone accused of a crime. The clip shared by Ms Dorries and fellow Tory MPs Maria Caulfield and Lucy Allan was from a 2013 Channel 5 interview with Sir Keir. In it, he appeared to be listing a series of reasons for not bringing charges against grooming gangs - including if the alleged victims had been in trouble with the police, or had been abusing drink or drugs. But the clip does not include the reporter's question, which asks Sir Keir about the incorrect use of guidelines being used by the authorities in the reporting and investigating of child sexual abuse allegations. As can be seen fromthe full exchange,external, Sir Keir was talking about how the police wrongly applied the guidelines, and how police culture had to change. Ms Dorries retweeted the edited clip and allegations against Sir Keir, from the right-wing @NJamesWorld account, with the one word comment ""revealing"". Labour MP and shadow Treasury minister Wes Streeting replied: ""What's revealing is that: 1. You've spread fake news and indulged a smear being promoted by the far right. 2. You had time to do this despite being a minister in the Department of Health during a public health crisis. ""It's either malevolence or stupidity. Probably both."" Former senior prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who was involved in bringing a number of cases, said the clip was being used to suggest Sir Keir did not take child sexual abuse seriously, when the opposite was true. ""As national lead, I can assure you that he and I put right the failings of a generation of those who should have safeguarded children. He inherited failure and left success,"" he tweeted. Earlier, a Labour Party source said: ""This is a doctored video tweeted by a far-right social media account. ""As a government minister, we hope Nadine Dorries acknowledges this and takes it down."" The edited video was viewed more than 239,000 times before the @NJamesWorld account was suspended. Ms Caulfield subsequently locked her Twitter account. while Ms Dorries and Ms Allan both deleted their tweets.

"This video can not be played Nineteen babies are being cared for at the Ataturk Children's Hospital The number of people who were killed in a militant attack on a maternity ward in the Afghan capital has risen to 24. Mothers, newborn babies and nurses were among the victims. At least 16 people were injured, the health ministry said. Tuesday's attack in Kabul prompted widespread condemnation. No group has said it carried it out. In a second incident that day, a suicide bomber killed at least 32 people at a funeral in Nangarhar, in the east of the country. US-Taliban deal raises hope for peace The Afghan war: The short and long story A month of killing in Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered the resumption of offensive operations against the Taliban and other groups. He accused the militants of ignoring repeated calls for a reduction in violence. Warning: Some readers may find details in this story upsetting The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack on the police commander's funeral in Nangarhar. It is still not clear who carried out the attack at the Dasht-e-Barchi hospital in Kabul, and the Taliban have denied any involvement. Allow Twitter content?

Nineteen babies have been taken to safety in a children's hospital in the city but many of their mothers are feared to be dead. In all,about 100 people were killed in violence around Afghanistan on Tuesday,external, the New York Times said. The attacks underline the fragility of peace efforts, and have dimmed hopes for an end to decades of war. Locals describe hearing two blasts then gunfire at the start of the attack at about 10:00 (05:30 GMT) on Tuesday. About 140 people were in the hospital at the time, one doctor who escaped told the BBC. The maternity ward in the hospital is run by the international medical charity MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) and some of those working there were foreigners. The hospital was attacked on Tuesday morning ""Total panic"" took hold as the assault unfolded, another doctor told AFP news agency. Ramazan Ali, a vendor who saw the attack begin, told Reuters news agency: ""The attackers were shooting at anyone in this hospital without any reason."" One mother gave birth during the attack, MSF was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Another woman called Zainab had given birth just before the attack, Reuters reports. She named her baby boy Omid, which means ""hope"" in Dari, because it had taken her years to conceive. Alerted by the commotion as she was visiting the washroom, the new mother rushed back to find her child of four hours, her hope of seven years, dead. ""I brought my daughter-in-law to Kabul so that she would not lose her baby,"" said Zahra Muhammadi, Zainab's mother-in-law, in her grief. ""Today we'll take his dead body to Bamiyan."" Afghan special forces rescued 100 women and children, including three foreigners, an official told the BBC. The three attackers, who reportedly had gained access dressed as police officers, were all killed by security personnel. Images from the scene showed soldiers carrying newborn babies swaddled in blood-stained blankets to safety. In the past, similar attacks in this mostly Shia Muslim area of the capital have been attributed to IS which, like the Taliban, is Sunni Muslim. The IS leader in South Asia and the Far East was arrestedin Kabul on Monday along with two other high-profile members, Afghan intelligence said. As well as two babies, at least 12 mothers and healthcare workers were killed In 2017, IS gunmen disguised as medical staffattacked Kabul's main military hospital, prompting widespread shock and anger and raising questions about security. The authorities later confirmed about 50 people had been killed. But the Taliban also attack hospitals. Last September, 20 people died after a truck packed with explosives was detonated by militants from the group outside a hospital in southern Zabul province. On TV, Mr Ghani said: ""In order to provide security for public places and to thwart attacks and threats from the Taliban and other terrorist groups, I'm ordering Afghan security forces to switch from an active defence mode to an offensive one and to resume their operations against the enemies."" Even in a country which has seen the worst of the worst, this savage attack on newborn babies and their mothers has shocked, and shaken fragile hope this would be the year Afghanistan would finally start to turn towards peace. Images of special forces in bulky body armour, carrying infants to safety, will remain long in the memory of those who have repeatedly called for a ceasefire - especially when Afghans are battling another deadly enemy in Covid-19. Despite Taliban denials that this ghastly attack was their work, President Ghani's denunciation reflects the anger and frustration of many. Some worry that groups like Islamic State, trying to drive an even greater wedge between Taliban and the government, have also killed for now what were slow uncertain steps toward peace talks. And for those who have never trusted the Taliban's commitment, this latest attack solidifies their resolve to keep fighting. Tuesday's attacks were widely condemned by countries around the world and human rights groups, with Amnesty International saying: ""The unconscionable war crimes in Afghanistan today... must awaken the world to the horrors civilians continue to face."" Relatives were still looking for news of their loved ones on Wednesday, a day after the attack ""Who attacks newborn babies and new mothers? Who does this?"" tweeted Debra Lyons, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""Any attack on innocents is unforgiveable, but to attack infants and women in labour... is an act of sheer evil. ""Terrorists who attack mourners lining up for prayer at a funeral are only seeking to tear apart the bonds that hold families and communities together, but they will never succeed."" According to survivors, thousands of people had gathered for the funeral in Nangarhar, and the bomb detonated about half-way through. Casualty figures have been rising since first reports of the bombing. Officials now say 133 people were injured. People help those injured during the attack on the funeral to a hospital Meanwhile, in northern Balkh province, at least 10 people were killed and many others injured in an air strike by US forces, reports said. Residents and the Taliban claimed the victims were all civilians, but the Afghan Defence Ministry said all those killed were militants. Since a February troop withdrawal agreement signed between the US and the Taliban, talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban have broken down over a prisoner swap and violence has continued unabated. The agreement was aimed at ending more than 18 years of war since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power following the 9/11 attacks on the US, whose mastermind Osama Bin Laden had been given sanctuary by the hardline Islamist group. Tens of thousands of people, most of them civilians, have been killed in the conflict. Many more have been injured or displaced from their homes.

"An AA engineer installing a perspex screen in a taxi for Uber Uber drivers and passengers in most countries will have to wear face masks from next week as the ride-hailing firm toughens its coronavirus policy. The new rule takes effect on Monday. It applies to services in the US, Canada, Mexico, India and most of Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. But the UK is not on the list, following government guidance which advises but does not require people to wear face coverings in confined spaces. Although it is not making it compulsory to wear a face mask in the UK, Uber said it had distributed free protective equipment to UK drivers, including more than a million single-use face masks, as well as 95,000 cleaning sprays. In the coming weeks, it will hand out another two million masks. ""As well as working with Unilever to provide drivers with free sanitising products, Uber is distributing millions of masks and directly reimbursing drivers if they choose to source the PPE themselves,"" an Uber spokesman told the BBC. At the same time, Uber, along with taxi firm Addison Lee, has announced new safety measures as the government looks to ease coronavirus restrictions and people return to work. Addison Lee will fit perspex partition screens between drivers and passengers across its 4,000 vehicles next week. And Uber is paying the AA to install partitions in 400 cars in Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham as part of an initial pilot. United Private Hire Drivers union wants it to be mandatory for both drivers and passengers to wear masks during journeys ""We know there is significant demand from drivers, passengers, businesses and the general public for more to be done to make transport cleaner and safer as we go back to work - including calls for the introduction of partition screens into private hire vehicles,"" said Liam Griffin, chief executive of London-based Addison Lee. ""That's why we have taken the decision to begin rolling out the installation of safety screens between drivers and passenger seats."" Uber said its pilot in the North East of England was crucial for the company to get a better understanding of how to carry passengers on journeys as safely as possible. Uber is first trialling the partition screens in areas where it has been able to gain the permission of the regulator or city council, in order to ensure that the screens are installed safely. Coronavirus: Taxi drivers demand safety screens Coronavirus: The taxi drivers left 'desperate' by the lockdown Uber says 'no sacred cows' amid coronavirus crisis On Wednesday, Transport for London (TfL) updated its guidance for taxi and private hire vehicle firms. The regulator is advising firms to have drivers and passengers socially distance, with passengers sitting in the back seats of cars. It advised drivers to carry a bottle of hand sanitiser gel in their vehicle that contains at least 60% alcohol. However, when it comes to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks, gloves or partition walls, TfL said it is waiting to hear from the London Strategic Coordination Group (SCG) on recommendations before mandating additional coronavirus prevention and control measures for taxis and private hire vehicles. The BBC understands that a number of taxi firms in the UK are seeking clarification from the government on health and safety precautions to take once the lockdown ends, and would prefer regulation rather than advice. In Wales,taxi drivers told the BBC they experience anxiety with every passenger they pick up, and are still waiting for approval from their local councils before they can make any modifications to their vehicles, such as installing a screen. ""Two months into a public health emergency which has seen private hire drivers suffer one of the highest occupational mortality rates, yet TfL and the Department for Transport (DfT) are still not taking responsibility to introduce necessary safety controls,"" James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers trade body, told the BBC. ""Poor regulatory standards and employment misclassification has become a lethal combination for desperately exploited drivers."" Taxi drivers have lost a lot of their income during the coronavirus income, as cities like Cardiff stand mostly deserted The trade body is similarly concerned that Uber is not providing partition screens to its drivers in other parts of the UK, such as London, which has the largest concentration of Uber drivers in the country. Mr Farrar wants to see Uber commit to limiting bookings to no more than two passengers per vehicle, and to make the wearing of masks mandatory for both drivers and passengers. For now, there is no evidence available that demonstrates that partitions in taxis will reduce the risk of transmitting the coronavirus. But there is some evidence that the use of cloth face coverings can help to reduce transmission of coronavirus infection where it is not possible for people to maintain a distance of 2m.

"This video can not be played Nineteen babies are being cared for at the Ataturk Children's Hospital The number of people who were killed in a militant attack on a maternity ward in the Afghan capital has risen to 24. Mothers, newborn babies and nurses were among the victims. At least 16 people were injured, the health ministry said. Tuesday's attack in Kabul prompted widespread condemnation. No group has said it carried it out. In a second incident that day, a suicide bomber killed at least 32 people at a funeral in Nangarhar, in the east of the country. US-Taliban deal raises hope for peace The Afghan war: The short and long story A month of killing in Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered the resumption of offensive operations against the Taliban and other groups. He accused the militants of ignoring repeated calls for a reduction in violence. Warning: Some readers may find details in this story upsetting The Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack on the police commander's funeral in Nangarhar. It is still not clear who carried out the attack at the Dasht-e-Barchi hospital in Kabul, and the Taliban have denied any involvement. Allow Twitter content?

Nineteen babies have been taken to safety in a children's hospital in the city but many of their mothers are feared to be dead. In all,about 100 people were killed in violence around Afghanistan on Tuesday,external, the New York Times said. The attacks underline the fragility of peace efforts, and have dimmed hopes for an end to decades of war. Locals describe hearing two blasts then gunfire at the start of the attack at about 10:00 (05:30 GMT) on Tuesday. About 140 people were in the hospital at the time, one doctor who escaped told the BBC. The maternity ward in the hospital is run by the international medical charity MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) and some of those working there were foreigners. The hospital was attacked on Tuesday morning ""Total panic"" took hold as the assault unfolded, another doctor told AFP news agency. Ramazan Ali, a vendor who saw the attack begin, told Reuters news agency: ""The attackers were shooting at anyone in this hospital without any reason."" One mother gave birth during the attack, MSF was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Another woman called Zainab had given birth just before the attack, Reuters reports. She named her baby boy Omid, which means ""hope"" in Dari, because it had taken her years to conceive. Alerted by the commotion as she was visiting the washroom, the new mother rushed back to find her child of four hours, her hope of seven years, dead. ""I brought my daughter-in-law to Kabul so that she would not lose her baby,"" said Zahra Muhammadi, Zainab's mother-in-law, in her grief. ""Today we'll take his dead body to Bamiyan."" Afghan special forces rescued 100 women and children, including three foreigners, an official told the BBC. The three attackers, who reportedly had gained access dressed as police officers, were all killed by security personnel. Images from the scene showed soldiers carrying newborn babies swaddled in blood-stained blankets to safety. In the past, similar attacks in this mostly Shia Muslim area of the capital have been attributed to IS which, like the Taliban, is Sunni Muslim. The IS leader in South Asia and the Far East was arrestedin Kabul on Monday along with two other high-profile members, Afghan intelligence said. As well as two babies, at least 12 mothers and healthcare workers were killed In 2017, IS gunmen disguised as medical staffattacked Kabul's main military hospital, prompting widespread shock and anger and raising questions about security. The authorities later confirmed about 50 people had been killed. But the Taliban also attack hospitals. Last September, 20 people died after a truck packed with explosives was detonated by militants from the group outside a hospital in southern Zabul province. On TV, Mr Ghani said: ""In order to provide security for public places and to thwart attacks and threats from the Taliban and other terrorist groups, I'm ordering Afghan security forces to switch from an active defence mode to an offensive one and to resume their operations against the enemies."" Even in a country which has seen the worst of the worst, this savage attack on newborn babies and their mothers has shocked, and shaken fragile hope this would be the year Afghanistan would finally start to turn towards peace. Images of special forces in bulky body armour, carrying infants to safety, will remain long in the memory of those who have repeatedly called for a ceasefire - especially when Afghans are battling another deadly enemy in Covid-19. Despite Taliban denials that this ghastly attack was their work, President Ghani's denunciation reflects the anger and frustration of many. Some worry that groups like Islamic State, trying to drive an even greater wedge between Taliban and the government, have also killed for now what were slow uncertain steps toward peace talks. And for those who have never trusted the Taliban's commitment, this latest attack solidifies their resolve to keep fighting. Tuesday's attacks were widely condemned by countries around the world and human rights groups, with Amnesty International saying: ""The unconscionable war crimes in Afghanistan today... must awaken the world to the horrors civilians continue to face."" Relatives were still looking for news of their loved ones on Wednesday, a day after the attack ""Who attacks newborn babies and new mothers? Who does this?"" tweeted Debra Lyons, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""Any attack on innocents is unforgiveable, but to attack infants and women in labour... is an act of sheer evil. ""Terrorists who attack mourners lining up for prayer at a funeral are only seeking to tear apart the bonds that hold families and communities together, but they will never succeed."" According to survivors, thousands of people had gathered for the funeral in Nangarhar, and the bomb detonated about half-way through. Casualty figures have been rising since first reports of the bombing. Officials now say 133 people were injured. People help those injured during the attack on the funeral to a hospital Meanwhile, in northern Balkh province, at least 10 people were killed and many others injured in an air strike by US forces, reports said. Residents and the Taliban claimed the victims were all civilians, but the Afghan Defence Ministry said all those killed were militants. Since a February troop withdrawal agreement signed between the US and the Taliban, talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban have broken down over a prisoner swap and violence has continued unabated. The agreement was aimed at ending more than 18 years of war since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power following the 9/11 attacks on the US, whose mastermind Osama Bin Laden had been given sanctuary by the hardline Islamist group. Tens of thousands of people, most of them civilians, have been killed in the conflict. Many more have been injured or displaced from their homes.

"Ed Sheeran and Mabel were among the British singer-songwriters who scored major hits in 2019 Musicians and songwriters in the UK received a record amount of money last year, but the loss of live music poses a major threat to income in 2020. The warning was issued by PRS for Music, the body that makes sure 145,000 songwriters, composers and publishers in the UK are paid when their music is played or performed around the world. The organisation collected a record Â£810m last year, a rise of 8.7%. But it said Covid-19 would result in an ""inevitable decline"" in 2020 and 2021. ""Even though we had a record-breaking year, we know very well that we're in unprecedented, unpredictable times,"" chief executive Andrea Martin told the BBC. Revenues from ""live music and public performance will be hit"" not just in 2020 but in 2021, as international payments often take time to trickle down, she said. ""There will be a downfall,"" she added. ""But by how much and by what per cent... your guess is just as good as mine."" The situation will hit smaller acts, many of whom were already struggling before the pandemic, the hardest. PRS processed 18.8 trillion ""performances"" of music last year, including streams, downloads, radio and TV broadcasts, and music played in pubs, clubs, hairdressers and concert venues. UK songwriters contributed to many of the year's most-played hits, including like Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi, Old Town Road by Lil Nas X and Don't Call Me Up by Mabel. Live music generated Â£54m in royalties, up Â£15m since 2018. Revenues were boosted by major tours from the Spice Girls, Sir Elton John, Ed Sheeran and the return of Glastonbury after a fallow year in 2018. But with an entire summer of festivals cancelled and dozens of major tours postponed until 2021, that figure will be impossible to recreate in next year's results. The Spice Girls' reunion tour grossed Â£78m last year, but this summer's stadium concerts have been cancelled Last week, UK Music revealed the contribution of live music to the UK economy is set to drop in 2020 from an estimated Â£1.1bn to Â£200m, describing it as a ""catastrophic"" blow to the industry. Meanwhile, the Ivors Academy of songwriters and composers said it anticipated a loss of Â£25,000 per member over a six-month period. The lockdown also means songwriters will lose out on royalties gathered when their music is played in shops, cinemas, pubs, clubs and restaurants. In 2019, that figure was Â£168.2m. There is some good news, however. Royalties from music streaming rose 22.1% to Â£155m, while the money generated from music on video-on-demand services like Amazon and Netflix increased 47.5% to Â£17.7m. Early figures suggest more people have taken out streaming subscriptions during the lockdown, which may provide a small counterweight to the loss of live music. But many musicians have noted that the money they receive from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon is not enough to sustain a career. Tom Gray from indie band Gomez recently shared a chart, originally compiled by The Trichordist, showing how many streams artists require to make a living in the UK. On YouTube, a song would have to be played 7,267 times to generate Â£8.72 - or one hour of minimum wage. On Spotify, the figure was 3,114 streams, and on Apple Music 1,615 streams.

That has led to a campaign, #BrokenRecord, seeking a more equitable system of distributing streaming money. Spearheaded by the Ivors Academy and the Musicians' Union, it is calling for a new system, where your subscription fee is distributed to the artists you actually listen to - rather than going into a central pot, where money is split between the most-streamed songs on a percentage basis. ""This is what the consumer wants,""said Graham Davies of the Ivors Academy,external, who is calling for a government-backed review. ""They want their Â£9.99 a month to be paid to the artists, performers, songwriters and composers of the music they love."" In the meantime, the PRS Emergency Relief Fund has raised more than Â£2.1m to help members who have lost income as a result of Covid-19. Martin says 1,600 songwriters have applied for assistance in the last week alone. Another Â£5m fund, set up by the charity Help Musicians, ran out of cash within a week after being launched in March. Trade body UK Music has subsequently called on the government to set up a new taskforce to revive the music industry as it navigates the pandemic.

Sam FrancisBBC News, London Researchers at one of London's top universities have been awarded funding to create experimental adaptors allowing snorkels to be used by frontline healthcare workers. Scientists and Engineers at Imperial College London are hoping to create connectors using 3D printers that would allow snorkels, or similar facemasks, to be used during higher risk procedures and highly infectious environments, such as A&Es. Snorkels ""are ideal as they provide a breathing filter as well
as full eye protection"", A spokesman for Imperial College said. They are also fully cleanable and reusable, and
therefore can be used where there are shortages of normal masks. If the designs are
successful the team will make their findings freely available
for the international community to replicate the printing process. One in 400 people in England has coronavirus, a survey of nearly 11,000 people in households suggests. They were asked to carry out swab tests over two weeks up to 10 May. This means about 148,000 people in England could currently be infected - 0.27% of the population. Those tested did not include hospital patients or people living in care home where rates of Covid-19 are likely to be much higher,figures from the Office for National Statistics show,external. The relaxation of lockdown measures could lead to further flouting of social distancing rules,a nurse has warned. Louise Wigginton, a specialist respiratory nurse working in an intensive care Covid-19 Red Zone in central London, said she was left feeling upset and unappreciated after seeing groups of people drinking and socialising in a park directly outside the hospital's intensive care unit. ""They were sunbathing, drinking and meeting in large groups,"" the 29-year-old said. ""My colleagues and I said to one another, 'can they not see us up here?'. ""This was the realisation that people are already not listening to the rules and now that lockdown is softened, it will only get worse."" Honda has saidit will restart production at its UK car plant next month.

"A healthcare professional in Italy shows a test tube with blood for a serological test that can identify who has contracted Covid-19 and has produced antibodies. A new ""fast and accurate"" coronavirus antibody test has been developed by scientists in Scotland and Switzerland. Quotien said each serological screening machine has capacity for up to 3,000 tests a day and produces results in 35 minutes with 99.8% accuracy. The blood-screening firm is now keen to hold talks with UK ministers amid interest from Europe for the machines. The Scottish government said it will explore ""all options"" as they become available. Quotient said the test can spot whether a person has developed antibodies to Covid-19. Understanding immunity could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus. Chief executive Franz Walt was managing director of the Singapore-based Roche Laboratory which developed the first diagnostic test for Sars in 2003. He said: ""We are truly proud to have developed such a fast and accurate test. This is an outstanding performance by our teams in both Edinburgh and Switzerland. ""We now want to make sure that we can help as many people as possible as quickly as possible. We have strong roots in the UK and want to speak to ministers there so MosaiQ can be used in the amazing national effort to tackle coronavirus and relaunch the economy. ""We realise ministers and the NHS are incredibly busy but are keen to talk given the strong interest from across Europe in the product."" Quotient said it has 12 screening machines available which can process up to 36,000 tests a day or 252,000 a week. A further 20 are expected to be ready by the end of the year. The firm's headquarters are in Eysins, Nyon, but its Scottish research division is based in Penicuik, Midlothian. It also has a corporate office in Edinburgh. While the UK government says it has laboratory capability to test for coronavirus immunity, it is currently being used for survey testing of existing blood samples and the capacity is not known. It is also attempting to develop home testing kits, rather than requiring analysis in laboratories, but so far these have proved unreliable. On Friday, Quotient received European regulatory approval for the MosaiQ serological screening machines. It claims they have 100% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity, meaning there is a low chance of a misread or ""false positive"". Ed Farrell, chief operating officer at the Edinburgh office, said: ""We're incredibly proud of all our work here in Scotland and Switzerland. ""We've got such a rich history here and we hope we can now make a difference at this challenging time."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Health Protection Scotland, with key partners, explore all options around new antibody tests as they become available on the market. ""The Scottish government is working closely with the UK government to ensure that everyone is able to access new antibody tests when they become available. ""It is essential that any new tests are reliable, and time is needed to undertake rigorous evaluation so that there is confidence that tests are accurate.""

"Some people across the UK have been able to form household support bubbles or extended households. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is a group of people with whom you have close physical contact. Bubbles must be ""exclusive"". Once in one, you can't start another with a different household. If you decide to change your bubble, you should treat your previous bubble as a separate household for 10 days before forming a new one. People in a bubble can stay overnight in each other's homes, visit outdoors places together and do not have to socially distance. In England, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household. The second household can be of any size and can include ""at risk"" peoplewho may be shielding. Wherever possible, the government recommends that a support bubble should be with another local household to avoid unnecessary travel. Anyone in the bubble contacted as part of England'stest and trace programmemust stay at home. If they develop coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. The governmentexpanded the eligibility,externalof support bubbles in England on 2 December to help families with very young children or people with continuous care needs. This means households can form a support bubble with another household, if at least one of them has: a child under 1 (regardless of how many other adults are in the household) a child under 5 with a disability that requires continuous care (regardless of how many other adults are in the household) a single adult carer (living with any additional adults in the household that have a disability and need continuous care) As well as the support bubble rules, the government in England also has a set of rules that apply to families with children under 14 (as well as to vulnerable adults). They can form a childcare bubble with one other household to provide informal (unpaid and unregistered) childcare. This must always be between the same two households. Childcare can be provided in either or both of the two homes. During lockdown,registered childcare and childcare bubbles can continue.,external Two single people each living alone can bubble Someone in a houseshare could bubble - but their housemates wouldn't be allowed to form their own bubbles with other people Full government guidelinesfor England are here.,external In Wales, during lockdown, you must not visit other households, or meet other people you do not live with, unless they are in yoursupport bubble,external. Support bubbles can be formed by: households where one adult lives alone households where one adult lives with any number of children under 18, or households where more than one adult lives, but one adult has caring responsibilities for all of the other adults in the home People in the same bubble can stay in each other's homes overnight. And they can meet up in groups in some other outdoor places. If you were part of a temporary extended household during the firebreak period, or were in one before that, you can make a new bubble, instead. However, once you have agreed and joined that new extended household, neither household can leave to form a new one. Under the five tier system in Scotland,external, people who live on their own or only with children under 18 can form an extended household with people from one other household. People in extended households are counted as one household, and so can continue to meet and socialise with each other despite general restrictions on households mixing, and can stay overnight in each other's homes. Couples who do not live together can also form an extended household, which can include any children they each live with. A household must not form an extended household with more than one other. However, one of them can end the arrangement at any time, and - as long as they wait at least 14 days - then form a new extended household with someone else. If any member of an extended household develops symptoms or tests positive for Covid, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. Two households of any size can form a support bubble. The members can spend time indoors and stay overnight with each other. Under the latest restrictions, these bubbles are limited to a maximum of 10 people, including children, at any one time. Read more fromthe Northern Ireland Executive here.,external Before the latest lockdown, schools across the UK have been usingyear group and/or class bubblesto support social distancing and reduce close contact between pupils as much as possible. Maintaining distinct groups which do not mix makes it quicker and easier when a positive case occurs to identify those who may need to self-isolate and minimise their number.

"An AA engineer installing a perspex screen in a taxi for Uber Uber drivers and passengers in most countries will have to wear face masks from next week as the ride-hailing firm toughens its coronavirus policy. The new rule takes effect on Monday. It applies to services in the US, Canada, Mexico, India and most of Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. But the UK is not on the list, following government guidance which advises but does not require people to wear face coverings in confined spaces. Although it is not making it compulsory to wear a face mask in the UK, Uber said it had distributed free protective equipment to UK drivers, including more than a million single-use face masks, as well as 95,000 cleaning sprays. In the coming weeks, it will hand out another two million masks. ""As well as working with Unilever to provide drivers with free sanitising products, Uber is distributing millions of masks and directly reimbursing drivers if they choose to source the PPE themselves,"" an Uber spokesman told the BBC. At the same time, Uber, along with taxi firm Addison Lee, has announced new safety measures as the government looks to ease coronavirus restrictions and people return to work. Addison Lee will fit perspex partition screens between drivers and passengers across its 4,000 vehicles next week. And Uber is paying the AA to install partitions in 400 cars in Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham as part of an initial pilot. United Private Hire Drivers union wants it to be mandatory for both drivers and passengers to wear masks during journeys ""We know there is significant demand from drivers, passengers, businesses and the general public for more to be done to make transport cleaner and safer as we go back to work - including calls for the introduction of partition screens into private hire vehicles,"" said Liam Griffin, chief executive of London-based Addison Lee. ""That's why we have taken the decision to begin rolling out the installation of safety screens between drivers and passenger seats."" Uber said its pilot in the North East of England was crucial for the company to get a better understanding of how to carry passengers on journeys as safely as possible. Uber is first trialling the partition screens in areas where it has been able to gain the permission of the regulator or city council, in order to ensure that the screens are installed safely. Coronavirus: Taxi drivers demand safety screens Coronavirus: The taxi drivers left 'desperate' by the lockdown Uber says 'no sacred cows' amid coronavirus crisis On Wednesday, Transport for London (TfL) updated its guidance for taxi and private hire vehicle firms. The regulator is advising firms to have drivers and passengers socially distance, with passengers sitting in the back seats of cars. It advised drivers to carry a bottle of hand sanitiser gel in their vehicle that contains at least 60% alcohol. However, when it comes to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks, gloves or partition walls, TfL said it is waiting to hear from the London Strategic Coordination Group (SCG) on recommendations before mandating additional coronavirus prevention and control measures for taxis and private hire vehicles. The BBC understands that a number of taxi firms in the UK are seeking clarification from the government on health and safety precautions to take once the lockdown ends, and would prefer regulation rather than advice. In Wales,taxi drivers told the BBC they experience anxiety with every passenger they pick up, and are still waiting for approval from their local councils before they can make any modifications to their vehicles, such as installing a screen. ""Two months into a public health emergency which has seen private hire drivers suffer one of the highest occupational mortality rates, yet TfL and the Department for Transport (DfT) are still not taking responsibility to introduce necessary safety controls,"" James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers trade body, told the BBC. ""Poor regulatory standards and employment misclassification has become a lethal combination for desperately exploited drivers."" Taxi drivers have lost a lot of their income during the coronavirus income, as cities like Cardiff stand mostly deserted The trade body is similarly concerned that Uber is not providing partition screens to its drivers in other parts of the UK, such as London, which has the largest concentration of Uber drivers in the country. Mr Farrar wants to see Uber commit to limiting bookings to no more than two passengers per vehicle, and to make the wearing of masks mandatory for both drivers and passengers. For now, there is no evidence available that demonstrates that partitions in taxis will reduce the risk of transmitting the coronavirus. But there is some evidence that the use of cloth face coverings can help to reduce transmission of coronavirus infection where it is not possible for people to maintain a distance of 2m.

"People in Wales join the eighth weekly 'clap for carers' to pay tribute to NHS staff and other key workers A police and crime commissioner has criticised the first minister for not increasing fines for those found breaking lockdown rules The five local council areas with the highest death rate for Covid-19 are among those with the greatest proportion of deprivation in Wales. Taxi drivers are urging councils to push through greater in-car safety measures to guard against the virus. A further 10 deaths of people with Covid-19 in Wales have been confirmed, bringing the total to 1,164, according to Public Health Wales on Thursday Rachel Flint, George Herd, Rhiannon Beacham and Andy Roberts That's it for our live page coverage today.

The pavement on Castle Street in Cardiff city centre will be widened on Sunday to help social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak. The work will involve the traffic lane next to Cardiff Castle being removed so there is more space for both pedestrians and cyclists to use. This new shared space will run from the Cathedral Road/Cowbridge Road junction, over Canton Bridge, along Castle Street, Duke Street and up to the North Road-Boulevard De Nantes junction. Cardiff Council said: ""This is the first city-centre project that will be installed to keep the public safe and able to socially distance on the highway network."" Earlier works were introduced around Roath Park Lake to create a one-way footpath to aid social distancing, as well as the removal of visitor parking bays nearest to the lake to provide additional space for cyclists and joggers. Councillor Caro Wild said a similar scheme on Wood Street is ""currently being looked into"", while a pilot scheme to enable better social distancing in shopping areas at Wellfield Road in Plasnewydd is expected soon. ""It's not possible for us to transform all public space in the city overnight, but we are doing all that we can, with the resources available, to bring in these social-distancing schemes as quickly as possible,"" she added. The pavement on Cardiff's Castle Street will be widened from Sunday Wales ismore exposed than many other parts of the UK to the economic impact of the coronavirus, according to a research group. The Learning and Work Institute Cymru said almost one in five workers in Wales are employed in sectors that have been shut down during the outbreak. It now fears unemployment could rise to its highest level since devolution. Young people, women and those with few qualifications are most at risk, researchers found. Wales has a higher proportion (18%) of workers employed in industries most affected by lockdown measures, than both England and Northern Ireland, according to the institute, while Scotland has the same. It fears that if just a quarter of those 250,000 people lose their job, it would see unemployment in Wales reach a higher level than during the last recession following the financial crisis of 2008.

"Many of Wales' poorest areas have been hardest hit by the pandemic The coronavirus death rate continues to disproportionately affect the most deprived areas in Wales, analysis of the latest figures has shown. The five local authorities with the highest mortality rate are also among those with the greatest proportion of deprivation in Wales.ã Youth worker Charlotte McCarthy said staying home was a ""luxury"". ""If you're able to work from home, you're fortunate to have the means to do that,"" she added. Charlotte works in Cardiff with a group called Action in Caerau and Ely (Ace). Ace is delivering food each day to 50 homes during the pandemic A recentbreakdown by the Office for National Statistics,externalsuggested Caerau West alone had seen 13 coronavirus-related deaths. Before the pandemic, Ace was supporting working families who needed extra support, now it regularly distributes three bags each to about 50 homes. ""The people we work with were balancing multiple jobs, on zero-hour contracts, low pay and just trying to make ends meet,"" she said. Charlotte said some people face a choice between going to work and risking their health Now, she explains, many have to weigh up whether to put themselves at risk to pay the bills, or cope with less money to protect their health. ""If you're coming into contact with people, you're at risk and if you've got to do 30 or 40 hours a week to get that sort of income, then 30 or 40 hours a week you're at risk. ""It looks very different to people in other areas who have got computers and internet at home. ""Within our area, I know that there have been quite high deaths through the coronavirus [but also] male suicides as well. It's been a shock and I think that's down to financial issues and people struggling."" ""Sometimes people don't know where to get help,"" said councillor Majid Rahman Newport councillor Majid Rahman represents the Victoria ward - which saw 11 coronavirus deaths in the latest figures. The densely populated area is a mix of middle-class families, single professionals and many on low incomes too, he said. He is acutely aware of the loss many have gone through - including his brother's father-in-law. He said there were a variety of factors, but poverty, housing and employment were hard to ignore. ""People are on low wages, in the gig economy, or taxi drivers. They don't have access to big companies that can give them that extra support or help financially and sometimes they don't know where to get help from the government."" Higher virus deaths in poorer areas - ONS What do the figures tell us in Wales? Coronavirus: How many people have died in the UK? He has also been exploringwhy the black, Asian and ethnic minority communities have been particularly hard hit. ""Those people have come into contact with someone with Covid-19, they go back home to a large family - because most Asian communities live in large household units - and may then pass it on to the rest of the family,"" he said. Many of Wales' most deprived areas have seen the highest death rates from coronavirus The death rate, per 100,000 population, according to the latest figures from PHW(as of 12 May) Rhondda Cynon Taff 83.7 Blaenau Gwent 80.3 Newport 78.2 Merthyr Tydfil 78 Cardiff 72 Local authorities with the highest proportion of areas in the most deprived 10% in Wales Newport 24.2 Merthyr 22.2 Cardiff 18.2 Rhondda Cynon Taff 17.5 Neath Port Talbot 15.4 Blaenau Gwent 12.8 Julie said the Rhondda's strength is the people who live there Julie Edwards works for a community group in Ynyshir and Wattstown in Rhondda Cynon Taff. They have delivered more than 500 packs to people in the area - including treats, books and gifts for children. Recent ONS analysis showed 15 confirmed deaths locally, though deaths at care homes may affect the local picture. While Rhondda Cynon Taff includes one of the highest number of most deprived wards, Julie says its real strength is its people. ""A lot of small villages in the valleys communities have become more fractured over the years and I think something like this - as tragic as it is - has actually helped them to come back together,"" she said.

"Anti-vax videos have been widely shared online We've been fact-checking the most widely shared dubious coronavirus claims this week. First, we've looked at a widely shared video posted on YouTube that claims changes introduced in UK law give the government the power to enforce vaccinations as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Under current UK law, however, this is not the case - vaccines are not compulsory. The presenter of the video has a copy of thePublic Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984,external, which applies in England and Wales. This legislation gives the government powers to prevent, control or mitigate the spread of an infection or contamination. However, it explicitly states that regulationscannot require a person to undertake medical treatment, including vaccination,external. The Coronavirus Act,externalintroduced in March 2020 extended this prohibition to Scotland and Northern Ireland. The current legislation ""makes explicitly clear that the power to make such regulations does not include mandatory treatment or vaccination,external"", says Louise Hooper, a barrister at Garden Court Chambers in London. Where we're at with a vaccine Why are people sceptical about vaccines? The video also claims the government has sweeping powers to detain people believed to be infectious with the virus. It's true there are powers in existing UK law to prevent the spread of disease, such as requiring someone to self-isolate if potentially infectious. ""These are wide-ranging, however, there are important limitations on all of these powers,"" says Louise Hooper. The person must be told why they are being told to isolate, it's limited to 14 days and can be appealed against to a magistrate. This can sometimes be extended but then must be reviewed every 24 hours. In the jargon of this next widely shared video, the global Covid-19 pandemic is a ""plandemic"", suggesting it was a planned event. So popular has this online film become that the term was, for a while, a top-trending search in the US. It has clocked up millions of views - #Plandemic has been tweeted tens of thousands of times. The video is filled with medical misinformation about the origins of the virus and how it is spread. It contains an interview with researcher Judy Mikovits, well-known for her anti-vaccination activism, who claims Covid-19 was not ""naturally occurring"" and was ""manipulated"" in a laboratory. This is a widely shared idea,but there is no scientific evidence for it. Several versions of the film have been removed by YouTube, which says the video has ""content that includes medically unsubstantiated diagnostic advice for Covid-19"". Other social networks have also been taking it down. Despite these efforts to remove it, users have been widely re-posting the video. Along with a host of false health claims (such as treating patients with hot water, Vitamin C and sunshine), another video, this one viewed more than a million times on YouTube also claims that a patent for the genome sequence of the new coronavirus was taken out long before the latest outbreak began. This rumour has been swirling around online for months, suggesting the release of a previously known virus. However, the ""coronavirus patent"" referred to in the video was one that was applied for in 2006 for the genome sequence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) - a different type of coronavirus.  The application was ultimately not pursued. The video then refers to the existence of a patent for a ""coronavirus vaccine"" - one held by the British-based Pirbright Institute. The video fails to mention that this is linked to a different coronavirus that affects poultry. The Pirbright Institute receives some funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This has contributed to the baseless but widespread online rumours that Bill Gates holds a patent for a Covid-19 vaccine. No, Bernie. Trump is not selling coronavirus coins The beautiful message that Bill Gates didnât send Who spreads 'fake news'? How bad information goes viral The big rap singalong that never happened We've looked previously at a herbal tea being promoted by President Andry Rajoelina of the island nation of Madagascar as atreatment for coronavirus. The drink, produced under the name Covid Organics, is now being widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa despite a lack of scientific testing. Among those pinning their hopes on the tonic is Tanzania's president John Magufuli, whoordered a plane to the island to pick up supplies, as have Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau. Authorities in Gabon and Comoros have also expressed intentions to import Covid Organics to use as a remedy. And the Covid-19 task force in the Democratic Republic of Congo have said they intend to produce their own treatment using Covid Organics as a base. The WHO has issued a warning in response to the production of the Covid Organics drink, that all traditional remedies and plants should be tested for efficacy and adverse side-effects. ""Africans deserve to use medicines tested to the same standards as people in the rest of the world,"" it said in a statement. A recent video of a doctor from Paraguay shared thousands of times on Facebook claims a substance known as ""miracle mineral supplement"" (MMS) can help prevent Covid-19. It containschlorine dioxide, a bleaching agent, and health authorities have warned of the dangers of drinking it. MMS products have been widely promoted on social media both in Latin America and in the United States, where they regularly appear in YouTube videos as treatments for a wide range of illnesses. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has said it's ""not aware of any scientific evidence supporting their safety or effectiveness and they pose significant risks to patient health"". The FDA adds there have beenreports of life-threatening consequences,externalfrom drinking chlorine dioxide products.

A checkpoint in Aden, Yemen There have been 385 deaths over the past week of people with ""coronavirus-like symptoms"" in Aden, Yemen, according to figures reported by the Save the Children organisation. The group said such deaths in Aden appeared to have increased fivefold in a week. Only 72 cases and 13 virus-related deaths have officially been confirmed in the war-ravaged country but Save the Children said it appeared the pandemic was ""getting a grip"" on Yemen. The testing rate is extremely low with only four labs nationwide able to carry out the diagnostics. âOur teams on the ground are seeing how people are being sent away from hospitals, breathing heavily or even collapsing. People are dying because they canât get treatment that would normally save their lives,"" the group said in a statement. It added that there were only 500 ventilators in Yemen.

People waiting outside McDonald's in New York City's Times Square yesterday McDonald's has released guidelines for how its restaurants should reopen dining areas in the US. Staff will wear masks and gloves, child play areas will be closed, and some seating will be inaccessible to promote social distancing. Some of the fast food restaurants will even offer masks to customers in cities where they are required. Despite the guidelines, McDonald's has not said when it will reopen eating areas across the US. In the UK, the fast food chain yesterday reopened 15 of its branches for delivery, and it plans to open some drive-thrus next week. Figures released by NHS England have provided a breakdown of specific pre-existing health conditions among those to have died with Covid-19. It showed thatmore than one in four,external(26%) patients who died with Covid-19 in hospitals in England between 31 March and 12 May had diabetes.
Of the 22,332 patients who died, 5,873 had the condition. Meanwhile, 18% of those who died had dementia, 15% had chronic pulmonary disease, and 14% had chronic kidney disease.

They say a fuller picture may only emerge over a longer period of time. There is a shortage of the plastic sheets used to make clear screens that employers have been advised to install for workplace safety, the BBC has learned. Supermarkets have fitted screens at checkouts and government guidance has advised other workplaces, from labs to factories, to take a similar approach, but a spike in demand has led to shortages of plastic sheets. Chris Marmion, managing director of Plastic Shop Screens, told the BBC's Wake up to Money: ""It's quite simple. There isn't enough [plastic] coming into the country to meet the current demand. Come a couple of weeks, I think there may definitely be a shortage.""
