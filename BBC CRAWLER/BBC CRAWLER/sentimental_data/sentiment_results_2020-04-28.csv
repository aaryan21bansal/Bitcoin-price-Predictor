"The captain of the HMS Trenchant has been sacked following an inquiry by the Royal Navy The commander of a nuclear-powered submarine who allowed his crew to hold a barbecue party has been sacked. Cdr Jonathan Lewis, captain of hunter-killer submarine HMS Trenchant, allowed the party during the lockdown at Devonport dockyard in Plymouth. A video shared on social media showed the crew dancing and laughing on the dockside after the submarine returned to the city for repairs. The captain has been relieved of his command following a Royal Navy probe. HMS Trenchant had been on patrol before having to return to Devonport to undergo repairs Naval sources told the BBC that Cdr Lewis had been advised both by his senior officers on shore and some of his own officers on the submarine not to go ahead with the party. A senior defence source said it was one of a number of instances that had undermined trust and credibility in his command. Cdr Lewis will remain in the Royal Navy but will be assigned another role.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Scottish government suggests covering face in shops and public transport The Scottish government has recommended people cover their faces while in some enclosed public spaces, such as shops and public transport. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there could be ""some benefit"" in wearing a cloth face covering in places where social distancing was difficult. But she said it was ""not a substitute"" for existing lockdown restrictions. Downing Street said UK ministers were considering the scientific evidence for introducing similar advice. The prime minister's official spokesman said a review had been carried out by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), adding: ""Once a decision has been reached then we'll announce it publicly."" The Scottish government guidance is not mandatory and will not be enforced by the authorities. UK sees weekly deaths double normal levels Latest on coronavirus in Scotland,external Should we all be covering our faces now? Ms Sturgeon stressed that the advice related to cloth garments such as a scarf rather than ""medical grade facemasks"" like those used by health and care workers. The first minister said evidence about the usefulness of face coverings was ""limited"", but that there may be ""some benefit in wearing a face covering if you enter an enclosed space where you will come into contract with multiple people and safe social distancing is difficult"". She said: ""To be clear, the benefit comes mainly in cases where someone might have the virus but is not aware of that because they are not experiencing symptoms and thus not isolating completely. ""Wearing a face covering in those circumstances may reduce the risk of that person transmitting the virus to others."" Ms Sturgeon said there was no evidence to suggest that wearing a face covering outdoors was of any benefit. The first minister warned that she did not want people to ""think they are invincible"" while covering their face in enclosed spaces such as shops. She said: ""It may do some good in limited circumstances, but it cannot and should not be seen as a substitute for the other rules and guidelines."" The Scottish government's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch,said earlier this monththere was ""no evidence"" to support members of the public wearing protective face masks. The government advice says face coverings should not be used by people with asthma or children under the age of two. It adds: ""When applying or removing the covering, it is important that you wash your hands first and avoid touching your face. ""After each use, you must wash the face covering at 60 degrees centigrade, or dispose of it safely."" Read the full government guidance here,external The guidance also says that it is ""not being made mandatory and will not be enforced at this stage"" due to the ""relatively weak"" evidence of the impact of face coverings on transmission of the virus. However, Ms Sturgeon said this would be kept under review as the government considers how to ease lockdown restrictions. The key factor in the Scottish decision is what's called ""asymptomatic transmission"" - people who are infected but not showing symptoms passing on the virus to others. Almost a month ago, US government assessed the latest research into this risk and concluded that the public should cover their faces when in confined spaces. A study in Singapore had found evidence that coronavirus had been spread by people who had not realised they were infected. In particular scientists identified the possibility of the virus being passed in a two-day period before symptoms started to show. Dozens of governments are now urging - or ordering - their citizens to cover their faces in an effort to reduce this route of infection. As Nicola Sturgeon said, this is not about urging people to rush out to buy professional-grade masks - these are designed to protect medical and care staff and should be reserved for them. Instead, as in the US, the idea is to devise your own covering, not so much to protect you and as to protect others where distancing isn't possible. The UK's government's scientific advisers weighed up the evidence last week and we're now waiting to see whether ministers decide to follow the Scottish example. What is happening in other countries? Americans have been advised to use clean cloth or fabric to cover their faces Other countries have brought in different rules around the wearing of face masks. They are to become compulsory on public transportin Germany, andin supermarkets and pharmacies in Austria. Residents in Lombardy in Italymust cover their nose and mouth,externalwhen outside and the French governmentplans to give out masks to the general public.,external Air passengers in Canadamust wear a non-medical mask or a face covering,,externaland in the USA,people are advised to wear,external""cloth face coverings"" in supermarkets and pharmacies. Should we all be covering our faces now? This video can not be played Should I wear a mask to stop coronavirus? Ms Sturgeon also announced that all over-70s in Scotland will now be tested for Covid-19 on admission to hospital. They will also be tested every four days throughout their stay. The latest figures show that 10,721 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, of which 1,754 people are in hospital, and 126 are in intensive care - figures which Ms Sturgeon said ""continue to give us case for cautious optimism"". Ms Sturgeon said a further 70 people who had tested positive for the virus have died, bringing the total under that measure to 1,332. Wider statistics including deaths where Covid-19 was a suspected cause will be published on Wednesday. Ms Sturgeon said: ""These numbers are not and never will be seen as just statistics - behind each and everyone of these numbers is a unique and irreplaceable individual whose loss is a source of grief for their friends and family.""

"Hatice Cengiz has called on the Premier League to block the takeover The fiancÃ©e of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi has urged the Premier League to block the takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi, a dissident Saudi columnist, was killed in 2018 inside Saudi Arabia's consulate in Turkey. Western intelligence agencies believe Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered his death - which he denies. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, led by the prince, looks set to acquire an 80% stake in the club. But lawyers speaking on behalf of Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, said the takeover should be blocked over the killing. Newcastle were 13th in the Premier League when football was suspended indefinitely amid the coronavirus pandemic Mike Ashley has owned Newcastle since 2007 and put the club up for sale in 2017. The proposed Saudi takeover is thought to be worth some Â£300 million. But it has already caused much controversy. Who are the main people involved in the potential deal? Premier League warned over takeover The Saudi government has been accused of facilitating the theft of Premier League commercial rights, while Amnesty International has criticised the potential deal due to the country's dire human rights record. The country has also been accused of ""sportswashing"", a term used to describe countries that try to improve their international reputation by investing in major teams or hosting big sporting events. But these accusations have been rebuffed by the Saudi government, which claims it wants to get more of its people engaged in sport. Lawyers for Ms Cengiz said in a letter on her behalf that the Premier League should block the takeover. ""It is undoubtedly the right, proper and lawful action for you (chief executive Richard Masters) and the Premier League to take, especially in light of the ruthless killing of Ms Cengiz's fiancÃ©e,"" the letter said. There should be no place in English football for anyone ""involved in such abhorrent acts"", it said. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" ""The standing of both the Premiership and English football in general would be tarnished by your connection with those who commit the most appalling crimes and then seek to whitewash them, and who seek to use English football as a way of improving their image and hiding their transgressions."" The journalist - who had gone into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017 - went to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018, seeking papers to marry Ms Cengiz. The secret tapes of Jamal Khashoggi's murder Jamal Khashoggi: All you need to know about his death Investigators believe that as she waited outside, the 59-year-old was murdered and then dismembered. Khashoggi's remains have never been found. The gruesome killing shocked the world and UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard said there was credible evidence that Crown Prince Mohammed and other high-level Saudi officials were individually liable. A court in Saudi Arabia last year sentenced five people to death and jailed three others over his murder. Turkey has separately charged 20 suspects over the murder.

"Scotland's first minister says the government is advising the use of face coverings in some circumstances Nicola Sturgeon says the coverings will not be mandatory ""right now"" but the policy might be reviewed and could be ""tougher"" in the future However, she adds that she doesn't want people ""pointing the finger"" at those who do not wear them and it is not something the ""police will stop you for"" A minute's silence has been held for key workers who have died during the pandemic Both the number of hospital admissions and intensive care patients falls, however, there have been a further 70 deaths registered overnight An expert tells virtual health committee not enough emphasis has been put on testing for Covid-19 BBC Scotland News Here are some of the day's developments: We'll be back early on Wednesday will our live coverage of key developments, including the weekly release of National Records of Scotland figures which give a fuller picture of coronavirus cases and deaths other than those in hospitals.

Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Professor Hugh Pennington says we could be ""past halfway for bad outcomes"", referring to new infections and deaths, but says maintaining lockdown restrictions successfully and combating the virus in care homes will be major factors. ""I hope we are at a point where we would start to see the
number of cases and deaths declining,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""Maybe we are at more than the halfway
point for bad outcomes, maybe a good bit further. ""Itâs really difficult to know
if we can sustain the controls we have at the moment. If we are lucky, it will
fall quite fast but that depends on social distancing and making sure people
donât get tired with it. ""We also need to get a grip on infections in care homes, we need to put an enormous effort in there."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Professor Hugh Pennington was talking to Holyroodâs Health Committee this morning, stressing the importance of mass testing in the fight against Covid-19. On BBC Radio Scotlandâs Drivetime, the microbiologist said he was âa bit scepticalâ on the new guidance on the use of face coverings in situations where it is difficult to observe social distancing. He says itâs not going to protect the wearer and it would only have a very limited role in preventing somebody who is infected from passing on the virus. Ben PhilipBBC Scotland Golf has been a casualty of the coronavirus pandemic with courses up and down the country closed and tournaments cancelled. In the âhome of golfâ - St Andrews - many are reliant on the golf tourists who generate millions for the Scottish economy every year. Caddie Master Fraser Riddle has set up an online fundraising page to try to compensate colleagues whose opportunity to earn money ""is severely affected"" due to the restrictions currently on the course and on international travel. You can see a full report on this onReporting Scotland on BBC One at 1830. Here are the main points from today's Scottish government briefing: Ms Sturgeon stressed she was talking about cloth face coverings, not medical-grade face masks Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Chief Nursing Officer Fiona McQueen is on BBC Radio Scotland repeating today's advice on the use of facial coverings in shops or on public transport. ""This does not replace social distancing or only going out when it is absolutely necessary and washing your hands,"" she stresses. ""When it should matter is only in a small set of circumstances because what we are hoping for and expecting is for people to socially distance when they are doing their shopping."" Ms Queen underlines that there is ""no benefit"" in wearing such a covering outside and that it is not mandatory to do so while shopping or on a bus, adding that people not wearing them ""should not be criticised"". The public are being told they should definitely not be wearing surgical masks, which could ""potentially deprive"" key workers. ""It can be a scarf or a t-shirt, we don't want people to go to any real bother or expense,"" says Ms McQueen. Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor on Drivetime The first minister is announcing new guidance but it's the caveats and qualifications that come to the fore. One of the reasons given for today's announcement on face coverings was that people are already wearing them and she wants to stress the limitation of their use. She doesn't sound remotely convinced, but it's happening anyway and she'd rather it happen with guidance.""  Morag KinniburghBBC Scotland Medics and their children have made a film to reduce fears young patients may have about being treated by people wearing masks.

"Fast food fans have been buoyed by news that burger chain McDonald's is testing reopening a branch this week. The bad news for hungry folk is that the branch will only open for ""operational tests"" and remain closed to customers. The chain said: ""Recently, we began working through a potential and limited reopening."" But it refused to put a date on when customers would be able to pick up a Happy Meal again. Shops preparing ways to reopen Greggs to begin reopening shops Major takeaway chains start to reopen ""Restarting our business is not an easy task, even when reopening in a limited capacity,"" said Paul Pomroy, McDonald's UK and Ireland chief executive. ""For now we remain closed, and will only reopen when we are absolutely confident we can have the right measures in place to ensure everyone's well-being."" Rumours began circulating that the chain would soon be serving up its popular Big Mac meals last week afterthe Irish Farmers Journal reported that some branches would reopen,externalin May. The restaurant group says it is keen to reopen branches as soon as it can, but it won't rush into doing so. ""We have been listening to our employees and customers as well as engaging with government and trade bodies to help ensure we do this responsibly, when the time is right,"" said Mr Pomroy. He said McDonald's had set itself some key criteria for reopening, all of which take time. These include ensuring the well-being of workers and creating the right environment for them to return to work. It also needs to ensure it has enough supply of fresh produce. Finally, it is working in step with government guidelines to ensure the safety of customers. The behind-closed-doors test which starts this week will involve ""exploring social distancing measures for our crew, PPE options and opening in a limited capacity,"" the company said. McDonald's shut all its branches last month in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. But it has seen rivals such as Burger King, KFC and Pret A Manger reopening some sites for delivery and takeaway over the past week. YesterdayGreggs became the latest fast food retailer to announce it is reopeningsome of its outlets despite the coronavirus lockdown. The bakery chain, which has more than 2,050 shops, said it would open 20 of them in the Newcastle area from Monday 4 May as part of a ""controlled trial"", with more to follow. Greggs boss Roger Whiteside said the trial, set to last at least two weeks, would involve a limited product range and shorter trading hours. He hopes to have all stores open again by 1 July, when the government's job retention scheme is due to end, although the timing could change, depending on future government announcements. Meanwhile Nando's has reopened six of its UK restaurants for delivery. The peri-peri chicken chain has reopened the kitchens of four restaurants in London and two in Manchester. However visitors won't be welcome - the branches will only offer a takeaway service through Deliveroo. Nando's said: ""The menu will be reduced to help the team maintain social distance in the kitchen and food prep areas. ""Each Nando's restaurant has been working under Public Health England guidelines for the past week on top of their existing health and safety procedures. ""Every member of the team has been washing their hands more frequently while maintaining social distance during shifts."" The company said it is the ""first phase"" of its reopening plans but more restaurants could follow suit, And Wagamama fans in some parts of London will from Thursday be able to have the food delivered by Deliveroo. The pan-Asian restaurant chain is reopening its kitchens at Peckham and Hackney. Kitchens in Leeds will reopen shortly, Wagamama said. Emma Woods, chief executive of Wagamama, said: ""We have taken medical advice on how we keep our teams safe in a kitchen environment from a doctor who advises on health and safety in challenging operating environments, including previous experience in the cruise industry.

The pandemic is playing havoc with movie release plans worldwide The organisers of the Academy Awards have announced that they will bend their own rules to let films only released on streaming
platforms be eligible for nomination. Under current rules, films have to be screened in a cinema in Los Angeles for at least seven days to qualify for awards. Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson said in a statement on Tuesday that their commitment to theatre releases was ""unchanged and unwavering"" but said the pandemic has made the rule change necessary. The Academy's new policy is only temporary while most cinemas are closed because of coronavirus. Many scheduled movie releases, including the new installment of James Bond, have been completely delayed by the pandemic. US President Donald Trump was speaking earlier at a White House event about supporting small businesses through the coronavirus pandemic. As he closed the event, Mr Trump expressed his pride at the work being done by his government and tried to compare the scale of the outbreak with the Spanish Flu pandemic. ""We're going through a period of time the likes of which we've never seen in this country before, certainly even if you go back into 1917 - it was the worst of all time but it was also not as bad here,"" Mr Trump said. ""It was very bad, it was very rough - it was a bad one. But it wasn't quite like what we're going through right now."" But the Spanish Flu pandemic happened in 1918, not 1917. It also had a far higher death toll than the coronavirus pandemic has had so far. More than 50 million people died of Spanish Flu worldwide while the current death toll from the coronavirus is about 216,000, according to Johns Hopkins University tracking. Some 675,000 Americans died in the 1918 pandemic, while some 58,000 are thought to have died with Covid-19.  US President Donald Trump has doubled down on earlier comments suggesting that American schools reopen, saying that young people are less susceptible to the virus. ""Now we found out that young people do extraordinarily well,"" with the virus, he says. ""That's why I think we can start thinking about schools."" The president said yesterday he thought it would be a ""good thing"" for schools to open up before the end of the current school year. ""I noticed that Purdue University"", in Indiana, wants to reopen, Trump said on Tuesday. ""I think that's correct."" ""So hopefully they're going to be coming back,"" he said. ""Young people do well with this horrible scourge."" The coronavirus has not hit US young children as hard as adults, however, the disease has caused hospitalisation and death across all ages. Earlier this month, a six-week-old baby died in Connecticut, believed to be one of America's youngest victim of the virus. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This video can not be played Coronavirus: Tests to be rolled out to care home staff and residents and over-65s The testing changes announced by Matt Hancockearlier this evening represent a massive expansion of who is eligible for
testing in the UK - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a
test if they have symptoms. That will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as
part of the ""test, track and trace"" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay. It is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing
kits and mobile units staffed by the Army. The problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-thru testing centres have
not always been in convenient locations. There is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the
three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire. The expansion has also allowed the government to do
something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the
testing of residents and staff without symptoms. A big concern is that the virus has been able to get a

"Spain will lift its strict virus lockdown in four phases until the end of June, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Spain has announced a four-phase plan to lift its stringent coronavirus lockdown and return to a ""new normality"" by the end of June. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said each region would relax restrictions at a different pace, depending on the severity of its outbreak. Four Spanish islands will be first to ease measures from 4 May, with the rest of Spain following a week later. Spain's coronavirus outbreak has so far killed almost 24,000 people. The country has endured some of the world's toughest containment measures since 14 March, with children banned from going outside for six weeks. There are signs the epidemic is now in decline, however. On Tuesday Spain's daily toll of registered virus deaths was 301, according to its health ministry, compared to a high of 950 in early April. The number of new infections also fell to 1,308 on Tuesday, its lowest level since Spain declared a state of alarm on 14 March. On Sunday,Spanish children under the age of 14 were finally permitted to leave their homes- for one hour a day, between 09:00 and 21:00. This video can not be played Children in Spain have been allowed outside for the first time in six weeks As of 2 May, the rest of the population will also be allowed brief outdoor exercise and walks, if the infection rate continues to fall. Spain has already taken an early step, allowing workers in manufacturing, construction and some services to return to work from 13 April. On Tuesday, the prime minister outlined a fuller de-escalation plan with four phases, each expected to last about two weeks. He said the process would take a minimum of six weeks, and hopefully no more than eight. ""By the end of June, we as a country will have entered into the new normality if the epidemic remains under control,"" he said. Before the plan kicks in, there will be a preparatory ""phase zero"" from 4-11 May, in which hairdressers and other businesses that take appointments can reopen, restaurants can offer take-away services, and professional sports leagues will go back to training. Can you compare different countries? Madridâs medical heroes in fight of their lives WATCH: 'If you don't want to work like a slave, you're out' Mr Sanchez said provinces would progress to less restrictive phases based on their infection rates, local hospital capacity, and how well distancing measures were being observed. The government wants remote working to continue wherever possible until June, when the fourth and final phase should be imposed. Spain had avoided setting specific deadlines for lockdown easing so it wouldn't miss them if the situation changed, the prime minister said. Small businesses and hotels can open from 11 May, but social distancing will remain in force Though some schools will reopen in late May, most will stay closed until the new term begins in September,in line with a similar decision in Italy. By contrast,France unveiled plans on Tuesday to gradually resume school classes from 11 May Restaurants can start opening their terraces from mid-May, but they must not be more than 30% full during the first phase Religious services can resume on a limited basis from 11 May, at no more than one third of the building's capacity Theatres and cinemas will reopen from late May, but again must be no more than a third full Shops can open at half capacity from around the end of June, with two metres (6ft) between shoppers Beaches are expected to reopen in late June Mr Sanchez told Spaniards: ""We are starting to glimpse an outcome that will be a reward for the huge collective effort made over the past weeks."" But he warned that ""the virus is still lurking"". ""It's up to the people now, we are embarking on a journey without a precise route map. [...] What we've accomplished is enormous, but it could all be lost if we don't look after each other."" Spain's economy has been battered by the impact of the virus, and the Bank of Spain forecasts that unemployment could rise to 21.7% this year. Mr Sanchez said a recession of ""extraordinary scale"" was now looming, which would require an extraordinary response from the EU. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

The captain has been relieved of his command following a Royal Navy probe. HMS Trenchant had been on patrol before having to return to Devonport to undergo repairs Naval sources told the BBC that Cdr Lewis had been advised both by his senior officers on shore and some of his own officers on the submarine not to go ahead with the party.

The pandemic is playing havoc with movie release plans worldwide The organisers of the Academy Awards have announced that they will bend their own rules to let films only released on streaming
platforms be eligible for nomination. Under current rules, films have to be screened in a cinema in Los Angeles for at least seven days to qualify for awards. Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson said in a statement on Tuesday that their commitment to theatre releases was ""unchanged and unwavering"" but said the pandemic has made the rule change necessary. The Academy's new policy is only temporary while most cinemas are closed because of coronavirus. Many scheduled movie releases, including the new installment of James Bond, have been completely delayed by the pandemic. US President Donald Trump was speaking earlier at a White House event about supporting small businesses through the coronavirus pandemic. As he closed the event, Mr Trump expressed his pride at the work being done by his government and tried to compare the scale of the outbreak with the Spanish Flu pandemic. ""We're going through a period of time the likes of which we've never seen in this country before, certainly even if you go back into 1917 - it was the worst of all time but it was also not as bad here,"" Mr Trump said. ""It was very bad, it was very rough - it was a bad one. But it wasn't quite like what we're going through right now."" But the Spanish Flu pandemic happened in 1918, not 1917. It also had a far higher death toll than the coronavirus pandemic has had so far. More than 50 million people died of Spanish Flu worldwide while the current death toll from the coronavirus is about 216,000, according to Johns Hopkins University tracking. Some 675,000 Americans died in the 1918 pandemic, while some 58,000 are thought to have died with Covid-19.  US President Donald Trump has doubled down on earlier comments suggesting that American schools reopen, saying that young people are less susceptible to the virus. ""Now we found out that young people do extraordinarily well,"" with the virus, he says. ""That's why I think we can start thinking about schools."" The president said yesterday he thought it would be a ""good thing"" for schools to open up before the end of the current school year. ""I noticed that Purdue University"", in Indiana, wants to reopen, Trump said on Tuesday. ""I think that's correct."" ""So hopefully they're going to be coming back,"" he said. ""Young people do well with this horrible scourge."" The coronavirus has not hit US young children as hard as adults, however, the disease has caused hospitalisation and death across all ages. Earlier this month, a six-week-old baby died in Connecticut, believed to be one of America's youngest victim of the virus. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This video can not be played Coronavirus: Tests to be rolled out to care home staff and residents and over-65s The testing changes announced by Matt Hancockearlier this evening represent a massive expansion of who is eligible for
testing in the UK - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a
test if they have symptoms. That will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as
part of the ""test, track and trace"" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay. It is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing
kits and mobile units staffed by the Army. The problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-thru testing centres have
not always been in convenient locations. There is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the
three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire. The expansion has also allowed the government to do
something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the
testing of residents and staff without symptoms. A big concern is that the virus has been able to get a
foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms
or if they are asymptomatic. But promising something is one thing - delivering it is
another. While the capacity looks like it will be there to test
100,000 a day by the end of the month as promised, the numbers actually getting
tested are currently less than half that. Royal Mail has scrapped Saturday letter deliveries across the UK until further notice due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"A third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes, figures show. Office for National Statistics data showed there were 2,000 coronavirus care home deaths in the week ending 17 April, double the previous week.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidtesting will be expandedto all care home residents and staff in England. This includes those who do not have symptoms, Mr Hancock told Tuesday's coronavirus briefing. ""Building on successful pilots, we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England, and to patients and staff in the NHS,"" Mr Hancock said. All those over 65 and people who must leave home for work will also be able to get a test if they are displaying symptoms. The health secretary also announced that the government would begin including the number of deaths in care homes and the community in its daily figures from Wednesday, in an effort to ""bring as much transparency as possible"" to the data. Until now, the figures have only included hospital deaths. Coronavirus deaths in hospitals across the UK have reached 21,678 - a rise of 586 from the day before - having peaked on 8 April. However, projections for care home deaths up to 24 April suggest the numbers have continued to rise. Another 630 deaths in care homes in Northern Ireland and Scotland have been linked with coronavirus up until mid-April. Nearly half of coronavirus deaths in those countries are now in care homes. Mike Padgham, of the Independent Care Group, which represents care homes, said they were now the ""true front line"" in the fight against coronavirus. He said: ""It is taking a terrible toll. These are our loved ones - mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and friends who have been taken from us early."" Asked at the coronavirus briefing whether care homes were now the government's priority in dealing with the disease, Mr Hancock said: ""Care homes have been a top priority right from the start. ""We've strengthened the rules around what happens in care homes and tightened infection control, also making testing available throughout the care sector."" Prof John Newton, co-ordinator of the national testing effort, addressing the spread of the virus in care homes, said: ""We've done some intensive studies of infection in care homes. ""The presence of symptoms was not really a good marker in the care home setting, both among residents and staff, for the presence of the virus. ""There were significant numbers who were asymptomatic who had the virus and so we have massively increased the amount of testing available."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said care homes had been a ""top priority right from the start"" A key criticism of the government's approach has been the lack of protective equipment for staff and testing for staff and residents. It was only in the middle of April that the government said all residents showing symptoms could be tested, while the Army is now helping to distribute protective kit. But Downing Street insisted it had acted to prevent the spread of coronavirus within care homes in the early stages of the pandemic, including guidance issued banning visitors.

These figures are released weekly and include people who have died who are suspected to have had the virus, not just those who have tested positive. They also compare the overall number of people who have died with the average number of deaths at that time of year. Up until 10 April just over 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths had been recorded in care homes so far. A week later this had increased by another 2,000 to hit 3,096 in England and Wales. Data provided by the Care Quality Commission, which receives reports from care homes in England, suggest the following week, up until last Friday, saw an even bigger rise. Similar trends are being seen in Northern Ireland and Scotland. But even these figures may be an underestimate. The overall number of people dying in care homes is now three times higher than it was before the pandemic started. Fewer than half of these extra deaths are being attributed to coronavirus. Labour's shadow social care minister, Liz Kendall, said it was clear that the virus was having a ""devastating impact"" on care homes. ""Urgent action is needed to get a grip of this problem."" Official figures show the total number of people dying in the UK from all causes in hospitals and the community is double what we would expect for this time of year. Government advisers say this is important to track as it reveals the indirect impact of the pandemic, from factors such as people missing out on care and dying from other conditions, as well as coronavirus deaths. In the week to 17 April the total number of deaths in England and Wales topped 22,000 - the highest since records began in 1993. Once you include Northern Ireland and Scotland the figures are nearly 25,000. But BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe said even this does not provide the full picture. He said: ""Those weekly figures do not tell us how many years of life have been lost - some people who die during the epidemic would have lived for many years, and some might have died within the next few months. ""To understand that picture, we'll have to wait to see what happens to all deaths in 2020, but that analysis is some time away."" How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

"The government must consider the impact of the lockdown on domestic abuse and mental health as it plans its exit strategy, Theresa May has said. The former prime minister said measures to tackle coronavirus must not do ""more damage than the disease itself"". She spoke as MPs debated the Domestic Abuse Bill, amid evidence of rising violence during the lockdown. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said help would be available for all such victims during the outbreak. There has beena ""surge"" in violence in the weeks since the lockdownwas introduced, a report by MPs said, with a rise in killings and the number of calls to the National Domestic Abuse helpline run by Refuge up 49% after three weeks. Addressing MPs via video link, Mrs May said the government must think about the ""impact of lockdown on our overall health and wellbeing"". She said police and local authorities should consider random visits to homes of known domestic abuse perpetrators during lockdown, or addresses where there had been reports of violence. But added that would have to be done carefully, so as not to make the situation worse. 'I'm in coronavirus lockdown with my abuser' Mrs May's government introduced the Domestic Abuse Bill last July, but it has been postponed since before the general election. It brings in new protections for victims - including Domestic Abuse Protection Orders and Protection Notices, which can be used to impose long-term bans on perpetrators making contact with the victim. It applies to England and Wales and proposes the first government definition of domestic abuse, including financial abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical behaviour. The Northern Ireland Assemblyalso debated legislationto strengthen domestic abuse laws on Tuesday. Mr Buckland told MPs the Domestic Violence Bill aimed to raise awareness of the crime, to protect and support victims and their children, to ""transform"" the response in the justice system and to ""improve performance across all national and local agencies"". The government has always stressed that its Domestic Abuse Bill is proof of its determination to tackle a problem that has been described as an epidemic in the UK. The bill - drafted before the lockdown - creates a statutory definition of domestic abuse, emphasising it's not just physical: it can also involve coercive or controlling behaviour and financial constraints. These provisions go to the heart of what could now be happening in homes up and down the country. Domestic abuse charities have seen a huge increase in calls and online requests for help during the lockdown. Victims are suffering both physically and emotionally in homes that are not places of safety. Many of the traditional escape routes have been cut off. A pandemic on top of an epidemic, as one victim described it. Labour has proposed amendments that would see 10% of theÂ£750 million charity support package announced this monthring-fenced in a fast-track fund for domestic abuse charities. MPs also said the bill must do more to protect victims regardless of their immigration status, and to ensure that there is adequate accommodation across the board for victims who flee their homes. As a short-term measure during the lockdown, former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called on the government to house them in vacant hotel rooms until decent alternatives could be found. ""We know that some hotel chains have offered to help with providing accommodation. These hotels should be taken up on that offer,"" she said. Amendments that MPs proposed to table included putting a stop to a defence of ""rough sex gone wrong"" in court. Conservative MP Mark Garnier's constituent Natalie Connolly died in 2016 after sustaining more than 40 separate injuries - but her boyfriend was cleared of murder in 2018 on the basis of such a defence. ""How can it possibly be the case that somebody dies through sex?"" Mr Garnier asked the Commons. ""It doesn't make any sense, this is wrong."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Charities, too, have called for the Domestic Abuse Bill to offer more support for victims. Its measures include requiring councils in England to provide support for victims and their children in refuges and other safe accommodation. However, Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan said this must be broadened out. ""With the majority of victims remaining in the family home, especially in BAME communities, it's vital that Parliament extends this duty to cover all victims and children - no matter where they live,"" he said. There are also calls for a new offence of ""non-fatal strangulation"" to be included, and for authorities to start collecting data on domestic abuse among the over-74s. Earlier, the government announced it would spend Â£3.1 million on services supporting children who witness ""appalling abuse"" at home during the coronavirus lockdown. The funding will be given to councils, charities, and police and crime commissioners in England and Wales, and will go towards services such as counselling sessions and early intervention schemes, the Home Office said. But shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the amount ""falls woefully short"" of what is needed to ""support vital frontline services"". Earlier, safeguarding minister Victoria Atkins told the BBC ministers were working with refuge providers to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the availability of places. ""I would also like for us to be looking at perhaps kicking the perpetrator out, rather than the victim, so that she stays in her home safely... and the perpetrator has his behaviour addressed to stop this cycle of abuse,"" she said. The Domestic Abuse Bill would also focus on ""stopping the perpetrator's behaviour in the first place"", she said. This video can not be played ""You will not be breaking coronavirus regulations and you will not be breaking the law if you seek help outside."" Speaking in the Commons before the debate, Attorney General Suella Braverman stressed that victims will not be breaking the law if they need to seek help outside the home during lockdown. She told MPs: ""I want to take this opportunity to let victims out there, both men and women, know that they don't have to suffer in silence.""

"White Helmets first responders denounced the ""horrific massacre"" of civilians At least 40 people have been killed in a bomb attack in the north-western Syrian city of Afrin, Turkey says. The governor of the neighbouring Turkish border province of Hatay said a fuel tanker rigged with a hand grenade exploded at a crowded market place. He and Turkey's defence ministry blamed a Kurdish militia group, the YPG, which they see as linked to Kurdish militant groups inside Turkey. Afrin is controlled by Turkish forces and allied Syrian opposition factions. In 2018, they launched a joint operation to drive the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia out of the city and its surrounding region. The Turkish government accuses the YPG of being an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the US and EU. The YPG, which the US relied on to defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in Syria, says they are separate entities. Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained First Syrian state torture trial begins in Germany Syrian air force behind chemical attacks - OPCW The fuel tanker exploded at an open air market in the central Souk Ali area of Afrin on Monday afternoon, close to the local government's offices, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. The market is usually full of shoppers in the hours before Muslims break their daily fasts for the holy month of Ramadan. Images from the scene showed thick black smoke rising above a residential area, and cars and food stalls on fire. The Turkish defence ministry said all of those killed in the attack were civilians and that they included 11 children. Forty-seven other civilians were wounded, it added. ""The enemy of humanity PKK/YPG has once again targeted innocent civilians in Afrin,""the ministry tweeted,external, without providing any evidence. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 40 civilians were killed along with six Syrian opposition fighters allied to Turkey. The Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are commonly known as the White Helmets, denounced the ""horrific massacre"" of civilians.It put the death toll at 42,external. It said the attack was ""just one more nail in the coffin of the Syrian people"" and called for ""international intervention to save lives and protect innocents"".

"Building a coronavirus contact-tracing app that might help the UK emerge from lockdown has been a titanic effort - and it has largely taken place in private. But now the NHS chief responsible has told MPs he hopes the first version will be ready in a fortnight's time. Matthew Gould also disclosed plans to log the location of whenever two or more people are in close proximity for minutes at a time. That will disturb privacy campaigners. However, NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - has told BBC News this extra request will be ""opt in"" rather than the default setting. Mr Gould told the Science and Technology Committee the app would be ""technically ready"" for deployment in ""two to three weeks"" - but made it clear it was only one part of the strategy to emerge from lockdown and would involve a none-too-subtle marketing campaign. ""If you want to protect the NHS and stop it being overwhelmed and, at the same time, want to get the economy moving, then the app is going to be part of an essential part of a strategy for doing that,"" he said. On Monday, BBC Newsrevealed the NHS had opted not to use the Google-Apple system. The technology giants want to help apps taking a ""decentralised"" approach to operate more effectively, with contact-matching happening locally on phones. Instead, the UK's app, unlike many countries in Europe, will use a ""centralised"" model, with the process of linking those diagnosed with the virus with those they could have infected happening on a computer server. This video can not be played WATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work? Mr Gould told the committee there was a false dichotomy, where decentralised was seen as private and centralised was not. And the NHS approach ""allows you to do certain important things that you couldn't do if it was just phone-to-phone propagation"". For example, it would be easier: to spot people falsely claiming to have virus symptoms so their friends would have to self-isolate once someone had received a negative test result, to tell people advised to self-isolate because they had been in proximity with them to go out again Meanwhile, Prof Christophe Fraser, whose advice has been crucial to the app's design, told the committee only a centralised approach would give epidemiologists visibility into how effective the app was proving to be and the means to calibrate it further. NHS rejects Apple-Google coronavirus app plan Apple and Google accelerate coronavirus contact tracing apps plan NHS contact-tracing app is tested at RAF base Both men stressed any data collected would be anonymous. But Mr Gould said ""it would be very useful epidemiologically"" - potentially identifying hotspots where ""the virus was propagating"" - if, in a update to the app, people voluntarily revealed where their proximity contacts had happened. And it is not clear whether those they had had the contact with would have any choice about being tracked in a way that could end up creating a huge database of the movements of millions of people. Prof Lilian Edwards, a leading expert on privacy law, told the committee there was an intrinsic risk in building a such a centralised database, which might be retained in some form beyond the pandemic. The experts and many of the MPs took part in the hearing remotely, to minimise their risk of catching the virus The target of persuading 80% of smartphone users to use the app would be virtually impossible without the 20% of the population polls suggested were worried about privacy, she said. Although, it could effectively become compulsory if its use was made a condition of employment or admission to places such as football stadiums. Greg Clark, who chairs the committee, meanwhile, suggested people may not take the app with them to the supermarket if they risked being told to stay home for two weeks because of a brief contact with someone infected. Later at the daily Downing Street briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed he intended for 18,000 human contact tracers, whose work will complement the software, to be in place ""before or at the same time as the app"".

Similar trends are being seen in Northern Ireland and Scotland. But even these figures may be an underestimate. The overall number of people dying in care homes is now three times higher than it was before the pandemic started. Fewer than half of these extra deaths are being attributed to coronavirus. Labour's shadow social care minister, Liz Kendall, said it was clear that the virus was having a ""devastating impact"" on care homes. ""Urgent action is needed to get a grip of this problem."" Official figures show the total number of people dying in the UK from all causes in hospitals and the community is double what we would expect for this time of year. Government advisers say this is important to track as it reveals the indirect impact of the pandemic, from factors such as people missing out on care and dying from other conditions, as well as coronavirus deaths. In the week to 17 April the total number of deaths in England and Wales topped 22,000 - the highest since records began in 1993. Once you include Northern Ireland and Scotland the figures are nearly 25,000. But BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe said even this does not provide the full picture. He said: ""Those weekly figures do not tell us how many years of life have been lost - some people who die during the epidemic would have lived for many years, and some might have died within the next few months. ""To understand that picture, we'll have to wait to see what happens to all deaths in 2020, but that analysis is some time away."" How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

"This video can not be played The BBC's Secunder Kermani and Anne Soy compare how prepared Asian and African countries are One billion people could become infected with the coronavirus worldwide unless vulnerable countries are given urgent help, an aid group has warned. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said financial and humanitarian aid were needed to help slow the global spread of the virus. It said ""fragile countries"" such as Afghanistan and Syria needed ""urgent funding"" to avoid a major outbreak. ""There remains a small window of time to mount a robust response,"" it warned. There have been more than three million confirmed cases of Covid-19 worldwide with more than 200,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US. The IRC's report, which is based on models and data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Imperial College London, estimated there could be between 500 million and one billion infections globally. It also said there could be more than three million deaths across dozens of conflict-affected and unstable countries. Live updates from around the world 'Without food, we'll die inside out homes' Developing world economies hit hard by virus ""These numbers should serve as a wake-up call,"" said the head of the IRC, David Miliband. ""The full, devastating and disproportionate weight of this pandemic has yet to be felt in the world's most fragile and war-torn countries,"" he added.  ""The key now is for donors to urgently put flexible funding behind frontline efforts. ""Governments must work together to remove any impediment to humanitarian assistance."" Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies Figures last updated5 July 2022, 08:59 BST The US-based group, which responds to humanitarian crises around the world, said factors such as household size, population density, healthcare capacity and pre-existing conflicts could all increase the risk of major outbreaks developing. Many countries in the developing world have low official infection rates or death tolls - but the actual numbers are believed to be much higher. Caroline Seguin, who manages programmes in Yemen for the medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF), said the organisation believed people there were already dying from Covid 19 - just not in hospitals. ""We are convinced that there is local transmission ongoing but the capacity of testing is very, very low,"" she told the BBC. This video can not be played Fears of virus in Idlib refugee camps Ms Seguin said Yemen, which was referenced in the IRC report as being particularly vulnerable to coronavirus, said the country had been weakened by recent outbreaks of cholera and measles. ""The health system is collapsing...  and for sure the ministry of health is not able to cope with this disease,"" she said. A major issue facing developing or unstable countries is a lack of suitable medical equipment for treating patients with Covid-19. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, there are fewer than ten ventilators for every one million people. In Nigeria, that figure is even more stark at 0.8 ventilators per million. For context, Italy, which has one of the highest death tolls from the virus in the world, had 80 ventilators per one million people at the start of the crisis. New Zealandhas begun easing some of its lockdown measures.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Scottish government suggests covering face in shops and public transport The Scottish government has recommended people cover their faces while in some enclosed public spaces, such as shops and public transport. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there could be ""some benefit"" in wearing a cloth face covering in places where social distancing was difficult. But she said it was ""not a substitute"" for existing lockdown restrictions. Downing Street said UK ministers were considering the scientific evidence for introducing similar advice. The prime minister's official spokesman said a review had been carried out by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), adding: ""Once a decision has been reached then we'll announce it publicly."" The Scottish government guidance is not mandatory and will not be enforced by the authorities. UK sees weekly deaths double normal levels Latest on coronavirus in Scotland,external Should we all be covering our faces now? Ms Sturgeon stressed that the advice related to cloth garments such as a scarf rather than ""medical grade facemasks"" like those used by health and care workers. The first minister said evidence about the usefulness of face coverings was ""limited"", but that there may be ""some benefit in wearing a face covering if you enter an enclosed space where you will come into contract with multiple people and safe social distancing is difficult"". She said: ""To be clear, the benefit comes mainly in cases where someone might have the virus but is not aware of that because they are not experiencing symptoms and thus not isolating completely. ""Wearing a face covering in those circumstances may reduce the risk of that person transmitting the virus to others."" Ms Sturgeon said there was no evidence to suggest that wearing a face covering outdoors was of any benefit. The first minister warned that she did not want people to ""think they are invincible"" while covering their face in enclosed spaces such as shops. She said: ""It may do some good in limited circumstances, but it cannot and should not be seen as a substitute for the other rules and guidelines."" The Scottish government's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch,said earlier this monththere was ""no evidence"" to support members of the public wearing protective face masks. The government advice says face coverings should not be used by people with asthma or children under the age of two. It adds: ""When applying or removing the covering, it is important that you wash your hands first and avoid touching your face. ""After each use, you must wash the face covering at 60 degrees centigrade, or dispose of it safely."" Read the full government guidance here,external The guidance also says that it is ""not being made mandatory and will not be enforced at this stage"" due to the ""relatively weak"" evidence of the impact of face coverings on transmission of the virus. However, Ms Sturgeon said this would be kept under review as the government considers how to ease lockdown restrictions. The key factor in the Scottish decision is what's called ""asymptomatic transmission"" - people who are infected but not showing symptoms passing on the virus to others. Almost a month ago, US government assessed the latest research into this risk and concluded that the public should cover their faces when in confined spaces. A study in Singapore had found evidence that coronavirus had been spread by people who had not realised they were infected. In particular scientists identified the possibility of the virus being passed in a two-day period before symptoms started to show. Dozens of governments are now urging - or ordering - their citizens to cover their faces in an effort to reduce this route of infection. As Nicola Sturgeon said, this is not about urging people to rush out to buy professional-grade masks - these are designed to protect medical and care staff and should be reserved for them. Instead, as in the US, the idea is to devise your own covering, not so much to protect you and as to protect others where distancing isn't possible. The UK's government's scientific advisers weighed up the evidence last week and we're now waiting to see whether ministers decide to follow the Scottish example. What is happening in other countries? Americans have been advised to use clean cloth or fabric to cover their faces Other countries have brought in different rules around the wearing of face masks. They are to become compulsory on public transportin Germany, andin supermarkets and pharmacies in Austria. Residents in Lombardy in Italymust cover their nose and mouth,externalwhen outside and the French governmentplans to give out masks to the general public.,external Air passengers in Canadamust wear a non-medical mask or a face covering,,externaland in the USA,people are advised to wear,external""cloth face coverings"" in supermarkets and pharmacies. Should we all be covering our faces now? This video can not be played Should I wear a mask to stop coronavirus? Ms Sturgeon also announced that all over-70s in Scotland will now be tested for Covid-19 on admission to hospital. They will also be tested every four days throughout their stay. The latest figures show that 10,721 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, of which 1,754 people are in hospital, and 126 are in intensive care - figures which Ms Sturgeon said ""continue to give us case for cautious optimism"". Ms Sturgeon said a further 70 people who had tested positive for the virus have died, bringing the total under that measure to 1,332. Wider statistics including deaths where Covid-19 was a suspected cause will be published on Wednesday. Ms Sturgeon said: ""These numbers are not and never will be seen as just statistics - behind each and everyone of these numbers is a unique and irreplaceable individual whose loss is a source of grief for their friends and family.""

"On 17 April, weeks into the UK's coronavirus lockdown, three-year-old Marley Grix was admitted to hospital. He'd been ill for a few days - since Easter Monday - but his condition had taken a turn for the worse. Marley's mum, Hayley, feared his life was in danger and knew she had to act quickly. ""He'd started off complaining about his neck saying it hurt, but it didn't seem bad and I just thought that perhaps he had slept funny. ""But for the rest of the week, he just kept getting progressively worse. He had diarrhoea and stomach pain and a temperature. I was on the phone to the GP pretty much every day. Phoning, videoing."" On the Friday, Marley was very ill, and he had symptoms that were scaring Hayley. ""He was really tired and he had a roaring, high temperature that wouldn't go down. His neck glands were swollen. ""His hands and feet were bright red and his eyes were bloodshot. And he was breathing really fast. It was terrifying. ""I called the GP again, but decided to take him to hospital. I followed my gut instinct."" The doctors in the paediatric unit admitted Marley and started running tests to figure out what might be wrong. They suspected a few possible causes, including a bad reaction to coronavirus. Doctors around the UK have been warning about a rare but serious syndrome that could be linked to the pandemic virus. Some of these very ill children have had a septic-shock type illness with a rash and difficulty breathing. Coronavirus: Rare syndrome seen in UK children Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that he is very worried about it and that experts are looking into this rare condition. Marley's coronavirus test came back negative and his doctors are now treating him for atypical Kawasaki disease. This is another rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Children who develop it may be genetically predisposed to doing so. The symptoms are like those seen when the body is trying hard to fight off an infection. And it is one of the conditions that mimics the new mystery illness which doctors think might be linked to coronavirus. Symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, fever and in severe cases, inflammation of arteries of the heart. Marley has been discharged from hospital but Hayley hopes sharing her story will help other parents who may face a similar dilemma to her own. ""All I can do is share this message. Seek help immediately if your child is unwell and your gut is telling you something isn't right. You know your child. ""I know people are reluctant to go to hospital because of coronavirus. You might think you are doing them a favour by keeping them at home but if they are really ill then you have got to seek help.""

"This video can not be played ""We'll be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England"" - Matt Hancock Millions more people are to be eligible for coronavirus tests, according to government announcements on Tuesday. In England, all care home residents and staff will be able to access tests from Wednesday, regardless of whether they have symptoms. People over 65 and those who must leave home to work, as well as those they live with, will be able to get tested if they have symptoms of Covid-19. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to follow suit. It comes after figures revealeda third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes. How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Care home coronavirus deaths rising rapidly Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""From construction workers to emergency plumbers, from research scientists to those in manufacturing, the expansion of access to testing will protect the most vulnerable and help keep people safe."" Anyone eligible can book a test onthe government's test-booking website,external. Last week,it closed temporarilyfollowing ""exceptional demand"" when key workers were first able to register. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Mr Hancock also announced that a small number of hospitals in England will begin testing all patients for coronavirus, regardless of if they are showing symptoms, as part of a pilot. The government has pledged to carry out 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, but the latest figures showed just over 43,000 tests took place across the UK on Monday - less than half its goal. The health secretary said daily testing capacity had increased to 73,400 and insisted the UK was ""on track"" to hit 100,000 tests a day by Thursday. This represents a massive expansion of who is eligible for testing - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a test if they have symptoms. That will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as part of the ""test, track and trace"" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay. It is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing kits and mobile units staffed by the armed forces. The problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-through testing centres have not always been in convenient locations. There is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire. The expansion has also allowed the government to do something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the testing of residents and staff without symptoms. A big concern is that the virus has been able to get a foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms or if they are asymptomatic. But promising something is one thing - delivering it is another. While the capacity looks like it will be there to test 100,000 a day by the end of the month, the numbers actually getting tested are currently less than half that. Meanwhile, in Scotland,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidall patients over 70 who are admitted to hospital for any reason will now be tested for Covid-19. In Northern Ireland,testing has begun in some GP practicesand will also be expanded in hospitals and care homes. Wales has adopteda needs-based approach to testingfor NHS and ""critical"" non-NHS workers. Office for National Statistics data showed there were 2,000 coronavirus care home deaths in England and Wales in the week ending 17 April, double the previous week. It brings the total number of deaths in care homes linked to the virus since the start of the pandemic to 3,096. Coronavirus deaths in hospitals across the UK, have reached 21,678 - a rise of 586 from Monday. The health secretary said from Wednesday the government will publish daily figures on deaths in care homes and the community. He said the change aimed to ""bring as much transparency as possible"" to the figures and ""add to our understanding of how this virus is spreading day by day"".

The government has pledged to carry out 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, but the latest figures showed just over 43,000 tests took place across the UK on Monday - less than half its goal. The health secretary said daily testing capacity had increased to 73,400 and insisted the UK was ""on track"" to hit 100,000 tests a day by Thursday. This represents a massive expansion of who is eligible for testing - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a test if they have symptoms. That will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as part of the ""test, track and trace"" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay. It is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing kits and mobile units staffed by the armed forces. The problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-through testing centres have not always been in convenient locations. There is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire. The expansion has also allowed the government to do something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the testing of residents and staff without symptoms. A big concern is that the virus has been able to get a foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms or if they are asymptomatic. But promising something is one thing - delivering it is another. While the capacity looks like it will be there to test 100,000 a day by the end of the month, the numbers actually getting tested are currently less than half that. Meanwhile, in Scotland,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidall patients over 70 who are admitted to hospital for any reason will now be tested for Covid-19. In Northern Ireland,testing has begun in some GP practicesand will also be expanded in hospitals and care homes. Wales has adopteda needs-based approach to testingfor NHS and ""critical"" non-NHS workers. Office for National Statistics data showed there were 2,000 coronavirus care home deaths in England and Wales in the week ending 17 April, double the previous week. It brings the total number of deaths in care homes linked to the virus since the start of the pandemic to 3,096. Coronavirus deaths in hospitals across the UK, have reached 21,678 - a rise of 586 from Monday. The health secretary said from Wednesday the government will publish daily figures on deaths in care homes and the community. He said the change aimed to ""bring as much transparency as possible"" to the figures and ""add to our understanding of how this virus is spreading day by day"".

"Airlines across the world have grounded aircraft as passenger numbers collapse British Airways is set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforce due to a collapse in business because of the coronavirus pandemic. The airline's parent company, IAG, said it needed to impose a ""restructuring and redundancy programme"" until demand for air travel returns to 2019 levels. The pilots' union Balpa said it was ""devastated"" at the news and vowed to fight ""every single"" job cut. IAG also owns Spanish airline Iberia and Ireland's Aer Lingus. In a statement, IAG said: ""The proposals remain subject to consultation, but it is likely that they will affect most of British Airways' employees and may result in the redundancy of up to 12,000 of them."" The company said it will take several years for air travel to return to pre-virus levels, a warning that has been echoed by airlines across the world. Alongside IAG's statement, BA chief executive Alex Cruz wrote in a letter to staff: ""In the last few weeks, the outlook for the aviation industry has worsened further and we must take action now. We are a strong, well-managed business that has faced into, and overcome, many crises in our hundred-year history. ""We must overcome this crisis ourselves, too. There is no government bailout standing by for BA and we cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely... We will see some airlines go out of business."" Airlines fear new cash crisis if jobs scheme ends Bransonâs Virgin Atlantic in virus bailout talks Airbus furloughs 3,200 after 'bleeding cash' alert About 4,500 pilots and 16,000 cabin crew work for BA, which has already put almost 23,000 staff on furlough. Balpa's general secretary Brian Strutton said: ""This has come as a bolt out of the blue from an airline that said it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support. ""Balpa does not accept that a case has been made for these job losses and we will be fighting to save every single one."" Also on Tuesday, IAG revealed the impact of the virus outbreak on group revenues. In the first three months of 2020 revenues fell 13% to â¬4.6bn (Â£4bn). Worse is to come warned Stephen Gunning, IAG's chief financial officer. Airlines across the world have warned they face a fight for survival. In the UK, EasyJet has laid off its 4,000 UK-based cabin crew for two months. And Sir Richard Branson has appealed to the government to help bail out his Virgin Atlantic airline with a loan thought to be up to Â£500m. Elsewhere, Qantas has put 20,000 staff on leave, while Air Canada has done the same for about 15,200 employees. Norwegian Air has said it could run out of cash by mid-May. At American Airlines, about 4,800 pilots have agreed to take short-term leave on reduced pay and more than 700 are taking early retirement. We know the aviation industry is in the throes of an unprecedented crisis. But the announcement from IAG is chilling nonetheless - and not only because of the number of jobs at stake. That's because the company is saying explicitly that it expects the recovery in the industry to be a very slow one, with passenger demand not reaching 2019 levels for ""several years"". The airline can survive on its financial reserves for the moment - and take advantage of the government's job retention scheme to furlough employees for a short period. Government support of this kind is very short term. With a quick recovery it might be enough to save a large number of jobs. Yet the prospect of that happening is deeply uncertain. It's not clear when countries will remove travel restrictions, under what conditions people will be able to fly - or even if they'll want to. IAG has now made it clear it's expecting the industry to look very different in future to what was the norm until just a few weeks ago, and is taking action accordingly. But unions will disagree, and the company may find itself accused of over-reacting - or even of taking advantage of the crisis in order to reduce its cost base.

"A third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes, figures show. Office for National Statistics data showed there were 2,000 coronavirus care home deaths in the week ending 17 April, double the previous week. It brings the total number of deaths in care homes linked to the virus since the start of the pandemic to 3,096. Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidtesting will be expandedto all care home residents and staff in England. This includes those who do not have symptoms, Mr Hancock told Tuesday's coronavirus briefing. ""Building on successful pilots, we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England, and to patients and staff in the NHS,"" Mr Hancock said. All those over 65 and people who must leave home for work will also be able to get a test if they are displaying symptoms. The health secretary also announced that the government would begin including the number of deaths in care homes and the community in its daily figures from Wednesday, in an effort to ""bring as much transparency as possible"" to the data. Until now, the figures have only included hospital deaths. Coronavirus deaths in hospitals across the UK have reached 21,678 - a rise of 586 from the day before - having peaked on 8 April. However, projections for care home deaths up to 24 April suggest the numbers have continued to rise. Another 630 deaths in care homes in Northern Ireland and Scotland have been linked with coronavirus up until mid-April. Nearly half of coronavirus deaths in those countries are now in care homes. Mike Padgham, of the Independent Care Group, which represents care homes, said they were now the ""true front line"" in the fight against coronavirus. He said: ""It is taking a terrible toll. These are our loved ones - mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and friends who have been taken from us early."" Asked at the coronavirus briefing whether care homes were now the government's priority in dealing with the disease, Mr Hancock said: ""Care homes have been a top priority right from the start. ""We've strengthened the rules around what happens in care homes and tightened infection control, also making testing available throughout the care sector."" Prof John Newton, co-ordinator of the national testing effort, addressing the spread of the virus in care homes, said: ""We've done some intensive studies of infection in care homes. ""The presence of symptoms was not really a good marker in the care home setting, both among residents and staff, for the presence of the virus. ""There were significant numbers who were asymptomatic who had the virus and so we have massively increased the amount of testing available."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said care homes had been a ""top priority right from the start"" A key criticism of the government's approach has been the lack of protective equipment for staff and testing for staff and residents. It was only in the middle of April that the government said all residents showing symptoms could be tested, while the Army is now helping to distribute protective kit. But Downing Street insisted it had acted to prevent the spread of coronavirus within care homes in the early stages of the pandemic, including guidance issued banning visitors. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We want to do all we can to support those living and working in care homes at what we accept is an enormously difficult time."" It came as: British Airways said it was set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforcedue to a collapse in business because of the pandemic The first version of a coronavirus contact-tracing app that might help the UK emerge from lockdowncould be ready in a fortnight's time, an NHS chief has said The son of an NHS doctor who died with the viruscalled on Health Secretary Matt Hancock to apologisefor mistakes in the government's response to the outbreak People across the UK, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson,held a minute's silence to remember health and care workerswho have died with coronavirus Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said face coveringswould be recommended for the public in enclosed spaces such as supermarkets Two brothers with coronavirus have died within hours of one another Black, Asian and minority ethnic staff who may need face masks or tests for Covid-19are being prioritised by an NHS trust Care home staff have been praised for isolating with residents for over a month to protect them from coronavirus All patients over 70 in Scotland who are admitted to hospital for any reasonwill now be tested for Covid-19, Ms Sturgeon has announced This video can not be played UK holds a minutes silence for coronavirus key worker deaths A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The daily updates provided by the government do not include care home deaths. TheONS has been able to track these by looking at deaths certificates,external- but that means the data lags behind the hospital deaths provided by the government. These figures are released weekly and include people who have died who are suspected to have had the virus, not just those who have tested positive. They also compare the overall number of people who have died with the average number of deaths at that time of year. Up until 10 April just over 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths had been recorded in care homes so far. A week later this had increased by another 2,000 to hit 3,096 in England and Wales. Data provided by the Care Quality Commission, which receives reports from care homes in England, suggest the following week, up until last Friday, saw an even bigger rise. Similar trends are being seen in Northern Ireland and Scotland. But even these figures may be an underestimate. The overall number of people dying in care homes is now three times higher than it was before the pandemic started. Fewer than half of these extra deaths are being attributed to coronavirus. Labour's shadow social care minister, Liz Kendall, said it was clear that the virus was having a ""devastating impact"" on care homes. ""Urgent action is needed to get a grip of this problem."" Official figures show the total number of people dying in the UK from all causes in hospitals and the community is double what we would expect for this time of year. Government advisers say this is important to track as it reveals the indirect impact of the pandemic, from factors such as people missing out on care and dying from other conditions, as well as coronavirus deaths. In the week to 17 April the total number of deaths in England and Wales topped 22,000 - the highest since records began in 1993. Once you include Northern Ireland and Scotland the figures are nearly 25,000. But BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe said even this does not provide the full picture. He said: ""Those weekly figures do not tell us how many years of life have been lost - some people who die during the epidemic would have lived for many years, and some might have died within the next few months. ""To understand that picture, we'll have to wait to see what happens to all deaths in 2020, but that analysis is some time away."" How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

"Tens of thousands of people across the UK have now died with coronavirus, including more than 100 NHS staff and other healthcare workers. The BBC has been tracking their deaths during the pandemic. Among them are a pregnant nurse who died before she could meet her daughter; a father-of-seven whose family say he was let down over a lack of personal protective equipment; and a grandmother who colleagues say was one the unsung heroes of the NHS. Many of them came to the UK from other countries to work for the NHS. Most were working on the frontline and caring for patients, while some were retired but continued to work. Here are 100 of their stories. Renowned surgeon Dr El Tayar worked in the NHS for 11 years before moving back to his native Sudan to help establish a transplant programme. He returned to the UK in 2015, working as a locum surgeon before his death. He gave the ""precious gift of life to so many people around the world"", fellow surgeon Abbas Ghazanfar wrote in a tribute. Dr Zaidi was a managing partner of a GP practice with his wife Dr Talat Zaidi. Their four children all work in the medical profession. His daughter, Dr Sarah Zaidi, said his death was ""reflective of his sacrifice"" and he had a ""vocational attitude to service"". A care co-ordinator in Hillingdon, north-west London, Ms Perugia was a ""lovely woman, who never said no to any requests"", colleagues said. Her mother, sister, brother and fiance all work for the same NHS trust she represented. Ms Sharma, who worked as a pharmacist at Eastbourne District General Hospital, was the ""superstar of the family"", her brother said. ""Her irresistible laugh, sense of humour and good nature would light up our world and fill it with colours. For this I am eternally grateful that Pooja was my sister. ""For me, Pooja would always be the little protector or shield for when I had done something mischievous."" An ear, nose and throat consultant at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, Mr El-Hawrani's family said he was ""a loving and much-loved husband, son, father, brother, and friend"". ""His greatest passions were his family and his profession, and he dedicated his life to both,"" they said. Mr El-Hawrani died at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester on 28 March. Father-of-seven Thomas Harvey, 57, was a healthcare assistant at Goodmayes Hospital in Ilford, east London. His family criticised the NHS for the lack of personal protective equipment provided to staff, saying he ""just had gloves and a flimsy apron"". He died at home on 29 March, after feeling unwell for several days. ""Living legend"" Dr Alfa Saadu, who had returned to work after retirement, died in hospital on 31 March. His family said he had been working part-time at the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn, Hertfordshire, before contracting the virus. His son said the family told him to go to hospital, but his father insisted he ""did not want to take up a hospital bed because others would need it"". The mother-of-two had worked as an administrator for Basildon and Brentwood Clinical Commissioning Group in an NHS career of more than 10 years. ""She was fantastic,"" her husband said. ""She was very loving, caring. ""I'm having stories coming through where she would just randomly meet people at the bus stop, friends that she'd made, just got talking to people, they've laid flowers on the doorstep."" Ms O'Rourke was ""such a kind and caring nurse"" who had ""a really special relationship with her patients and colleagues"", her ward manager said. ""Nursing was something she had always wanted to do, although she came to it relatively late after raising her girls."" The 39-year-old died at the hospital where she worked - the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital, in Margate, Kent. Ms Nasreen worked as a hospital cleaner before gaining her nursing qualification in 2019. She died on 2 April at Walsall Manor Hospital, in the West Midlands - the hospital she had worked at for 16 years. ""We've lost an amazing nurse, but we've lost also an amazing person in life,"" her sister Kazeema Nasreen said. The grandmother ""followed her dream"" and trained as a midwife in later life, her family said in a statement. ""She was a very well-respected midwife who supported many hundreds of women as they welcomed their babies into the world,"" they added. Ms Coventry had worked at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, in Harlow, Essex, for 10 years. She died on 2 April. Prof Shousha was an honorary professor of histopathology at Imperial College, London. He had worked at UK cancer research laboratories at London's Hammersmith and Charing Cross hospitals since 1978. He died on 2 April. Mr Alagos was a nursing assistant who was looking after coronavirus patients. Tracey Carter, chief nurse at the hospital, said: ""John was very popular and will be missed greatly by his colleagues."" Ms Glanister was a ""long-serving"" nurse at the Aintree University Hospital, in Liverpool. ""We are so proud to see just how many people's lives Liz has touched,"" her family said in a statement. Ms Glanister died on 3 April at Royal Liverpool University Hospital. In a statement on its website, Vale Practice in Crouch End, north London, paid tribute to a ""beautiful, caring receptionist"". It said: ""It is with great sadness that we are announcing the death of our beautiful, caring receptionist, Amanda Forde. She sadly lost her battle with Covid-19 on Friday 3rd April 2020. May she rest in peace."" A published historian, Dr Sebastianpillai trained at a medical school in Sri Lanka and went on to specialise in treating elderly people at Kingston Hospital in south-west London. He was ""hugely respected as a consultant and author"", Ed Davey, acting Lib Dem leader, said. Dr Sebastianpillai, who was in his 70s, died on 4 April. A healthcare assistant, Mr Corbin worked at the Park Royal Centre for Mental Health, in north-west London, for more than 25 years. ""He was the 'go to' person who knew everything about the ward and how to get things done,"" said Claire Murdoch, head of the local NHS trust, adding he was the ""backbone"" of his team. Mr Corbin died on 4 April. The nurse had worked in the children's cancer unit at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary before taking up other roles in the health sector. ""She was a devoted friend, an incredible nurse and an unapologetically imperfect person,"" one of her friends said in a Facebook post. Ms Mack was not believed to have been directly dealing with patients before becoming ill. The grandmother, who worked at Royal Liverpool University Hospital, was an ""unsung hero"", her local NHS trust said. Her job was to make arrangements to allow patients to safely leave hospital, having spent most of her career as a care worker for people with disabilities. ""Barbara was a much-loved wife, mum, nan, sister, auntie, friend and beautiful person,"" her family said. Ms Graham was the first reported NHS worker in Scotland to die from coronavirus. ""My Mum was there for me no matter what. I will miss everything about her,"" her son told STV News. A healthcare support worker and district nurse, Ms Graham died at Inverclyde Royal Hospital on 6 April. Father-of-two Jitendra Rathod was a ""dearly loved"" specialist heart surgeon at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, where he spent 25 years. The health board's chief executive said he was a ""great"" surgeon who would be missed by his colleagues. Mr Rathod died in the intensive care ward at the hospital on 6 April. Dr Haider was ""a selfless and compassionate doctor for over 50 years,"" his daughter told the BBC. He was a senior partner at Valance Medical Centre, in Dagenham, east London. Dr Haider, who died on 6 April, also worked for more than 30 years as a senior homeopathic physician at the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine. Ms Ong ""loved her job"", her daughter Melissa told the PA news agency. She said her mother came to London from Hong Kong in the 1970s to join the NHS ""because she believed it was the best in the world"". Ms Ong began her career as a midwife and was working full-time at two surgeries and holding baby clinics before falling ill. Colleagues said the nurse, who was originally from the Philippines and worked at Hammersmith Hospital, in west London, ""loved his NHS job"". Before his death, he changed his Facebook profile picture to an image of him wearing a protective mask emblazoned with the words: ""I can't stay at home, I'm a healthcare worker."" He died after going into self-isolation with coronavirus symptoms, a friend and fellow nurse said. The care home nurse fell ill at home, in Birmingham, before being taken hospital, where she died on 7 April. Ken, her husband, said she rang him before she was put on a ventilator: ""She started telling me, 'Ken, if I don't come back be strong, I love you, be strong for the kids',"" he said. She worked at New Cross Hospital, in Wolverhampton. Sister Leilani Dayrit died of suspected coronavirus after displaying symptoms at work, her daughter has said.

Dr Edmond Adedeji worked as a locum registrar in the emergency department of Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire. ""He died doing a job he loved, serving others before himself,"" his family said in a statement. The hospital's chief executive added he was a ""respected and well-liked member of the team"". Dr Ayache stopped working a month before he died, but his family say they think he continued to visit patients in their homes in an effort to help. The retired GP, who worked for the NHS in Suffolk for more than 40 years, ""would often pop round and just check [former patients] were OK"", his daughter Layla Ayache said. ""He was a rural village GP at heart,"" she added. Mr Darlington was a grandfather and hospital porter for Mid Cheshire Hospitals known for handing out sweets to colleagues. Ava, his wife of 46 years, said he was ""a great husband, as well as father and grandfather"". ""He always walked round the hospital with a smile on his face, passing out sweets to colleagues,"" facilities supervisor Richard Studinski added. Joanna Klenczon ""touched the lives of so many people"" during the 10 years she worked at Northampton Hospital, its chief executive said.

He told Sky News: ""Our youngest child is 14 years old and it is so hard. The pain is unbearable."" Known to his colleagues as ""Bob"", Mr Bamotra ""touched so many people's hearts with his personality"", his family said in a statement. The 63-year-old had worked as a radiology support worker at the King George Hospital in Ilford, east London, for four years. ""There's not a time when we can say he wouldn't go that extra mile to do something for anyone to make sure they were happy,"" his family added. Mother-of-two Ms Campbell was a ""treasured"" member of staff who could ""light up a room with her infectious laugh and bubbly personality"", colleagues said. ""She was often found singing and dancing, entertaining patients and staff, making everyone smile,"" they added. Ms Campbell was a healthcare support worker who worked at the Velindre Cancer Centre, in Cardiff. Mr Rico worked as a porter at John Radcliffe Hospital, in Oxford, after moving to the UK from the Philippines, in 2004. Married to a nurse at the hospital, he was ""popular and hard-working"", colleagues said. ""He would walk around the hospital with a smile on his face and very rarely would he call in sick from work,"" his daughter, Carla, said. Julie Omar had been working as a sister on Ward 14 at the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, and had also previously worked with the trauma team at Worcestershire Royal Hospital. She was a ""much-loved member"" of its nursing team, said the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. She died at home on 10 April, and leaves a husband, Laith, and a grown-up daughter.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Scottish government suggests covering face in shops and public transport The Scottish government has recommended people cover their faces while in some enclosed public spaces, such as shops and public transport. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there could be ""some benefit"" in wearing a cloth face covering in places where social distancing was difficult. But she said it was ""not a substitute"" for existing lockdown restrictions. Downing Street said UK ministers were considering the scientific evidence for introducing similar advice. The prime minister's official spokesman said a review had been carried out by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), adding: ""Once a decision has been reached then we'll announce it publicly."" The Scottish government guidance is not mandatory and will not be enforced by the authorities. UK sees weekly deaths double normal levels Latest on coronavirus in Scotland,external Should we all be covering our faces now? Ms Sturgeon stressed that the advice related to cloth garments such as a scarf rather than ""medical grade facemasks"" like those used by health and care workers. The first minister said evidence about the usefulness of face coverings was ""limited"", but that there may be ""some benefit in wearing a face covering if you enter an enclosed space where you will come into contract with multiple people and safe social distancing is difficult"". She said: ""To be clear, the benefit comes mainly in cases where someone might have the virus but is not aware of that because they are not experiencing symptoms and thus not isolating completely. ""Wearing a face covering in those circumstances may reduce the risk of that person transmitting the virus to others."" Ms Sturgeon said there was no evidence to suggest that wearing a face covering outdoors was of any benefit. The first minister warned that she did not want people to ""think they are invincible"" while covering their face in enclosed spaces such as shops. She said: ""It may do some good in limited circumstances, but it cannot and should not be seen as a substitute for the other rules and guidelines."" The Scottish government's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch,said earlier this monththere was ""no evidence"" to support members of the public wearing protective face masks. The government advice says face coverings should not be used by people with asthma or children under the age of two. It adds: ""When applying or removing the covering, it is important that you wash your hands first and avoid touching your face. ""After each use, you must wash the face covering at 60 degrees centigrade, or dispose of it safely."" Read the full government guidance here,external The guidance also says that it is ""not being made mandatory and will not be enforced at this stage"" due to the ""relatively weak"" evidence of the impact of face coverings on transmission of the virus. However, Ms Sturgeon said this would be kept under review as the government considers how to ease lockdown restrictions. The key factor in the Scottish decision is what's called ""asymptomatic transmission"" - people who are infected but not showing symptoms passing on the virus to others. Almost a month ago, US government assessed the latest research into this risk and concluded that the public should cover their faces when in confined spaces. A study in Singapore had found evidence that coronavirus had been spread by people who had not realised they were infected. In particular scientists identified the possibility of the virus being passed in a two-day period before symptoms started to show. Dozens of governments are now urging - or ordering - their citizens to cover their faces in an effort to reduce this route of infection. As Nicola Sturgeon said, this is not about urging people to rush out to buy professional-grade masks - these are designed to protect medical and care staff and should be reserved for them. Instead, as in the US, the idea is to devise your own covering, not so much to protect you and as to protect others where distancing isn't possible. The UK's government's scientific advisers weighed up the evidence last week and we're now waiting to see whether ministers decide to follow the Scottish example. What is happening in other countries? Americans have been advised to use clean cloth or fabric to cover their faces Other countries have brought in different rules around the wearing of face masks. They are to become compulsory on public transportin Germany, andin supermarkets and pharmacies in Austria. Residents in Lombardy in Italymust cover their nose and mouth,externalwhen outside and the French governmentplans to give out masks to the general public.,external Air passengers in Canadamust wear a non-medical mask or a face covering,,externaland in the USA,people are advised to wear,external""cloth face coverings"" in supermarkets and pharmacies. Should we all be covering our faces now? This video can not be played Should I wear a mask to stop coronavirus? Ms Sturgeon also announced that all over-70s in Scotland will now be tested for Covid-19 on admission to hospital. They will also be tested every four days throughout their stay. The latest figures show that 10,721 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, of which 1,754 people are in hospital, and 126 are in intensive care - figures which Ms Sturgeon said ""continue to give us case for cautious optimism"". Ms Sturgeon said a further 70 people who had tested positive for the virus have died, bringing the total under that measure to 1,332. Wider statistics including deaths where Covid-19 was a suspected cause will be published on Wednesday. Ms Sturgeon said: ""These numbers are not and never will be seen as just statistics - behind each and everyone of these numbers is a unique and irreplaceable individual whose loss is a source of grief for their friends and family.""

"Airlines across the world have grounded aircraft as passenger numbers collapse British Airways is set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforce due to a collapse in business because of the coronavirus pandemic. The airline's parent company, IAG, said it needed to impose a ""restructuring and redundancy programme"" until demand for air travel returns to 2019 levels. The pilots' union Balpa said it was ""devastated"" at the news and vowed to fight ""every single"" job cut. IAG also owns Spanish airline Iberia and Ireland's Aer Lingus. In a statement, IAG said: ""The proposals remain subject to consultation, but it is likely that they will affect most of British Airways' employees and may result in the redundancy of up to 12,000 of them."" The company said it will take several years for air travel to return to pre-virus levels, a warning that has been echoed by airlines across the world. Alongside IAG's statement, BA chief executive Alex Cruz wrote in a letter to staff: ""In the last few weeks, the outlook for the aviation industry has worsened further and we must take action now. We are a strong, well-managed business that has faced into, and overcome, many crises in our hundred-year history. ""We must overcome this crisis ourselves, too. There is no government bailout standing by for BA and we cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely... We will see some airlines go out of business."" Airlines fear new cash crisis if jobs scheme ends Bransonâs Virgin Atlantic in virus bailout talks Airbus furloughs 3,200 after 'bleeding cash' alert About 4,500 pilots and 16,000 cabin crew work for BA, which has already put almost 23,000 staff on furlough. Balpa's general secretary Brian Strutton said: ""This has come as a bolt out of the blue from an airline that said it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support. ""Balpa does not accept that a case has been made for these job losses and we will be fighting to save every single one."" Also on Tuesday, IAG revealed the impact of the virus outbreak on group revenues. In the first three months of 2020 revenues fell 13% to â¬4.6bn (Â£4bn). Worse is to come warned Stephen Gunning, IAG's chief financial officer. Airlines across the world have warned they face a fight for survival. In the UK, EasyJet has laid off its 4,000 UK-based cabin crew for two months. And Sir Richard Branson has appealed to the government to help bail out his Virgin Atlantic airline with a loan thought to be up to Â£500m. Elsewhere, Qantas has put 20,000 staff on leave, while Air Canada has done the same for about 15,200 employees. Norwegian Air has said it could run out of cash by mid-May. At American Airlines, about 4,800 pilots have agreed to take short-term leave on reduced pay and more than 700 are taking early retirement. We know the aviation industry is in the throes of an unprecedented crisis. But the announcement from IAG is chilling nonetheless - and not only because of the number of jobs at stake. That's because the company is saying explicitly that it expects the recovery in the industry to be a very slow one, with passenger demand not reaching 2019 levels for ""several years"". The airline can survive on its financial reserves for the moment - and take advantage of the government's job retention scheme to furlough employees for a short period. Government support of this kind is very short term. With a quick recovery it might be enough to save a large number of jobs. Yet the prospect of that happening is deeply uncertain. It's not clear when countries will remove travel restrictions, under what conditions people will be able to fly - or even if they'll want to. IAG has now made it clear it's expecting the industry to look very different in future to what was the norm until just a few weeks ago, and is taking action accordingly. But unions will disagree, and the company may find itself accused of over-reacting - or even of taking advantage of the crisis in order to reduce its cost base.

"This video can not be played ""We'll be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England"" - Matt Hancock Millions more people are to be eligible for coronavirus tests, according to government announcements on Tuesday. In England, all care home residents and staff will be able to access tests from Wednesday, regardless of whether they have symptoms. People over 65 and those who must leave home to work, as well as those they live with, will be able to get tested if they have symptoms of Covid-19. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to follow suit. It comes after figures revealeda third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes. How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Care home coronavirus deaths rising rapidly Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""From construction workers to emergency plumbers, from research scientists to those in manufacturing, the expansion of access to testing will protect the most vulnerable and help keep people safe."" Anyone eligible can book a test onthe government's test-booking website,external. Last week,it closed temporarilyfollowing ""exceptional demand"" when key workers were first able to register. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Mr Hancock also announced that a small number of hospitals in England will begin testing all patients for coronavirus, regardless of if they are showing symptoms, as part of a pilot. The government has pledged to carry out 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, but the latest figures showed just over 43,000 tests took place across the UK on Monday - less than half its goal. The health secretary said daily testing capacity had increased to 73,400 and insisted the UK was ""on track"" to hit 100,000 tests a day by Thursday. This represents a massive expansion of who is eligible for testing - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a test if they have symptoms. That will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as part of the ""test, track and trace"" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay. It is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing kits and mobile units staffed by the armed forces. The problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-through testing centres have not always been in convenient locations. There is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire. The expansion has also allowed the government to do something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the testing of residents and staff without symptoms. A big concern is that the virus has been able to get a foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms or if they are asymptomatic. But promising something is one thing - delivering it is another. While the capacity looks like it will be there to test 100,000 a day by the end of the month, the numbers actually getting tested are currently less than half that. Meanwhile, in Scotland,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidall patients over 70 who are admitted to hospital for any reason will now be tested for Covid-19. In Northern Ireland,testing has begun in some GP practicesand will also be expanded in hospitals and care homes. Wales has adopteda needs-based approach to testingfor NHS and ""critical"" non-NHS workers. Office for National Statistics data showed there were 2,000 coronavirus care home deaths in England and Wales in the week ending 17 April, double the previous week. It brings the total number of deaths in care homes linked to the virus since the start of the pandemic to 3,096. Coronavirus deaths in hospitals across the UK, have reached 21,678 - a rise of 586 from Monday. The health secretary said from Wednesday the government will publish daily figures on deaths in care homes and the community. He said the change aimed to ""bring as much transparency as possible"" to the figures and ""add to our understanding of how this virus is spreading day by day"".

"Fast food fans have been buoyed by news that burger chain McDonald's is testing reopening a branch this week. The bad news for hungry folk is that the branch will only open for ""operational tests"" and remain closed to customers. The chain said: ""Recently, we began working through a potential and limited reopening."" But it refused to put a date on when customers would be able to pick up a Happy Meal again. Shops preparing ways to reopen Greggs to begin reopening shops Major takeaway chains start to reopen ""Restarting our business is not an easy task, even when reopening in a limited capacity,"" said Paul Pomroy, McDonald's UK and Ireland chief executive. ""For now we remain closed, and will only reopen when we are absolutely confident we can have the right measures in place to ensure everyone's well-being."" Rumours began circulating that the chain would soon be serving up its popular Big Mac meals last week afterthe Irish Farmers Journal reported that some branches would reopen,externalin May. The restaurant group says it is keen to reopen branches as soon as it can, but it won't rush into doing so. ""We have been listening to our employees and customers as well as engaging with government and trade bodies to help ensure we do this responsibly, when the time is right,"" said Mr Pomroy. He said McDonald's had set itself some key criteria for reopening, all of which take time. These include ensuring the well-being of workers and creating the right environment for them to return to work. It also needs to ensure it has enough supply of fresh produce. Finally, it is working in step with government guidelines to ensure the safety of customers. The behind-closed-doors test which starts this week will involve ""exploring social distancing measures for our crew, PPE options and opening in a limited capacity,"" the company said. McDonald's shut all its branches last month in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. But it has seen rivals such as Burger King, KFC and Pret A Manger reopening some sites for delivery and takeaway over the past week. YesterdayGreggs became the latest fast food retailer to announce it is reopeningsome of its outlets despite the coronavirus lockdown. The bakery chain, which has more than 2,050 shops, said it would open 20 of them in the Newcastle area from Monday 4 May as part of a ""controlled trial"", with more to follow. Greggs boss Roger Whiteside said the trial, set to last at least two weeks, would involve a limited product range and shorter trading hours. He hopes to have all stores open again by 1 July, when the government's job retention scheme is due to end, although the timing could change, depending on future government announcements. Meanwhile Nando's has reopened six of its UK restaurants for delivery. The peri-peri chicken chain has reopened the kitchens of four restaurants in London and two in Manchester. However visitors won't be welcome - the branches will only offer a takeaway service through Deliveroo. Nando's said: ""The menu will be reduced to help the team maintain social distance in the kitchen and food prep areas. ""Each Nando's restaurant has been working under Public Health England guidelines for the past week on top of their existing health and safety procedures. ""Every member of the team has been washing their hands more frequently while maintaining social distance during shifts."" The company said it is the ""first phase"" of its reopening plans but more restaurants could follow suit, And Wagamama fans in some parts of London will from Thursday be able to have the food delivered by Deliveroo. The pan-Asian restaurant chain is reopening its kitchens at Peckham and Hackney. Kitchens in Leeds will reopen shortly, Wagamama said. Emma Woods, chief executive of Wagamama, said: ""We have taken medical advice on how we keep our teams safe in a kitchen environment from a doctor who advises on health and safety in challenging operating environments, including previous experience in the cruise industry. This will be very much a test-and-learn approach for the business.""

"NHS staff say they are at risk because of equipment shortages Boris Johnson focused on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at his first cabinet coronavirus meeting since returning to work, Downing Street said. The government has been defending its record on PPE supplies for health workers, following a BBC investigation. The BBC's Panorama found the government failed to buy crucial protective equipment to cope with a pandemic. Ministers say stockpiles had been designed for a flu pandemic, on scientific advice. Covid-19 is a different disease with a higher hospitalisation rate, the government has said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock criticised the Panorama report and a survey of doctors showing their concerns, at the daily Downing Street coronavirus press conference. UK failed to stockpile crucial protective kit Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags Are NHS staff getting enough protective gear? In answer to a question from the BBC's health editor, Hugh Pym, Mr Hancock said: ""I saw two of the things you referred to. ""I'm not sure they were a fair and objective journalistic assessment of the situation but what we do have is constant focus on the realities of getting PPE to the frontline."" He added that ""we have been moving heaven and earth"" to get sufficient PPE to the frontline in a ""mammoth effort"". NHS staff say they are being put at risk because of the shortage of PPE. The Panorama investigation found there were no gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in the government's pandemic stockpile when Covid-19 reached the UK, and that the government ignored a warning from its own advisers to buy missing equipment. Gowns are currently one of the items in shortest supply in the UK and they are now difficult to source because of the global shortage of PPE. The expert committee that advises the government on pandemics, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), recommended the purchase of gowns last June. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the documentary had ""exposed government failures"" in providing ""life-saving"" equipment. ""Ministers shouldn't be trying to rubbish the contributors, they should take responsibility and ensure our NHS and care staff have the PPE they need,"" he tweeted. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We have been working to secure gowns and other PPE from across the globe - and domestically - for a number of months. ""The pandemic influenza preparatory programme was designed to prepare for flu outbreaks and the decision was based on advice from Nervtag - gowns are a recent recommendation from Nervtag and would be procured for future preparations."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The spokesman said the PM had focused on PPE delivery at a meeting of the cabinet's coronavirus response group on Monday morning - his first day back at work after recovering from the virus. Downing Street said that on Monday the government had delivered 12 million items of PPE to 227 NHS Trusts and other locations, including gloves, aprons, masks, eye protectors and gowns. Responding to claims in the Panorama investigation that gloves were sometimes counted individually, making the figure appear bigger than it was, No 10 said: ""Gloves are counted differently depending on clinical settings. ""Sometimes they're single and sometimes pairs. They are often counted in fours in high risk areas. They're counted in a number of different ways."" On Tuesday, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told MPs: ""Like every government across the world, we have had to respond to this new virus by assuring not just with personal protective equipment, but in every respect, that we are in a position to retool, refit and to upgrade our response."" Mr Gove added that the government was on course to meet its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day on Thursday, but the figures would not be published until Saturday.

"Intisar Chowdhury said he wanted Matt Hancock to acknowledge mistakes have been made The son of an NHS doctor who died with coronavirus has called on Health Secretary Matt Hancock to say sorry for mistakes in the government's response. Intisar Chowdhury, 18, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a public apology would help improve public trust. Intisar's father Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, 53,warned about a lack of protectionbefore he died. Mr Hancock later told LBC that listening to front-line staff would help the government improve. He added that he did not want to ""play down"" the efforts of those working to get personal protective equipment (PPE) to the front line. UK holds minute's silence for fallen key workers Rising virus care home toll leads to record deaths Mr Hancock said: ""A huge amount of people are doing everything they can and have done since the start of this crisis. I don't want to play down the enormous efforts of many thousands of people who are working every hour that there is to try to solve the problem."" Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury died with coronavirus earlier this month Speaking directly to the health secretary onan LBC phone-in,externalon Tuesday, Intisar said: ""The public is not expecting the government to handle this perfectly. We just want you to openly acknowledge there have been mistakes in handling this virus. ""Openly acknowledging a mistake is not an admission of guilt, it is genuinely just making you seem more human. So can you please do that for me at the press conference today - make the public apology?"" Mr Hancock responded: ""It is very important that we are constantly learning about how to do things better and I think listening to the voices on the front line will be a very important part of how we improve."" This video can not be played Intisar Chowdhury spoke to Health Secretary Matt Hancock about his father's concerns Intisar had earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier that ministers should consider giving families a private apology at some point in the future, but that a public apology now would help improve public trust. ""I definitely do want a public apology because I feel like the government's response in not only handling the PPE crisis but the whole virus in itself wasn't the best,"" he said. ""I think we can forgive that as a country because it is such an unprecedented thing it is hard to know what to do. ""But they need to hold themselves accountable for that, learn from that and move on so that we can trust them more."" Dr Chowdhury, a consultant urologist, died at Queen's Hospital in Romford, east London, earlier this month. At least 82 NHS staff and 16 care workers who were confirmed to have died in hospital in England, according to official figures. A separate BBC News analysis of published figures found that at least 114 health workers have died with the virus across the UK. It is not known where they contracted Covid-19. Mr Chowdhury's appeal comes after a BBC Panorama investigationfound the government failed to buy crucial PPE to cope with a pandemic.

"Supermarket checkout supervisor Kay Timbrell has her own phrase for the dangers she faces from coronavirus: ""I call it shop-worker roulette."" While nurses are aware when patients are sick, she says, ""we don't know who's got coronavirus. We have absolutely no idea what we have around us."" Too many customers are failing to observe social distancing and some become abusive when asked to do so, she says. ""As retail workers, we've always faced a degree of abuse,"" she says. ""We're dehumanised by putting on the uniform. But that abuse has doubled in the past month."" Kay says she wants to keep doing her job in maintaining food supplies during the pandemic: ""I want to help in this disastrous situation, but we need everyone to play their part in it, because we're putting ourselves at risk."" Women like Kay are most likely to work in key worker roles where social distancing isn't always possible,according to a new report by the Resolution Foundation.,external The think tank says that women are twice as likely to work in lower-paid jobs, while two in five are also working mothers. It has identified more than 8.5 million key workers in the UK, including health workers, teachers and retail staff in food shops and pharmacies. Furloughed workers urged to become fruit pickers UK employment rate at record high before lockdown ""The current crisis has affected almost every worker across the country, from having to work from home to risking infection at work or losing your livelihood altogether,"" said Maja Gustafsson, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation. ""But women, young people and the low-paid are most likely to be bearing the biggest health and economic risks from the crisis, which has shone a spotlight on the vitality of work that has been undervalued and underpaid for far too long,"" she added. The Resolution Foundation also found that young people are most likely to work in sectors that have been shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 40% of employed 16 to 24-year-olds work in sectors hit bylockdown measures introduced by the government in March.,external They include the arts, retail and hospitality industries, with only one quarter of young people able to work from home, while nearly half of older workers can. This video can not be played Coronavirus career pivot: 'I now work in a supermarket' The new study also suggests that any rise in unemployment will disproportionately affect young people, as it did following the 2008 financial crash. UK employment was estimated at a record highin the three months to February of this year, before the effects of the coronavirus lockdown started to kick in.

"The government must consider the impact of the lockdown on domestic abuse and mental health as it plans its exit strategy, Theresa May has said. The former prime minister said measures to tackle coronavirus must not do ""more damage than the disease itself"". She spoke as MPs debated the Domestic Abuse Bill, amid evidence of rising violence during the lockdown. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said help would be available for all such victims during the outbreak. There has beena ""surge"" in violence in the weeks since the lockdownwas introduced, a report by MPs said, with a rise in killings and the number of calls to the National Domestic Abuse helpline run by Refuge up 49% after three weeks. Addressing MPs via video link, Mrs May said the government must think about the ""impact of lockdown on our overall health and wellbeing"". She said police and local authorities should consider random visits to homes of known domestic abuse perpetrators during lockdown, or addresses where there had been reports of violence. But added that would have to be done carefully, so as not to make the situation worse. 'I'm in coronavirus lockdown with my abuser' Mrs May's government introduced the Domestic Abuse Bill last July, but it has been postponed since before the general election. It brings in new protections for victims - including Domestic Abuse Protection Orders and Protection Notices, which can be used to impose long-term bans on perpetrators making contact with the victim. It applies to England and Wales and proposes the first government definition of domestic abuse, including financial abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical behaviour. The Northern Ireland Assemblyalso debated legislationto strengthen domestic abuse laws on Tuesday. Mr Buckland told MPs the Domestic Violence Bill aimed to raise awareness of the crime, to protect and support victims and their children, to ""transform"" the response in the justice system and to ""improve performance across all national and local agencies"". The government has always stressed that its Domestic Abuse Bill is proof of its determination to tackle a problem that has been described as an epidemic in the UK. The bill - drafted before the lockdown - creates a statutory definition of domestic abuse, emphasising it's not just physical: it can also involve coercive or controlling behaviour and financial constraints. These provisions go to the heart of what could now be happening in homes up and down the country. Domestic abuse charities have seen a huge increase in calls and online requests for help during the lockdown. Victims are suffering both physically and emotionally in homes that are not places of safety. Many of the traditional escape routes have been cut off. A pandemic on top of an epidemic, as one victim described it. Labour has proposed amendments that would see 10% of theÂ£750 million charity support package announced this monthring-fenced in a fast-track fund for domestic abuse charities. MPs also said the bill must do more to protect victims regardless of their immigration status, and to ensure that there is adequate accommodation across the board for victims who flee their homes. As a short-term measure during the lockdown, former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called on the government to house them in vacant hotel rooms until decent alternatives could be found. ""We know that some hotel chains have offered to help with providing accommodation. These hotels should be taken up on that offer,"" she said. Amendments that MPs proposed to table included putting a stop to a defence of ""rough sex gone wrong"" in court. Conservative MP Mark Garnier's constituent Natalie Connolly died in 2016 after sustaining more than 40 separate injuries - but her boyfriend was cleared of murder in 2018 on the basis of such a defence. ""How can it possibly be the case that somebody dies through sex?"" Mr Garnier asked the Commons. ""It doesn't make any sense, this is wrong."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Charities, too, have called for the Domestic Abuse Bill to offer more support for victims. Its measures include requiring councils in England to provide support for victims and their children in refuges and other safe accommodation. However, Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan said this must be broadened out. ""With the majority of victims remaining in the family home, especially in BAME communities, it's vital that Parliament extends this duty to cover all victims and children - no matter where they live,"" he said. There are also calls for a new offence of ""non-fatal strangulation"" to be included, and for authorities to start collecting data on domestic abuse among the over-74s. Earlier, the government announced it would spend Â£3.1 million on services supporting children who witness ""appalling abuse"" at home during the coronavirus lockdown. The funding will be given to councils, charities, and police and crime commissioners in England and Wales, and will go towards services such as counselling sessions and early intervention schemes, the Home Office said. But shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the amount ""falls woefully short"" of what is needed to ""support vital frontline services"". Earlier, safeguarding minister Victoria Atkins told the BBC ministers were working with refuge providers to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the availability of places. ""I would also like for us to be looking at perhaps kicking the perpetrator out, rather than the victim, so that she stays in her home safely... and the perpetrator has his behaviour addressed to stop this cycle of abuse,"" she said. The Domestic Abuse Bill would also focus on ""stopping the perpetrator's behaviour in the first place"", she said. This video can not be played ""You will not be breaking coronavirus regulations and you will not be breaking the law if you seek help outside."" Speaking in the Commons before the debate, Attorney General Suella Braverman stressed that victims will not be breaking the law if they need to seek help outside the home during lockdown. She told MPs: ""I want to take this opportunity to let victims out there, both men and women, know that they don't have to suffer in silence.""

"Sales are at levels normally seen at Christmas Some 373,000 property sales are on hold owing to the coronavirus lockdown, analysis of the housing market in UK cities suggests. The value of held sales totals a collective Â£82bn, researchers at property portal Zoopla have estimated. Agreed sales were running at a tenth of the normal level for the time of year, and were akin to the activity seen in late December, they said. Spring is usually a busy time for the housing and mortgage markets. It is known in the trade as the ""spring bounce"". However, the stay-at-home message from the government has meant that people are only moving to new homes in rare circumstances, such as entering a vacant property. Government advice is for sellers and buyers to come toan amicable arrangementover delaying a moving date. Banks to allow customers to defer mortgage payments Demand from renters slumps amid lockdown Lenders kick-start mortgage deals Zoopla researchers said the rate of sales falling through peaked on 23 March - the day the UK lockdown began. It added that demand for housing was down 60% on levels recorded at the start of March. However, the picture varied across UK cities, with Cardiff recording an 80% drop in demand from buyers, and Newcastle a 48% fall. The housing market could take some time to recover Zoopla said people had been browsing for homes less on the internet, but this had recovered slightly in the last couple of weeks, perhaps in response to the fact people are living and working from home and yearning for more room on the domestic front. ""Some may feel the urge to move and find more space or consider the potential for remote working,"" said Richard Donnell, director of research and insight at Zoopla. ""This could boost activity in the second half of 2020, but this all depends upon how much the economy is impacted over the rest of the year and the impact on levels of unemployment."" Overall, Zoopla expects the number of completed sales across the UK this year to be around half that seen in 2019. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"HSBC has paused plans to cut 35,000 jobs, saying it does not want to leave staff unable to find work elsewhere during the coronavirus outbreak. The bank announced the cuts in February as part of a massive cost-cutting programme. But boss Noel Quinn said the ""the vast majority"" of redundancies would now be put on hold due to the exceptional circumstances. It came as HSBC reported a 50% fall in profits linked to the pandemic. Pre-tax earnings for the first three months came in at $3.2bn (Â£2.6bn), down from $6.2bn  a year ago. Coronavirus: Banksâ top brass forgo bonuses Banks bow to pressure to axe investor payouts HSBC signals mass job cuts as profits plunge The bank forecast bad loans would rise to $3bn due to customers not being able to repay them during the crisis. It also said earnings were likely to remain under pressure. ""The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our customers has been the main driver of the change in our financial performance,"" Mr Quinn said. Earlier this year, HSBC said it planned to scale back its headcount from 235,000 to about 200,000 over the next three years. The move is part of a restructuring programme which aimed to achieve $4.5bn (Â£3.6bn) of cost cuts by 2022. Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, told the BBC's Today programme the plan to delay job cuts would provoke mixed feelings. ""This is probably the best bit of news in the whole results for employees,"" he said. ""But while it's good news for employees it isn't necessarily good news for shareholders and a return to higher profitability."" Analysis, Dharshini David, global trade correspondent HSBC has suffered a dramatic halving of profits with provisions for bad loans up  five-fold to $3.2bn (Â£2.4bn). Yet the bosses of HSBC, its shareholders and employees may have uttered a sigh of relief: relief that the damage wasn't greater, given HSBC's exposure to some of the worst affected markets  - and relief that plans to cut up to one in eight jobs have been paused. But that relief may be fleeting. The bank's bosses have warned that provision for  bad loans could hit $11bn  this year, resulting in ""materially lower profits"" . They, like  governments worldwide are bracing for a severe recession, especially in Europe and the US. And while HSBC sees signs of recovery in China as factories fire back up, it acknowledges that will be hit by weaker demand from the West. That makes HSBC's massive restructuring plan, which relies on pivoting towards Asia, even more arduous. As the tough times hit, it's curbing costs - cutting the size of the bonus pool and keeping the 2020 dividend under review. But when the job cuts do resume, they may be more severe than initially envisaged. Separately, in a note to employees earlier this month, HSBC's chief executive Noel Quinn said he would donate a quarter of his base salary, about Â£160,000, for the next six months to charity. He will also not take his annual cash bonus, which would have been up to Â£1.2m. Chief financial officer Ewen Stevenson said he would take similar action,  donating Â£93,000 and forgoing Â£706,000, while chairman Mark Tucker will donate his entire 2020 fee to charity, about Â£1.5m. It came as senior executives and board members at other major UK banks, including RBS and Lloyds, agreed to give up their bonuses for this year. The announcements were in response to calls from the Bank of England to restrict bonuses during the pandemic.

"This video can not be played UK holds a minutes silence for coronavirus key worker deaths A minute's silence has been held across the UK to commemorate the key workers who have died with coronavirus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whoreturned to work on Monday,joined the tribute at 11:00 BST. More than 100 NHS and care staff have died with the virus, as have many transport and other key workers. Meanwhile, the son of a doctor who died hascalled on the governmentto issue a public apology for issues with personal protective equipment (PPE). Intisar Chowdhury, 18, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted ministers ""to accept their mistakes and let their mistakes become improvement rather than just ignore them and completely move on"". Intisar's father, Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, 53,who died earlier this month, had warned Prime Minister Boris Johnson about a lack of PPE five days before being hospitalised. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was also asked by Mr Chowdhury to apologise on LBC, and said ""listening to the voices on the front line is a very, very important part of how we improve"". Staff observe the minute's silence outside Salford Royal Hospital Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined the silence with Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill and Chancellor Rishi Sunak At 11:00, people across the country paused to join the minute's silence. Dame Donna Kinnair, head of the Royal College of Nursing, said she was ""heartened to hear how many people took part"". In Northern Ireland, assembly membershalted business to observe the silence, in Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford and other Welsh ministers were among thosepaying respects in Wales, and in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeonled the tribute in Edinburgh. The latest daily figures on Monday show a further 360 people died with the virus in UK hospitals, taking the total number of deaths to 21,092. This number includes 82 NHS staff and 16 care workers who were confirmed to have died in hospital in England. A separate BBC News analysis of published figures found thatat least 114 health workershave died with the virus across the UK. It is not known where they contracted Covid-19. Transport for London said the underground and bus network would be brought to a halt for the silence Staff outside Salford Royal Hospital reacted to the moving silence A veteran joins the silence outside Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS staff at the Mater Infirmorum Hospital in Belfast stood 2m apart to follow distancing rules Latest statisticsreleased on Tuesday from the Office for National Statistics- which count all deaths, not just those in hospitals - found the number of people who died in England and Wales hit a record high in the week ending 17 April. More than 22,000 people died - the highest since records began in 1993. Across the whole of the UK there were 24,686 deaths registered in the week after Easter - more than twice as many as normal. The rise is partly driven by an increasing number of deaths in care homes, which accounted for a third of all deaths. The figures show deaths in care homes were continuing to rise, compared with the number of deaths in hospitals which appears to have peaked and is coming down. BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe said the data ""showed the epidemic certainly hasn't reached its peak in care homes"". Remembering 100 NHS workers who have died 'Living legend' doctor dies after contracting virus Nurse, 84, 'gave her life to the NHS' Meanwhile, it comes as a BBC Panorama investigation foundthe government failed to buy enough PPE to cope with a pandemic. There were no gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in the government's pandemic stockpile when Covid-19 reached the UK, the programme reported. Government minister Victoria Atkins told BBC Breakfast she was ""very, very sorry to hear"" of the Panorama report. ""Like every other country in the world, [the virus] is unprecedented and the requirements for PPE have risen exponentially and we're doing our absolute best to address those needs and will continue to do so,"" she said. She added that, since the outbreak began, ""a billion pieces of PPE"" have been distributed across the UK. The Archbishop of York John Sentanu was among those inviting people to take part in the minute's silence - which coincided with International Workers Memorial Day. ""Workers should not be sent into danger without the correct PPE,"" he said and called for those on the front line to be ""given all the safety equipment they need"".

"This video can not be played Tesco online deliveries to double in a month People have reverted to shopping the way they did a decade ago by making one big weekly trip to the supermarket, according to the boss of Tesco. Chief executive Dave Lewis said Covid-19 social distancing measures mean consumers are shopping less frequently. He said that the number of transactions in April nearly halved, but the size of the average basket had doubled. Mr Lewis added Tesco has now broken through the one million online delivery slots a week for the first time. He expects the supermarket will add a further 200,000 slots over the next ten days, in particularfrom vulnerable customers. Tesco has achieved an increase in online capacity of 103% in the space of a few weeks, growth which would normally take years to achieve. The other supermarkets have also ramped up delivery slots. Before the crisis, only about 7% of all groceries were bought online. ""We're trying to help as many people as we can. And the single biggest thing has been the change in online shopping,"" he said. ""The issue that we have is that when the government talks about vulnerable customers, it has very specific guidelines and they had about 400,000 that they wanted the retail industry to help. They gave us 350,000 of those names and we got to 260,000. Shoppers swap clothes for drink as retail sales sink Tesco tells people to visit stores to get food ""We will want to do more, but there's still more demand than we're able to supply,"" Mr Lewis said. The Tesco boss's comments about the weekly shop were backed up by data from retail consultant Kantar, which said households made a ""record low"" number of trips to the supermarket in the 12 weeks to 19 April. However, average basket sizes had ""hit their highest levels ever"", it added. ""Grocery sales were Â£524m higher in the past four weeks than they were in April 2019, as British consumers adapted to life under lockdown,"" Kantar said. Online sales now account for 10.2% of the grocery market. ""On average, households shopped only 14 times for groceries over the past month, a record low and down from 17 in more normal times,"" Kantar said. ""A drop in frequency was matched by a corresponding uplift in the amount spent on each trip to Â£26.02 - easily the highest figure ever recorded by Kantar and Â£7 greater than last year."" Tesco remains the UK's biggest supermarket, with a 26.8% share of the market, with shoppers spending 7.2% more than in the same period last year. Other supermarkets saw even bigger rises in spending, with the Co-op up 20% and online-only Ocado rising 19.4%. In his first broadcast interview since the outbreak of coronavirus, Mr Lewis spoke about how Britain's biggest retailer had adapted and how shopping habits have changed during lockdown. ""People are shopping once a week, a little like they did 10 or 15 years ago, rather than two, three or four times a week that was happening before the crisis."" He added that during the surge in panic buying - when customers stripped supermarket shelves of goods like liquid soap, toilet roll and pasta - Tesco ""had seen seven weeks of sales going in one or two days"". ""The food supply chain is now back in good shape,"" he believes.  Flour, though, is still in short supply. Tesco is asking those who can come into store to do so Mr Lewis described the last six weeks as ""incredible"" adding that ""just about everything in the business had changed"". For instance, Tesco has taken on 45, 000 temporary workers to help cover for the 51,000 staff who were absent because of Covid-19 and cope with the increase in online deliveries. Mr Lewis said the company, the UK's biggest private sector employer with more than 300,000 workers, is now in the process of welcoming back staff who have been away while those temporary hires leave. ""We still have probably 35,000 to 40,000 double cover at the moment,"" he said. ""I think what was really quite humbling was the willingness of people to come and work in a supermarket and help us feed the nation. We've had some very interesting new colleagues - from BA pilots, West End theatre, to racing drivers... and we've trained them all very quickly"". The priority is to keep his staff and shoppers safe. ""I've been really quite amazed how well 99% of our customers have adapted to the changes in stores, "" he said. ""But we have to recognise that until the advice of the government changes, then we need to maintain social distance. So, we will, for the foreseeable future have to keep those measures in place."" The challenge will be keeping the discipline in smaller stores, especially in city centres, when people return to work. Mr Lewis was asked about the impact of coronavirus on retail and High Streets more broadly. He said a lot depended on how customers behave once the crisis is over but he hoped it would encourage the country to think about its future food strategy. ""I think the food chain has done really very well. Two weeks after such a big demand spike everything did recover, so there is resilience. ""I think what this crisis has shown is the importance of food retail. I think in the past, perhaps, a little bit we may have taken that for granted. So I hope that as a nation, we'll think carefully about food, food strategy and distribution.""

"Sales are at levels normally seen at Christmas Some 373,000 property sales are on hold owing to the coronavirus lockdown, analysis of the housing market in UK cities suggests. The value of held sales totals a collective Â£82bn, researchers at property portal Zoopla have estimated. Agreed sales were running at a tenth of the normal level for the time of year, and were akin to the activity seen in late December, they said. Spring is usually a busy time for the housing and mortgage markets. It is known in the trade as the ""spring bounce"". However, the stay-at-home message from the government has meant that people are only moving to new homes in rare circumstances, such as entering a vacant property. Government advice is for sellers and buyers to come toan amicable arrangementover delaying a moving date. Banks to allow customers to defer mortgage payments Demand from renters slumps amid lockdown Lenders kick-start mortgage deals Zoopla researchers said the rate of sales falling through peaked on 23 March - the day the UK lockdown began. It added that demand for housing was down 60% on levels recorded at the start of March. However, the picture varied across UK cities, with Cardiff recording an 80% drop in demand from buyers, and Newcastle a 48% fall. The housing market could take some time to recover Zoopla said people had been browsing for homes less on the internet, but this had recovered slightly in the last couple of weeks, perhaps in response to the fact people are living and working from home and yearning for more room on the domestic front. ""Some may feel the urge to move and find more space or consider the potential for remote working,"" said Richard Donnell, director of research and insight at Zoopla. ""This could boost activity in the second half of 2020, but this all depends upon how much the economy is impacted over the rest of the year and the impact on levels of unemployment."" Overall, Zoopla expects the number of completed sales across the UK this year to be around half that seen in 2019. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"The government must consider the impact of the lockdown on domestic abuse and mental health as it plans its exit strategy, Theresa May has said. The former prime minister said measures to tackle coronavirus must not do ""more damage than the disease itself"". She spoke as MPs debated the Domestic Abuse Bill, amid evidence of rising violence during the lockdown. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said help would be available for all such victims during the outbreak. There has beena ""surge"" in violence in the weeks since the lockdownwas introduced, a report by MPs said, with a rise in killings and the number of calls to the National Domestic Abuse helpline run by Refuge up 49% after three weeks. Addressing MPs via video link, Mrs May said the government must think about the ""impact of lockdown on our overall health and wellbeing"". She said police and local authorities should consider random visits to homes of known domestic abuse perpetrators during lockdown, or addresses where there had been reports of violence. But added that would have to be done carefully, so as not to make the situation worse. 'I'm in coronavirus lockdown with my abuser' Mrs May's government introduced the Domestic Abuse Bill last July, but it has been postponed since before the general election. It brings in new protections for victims - including Domestic Abuse Protection Orders and Protection Notices, which can be used to impose long-term bans on perpetrators making contact with the victim. It applies to England and Wales and proposes the first government definition of domestic abuse, including financial abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical behaviour. The Northern Ireland Assemblyalso debated legislationto strengthen domestic abuse laws on Tuesday. Mr Buckland told MPs the Domestic Violence Bill aimed to raise awareness of the crime, to protect and support victims and their children, to ""transform"" the response in the justice system and to ""improve performance across all national and local agencies"". The government has always stressed that its Domestic Abuse Bill is proof of its determination to tackle a problem that has been described as an epidemic in the UK. The bill - drafted before the lockdown - creates a statutory definition of domestic abuse, emphasising it's not just physical: it can also involve coercive or controlling behaviour and financial constraints. These provisions go to the heart of what could now be happening in homes up and down the country. Domestic abuse charities have seen a huge increase in calls and online requests for help during the lockdown. Victims are suffering both physically and emotionally in homes that are not places of safety. Many of the traditional escape routes have been cut off. A pandemic on top of an epidemic, as one victim described it. Labour has proposed amendments that would see 10% of theÂ£750 million charity support package announced this monthring-fenced in a fast-track fund for domestic abuse charities. MPs also said the bill must do more to protect victims regardless of their immigration status, and to ensure that there is adequate accommodation across the board for victims who flee their homes. As a short-term measure during the lockdown, former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called on the government to house them in vacant hotel rooms until decent alternatives could be found. ""We know that some hotel chains have offered to help with providing accommodation. These hotels should be taken up on that offer,"" she said. Amendments that MPs proposed to table included putting a stop to a defence of ""rough sex gone wrong"" in court. Conservative MP Mark Garnier's constituent Natalie Connolly died in 2016 after sustaining more than 40 separate injuries - but her boyfriend was cleared of murder in 2018 on the basis of such a defence. ""How can it possibly be the case that somebody dies through sex?"" Mr Garnier asked the Commons. ""It doesn't make any sense, this is wrong."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Charities, too, have called for the Domestic Abuse Bill to offer more support for victims. Its measures include requiring councils in England to provide support for victims and their children in refuges and other safe accommodation. However, Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan said this must be broadened out. ""With the majority of victims remaining in the family home, especially in BAME communities, it's vital that Parliament extends this duty to cover all victims and children - no matter where they live,"" he said. There are also calls for a new offence of ""non-fatal strangulation"" to be included, and for authorities to start collecting data on domestic abuse among the over-74s. Earlier, the government announced it would spend Â£3.1 million on services supporting children who witness ""appalling abuse"" at home during the coronavirus lockdown. The funding will be given to councils, charities, and police and crime commissioners in England and Wales, and will go towards services such as counselling sessions and early intervention schemes, the Home Office said. But shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the amount ""falls woefully short"" of what is needed to ""support vital frontline services"". Earlier, safeguarding minister Victoria Atkins told the BBC ministers were working with refuge providers to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the availability of places. ""I would also like for us to be looking at perhaps kicking the perpetrator out, rather than the victim, so that she stays in her home safely... and the perpetrator has his behaviour addressed to stop this cycle of abuse,"" she said. The Domestic Abuse Bill would also focus on ""stopping the perpetrator's behaviour in the first place"", she said. This video can not be played ""You will not be breaking coronavirus regulations and you will not be breaking the law if you seek help outside."" Speaking in the Commons before the debate, Attorney General Suella Braverman stressed that victims will not be breaking the law if they need to seek help outside the home during lockdown. She told MPs: ""I want to take this opportunity to let victims out there, both men and women, know that they don't have to suffer in silence.""

The pandemic is playing havoc with movie release plans worldwide The organisers of the Academy Awards have announced that they will bend their own rules to let films only released on streaming
platforms be eligible for nomination. Under current rules, films have to be screened in a cinema in Los Angeles for at least seven days to qualify for awards. Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson said in a statement on Tuesday that their commitment to theatre releases was ""unchanged and unwavering"" but said the pandemic has made the rule change necessary. The Academy's new policy is only temporary while most cinemas are closed because of coronavirus. Many scheduled movie releases, including the new installment of James Bond, have been completely delayed by the pandemic. US President Donald Trump was speaking earlier at a White House event about supporting small businesses through the coronavirus pandemic. As he closed the event, Mr Trump expressed his pride at the work being done by his government and tried to compare the scale of the outbreak with the Spanish Flu pandemic. ""We're going through a period of time the likes of which we've never seen in this country before, certainly even if you go back into 1917 - it was the worst of all time but it was also not as bad here,"" Mr Trump said. ""It was very bad, it was very rough - it was a bad one. But it wasn't quite like what we're going through right now."" But the Spanish Flu pandemic happened in 1918, not 1917. It also had a far higher death toll than the coronavirus pandemic has had so far. More than 50 million people died of Spanish Flu worldwide while the current death toll from the coronavirus is about 216,000, according to Johns Hopkins University tracking. Some 675,000 Americans died in the 1918 pandemic, while some 58,000 are thought to have died with Covid-19.  US President Donald Trump has doubled down on earlier comments suggesting that American schools reopen, saying that young people are less susceptible to the virus. ""Now we found out that young people do extraordinarily well,"" with the virus, he says. ""That's why I think we can start thinking about schools."" The president said yesterday he thought it would be a ""good thing"" for schools to open up before the end of the current school year. ""I noticed that Purdue University"", in Indiana, wants to reopen, Trump said on Tuesday. ""I think that's correct."" ""So hopefully they're going to be coming back,"" he said. ""Young people do well with this horrible scourge."" The coronavirus has not hit US young children as hard as adults, however, the disease has caused hospitalisation and death across all ages. Earlier this month, a six-week-old baby died in Connecticut, believed to be one of America's youngest victim of the virus. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This video can not be played Coronavirus: Tests to be rolled out to care home staff and residents and over-65s The testing changes announced by Matt Hancockearlier this evening represent a massive expansion of who is eligible for
testing in the UK - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a
test if they have symptoms. That will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as
part of the ""test, track and trace"" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay. It is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing
kits and mobile units staffed by the Army. The problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-thru testing centres have
not always been in convenient locations. There is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the
three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire. The expansion has also allowed the government to do
something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the
testing of residents and staff without symptoms. A big concern is that the virus has been able to get a
foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms
or if they are asymptomatic. But promising something is one thing - delivering it is
another. While the capacity looks like it will be there to test
100,000 a day by the end of the month as promised, the numbers actually getting
tested are currently less than half that. Royal Mail has scrapped Saturday letter deliveries across the UK until further notice due to the coronavirus pandemic. From this weekend Saturday deliveries will be ""temporarily"" halted, the delivery company said. Monday to Friday post will continue as normal. Canadaâs
most recent data shows that social distancing is working, just as some provinces
unveil their plans to reopen the economy. Quebec, the
epicentre of Canadaâs outbreak, plans to reopen schools and some
businesses like manufacturing and construction as early as 4 May. Premier Francois Legault plans to ease controls
outside of the Montreal âhot zoneâ first. These new
plans have left some worried, as the governmentâs latest modelling shows how
essential social distancing is for Canadaâs recovery. In early
April, new cases were doubling every three days. Now they are doubling every 16
days, the data shows. Without strict
public health controls, models predict as much as 80% of the population could be
infected by the fall. If strict measures are maintained, the infection rate
could go as low as 1%. The country
currently has about 49,025 cases and 2,766 deaths. Models
predict that by 5 May, there will be 53,196 to 66,835 and 3,277 to 3,883
deaths. President Donald Trump was just asked for his response to the US hitting one million confirmed cases, given his comments in February that the 15 cases of coronavirus confirmed at the time would soon drop down ""close to zero"". ""It will go down to zero ultimately,"" Mr Trump said on Tuesday. ""You have to understand, when it comes to cases we do much more testing than anybody else. He added: 'We're doing more testing than any other country in the world by far... So we're gonna show more cases because we're doing much, much more testing, double anybody else. ""At the appropriate time it will be down to zero like we say."" Jessica LussenhopSenior staff writer, BBC News President Trump will use the Defense Production Act to compel some meat processing plants to stay open. But it will raise questions about how workers will remain safe on factory floors. Across the country, slaughterhouses and meat production facilities have shut after the coronavirus swept through the employees' ranks, sickening at least 3,300 workers and killing 20. Meat production in the US is thought to have contracted by anywhere from 25 to 40%. Because these plants process tens of thousands of animals into meat products every day, the shutdowns are having a significant impact on thousands of farmers, particularly hog farmers in the US Midwest. Without anyone to buy pigs ready for slaughter, some are beginning to euthanize their animals. Glynn Tonsor, a professor of agricultural economics at Kansas State University, says consumers will notice a decrease in available meat products in the month of May, particularly in products that require an extra step like smoking or flavouring. But he says stocks could be back to normal by June. One of the first large American pork plants to close was the Smithfield factory in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, after it became the number one Covid-19 hotspot in the US. Read the BBC's untold story of America's biggest outbreak. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris French central planning is at its finest in a crisis. As the prime minister said, never in history - not in war, occupation or disease - has France had to confront such massive disruption. And now from the bestfonctionnairebrains in the land comes an exit strategy that might just measure up to the disaster. As ever in hyper-rational France, the plan is built around numbers, categories and systems. The key figure is 3,000. That is what the government reckons will be the amount of daily infections in the weeks ahead. By setting up local âbrigadesâ of investigators to track the trail of infection,  they reckon they will test 20 contacts per infection - so 420,000 tests a week, which is well within planned capacity. Those found to have the virus will be expected to self-isolate, either at home with their families or in requisitioned hotels. And as for the rest of the population, life will very gradually resume. Protection, testing, isolation. That is the system. Which is itself then conditioned by three imperatives: acceptance of the enduring nature of the virus, progressive implementation and regional adaptation. It always sounds a mouthful when a French technocrat expounds on a plan. But sometimes it may be exactly what the country needs. Reality Check US President Donald Trump has said that the US isâdoing far more, and better, testing than any other country in the world"".,external The latest data shows 5,593,495 tests have been carried out in the US, and that is more tests in total than any other country. But the US has far more people to test than most other nations, with a population of about 328 million, and in terms of tests per capita it is still behind others. Exact testing comparisons can be difficult. Some countries count the number of people tested, while others count the total number of tests carried out as someone can be tested several times over if the first test doesn't work properly. Looking at the latest data available, the US has carried out one test in every 60 people. But Italy has done one in every 35 people, Spain around one in every 45, and Australia around one in every 50. In early March, the White House conceded that the US did not have enough testing kits, but testing has significantly increased, with the total number carried out more than quadrupling since the start of April. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter One million coronavirus cases in the US is indeed a grim milestone, a number as round and neat as it is devastating. The reality, however, is that the mark was certainly hit weeks ago, as many cases have gone undiagnosed â the disease silently spreading through communities across the nation. Only a few months ago, the pandemic seemed like a distant news story for most Americans â a problem for China, then Italy. There had been pandemic warnings before, but they had always passed with little impact on everyday life. Why would this time be different? But it was different. The virus spread from a handful of documented US cases in January, to thousands, to hundreds of thousands, and now a million â one-third of all the cases in entire world, with a death count now above 50,000. While the nationwide lockdown appears to have helped slow the spread of the virus and avoid the most dire casualty predictions, Tuesdayâs milestone is still an indictment of US governmentâs failed attempts to prevent a full-blown health â and economic â crisis. It is also a warning that despite calls to ease state-imposed restrictions and reopen businesses, the virus continues to pose a serious threat throughout the US. A total of 21,678 people have died in UK hospitals, an increase of 586 since Monday's figures. This number will be higher once deaths in care homes an in the community are included. From Wednesday, the UK will publish a daily figure of the number of people who have died in care homes, alongside the hospital deaths figure, the health secretary has announced. In the individual nations:  The tallies for individual nations differ
from the UK-wide total, because they are calculated on a different timeframe. Canadian members of Parliament convened today for the first ever virtual sitting using the videoconferencing platform Zoom. It was the first time all 338 MPs have publicly gathered virtually, in this case for a special committee to debate the federal governmentâs response to the coronavirus pandemic. There were a number of technical glitches - connection, audio and translation issues. Some members - including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - occasionally forgot to take themselves off mute. These happened despite a less formal dry run on Monday, captured in a screengrab by Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner and posted on Twitter. Missing was the usual heckling and applause. MPs will be supplementing once-weekly in-person sittings - with social distancing guidelines in place - with these virtual sittings until late May.   Allow Twitter content?

The country, suffering huge economic disruption caused by the pandemic, is the midst of a national row over how and when to lift lockdown measures.

Despite the lack of live action around the world due to the coronavirus pandemic, there is plenty of news in sport.

The US Navy's Blue Angels and the Air Force's Thunderbirds flew over New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania today in a joint salute to health care workers, first responders and other essential employees working on the frontlines of the virus outbreak. A Royal Navy submarine captainwho allowed his crew to hold a barbeque partyduring the UK lockdown has been sacked. Commander John Lewis, captain of nuclear-powered submarine HMS Trenchant, allowed the party at Devonport dockyard in Plymouth. A video shared on social media showed the crew dancing and laughing on the dockside after the submarine returned to the town for repairs. The captain has been relieved of his command following an inquiry, but will remain in the Royal Navy in another role. Confirmed virus cases in the US have now surpassed 1 million, according to Johns Hopkins University.

"This video can not be played UK holds a minutes silence for coronavirus key worker deaths A minute's silence has been held across the UK to commemorate the key workers who have died with coronavirus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whoreturned to work on Monday,joined the tribute at 11:00 BST. More than 100 NHS and care staff have died with the virus, as have many transport and other key workers. Meanwhile, the son of a doctor who died hascalled on the governmentto issue a public apology for issues with personal protective equipment (PPE). Intisar Chowdhury, 18, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted ministers ""to accept their mistakes and let their mistakes become improvement rather than just ignore them and completely move on"". Intisar's father, Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, 53,who died earlier this month, had warned Prime Minister Boris Johnson about a lack of PPE five days before being hospitalised. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was also asked by Mr Chowdhury to apologise on LBC, and said ""listening to the voices on the front line is a very, very important part of how we improve"". Staff observe the minute's silence outside Salford Royal Hospital Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined the silence with Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill and Chancellor Rishi Sunak At 11:00, people across the country paused to join the minute's silence. Dame Donna Kinnair, head of the Royal College of Nursing, said she was ""heartened to hear how many people took part"". In Northern Ireland, assembly membershalted business to observe the silence, in Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford and other Welsh ministers were among thosepaying respects in Wales, and in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeonled the tribute in Edinburgh. The latest daily figures on Monday show a further 360 people died with the virus in UK hospitals, taking the total number of deaths to 21,092. This number includes 82 NHS staff and 16 care workers who were confirmed to have died in hospital in England. A separate BBC News analysis of published figures found thatat least 114 health workershave died with the virus across the UK. It is not known where they contracted Covid-19. Transport for London said the underground and bus network would be brought to a halt for the silence Staff outside Salford Royal Hospital reacted to the moving silence A veteran joins the silence outside Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS staff at the Mater Infirmorum Hospital in Belfast stood 2m apart to follow distancing rules Latest statisticsreleased on Tuesday from the Office for National Statistics- which count all deaths, not just those in hospitals - found the number of people who died in England and Wales hit a record high in the week ending 17 April. More than 22,000 people died - the highest since records began in 1993. Across the whole of the UK there were 24,686 deaths registered in the week after Easter - more than twice as many as normal. The rise is partly driven by an increasing number of deaths in care homes, which accounted for a third of all deaths. The figures show deaths in care homes were continuing to rise, compared with the number of deaths in hospitals which appears to have peaked and is coming down. BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe said the data ""showed the epidemic certainly hasn't reached its peak in care homes"".

There were no gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in the government's pandemic stockpile when Covid-19 reached the UK, the programme reported. Government minister Victoria Atkins told BBC Breakfast she was ""very, very sorry to hear"" of the Panorama report. ""Like every other country in the world, [the virus] is unprecedented and the requirements for PPE have risen exponentially and we're doing our absolute best to address those needs and will continue to do so,"" she said. She added that, since the outbreak began, ""a billion pieces of PPE"" have been distributed across the UK. The Archbishop of York John Sentanu was among those inviting people to take part in the minute's silence - which coincided with International Workers Memorial Day. ""Workers should not be sent into danger without the correct PPE,"" he said and called for those on the front line to be ""given all the safety equipment they need"". NHS England medical director Stephen Powis said the silence ensured the health workers' ""contribution is remembered and appreciated"". Chief nursing officer Ruth May added: ""Every death is a tragedy but we feel the loss of fellow health and care workers particularly keenly."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer - who also joined the silence - said too many front-line workers had lost their lives, adding: ""We owe it to them to make sure they've got the right equipment, in the right place, at the right time."" On Monday, the government announced that families of front-line NHS and social care staff who died with the virus in England wouldreceive a Â£60,000 compensation payment. Cheryl Williams, a ward housekeeper, was ""a lynchpin of the care, comfort, and compassion"", North Middlesex University Hospital said Prerana Issar, NHS chief people officer, said that NHS England was considering how to formally commemorate all those who had died while working to care for others once the health service was through the peak of the virus.

"This video can not be played Tesco online deliveries to double in a month People have reverted to shopping the way they did a decade ago by making one big weekly trip to the supermarket, according to the boss of Tesco. Chief executive Dave Lewis said Covid-19 social distancing measures mean consumers are shopping less frequently. He said that the number of transactions in April nearly halved, but the size of the average basket had doubled. Mr Lewis added Tesco has now broken through the one million online delivery slots a week for the first time. He expects the supermarket will add a further 200,000 slots over the next ten days, in particularfrom vulnerable customers. Tesco has achieved an increase in online capacity of 103% in the space of a few weeks, growth which would normally take years to achieve. The other supermarkets have also ramped up delivery slots. Before the crisis, only about 7% of all groceries were bought online. ""We're trying to help as many people as we can. And the single biggest thing has been the change in online shopping,"" he said. ""The issue that we have is that when the government talks about vulnerable customers, it has very specific guidelines and they had about 400,000 that they wanted the retail industry to help. They gave us 350,000 of those names and we got to 260,000. Shoppers swap clothes for drink as retail sales sink Tesco tells people to visit stores to get food ""We will want to do more, but there's still more demand than we're able to supply,"" Mr Lewis said. The Tesco boss's comments about the weekly shop were backed up by data from retail consultant Kantar, which said households made a ""record low"" number of trips to the supermarket in the 12 weeks to 19 April. However, average basket sizes had ""hit their highest levels ever"", it added. ""Grocery sales were Â£524m higher in the past four weeks than they were in April 2019, as British consumers adapted to life under lockdown,"" Kantar said. Online sales now account for 10.2% of the grocery market. ""On average, households shopped only 14 times for groceries over the past month, a record low and down from 17 in more normal times,"" Kantar said. ""A drop in frequency was matched by a corresponding uplift in the amount spent on each trip to Â£26.02 - easily the highest figure ever recorded by Kantar and Â£7 greater than last year."" Tesco remains the UK's biggest supermarket, with a 26.8% share of the market, with shoppers spending 7.2% more than in the same period last year. Other supermarkets saw even bigger rises in spending, with the Co-op up 20% and online-only Ocado rising 19.4%. In his first broadcast interview since the outbreak of coronavirus, Mr Lewis spoke about how Britain's biggest retailer had adapted and how shopping habits have changed during lockdown. ""People are shopping once a week, a little like they did 10 or 15 years ago, rather than two, three or four times a week that was happening before the crisis."" He added that during the surge in panic buying - when customers stripped supermarket shelves of goods like liquid soap, toilet roll and pasta - Tesco ""had seen seven weeks of sales going in one or two days"". ""The food supply chain is now back in good shape,"" he believes.  Flour, though, is still in short supply. Tesco is asking those who can come into store to do so Mr Lewis described the last six weeks as ""incredible"" adding that ""just about everything in the business had changed"". For instance, Tesco has taken on 45, 000 temporary workers to help cover for the 51,000 staff who were absent because of Covid-19 and cope with the increase in online deliveries. Mr Lewis said the company, the UK's biggest private sector employer with more than 300,000 workers, is now in the process of welcoming back staff who have been away while those temporary hires leave. ""We still have probably 35,000 to 40,000 double cover at the moment,"" he said. ""I think what was really quite humbling was the willingness of people to come and work in a supermarket and help us feed the nation. We've had some very interesting new colleagues - from BA pilots, West End theatre, to racing drivers... and we've trained them all very quickly"". The priority is to keep his staff and shoppers safe. ""I've been really quite amazed how well 99% of our customers have adapted to the changes in stores, "" he said. ""But we have to recognise that until the advice of the government changes, then we need to maintain social distance. So, we will, for the foreseeable future have to keep those measures in place."" The challenge will be keeping the discipline in smaller stores, especially in city centres, when people return to work. Mr Lewis was asked about the impact of coronavirus on retail and High Streets more broadly. He said a lot depended on how customers behave once the crisis is over but he hoped it would encourage the country to think about its future food strategy. ""I think the food chain has done really very well. Two weeks after such a big demand spike everything did recover, so there is resilience. ""I think what this crisis has shown is the importance of food retail. I think in the past, perhaps, a little bit we may have taken that for granted. So I hope that as a nation, we'll think carefully about food, food strategy and distribution.""

"HSBC has paused plans to cut 35,000 jobs, saying it does not want to leave staff unable to find work elsewhere during the coronavirus outbreak. The bank announced the cuts in February as part of a massive cost-cutting programme. But boss Noel Quinn said the ""the vast majority"" of redundancies would now be put on hold due to the exceptional circumstances. It came as HSBC reported a 50% fall in profits linked to the pandemic. Pre-tax earnings for the first three months came in at $3.2bn (Â£2.6bn), down from $6.2bn  a year ago. Coronavirus: Banksâ top brass forgo bonuses Banks bow to pressure to axe investor payouts HSBC signals mass job cuts as profits plunge The bank forecast bad loans would rise to $3bn due to customers not being able to repay them during the crisis. It also said earnings were likely to remain under pressure. ""The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our customers has been the main driver of the change in our financial performance,"" Mr Quinn said. Earlier this year, HSBC said it planned to scale back its headcount from 235,000 to about 200,000 over the next three years. The move is part of a restructuring programme which aimed to achieve $4.5bn (Â£3.6bn) of cost cuts by 2022. Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, told the BBC's Today programme the plan to delay job cuts would provoke mixed feelings. ""This is probably the best bit of news in the whole results for employees,"" he said. ""But while it's good news for employees it isn't necessarily good news for shareholders and a return to higher profitability."" Analysis, Dharshini David, global trade correspondent HSBC has suffered a dramatic halving of profits with provisions for bad loans up  five-fold to $3.2bn (Â£2.4bn). Yet the bosses of HSBC, its shareholders and employees may have uttered a sigh of relief: relief that the damage wasn't greater, given HSBC's exposure to some of the worst affected markets  - and relief that plans to cut up to one in eight jobs have been paused. But that relief may be fleeting. The bank's bosses have warned that provision for  bad loans could hit $11bn  this year, resulting in ""materially lower profits"" . They, like  governments worldwide are bracing for a severe recession, especially in Europe and the US. And while HSBC sees signs of recovery in China as factories fire back up, it acknowledges that will be hit by weaker demand from the West. That makes HSBC's massive restructuring plan, which relies on pivoting towards Asia, even more arduous. As the tough times hit, it's curbing costs - cutting the size of the bonus pool and keeping the 2020 dividend under review. But when the job cuts do resume, they may be more severe than initially envisaged. Separately, in a note to employees earlier this month, HSBC's chief executive Noel Quinn said he would donate a quarter of his base salary, about Â£160,000, for the next six months to charity. He will also not take his annual cash bonus, which would have been up to Â£1.2m. Chief financial officer Ewen Stevenson said he would take similar action,  donating Â£93,000 and forgoing Â£706,000, while chairman Mark Tucker will donate his entire 2020 fee to charity, about Â£1.5m. It came as senior executives and board members at other major UK banks, including RBS and Lloyds, agreed to give up their bonuses for this year. The announcements were in response to calls from the Bank of England to restrict bonuses during the pandemic.

"Tens of thousands of people across the UK have now died with coronavirus, including more than 100 NHS staff and other healthcare workers. The BBC has been tracking their deaths during the pandemic. Among them are a pregnant nurse who died before she could meet her daughter; a father-of-seven whose family say he was let down over a lack of personal protective equipment; and a grandmother who colleagues say was one the unsung heroes of the NHS. Many of them came to the UK from other countries to work for the NHS. Most were working on the frontline and caring for patients, while some were retired but continued to work. Here are 100 of their stories. Renowned surgeon Dr El Tayar worked in the NHS for 11 years before moving back to his native Sudan to help establish a transplant programme. He returned to the UK in 2015, working as a locum surgeon before his death. He gave the ""precious gift of life to so many people around the world"", fellow surgeon Abbas Ghazanfar wrote in a tribute. Dr Zaidi was a managing partner of a GP practice with his wife Dr Talat Zaidi. Their four children all work in the medical profession. His daughter, Dr Sarah Zaidi, said his death was ""reflective of his sacrifice"" and he had a ""vocational attitude to service"". A care co-ordinator in Hillingdon, north-west London, Ms Perugia was a ""lovely woman, who never said no to any requests"", colleagues said. Her mother, sister, brother and fiance all work for the same NHS trust she represented. Ms Sharma, who worked as a pharmacist at Eastbourne District General Hospital, was the ""superstar of the family"", her brother said. ""Her irresistible laugh, sense of humour and good nature would light up our world and fill it with colours. For this I am eternally grateful that Pooja was my sister. ""For me, Pooja would always be the little protector or shield for when I had done something mischievous."" An ear, nose and throat consultant at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, Mr El-Hawrani's family said he was ""a loving and much-loved husband, son, father, brother, and friend"".

"A third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes, figures show. Office for National Statistics data showed there were 2,000 coronavirus care home deaths in the week ending 17 April, double the previous week. It brings the total number of deaths in care homes linked to the virus since the start of the pandemic to 3,096. Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidtesting will be expandedto all care home residents and staff in England. This includes those who do not have symptoms, Mr Hancock told Tuesday's coronavirus briefing. ""Building on successful pilots, we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England, and to patients and staff in the NHS,"" Mr Hancock said. All those over 65 and people who must leave home for work will also be able to get a test if they are displaying symptoms. The health secretary also announced that the government would begin including the number of deaths in care homes and the community in its daily figures from Wednesday, in an effort to ""bring as much transparency as possible"" to the data. Until now, the figures have only included hospital deaths. Coronavirus deaths in hospitals across the UK have reached 21,678 - a rise of 586 from the day before - having peaked on 8 April. However, projections for care home deaths up to 24 April suggest the numbers have continued to rise. Another 630 deaths in care homes in Northern Ireland and Scotland have been linked with coronavirus up until mid-April. Nearly half of coronavirus deaths in those countries are now in care homes. Mike Padgham, of the Independent Care Group, which represents care homes, said they were now the ""true front line"" in the fight against coronavirus. He said: ""It is taking a terrible toll. These are our loved ones - mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and friends who have been taken from us early."" Asked at the coronavirus briefing whether care homes were now the government's priority in dealing with the disease, Mr Hancock said: ""Care homes have been a top priority right from the start. ""We've strengthened the rules around what happens in care homes and tightened infection control, also making testing available throughout the care sector."" Prof John Newton, co-ordinator of the national testing effort, addressing the spread of the virus in care homes, said: ""We've done some intensive studies of infection in care homes. ""The presence of symptoms was not really a good marker in the care home setting, both among residents and staff, for the presence of the virus. ""There were significant numbers who were asymptomatic who had the virus and so we have massively increased the amount of testing available."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said care homes had been a ""top priority right from the start"" A key criticism of the government's approach has been the lack of protective equipment for staff and testing for staff and residents. It was only in the middle of April that the government said all residents showing symptoms could be tested, while the Army is now helping to distribute protective kit. But Downing Street insisted it had acted to prevent the spread of coronavirus within care homes in the early stages of the pandemic, including guidance issued banning visitors. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We want to do all we can to support those living and working in care homes at what we accept is an enormously difficult time."" It came as: British Airways said it was set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforcedue to a collapse in business because of the pandemic The first version of a coronavirus contact-tracing app that might help the UK emerge from lockdowncould be ready in a fortnight's time, an NHS chief has said The son of an NHS doctor who died with the viruscalled on Health Secretary Matt Hancock to apologisefor mistakes in the government's response to the outbreak People across the UK, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson,held a minute's silence to remember health and care workerswho have died with coronavirus Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said face coveringswould be recommended for the public in enclosed spaces such as supermarkets Two brothers with coronavirus have died within hours of one another Black, Asian and minority ethnic staff who may need face masks or tests for Covid-19are being prioritised by an NHS trust Care home staff have been praised for isolating with residents for over a month to protect them from coronavirus All patients over 70 in Scotland who are admitted to hospital for any reasonwill now be tested for Covid-19, Ms Sturgeon has announced This video can not be played UK holds a minutes silence for coronavirus key worker deaths A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The daily updates provided by the government do not include care home deaths. TheONS has been able to track these by looking at deaths certificates,external- but that means the data lags behind the hospital deaths provided by the government. These figures are released weekly and include people who have died who are suspected to have had the virus, not just those who have tested positive. They also compare the overall number of people who have died with the average number of deaths at that time of year. Up until 10 April just over 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths had been recorded in care homes so far. A week later this had increased by another 2,000 to hit 3,096 in England and Wales. Data provided by the Care Quality Commission, which receives reports from care homes in England, suggest the following week, up until last Friday, saw an even bigger rise. Similar trends are being seen in Northern Ireland and Scotland. But even these figures may be an underestimate. The overall number of people dying in care homes is now three times higher than it was before the pandemic started. Fewer than half of these extra deaths are being attributed to coronavirus. Labour's shadow social care minister, Liz Kendall, said it was clear that the virus was having a ""devastating impact"" on care homes. ""Urgent action is needed to get a grip of this problem."" Official figures show the total number of people dying in the UK from all causes in hospitals and the community is double what we would expect for this time of year. Government advisers say this is important to track as it reveals the indirect impact of the pandemic, from factors such as people missing out on care and dying from other conditions, as well as coronavirus deaths. In the week to 17 April the total number of deaths in England and Wales topped 22,000 - the highest since records began in 1993. Once you include Northern Ireland and Scotland the figures are nearly 25,000. But BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe said even this does not provide the full picture. He said: ""Those weekly figures do not tell us how many years of life have been lost - some people who die during the epidemic would have lived for many years, and some might have died within the next few months. ""To understand that picture, we'll have to wait to see what happens to all deaths in 2020, but that analysis is some time away."" How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

"A third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes, figures show. Office for National Statistics data showed there were 2,000 coronavirus care home deaths in the week ending 17 April, double the previous week. It brings the total number of deaths in care homes linked to the virus since the start of the pandemic to 3,096. Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidtesting will be expandedto all care home residents and staff in England. This includes those who do not have symptoms, Mr Hancock told Tuesday's coronavirus briefing. ""Building on successful pilots, we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England, and to patients and staff in the NHS,"" Mr Hancock said. All those over 65 and people who must leave home for work will also be able to get a test if they are displaying symptoms. The health secretary also announced that the government would begin including the number of deaths in care homes and the community in its daily figures from Wednesday, in an effort to ""bring as much transparency as possible"" to the data. Until now, the figures have only included hospital deaths. Coronavirus deaths in hospitals across the UK have reached 21,678 - a rise of 586 from the day before - having peaked on 8 April. However, projections for care home deaths up to 24 April suggest the numbers have continued to rise. Another 630 deaths in care homes in Northern Ireland and Scotland have been linked with coronavirus up until mid-April. Nearly half of coronavirus deaths in those countries are now in care homes. Mike Padgham, of the Independent Care Group, which represents care homes, said they were now the ""true front line"" in the fight against coronavirus. He said: ""It is taking a terrible toll. These are our loved ones - mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and friends who have been taken from us early."" Asked at the coronavirus briefing whether care homes were now the government's priority in dealing with the disease, Mr Hancock said: ""Care homes have been a top priority right from the start. ""We've strengthened the rules around what happens in care homes and tightened infection control, also making testing available throughout the care sector."" Prof John Newton, co-ordinator of the national testing effort, addressing the spread of the virus in care homes, said: ""We've done some intensive studies of infection in care homes. ""The presence of symptoms was not really a good marker in the care home setting, both among residents and staff, for the presence of the virus. ""There were significant numbers who were asymptomatic who had the virus and so we have massively increased the amount of testing available."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said care homes had been a ""top priority right from the start"" A key criticism of the government's approach has been the lack of protective equipment for staff and testing for staff and residents. It was only in the middle of April that the government said all residents showing symptoms could be tested, while the Army is now helping to distribute protective kit. But Downing Street insisted it had acted to prevent the spread of coronavirus within care homes in the early stages of the pandemic, including guidance issued banning visitors. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We want to do all we can to support those living and working in care homes at what we accept is an enormously difficult time."" It came as: British Airways said it was set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforcedue to a collapse in business because of the pandemic The first version of a coronavirus contact-tracing app that might help the UK emerge from lockdowncould be ready in a fortnight's time, an NHS chief has said The son of an NHS doctor who died with the viruscalled on Health Secretary Matt Hancock to apologisefor mistakes in the government's response to the outbreak People across the UK, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson,held a minute's silence to remember health and care workerswho have died with coronavirus Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said face coveringswould be recommended for the public in enclosed spaces such as supermarkets Two brothers with coronavirus have died within hours of one another Black, Asian and minority ethnic staff who may need face masks or tests for Covid-19are being prioritised by an NHS trust Care home staff have been praised for isolating with residents for over a month to protect them from coronavirus All patients over 70 in Scotland who are admitted to hospital for any reasonwill now be tested for Covid-19, Ms Sturgeon has announced This video can not be played UK holds a minutes silence for coronavirus key worker deaths A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The daily updates provided by the government do not include care home deaths. TheONS has been able to track these by looking at deaths certificates,external- but that means the data lags behind the hospital deaths provided by the government. These figures are released weekly and include people who have died who are suspected to have had the virus, not just those who have tested positive. They also compare the overall number of people who have died with the average number of deaths at that time of year. Up until 10 April just over 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths had been recorded in care homes so far. A week later this had increased by another 2,000 to hit 3,096 in England and Wales. Data provided by the Care Quality Commission, which receives reports from care homes in England, suggest the following week, up until last Friday, saw an even bigger rise. Similar trends are being seen in Northern Ireland and Scotland. But even these figures may be an underestimate. The overall number of people dying in care homes is now three times higher than it was before the pandemic started. Fewer than half of these extra deaths are being attributed to coronavirus. Labour's shadow social care minister, Liz Kendall, said it was clear that the virus was having a ""devastating impact"" on care homes. ""Urgent action is needed to get a grip of this problem."" Official figures show the total number of people dying in the UK from all causes in hospitals and the community is double what we would expect for this time of year. Government advisers say this is important to track as it reveals the indirect impact of the pandemic, from factors such as people missing out on care and dying from other conditions, as well as coronavirus deaths. In the week to 17 April the total number of deaths in England and Wales topped 22,000 - the highest since records began in 1993. Once you include Northern Ireland and Scotland the figures are nearly 25,000. But BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe said even this does not provide the full picture. He said: ""Those weekly figures do not tell us how many years of life have been lost - some people who die during the epidemic would have lived for many years, and some might have died within the next few months. ""To understand that picture, we'll have to wait to see what happens to all deaths in 2020, but that analysis is some time away."" How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

"This video can not be played UK holds a minutes silence for coronavirus key worker deaths A minute's silence has been held across the UK to commemorate the key workers who have died with coronavirus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whoreturned to work on Monday,joined the tribute at 11:00 BST. More than 100 NHS and care staff have died with the virus, as have many transport and other key workers. Meanwhile, the son of a doctor who died hascalled on the governmentto issue a public apology for issues with personal protective equipment (PPE).

Intisar's father, Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, 53,who died earlier this month, had warned Prime Minister Boris Johnson about a lack of PPE five days before being hospitalised. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was also asked by Mr Chowdhury to apologise on LBC, and said ""listening to the voices on the front line is a very, very important part of how we improve"".

More than 22,000 people died - the highest since records began in 1993. Across the whole of the UK there were 24,686 deaths registered in the week after Easter - more than twice as many as normal. The rise is partly driven by an increasing number of deaths in care homes, which accounted for a third of all deaths. The figures show deaths in care homes were continuing to rise, compared with the number of deaths in hospitals which appears to have peaked and is coming down.

"Intisar Chowdhury said he wanted Matt Hancock to acknowledge mistakes have been made The son of an NHS doctor who died with coronavirus has called on Health Secretary Matt Hancock to say sorry for mistakes in the government's response. Intisar Chowdhury, 18, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a public apology would help improve public trust. Intisar's father Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, 53,warned about a lack of protectionbefore he died. Mr Hancock later told LBC that listening to front-line staff would help the government improve. He added that he did not want to ""play down"" the efforts of those working to get personal protective equipment (PPE) to the front line. UK holds minute's silence for fallen key workers Rising virus care home toll leads to record deaths Mr Hancock said: ""A huge amount of people are doing everything they can and have done since the start of this crisis. I don't want to play down the enormous efforts of many thousands of people who are working every hour that there is to try to solve the problem."" Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury died with coronavirus earlier this month Speaking directly to the health secretary onan LBC phone-in,externalon Tuesday, Intisar said: ""The public is not expecting the government to handle this perfectly. We just want you to openly acknowledge there have been mistakes in handling this virus. ""Openly acknowledging a mistake is not an admission of guilt, it is genuinely just making you seem more human. So can you please do that for me at the press conference today - make the public apology?"" Mr Hancock responded: ""It is very important that we are constantly learning about how to do things better and I think listening to the voices on the front line will be a very important part of how we improve."" This video can not be played Intisar Chowdhury spoke to Health Secretary Matt Hancock about his father's concerns Intisar had earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier that ministers should consider giving families a private apology at some point in the future, but that a public apology now would help improve public trust. ""I definitely do want a public apology because I feel like the government's response in not only handling the PPE crisis but the whole virus in itself wasn't the best,"" he said. ""I think we can forgive that as a country because it is such an unprecedented thing it is hard to know what to do. ""But they need to hold themselves accountable for that, learn from that and move on so that we can trust them more."" Dr Chowdhury, a consultant urologist, died at Queen's Hospital in Romford, east London, earlier this month. At least 82 NHS staff and 16 care workers who were confirmed to have died in hospital in England, according to official figures. A separate BBC News analysis of published figures found that at least 114 health workers have died with the virus across the UK. It is not known where they contracted Covid-19. Mr Chowdhury's appeal comes after a BBC Panorama investigationfound the government failed to buy crucial PPE to cope with a pandemic. There were no gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in the government's pandemic stockpile when Covid-19 reached the UK, the programme found. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"A third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes, figures show. Office for National Statistics data showed there were 2,000 coronavirus care home deaths in the week ending 17 April, double the previous week. It brings the total number of deaths in care homes linked to the virus since the start of the pandemic to 3,096. Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidtesting will be expandedto all care home residents and staff in England. This includes those who do not have symptoms, Mr Hancock told Tuesday's coronavirus briefing. ""Building on successful pilots, we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England, and to patients and staff in the NHS,"" Mr Hancock said. All those over 65 and people who must leave home for work will also be able to get a test if they are displaying symptoms. The health secretary also announced that the government would begin including the number of deaths in care homes and the community in its daily figures from Wednesday, in an effort to ""bring as much transparency as possible"" to the data. Until now, the figures have only included hospital deaths. Coronavirus deaths in hospitals across the UK have reached 21,678 - a rise of 586 from the day before - having peaked on 8 April. However, projections for care home deaths up to 24 April suggest the numbers have continued to rise. Another 630 deaths in care homes in Northern Ireland and Scotland have been linked with coronavirus up until mid-April. Nearly half of coronavirus deaths in those countries are now in care homes. Mike Padgham, of the Independent Care Group, which represents care homes, said they were now the ""true front line"" in the fight against coronavirus. He said: ""It is taking a terrible toll. These are our loved ones - mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and friends who have been taken from us early."" Asked at the coronavirus briefing whether care homes were now the government's priority in dealing with the disease, Mr Hancock said: ""Care homes have been a top priority right from the start. ""We've strengthened the rules around what happens in care homes and tightened infection control, also making testing available throughout the care sector."" Prof John Newton, co-ordinator of the national testing effort, addressing the spread of the virus in care homes, said: ""We've done some intensive studies of infection in care homes. ""The presence of symptoms was not really a good marker in the care home setting, both among residents and staff, for the presence of the virus. ""There were significant numbers who were asymptomatic who had the virus and so we have massively increased the amount of testing available."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said care homes had been a ""top priority right from the start"" A key criticism of the government's approach has been the lack of protective equipment for staff and testing for staff and residents. It was only in the middle of April that the government said all residents showing symptoms could be tested, while the Army is now helping to distribute protective kit. But Downing Street insisted it had acted to prevent the spread of coronavirus within care homes in the early stages of the pandemic, including guidance issued banning visitors.

"The UK's oil and gas industry is warning that 30,000 jobs could be lost as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the low oil price. A global oversupply of oil has pushed prices to their lowest level in 20 years. In a survey of its members, Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said many firms would struggle to survive. It has called for the transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions to be at the heart of its recovery plan. At its peak, a barrel of Brent Crude oil sold for about $120. But in recent weeks, that has fallen as low as $16 with no real sign of it recovering. The industry fears the problems will last much longer than the Covid-19 pandemic, and that has meant many workers are being laid off rather than furloughed. Oil price falls to 18-year low as turmoil persists Record deal to cut oil output ends price war The predicted job losses represent about one in five of the 151,000 people employed directly or indirectly by the sector. Some job losses have already been announced with ""many more"" expected to be confirmed in the coming months. Many North Sea workers are being laid off rather than furloughed OGUK chief executive Deirdre Michie said: ""With historic low oil and gas prices coming so soon after one of the most severe downturns our sector has experienced, these findings confirm an especially bleak outlook for the UK's oil and industry. ""If the UK is to maintain its supply of domestic energy, protect jobs and build the critical infrastructure it needs to transition to a net-zero future, ours is an industry worth fighting for."" The industry body has outlined a three-stage plan which it hopes will minimise the longer-term impact. It calls for the addressing of the industry's immediate needs, followed by its industrial recovery and then an accelerated transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. By Dharshini David, Global trade correspondent A slump in oil prices is normally a cause for celebration in gas-guzzling nations. The average American burns through 10 litres of oil or oil products per day in normal times. But for oil producing countries - the ""global petropolis"" - such a drop in the cost of crude can spell disaster, and hardship for millions. It's easy to see why oil is referred to as black gold. When the price was riding high, oil revenues filled the coffers of companies and governments in the countries that produce it. That kept people fed and public services flourishing. But now, having oil can be a curse rather than a blessing. Read more here. But green groups say any government support for oil and gas has to come with strings attached. Ryan Morrison, from Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: ""Any measures of support that seek to return the industry back to 'business as usual' from before coronavirus will be locking in another crisis further down the line without regard for the workers and communities that will face that the hardest. ""We've already seen the industry accused of treating its workforce like a tap that can be turned on and off and a continuation of this approach where workers are hit first by any potential trouble to the industry cannot continue."" About 30% of companies said they had been successful in securing funding as part of the government's Covid-19 packages. A further 40% said they were still exploring the options. Capital expenditure is expected to fall to about Â£3.5bn - which would be one of the lowest figures since the discovery of oil in the North Sea. Drilling activity is expected to be down 50% on 2019, which pushes it to record low levels. Who wins and who loses when oil prices fall?

"The number of prisoners believed to have been infected with coronavirus may be up to six times as many as the published figure, it has emerged. Public Health England (PHE) says it has found 1,783 ""possible/probable"" cases - on top of 304 confirmed infections across jails in England and Wales. PHE's report,externalsays there have been no ""explosive outbreaks"" in prisons, but ""significant threat levels"" remain. Measures to quarantine new and at-risk inmates are needed for a year, it adds. The report, published by the Ministry of Justice, says access to testing for prisoners has been ""limited and variable"". ""Therefore, the number of laboratory confirmed cases reported does not represent the true burden of infection in the prison system,"" it said. ""During outbreaks, where a number of positive laboratory samples have been received (usually around five or more) on prisoners who have been swabbed, then subsequent cases who meet the clinical case definition are included as 'possible/probable cases'."" Of the 1,783 ""possible/probable"" cases by the end of last week: 398 were in Welsh prisons 298 in the West Midlands 264 in south-east England Wales also had more confirmed cases (77) than anywhere else. PHE said officials had responded to outbreaks in 75 different ""custodial institutions"", with 35 inmates treated in hospital and 15 deaths. But the report says the frequency of outbreaks and the number of cases is reducing, indicating that the initial wave of infections is being ""contained effectively"" - which it says is a ""cause for cautious optimism"". Previous modelling suggested there could be between 1,800 and 2,300 deaths, depending on reductions in the prisoner population. Prisoners' families fear 'death sentences' over virus Virus response scheme sees only 33 prisoners released The report goes on to warn, however, that restrictions will be needed until the ""end of the financial year"", that is April 2021. ""In the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment, risks of large outbreaks in the prison estate will remain. ""These risks may be escalated later in the year relating to relaxation of wider community restrictions, some return of normal police and court activities."" With measures in place, the report estimates there will be 2,800 infections and 100 deaths. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? CORONAVIRUS IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?The rules on sick pay, wages and time off One of the measures involves restricting movements of prisoners between jails - known as ""compartmentalisation"" - in order to stop the ""seeding"" of infections. But the report notes that it has been achieved in only a limited way. It said: ""The most effective form of compartmentalisation is single-cell accommodation but it was recognised that this would require significant reductions in prisoner population to achieve across the prison estate (about 15,000 people was the estimate at the time the original advice was provided)."" Earlier, the Commons heard thatless than 1% of prisoners eligible for the government's emergency release programme had been freed.

The Justice Secretary, Robert Buckland, told MPs that 33 inmates had been let out, including a number of pregnant prisoners and mothers with babies.

"This video can not be played UK holds a minutes silence for coronavirus key worker deaths A minute's silence has been held across the UK to commemorate the key workers who have died with coronavirus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whoreturned to work on Monday,joined the tribute at 11:00 BST. More than 100 NHS and care staff have died with the virus, as have many transport and other key workers. Meanwhile, the son of a doctor who died hascalled on the governmentto issue a public apology for issues with personal protective equipment (PPE). Intisar Chowdhury, 18, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted ministers ""to accept their mistakes and let their mistakes become improvement rather than just ignore them and completely move on"". Intisar's father, Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, 53,who died earlier this month, had warned Prime Minister Boris Johnson about a lack of PPE five days before being hospitalised. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was also asked by Mr Chowdhury to apologise on LBC, and said ""listening to the voices on the front line is a very, very important part of how we improve"". Staff observe the minute's silence outside Salford Royal Hospital Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined the silence with Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill and Chancellor Rishi Sunak At 11:00, people across the country paused to join the minute's silence. Dame Donna Kinnair, head of the Royal College of Nursing, said she was ""heartened to hear how many people took part"". In Northern Ireland, assembly membershalted business to observe the silence, in Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford and other Welsh ministers were among thosepaying respects in Wales, and in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeonled the tribute in Edinburgh. The latest daily figures on Monday show a further 360 people died with the virus in UK hospitals, taking the total number of deaths to 21,092. This number includes 82 NHS staff and 16 care workers who were confirmed to have died in hospital in England. A separate BBC News analysis of published figures found thatat least 114 health workershave died with the virus across the UK. It is not known where they contracted Covid-19. Transport for London said the underground and bus network would be brought to a halt for the silence Staff outside Salford Royal Hospital reacted to the moving silence A veteran joins the silence outside Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS staff at the Mater Infirmorum Hospital in Belfast stood 2m apart to follow distancing rules Latest statisticsreleased on Tuesday from the Office for National Statistics- which count all deaths, not just those in hospitals - found the number of people who died in England and Wales hit a record high in the week ending 17 April. More than 22,000 people died - the highest since records began in 1993. Across the whole of the UK there were 24,686 deaths registered in the week after Easter - more than twice as many as normal. The rise is partly driven by an increasing number of deaths in care homes, which accounted for a third of all deaths. The figures show deaths in care homes were continuing to rise, compared with the number of deaths in hospitals which appears to have peaked and is coming down. BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe said the data ""showed the epidemic certainly hasn't reached its peak in care homes"".

Government minister Victoria Atkins told BBC Breakfast she was ""very, very sorry to hear"" of the Panorama report. ""Like every other country in the world, [the virus] is unprecedented and the requirements for PPE have risen exponentially and we're doing our absolute best to address those needs and will continue to do so,"" she said. She added that, since the outbreak began, ""a billion pieces of PPE"" have been distributed across the UK. The Archbishop of York John Sentanu was among those inviting people to take part in the minute's silence - which coincided with International Workers Memorial Day. ""Workers should not be sent into danger without the correct PPE,"" he said and called for those on the front line to be ""given all the safety equipment they need"". NHS England medical director Stephen Powis said the silence ensured the health workers' ""contribution is remembered and appreciated"".

Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer - who also joined the silence - said too many front-line workers had lost their lives, adding: ""We owe it to them to make sure they've got the right equipment, in the right place, at the right time."" On Monday, the government announced that families of front-line NHS and social care staff who died with the virus in England wouldreceive a Â£60,000 compensation payment.

"The government must consider the impact of the lockdown on domestic abuse and mental health as it plans its exit strategy, Theresa May has said. The former prime minister said measures to tackle coronavirus must not do ""more damage than the disease itself"". She spoke as MPs debated the Domestic Abuse Bill, amid evidence of rising violence during the lockdown. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said help would be available for all such victims during the outbreak. There has beena ""surge"" in violence in the weeks since the lockdownwas introduced, a report by MPs said, with a rise in killings and the number of calls to the National Domestic Abuse helpline run by Refuge up 49% after three weeks. Addressing MPs via video link, Mrs May said the government must think about the ""impact of lockdown on our overall health and wellbeing"". She said police and local authorities should consider random visits to homes of known domestic abuse perpetrators during lockdown, or addresses where there had been reports of violence. But added that would have to be done carefully, so as not to make the situation worse. 'I'm in coronavirus lockdown with my abuser' Mrs May's government introduced the Domestic Abuse Bill last July, but it has been postponed since before the general election. It brings in new protections for victims - including Domestic Abuse Protection Orders and Protection Notices, which can be used to impose long-term bans on perpetrators making contact with the victim. It applies to England and Wales and proposes the first government definition of domestic abuse, including financial abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical behaviour. The Northern Ireland Assemblyalso debated legislationto strengthen domestic abuse laws on Tuesday. Mr Buckland told MPs the Domestic Violence Bill aimed to raise awareness of the crime, to protect and support victims and their children, to ""transform"" the response in the justice system and to ""improve performance across all national and local agencies"". The government has always stressed that its Domestic Abuse Bill is proof of its determination to tackle a problem that has been described as an epidemic in the UK. The bill - drafted before the lockdown - creates a statutory definition of domestic abuse, emphasising it's not just physical: it can also involve coercive or controlling behaviour and financial constraints. These provisions go to the heart of what could now be happening in homes up and down the country. Domestic abuse charities have seen a huge increase in calls and online requests for help during the lockdown. Victims are suffering both physically and emotionally in homes that are not places of safety. Many of the traditional escape routes have been cut off. A pandemic on top of an epidemic, as one victim described it. Labour has proposed amendments that would see 10% of theÂ£750 million charity support package announced this monthring-fenced in a fast-track fund for domestic abuse charities. MPs also said the bill must do more to protect victims regardless of their immigration status, and to ensure that there is adequate accommodation across the board for victims who flee their homes. As a short-term measure during the lockdown, former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called on the government to house them in vacant hotel rooms until decent alternatives could be found. ""We know that some hotel chains have offered to help with providing accommodation. These hotels should be taken up on that offer,"" she said. Amendments that MPs proposed to table included putting a stop to a defence of ""rough sex gone wrong"" in court. Conservative MP Mark Garnier's constituent Natalie Connolly died in 2016 after sustaining more than 40 separate injuries - but her boyfriend was cleared of murder in 2018 on the basis of such a defence. ""How can it possibly be the case that somebody dies through sex?"" Mr Garnier asked the Commons. ""It doesn't make any sense, this is wrong."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Charities, too, have called for the Domestic Abuse Bill to offer more support for victims. Its measures include requiring councils in England to provide support for victims and their children in refuges and other safe accommodation. However, Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan said this must be broadened out. ""With the majority of victims remaining in the family home, especially in BAME communities, it's vital that Parliament extends this duty to cover all victims and children - no matter where they live,"" he said. There are also calls for a new offence of ""non-fatal strangulation"" to be included, and for authorities to start collecting data on domestic abuse among the over-74s. Earlier, the government announced it would spend Â£3.1 million on services supporting children who witness ""appalling abuse"" at home during the coronavirus lockdown. The funding will be given to councils, charities, and police and crime commissioners in England and Wales, and will go towards services such as counselling sessions and early intervention schemes, the Home Office said. But shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the amount ""falls woefully short"" of what is needed to ""support vital frontline services"". Earlier, safeguarding minister Victoria Atkins told the BBC ministers were working with refuge providers to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the availability of places. ""I would also like for us to be looking at perhaps kicking the perpetrator out, rather than the victim, so that she stays in her home safely... and the perpetrator has his behaviour addressed to stop this cycle of abuse,"" she said. The Domestic Abuse Bill would also focus on ""stopping the perpetrator's behaviour in the first place"", she said. This video can not be played ""You will not be breaking coronavirus regulations and you will not be breaking the law if you seek help outside."" Speaking in the Commons before the debate, Attorney General Suella Braverman stressed that victims will not be breaking the law if they need to seek help outside the home during lockdown. She told MPs: ""I want to take this opportunity to let victims out there, both men and women, know that they don't have to suffer in silence.""

"Ministers are facing competing demands from councils across England for a Â£1.6bn emergency coronavirus fund. County councils are seeking assurances that up to Â£1bn in added social care costs will be met to support nursing homes, recruit carers, source equipment and relieve pressure on the NHS. But district councils have warned they risk financial collapse if the new money is not allocated ""fairly"". The government said councils were getting ""significant support"". Earlier this month, Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick announced a second tranche of emergency funding for councils as part of a Â£3.2bn package to fund higher service costs caused by the pandemic. But the Local Government Association, which represents more than 300 councils of different sizes in England and Wales, said local authorities could require four times that in order to make it through. With the government yet to make clear how the money will be allocated, the BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said many councils were fearful that they could lose out, showing just how stretched services were. County councils and unitary authorities, which are legally responsible for providing care for the elderly in their areas, say they ought to be prioritised as they are facing an added Â£1.3bn financial burden, The County Councils Network, which represents 36 county councils and unitary authorities, has warned already stretched social care budgets could come under further strain if funding mechanisms are ""dramatically altered"". They say their members are liable for an estimated extra Â£322m to meet the escalating costs of care and nursing homes while Â£259m could be needed to meet growing demand for other services, vital to ensuring people could be treated in the community and not put added strain on NHS beds. It warned it might have to take ""unpalatable decisions"" and potentially reduce support for ""life-saving"" services, including providing testing in care homes, helping to ""shield"" the most vulnerable in their homes and meeting shortages of personal protective equipment locally. It also wants the government, separately, to underwrite the cost of potentially billions in lost revenues due to the anticipated steep fall in council tax receipts, income from business rates and other charges.

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area ""It is clear from the evidence provided to ministers that social care is adding the most strain to council budgets as we battle the spread of the disease locally,"" said Councillor David Williams, the body's chairman. He added: ""If the government changes the distribution of emergency funding it will disproportionately and unfairly impact those councils responsible for adult and children's social care."" Care England, the largest representative body for independent providers of adult social care, has warned of ""severe"" financial implications from the pandemic and said resources must quickly reach the frontline. But the 192 district councils in England, which provide services from bin collections to helping the homeless, say they are facing the toughest squeeze on their budgets of any local authorities due to the economic impact of the lockdown and their needs cannot be overlooked. They warned that income from car parking, leisure facilities, planning and licensing applications is ""plummeting"" while financial liabilities could dwarf their finances should council tax collection rates fall sharply. The District Councils Network has called for each district to receive minimum amount of temporary funding, supplemented with additional funding based on the number of residents and businesses in each area. ""We cannot run services on fresh air,"" said its chair John Fuller. ""Districts need to see a significant share of the additional Â£1.6bn to prevent them winding down services when people and businesses need them most. ""District councils are the ones who are delivering the final mile of public services and have stretched every sinew of resource to step up to the plate and respond to this pandemic."" The Department of Communities and Local Government said it would outline where the Â£1.6bn would be spent as soon as possible but insisted it was standing by councils at a highly challenging time for them. ""The secretary of state has announced a total of Â£3.2 billion of funding for councils to support their response to the pandemic,"" a spokesman said.

"The number of prisoners believed to have been infected with coronavirus may be up to six times as many as the published figure, it has emerged. Public Health England (PHE) says it has found 1,783 ""possible/probable"" cases - on top of 304 confirmed infections across jails in England and Wales. PHE's report,externalsays there have been no ""explosive outbreaks"" in prisons, but ""significant threat levels"" remain. Measures to quarantine new and at-risk inmates are needed for a year, it adds. The report, published by the Ministry of Justice, says access to testing for prisoners has been ""limited and variable"". ""Therefore, the number of laboratory confirmed cases reported does not represent the true burden of infection in the prison system,"" it said. ""During outbreaks, where a number of positive laboratory samples have been received (usually around five or more) on prisoners who have been swabbed, then subsequent cases who meet the clinical case definition are included as 'possible/probable cases'."" Of the 1,783 ""possible/probable"" cases by the end of last week: 398 were in Welsh prisons 298 in the West Midlands 264 in south-east England Wales also had more confirmed cases (77) than anywhere else. PHE said officials had responded to outbreaks in 75 different ""custodial institutions"", with 35 inmates treated in hospital and 15 deaths. But the report says the frequency of outbreaks and the number of cases is reducing, indicating that the initial wave of infections is being ""contained effectively"" - which it says is a ""cause for cautious optimism"". Previous modelling suggested there could be between 1,800 and 2,300 deaths, depending on reductions in the prisoner population. Prisoners' families fear 'death sentences' over virus Virus response scheme sees only 33 prisoners released The report goes on to warn, however, that restrictions will be needed until the ""end of the financial year"", that is April 2021. ""In the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment, risks of large outbreaks in the prison estate will remain. ""These risks may be escalated later in the year relating to relaxation of wider community restrictions, some return of normal police and court activities."" With measures in place, the report estimates there will be 2,800 infections and 100 deaths. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? CORONAVIRUS IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice?

But the report notes that it has been achieved in only a limited way. It said: ""The most effective form of compartmentalisation is single-cell accommodation but it was recognised that this would require significant reductions in prisoner population to achieve across the prison estate (about 15,000 people was the estimate at the time the original advice was provided).""

"The government failed to buy crucial protective equipment to cope with a pandemic, a BBC investigation has found. There were no gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in the government's pandemic stockpile when Covid-19 reached the UK. NHS staff say they are being put at risk because of the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). The government said it has taken the right steps and is doing everything it can to increase stocks. The investigation by BBC Panorama found that vital items were left out of the stockpile when it was set up in 2009 and that the government subsequently ignored a warning from its own advisers to buy missing equipment. Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags Are NHS staff getting enough protective gear? The expert committee that advises the government on pandemics, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), recommended the purchase of gowns last June. Gowns are currently one of the items in shortest supply in the UK and they are now difficult to source because of the global shortage of PPE. Doctors and nurses have complained that there are also shortages of the life-saving FFP3 respirator masks. Panorama has discovered that millions of FFP3 respirator masks are unaccounted for. There were 33 million on the original 2009 procurement list for the stockpile, but only 12 million have been handed out. The government refuses to explain where the other masks have gone. A government spokesperson said there was ""limited demand"" for the masks coming through the Supply Disruption Line, ""which is one reason why they haven't all been distributed"". They added that gowns were a recent recommendation from the advisory group and would be procured for the ""future stockpile build up alongside all other necessary equipment"". NHS staff have been washing and reusing PPE Panorama has spoken to a number of NHS insiders about PPE who wish to remain anonymous. ""There is a complete lack of transparency from the government. They are creating panic, as we don't know if they can supply us so we are scrambling to get it elsewhere,"" a head of procurement told the programme. The government also failed to stockpile visors, the swabs needed for testing and the body bags needed for the dead. Professor John Ashton, a public health expert and long-standing critic of the government, told the programme the lack of preparation was breathtaking. ""The consequence of not planning; not ordering kit; not having stockpiles is that we are sending into the front line doctors, nurses, other health workers and social care workers without the equipment to keep them safe,"" he said. A government spokesperson said the stockpile was designed for a flu pandemic and that Covid-19 is a different disease with a higher hospitalisation rate. They said swabs and body bags were not recommended by Nervtag historically, but eye protection was, so the stockpile contains safety glasses. Government minister Victoria Atkins told BBC Breakfast she was ""very, very sorry to hear"" of the Panorama report. ""Like every other country in the world, [the virus] is unprecedented and the requirements for PPE have risen exponentially and we are doing our absolute best to address those needs and will continue to do so throughout this crisis,"" she said. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Panorama also investigated changes to the government guidance on what PPE NHS staff should wear. In January this year, Covid-19 was officially designated a High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID). The decision was made in consultation with a group of British experts. A Health and Safety Executive evaluation of PPE published in 2019 had already recommended that all healthcare workers should wear a gown, FFP3 respirator mask and visor when dealing with HCIDs. Those recommendations were in line with existing UK guidance. An NHS worker is pictured wearing a plastic bag as a hair cover But on 13 March this year, the government downgraded its guidance on PPE and told NHS staff they were safe to wear less protective aprons and basic surgical masks in all but the most high risk circumstances. Panorama understands that on the same day, the government took steps to remove Covid-19 from the list of HCIDs. But the experts who had recommended the coronavirus be put on the list in the first place were not consulted. Instead, the government asked its Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP). Panorama has discovered that the ACDP was only asked to consider the matter on the morning of its 13 March meeting. It was added to the committee's agenda under ""any other business"". The committee backed the decision to remove Covid-19 from the HCID list, but sources on that committee have told Panorama that it had to be, in part, a pragmatic decision based on the availability of PPE. It was another six days before Public Health England announced that the coronavirus was no longer considered an HCID. A government spokesperson said Covid-19 was taken off the list because it has a low overall mortality rate and there is now greater clinical awareness and a specific laboratory test for the virus. They added the committee's advice that Covid-19 no longer be considered an HCID was based entirely on scientific considerations. ""The HCID classification is used for serious infections where there are limited numbers of cases requiring specialist input and facilities,"" the spokesperson said. ""This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice. ""The government has been working day and night to battle against coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed at all times to protect our NHS and save lives.""

"This video can not be played ""Looking forward to a drink at the end of the day was something that I was doing a lot more often"" People could develop long-term heavy drinking habits as a result of self-isolating at home, a charity fears. Over a quarter of adults in Wales who drink have increased their consumption since the coronavirus restrictions were brought in,according to research by Alcohol Change UK,external. Sales of alcohol jumped 31% in March, ahead of overall supermarket sales. The charity urged people to think about how much they were drinking during the lockdown. In March, pubs, restaurants, bars and clubs were closed as part of strict measures to curb the spread of coronavirus,and people have been unable to socialise with those outside their own homes. Research from the charity suggests many people are now drinking in their homes. But it said about a third of those who drink have cut down, or stopped drinking all together during lockdown. Meg Payne has never been a heavy or frequent drinker, but said she noticed she was drinking more regularly out of ""boredom"" during the restrictions. The 23-year-old, who lives with her parents in Cardiff,has been furloughed through the UK government job retention scheme. She said she found herself drinking on evenings she normally would not. To combat this, she developed a routine and said that exercise and online workouts helped. ""I did find that looking forward to a drink at the end of the day was something that I was doing a lot more often,"" she said. ""At the start of this quarantine and lockdown period, I was drinking more,"" she said. ""It probably got to two weeks in, when I sort of realised and took a look at it and I realised that wasn't something that I wanted to happen."" Andrew Misell, director for Wales at Alcohol Change UK, said there were concerns that more people may get into habits of heavy drinking which could last for the long term. The charity said the number of people visiting their website for help was up nearly 400% in the past month, compared to the same period last year. 'I walk around my block of flats to stay sane' Ways to stay social online while in self-isolation ""Even those of us who perhaps aren't in such immediate danger are feeling the strain. I think an awful lot of us realised how much we really liked getting out of the house,"" he said. Alcohol sales in UK retailers surged 31% in March, ahead of overall supermarket sales, which rose 10.3% in the same period, according to Office for National Statistics figures. Personal trainer Emily Tucker said exercise and learning new skills could stop people reaching for the bottle out of boredom Cardiff-based personal trainer Emily Tucker said a rise in online drinking challenges could lead to heavier and more regular drinking. She said a perception that people needed to be productive with their time during isolation could make people feel pressurised. The 28-year-old is offering live workouts on Instagram and said exercises and learning new skills could help stem boredom. ""If you feel [alcohol is] starting to become your go-to source of entertainment, I would definitely look into the online content that's available,"" she said.

Ullapool Sea Savers had received lottery funding for a beach party with seafood stalls and music before the Covid-19 pandemic. The charity adapted their plans and, while observing social distancing and other lockdown restrictions, delivered bags of prawns to households in Ullapool. The bags made from recycled plastic were donated by a local supermarket. The shellfish were bought from fishermen whose markets in France and Spain have collapsed. Allow Twitter content?

Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Professor Hugh Pennington says we could be ""past halfway for bad outcomes"", referring to new infections and deaths, but says maintaining lockdown restrictions successfully and combating the virus in care homes will be major factors. ""I hope we are at a point where we would start to see the
number of cases and deaths declining,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""Maybe we are at more than the halfway
point for bad outcomes, maybe a good bit further. ""Itâs really difficult to know
if we can sustain the controls we have at the moment. If we are lucky, it will
fall quite fast but that depends on social distancing and making sure people
donât get tired with it. ""We also need to get a grip on infections in care homes, we need to put an enormous effort in there."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Professor Hugh Pennington was talking to Holyroodâs Health Committee this morning, stressing the importance of mass testing in the fight against Covid-19. On BBC Radio Scotlandâs Drivetime, the microbiologist said he was âa bit scepticalâ on the new guidance on the use of face coverings in situations where it is difficult to observe social distancing. He says itâs not going to protect the wearer and it would only have a very limited role in preventing somebody who is infected from passing on the virus. Ben PhilipBBC Scotland Golf has been a casualty of the coronavirus pandemic with courses up and down the country closed and tournaments cancelled. In the âhome of golfâ - St Andrews - many are reliant on the golf tourists who generate millions for the Scottish economy every year. Caddie Master Fraser Riddle has set up an online fundraising page to try to compensate colleagues whose opportunity to earn money ""is severely affected"" due to the restrictions currently on the course and on international travel. You can see a full report on this onReporting Scotland on BBC One at 1830. Here are the main points from today's Scottish government briefing: Ms Sturgeon stressed she was talking about cloth face coverings, not medical-grade face masks Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Chief Nursing Officer Fiona McQueen is on BBC Radio Scotland repeating today's advice on the use of facial coverings in shops or on public transport. ""This does not replace social distancing or only going out when it is absolutely necessary and washing your hands,"" she stresses. ""When it should matter is only in a small set of circumstances because what we are hoping for and expecting is for people to socially distance when they are doing their shopping."" Ms Queen underlines that there is ""no benefit"" in wearing such a covering outside and that it is not mandatory to do so while shopping or on a bus, adding that people not wearing them ""should not be criticised"". The public are being told they should definitely not be wearing surgical masks, which could ""potentially deprive"" key workers. ""It can be a scarf or a t-shirt, we don't want people to go to any real bother or expense,"" says Ms McQueen. Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor on Drivetime The first minister is announcing new guidance but it's the caveats and qualifications that come to the fore. One of the reasons given for today's announcement on face coverings was that people are already wearing them and she wants to stress the limitation of their use. She doesn't sound remotely convinced, but it's happening anyway and she'd rather it happen with guidance.""  Morag KinniburghBBC Scotland Medics and their children have made a film to reduce fears young patients may have about being treated by people wearing masks. The Edinburgh Childrenâs Hospital Charity said: âFor a child, coming to hospital can be scary at the best of times, but it is especially daunting right now with all the doctors and nurses wearing their special PPE.â The film shows NHS staff children dressed up as everything from astronauts to chefs explaining why uniforms are important as well as medics in PPE, to try to reassure children coming into hospital.

"Ministers are facing competing demands from councils across England for a Â£1.6bn emergency coronavirus fund. County councils are seeking assurances that up to Â£1bn in added social care costs will be met to support nursing homes, recruit carers, source equipment and relieve pressure on the NHS. But district councils have warned they risk financial collapse if the new money is not allocated ""fairly"". The government said councils were getting ""significant support"". Earlier this month, Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick announced a second tranche of emergency funding for councils as part of a Â£3.2bn package to fund higher service costs caused by the pandemic. But the Local Government Association, which represents more than 300 councils of different sizes in England and Wales, said local authorities could require four times that in order to make it through. With the government yet to make clear how the money will be allocated, the BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said many councils were fearful that they could lose out, showing just how stretched services were. County councils and unitary authorities, which are legally responsible for providing care for the elderly in their areas, say they ought to be prioritised as they are facing an added Â£1.3bn financial burden, The County Councils Network, which represents 36 county councils and unitary authorities, has warned already stretched social care budgets could come under further strain if funding mechanisms are ""dramatically altered"". They say their members are liable for an estimated extra Â£322m to meet the escalating costs of care and nursing homes while Â£259m could be needed to meet growing demand for other services, vital to ensuring people could be treated in the community and not put added strain on NHS beds. It warned it might have to take ""unpalatable decisions"" and potentially reduce support for ""life-saving"" services, including providing testing in care homes, helping to ""shield"" the most vulnerable in their homes and meeting shortages of personal protective equipment locally. It also wants the government, separately, to underwrite the cost of potentially billions in lost revenues due to the anticipated steep fall in council tax receipts, income from business rates and other charges. LIVE:PM urges UK to stick with lockdown A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area ""It is clear from the evidence provided to ministers that social care is adding the most strain to council budgets as we battle the spread of the disease locally,"" said Councillor David Williams, the body's chairman. He added: ""If the government changes the distribution of emergency funding it will disproportionately and unfairly impact those councils responsible for adult and children's social care."" Care England, the largest representative body for independent providers of adult social care, has warned of ""severe"" financial implications from the pandemic and said resources must quickly reach the frontline. But the 192 district councils in England, which provide services from bin collections to helping the homeless, say they are facing the toughest squeeze on their budgets of any local authorities due to the economic impact of the lockdown and their needs cannot be overlooked. They warned that income from car parking, leisure facilities, planning and licensing applications is ""plummeting"" while financial liabilities could dwarf their finances should council tax collection rates fall sharply. The District Councils Network has called for each district to receive minimum amount of temporary funding, supplemented with additional funding based on the number of residents and businesses in each area. ""We cannot run services on fresh air,"" said its chair John Fuller. ""Districts need to see a significant share of the additional Â£1.6bn to prevent them winding down services when people and businesses need them most. ""District councils are the ones who are delivering the final mile of public services and have stretched every sinew of resource to step up to the plate and respond to this pandemic."" The Department of Communities and Local Government said it would outline where the Â£1.6bn would be spent as soon as possible but insisted it was standing by councils at a highly challenging time for them. ""The secretary of state has announced a total of Â£3.2 billion of funding for councils to support their response to the pandemic,"" a spokesman said. ""This is a significant package of support which responds to the range of pressures councils have told us they are facing and will support them to protect vital services.""

The pandemic is playing havoc with movie release plans worldwide The organisers of the Academy Awards have announced that they will bend their own rules to let films only released on streaming
platforms be eligible for nomination. Under current rules, films have to be screened in a cinema in Los Angeles for at least seven days to qualify for awards. Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson said in a statement on Tuesday that their commitment to theatre releases was ""unchanged and unwavering"" but said the pandemic has made the rule change necessary. The Academy's new policy is only temporary while most cinemas are closed because of coronavirus. Many scheduled movie releases, including the new installment of James Bond, have been completely delayed by the pandemic. US President Donald Trump was speaking earlier at a White House event about supporting small businesses through the coronavirus pandemic. As he closed the event, Mr Trump expressed his pride at the work being done by his government and tried to compare the scale of the outbreak with the Spanish Flu pandemic. ""We're going through a period of time the likes of which we've never seen in this country before, certainly even if you go back into 1917 - it was the worst of all time but it was also not as bad here,"" Mr Trump said. ""It was very bad, it was very rough - it was a bad one. But it wasn't quite like what we're going through right now."" But the Spanish Flu pandemic happened in 1918, not 1917. It also had a far higher death toll than the coronavirus pandemic has had so far. More than 50 million people died of Spanish Flu worldwide while the current death toll from the coronavirus is about 216,000, according to Johns Hopkins University tracking. Some 675,000 Americans died in the 1918 pandemic, while some 58,000 are thought to have died with Covid-19.  US President Donald Trump has doubled down on earlier comments suggesting that American schools reopen, saying that young people are less susceptible to the virus. ""Now we found out that young people do extraordinarily well,"" with the virus, he says. ""That's why I think we can start thinking about schools."" The president said yesterday he thought it would be a ""good thing"" for schools to open up before the end of the current school year. ""I noticed that Purdue University"", in Indiana, wants to reopen, Trump said on Tuesday. ""I think that's correct."" ""So hopefully they're going to be coming back,"" he said. ""Young people do well with this horrible scourge."" The coronavirus has not hit US young children as hard as adults, however, the disease has caused hospitalisation and death across all ages. Earlier this month, a six-week-old baby died in Connecticut, believed to be one of America's youngest victim of the virus. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This video can not be played Coronavirus: Tests to be rolled out to care home staff and residents and over-65s The testing changes announced by Matt Hancockearlier this evening represent a massive expansion of who is eligible for
testing in the UK - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a
test if they have symptoms. That will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as
part of the ""test, track and trace"" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay. It is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing
kits and mobile units staffed by the Army. The problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-thru testing centres have
not always been in convenient locations. There is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the
three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire. The expansion has also allowed the government to do
something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the
testing of residents and staff without symptoms. A big concern is that the virus has been able to get a
foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms
or if they are asymptomatic. But promising something is one thing - delivering it is
another. While the capacity looks like it will be there to test
100,000 a day by the end of the month as promised, the numbers actually getting
tested are currently less than half that. Royal Mail has scrapped Saturday letter deliveries across the UK until further notice due to the coronavirus pandemic. From this weekend Saturday deliveries will be ""temporarily"" halted, the delivery company said. Monday to Friday post will continue as normal. Canadaâs
most recent data shows that social distancing is working, just as some provinces
unveil their plans to reopen the economy. Quebec, the
epicentre of Canadaâs outbreak, plans to reopen schools and some
businesses like manufacturing and construction as early as 4 May. Premier Francois Legault plans to ease controls
outside of the Montreal âhot zoneâ first. These new
plans have left some worried, as the governmentâs latest modelling shows how
essential social distancing is for Canadaâs recovery. In early
April, new cases were doubling every three days. Now they are doubling every 16
days, the data shows. Without strict
public health controls, models predict as much as 80% of the population could be
infected by the fall. If strict measures are maintained, the infection rate
could go as low as 1%. The country
currently has about 49,025 cases and 2,766 deaths. Models
predict that by 5 May, there will be 53,196 to 66,835 and 3,277 to 3,883
deaths. President Donald Trump was just asked for his response to the US hitting one million confirmed cases, given his comments in February that the 15 cases of coronavirus confirmed at the time would soon drop down ""close to zero"". ""It will go down to zero ultimately,"" Mr Trump said on Tuesday. ""You have to understand, when it comes to cases we do much more testing than anybody else. He added: 'We're doing more testing than any other country in the world by far... So we're gonna show more cases because we're doing much, much more testing, double anybody else. ""At the appropriate time it will be down to zero like we say."" Jessica LussenhopSenior staff writer, BBC News President Trump will use the Defense Production Act to compel some meat processing plants to stay open. But it will raise questions about how workers will remain safe on factory floors. Across the country, slaughterhouses and meat production facilities have shut after the coronavirus swept through the employees' ranks, sickening at least 3,300 workers and killing 20. Meat production in the US is thought to have contracted by anywhere from 25 to 40%. Because these plants process tens of thousands of animals into meat products every day, the shutdowns are having a significant impact on thousands of farmers, particularly hog farmers in the US Midwest. Without anyone to buy pigs ready for slaughter, some are beginning to euthanize their animals. Glynn Tonsor, a professor of agricultural economics at Kansas State University, says consumers will notice a decrease in available meat products in the month of May, particularly in products that require an extra step like smoking or flavouring. But he says stocks could be back to normal by June. One of the first large American pork plants to close was the Smithfield factory in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, after it became the number one Covid-19 hotspot in the US. Read the BBC's untold story of America's biggest outbreak. Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris French central planning is at its finest in a crisis. As the prime minister said, never in history - not in war, occupation or disease - has France had to confront such massive disruption. And now from the bestfonctionnairebrains in the land comes an exit strategy that might just measure up to the disaster. As ever in hyper-rational France, the plan is built around numbers, categories and systems. The key figure is 3,000. That is what the government reckons will be the amount of daily infections in the weeks ahead. By setting up local âbrigadesâ of investigators to track the trail of infection,  they reckon they will test 20 contacts per infection - so 420,000 tests a week, which is well within planned capacity. Those found to have the virus will be expected to self-isolate, either at home with their families or in requisitioned hotels. And as for the rest of the population, life will very gradually resume. Protection, testing, isolation. That is the system. Which is itself then conditioned by three imperatives: acceptance of the enduring nature of the virus, progressive implementation and regional adaptation. It always sounds a mouthful when a French technocrat expounds on a plan. But sometimes it may be exactly what the country needs. Reality Check US President Donald Trump has said that the US isâdoing far more, and better, testing than any other country in the world"".,external The latest data shows 5,593,495 tests have been carried out in the US, and that is more tests in total than any other country. But the US has far more people to test than most other nations, with a population of about 328 million, and in terms of tests per capita it is still behind others. Exact testing comparisons can be difficult. Some countries count the number of people tested, while others count the total number of tests carried out as someone can be tested several times over if the first test doesn't work properly. Looking at the latest data available, the US has carried out one test in every 60 people. But Italy has done one in every 35 people, Spain around one in every 45, and Australia around one in every 50. In early March, the White House conceded that the US did not have enough testing kits, but testing has significantly increased, with the total number carried out more than quadrupling since the start of April. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter One million coronavirus cases in the US is indeed a grim milestone, a number as round and neat as it is devastating. The reality, however, is that the mark was certainly hit weeks ago, as many cases have gone undiagnosed â the disease silently spreading through communities across the nation. Only a few months ago, the pandemic seemed like a distant news story for most Americans â a problem for China, then Italy. There had been pandemic warnings before, but they had always passed with little impact on everyday life. Why would this time be different? But it was different. The virus spread from a handful of documented US cases in January, to thousands, to hundreds of thousands, and now a million â one-third of all the cases in entire world, with a death count now above 50,000. While the nationwide lockdown appears to have helped slow the spread of the virus and avoid the most dire casualty predictions, Tuesdayâs milestone is still an indictment of US governmentâs failed attempts to prevent a full-blown health â and economic â crisis. It is also a warning that despite calls to ease state-imposed restrictions and reopen businesses, the virus continues to pose a serious threat throughout the US. A total of 21,678 people have died in UK hospitals, an increase of 586 since Monday's figures. This number will be higher once deaths in care homes an in the community are included. From Wednesday, the UK will publish a daily figure of the number of people who have died in care homes, alongside the hospital deaths figure, the health secretary has announced. In the individual nations:  The tallies for individual nations differ
from the UK-wide total, because they are calculated on a different timeframe. Canadian members of Parliament convened today for the first ever virtual sitting using the videoconferencing platform Zoom. It was the first time all 338 MPs have publicly gathered virtually, in this case for a special committee to debate the federal governmentâs response to the coronavirus pandemic. There were a number of technical glitches - connection, audio and translation issues. Some members - including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - occasionally forgot to take themselves off mute. These happened despite a less formal dry run on Monday, captured in a screengrab by Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner and posted on Twitter. Missing was the usual heckling and applause. MPs will be supplementing once-weekly in-person sittings - with social distancing guidelines in place - with these virtual sittings until late May.   Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's partner, CBS, has asked the clinic for a statement. The incident comes on the same day confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US topped one million. The country, suffering huge economic disruption caused by the pandemic, is the midst of a national row over how and when to lift lockdown measures. Some governors have taken action to reopen local economies, despite ongoing health concerns and almost 58,000 national deaths.  Despite the lack of live action around the world due to the coronavirus pandemic, there is plenty of news in sport. Here are a few headlines: He is usually photographed wearing a suit and tie, but Irish premier Leo Varadkar was spotted wearing medical scrubs when he joined front line workers to help out with coronavirus testing in Dublin. The Taoiseach, who is a qualified medical doctor, also had a face mask as he helped out. Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group posted pictures on theirFacebook page,externalof Mr Varadkar wearing the medical gear while talking to a number of residents. Mr Varadkar rejoined the medical register to offer his services and is working one session a week since earlier this month. As of Tuesday, a total of total of 1,159 people have died with coronavirus in the Republic of Ireland. The US Navy's Blue Angels and the Air Force's Thunderbirds flew over New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania today in a joint salute to health care workers, first responders and other essential employees working on the frontlines of the virus outbreak. A Royal Navy submarine captainwho allowed his crew to hold a barbeque partyduring the UK lockdown has been sacked. Commander John Lewis, captain of nuclear-powered submarine HMS Trenchant, allowed the party at Devonport dockyard in Plymouth. A video shared on social media showed the crew dancing and laughing on the dockside after the submarine returned to the town for repairs. The captain has been relieved of his command following an inquiry, but will remain in the Royal Navy in another role. Confirmed virus cases in the US have now surpassed 1 million, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US surpassed China in March for the most confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country. The death toll has reached 56,749 nationwide, also a global high. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Families of front line NHS and social care staff in England who die from coronavirus will be entitled to a Â£60,000 payment, the government says. Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed 82 NHS and 16 social care workers had died so far during the outbreak. He said he felt a ""deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones"". Unions have welcomed the announcement, but called for the scheme to be applied to more sectors. The Welsh government haspromised the same payment to its NHS and social care staffwhile Scotland is finalising its own arrangements - although all devolved schemes will be paid for by the UK government.

"This video can not be played Tesco online deliveries to double in a month People have reverted to shopping the way they did a decade ago by making one big weekly trip to the supermarket, according to the boss of Tesco. Chief executive Dave Lewis said Covid-19 social distancing measures mean consumers are shopping less frequently. He said that the number of transactions in April nearly halved, but the size of the average basket had doubled. Mr Lewis added Tesco has now broken through the one million online delivery slots a week for the first time. He expects the supermarket will add a further 200,000 slots over the next ten days, in particularfrom vulnerable customers. Tesco has achieved an increase in online capacity of 103% in the space of a few weeks, growth which would normally take years to achieve. The other supermarkets have also ramped up delivery slots. Before the crisis, only about 7% of all groceries were bought online. ""We're trying to help as many people as we can. And the single biggest thing has been the change in online shopping,"" he said. ""The issue that we have is that when the government talks about vulnerable customers, it has very specific guidelines and they had about 400,000 that they wanted the retail industry to help. They gave us 350,000 of those names and we got to 260,000. Shoppers swap clothes for drink as retail sales sink Tesco tells people to visit stores to get food ""We will want to do more, but there's still more demand than we're able to supply,"" Mr Lewis said. The Tesco boss's comments about the weekly shop were backed up by data from retail consultant Kantar, which said households made a ""record low"" number of trips to the supermarket in the 12 weeks to 19 April. However, average basket sizes had ""hit their highest levels ever"", it added. ""Grocery sales were Â£524m higher in the past four weeks than they were in April 2019, as British consumers adapted to life under lockdown,"" Kantar said. Online sales now account for 10.2% of the grocery market. ""On average, households shopped only 14 times for groceries over the past month, a record low and down from 17 in more normal times,"" Kantar said. ""A drop in frequency was matched by a corresponding uplift in the amount spent on each trip to Â£26.02 - easily the highest figure ever recorded by Kantar and Â£7 greater than last year."" Tesco remains the UK's biggest supermarket, with a 26.8% share of the market, with shoppers spending 7.2% more than in the same period last year. Other supermarkets saw even bigger rises in spending, with the Co-op up 20% and online-only Ocado rising 19.4%. In his first broadcast interview since the outbreak of coronavirus, Mr Lewis spoke about how Britain's biggest retailer had adapted and how shopping habits have changed during lockdown. ""People are shopping once a week, a little like they did 10 or 15 years ago, rather than two, three or four times a week that was happening before the crisis."" He added that during the surge in panic buying - when customers stripped supermarket shelves of goods like liquid soap, toilet roll and pasta - Tesco ""had seen seven weeks of sales going in one or two days"". ""The food supply chain is now back in good shape,"" he believes.  Flour, though, is still in short supply. Tesco is asking those who can come into store to do so Mr Lewis described the last six weeks as ""incredible"" adding that ""just about everything in the business had changed"". For instance, Tesco has taken on 45, 000 temporary workers to help cover for the 51,000 staff who were absent because of Covid-19 and cope with the increase in online deliveries. Mr Lewis said the company, the UK's biggest private sector employer with more than 300,000 workers, is now in the process of welcoming back staff who have been away while those temporary hires leave. ""We still have probably 35,000 to 40,000 double cover at the moment,"" he said. ""I think what was really quite humbling was the willingness of people to come and work in a supermarket and help us feed the nation. We've had some very interesting new colleagues - from BA pilots, West End theatre, to racing drivers... and we've trained them all very quickly"". The priority is to keep his staff and shoppers safe. ""I've been really quite amazed how well 99% of our customers have adapted to the changes in stores, "" he said. ""But we have to recognise that until the advice of the government changes, then we need to maintain social distance. So, we will, for the foreseeable future have to keep those measures in place."" The challenge will be keeping the discipline in smaller stores, especially in city centres, when people return to work. Mr Lewis was asked about the impact of coronavirus on retail and High Streets more broadly. He said a lot depended on how customers behave once the crisis is over but he hoped it would encourage the country to think about its future food strategy. ""I think the food chain has done really very well. Two weeks after such a big demand spike everything did recover, so there is resilience. ""I think what this crisis has shown is the importance of food retail. I think in the past, perhaps, a little bit we may have taken that for granted. So I hope that as a nation, we'll think carefully about food, food strategy and distribution.""

"The government is understood to be considering a hardship payment for dairy farmers after warnings tens of thousands of cows could be slaughtered. Demand for dairy products in the hospitality sector has dropped with the closure of many cafes and restaurants. George Eustice will discuss the issue with senior Tories, while talks with MPs and trade reps are due on Tuesday. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it had relaxed competition law to help the industry. It also said that farmers could access existing financial support measures. Dairy farmers told to cut milk supplies Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry The coronavirus outbreak has led to problems for the dairy industry, withsome farmers forced to discard milk. Whitehall sources have indicated that officials are now looking at the idea of a hardship fund, which could take the form of a targeted time-limited payment for badly affected farmers. The former environment secretary, Owen Paterson, said: ""There is an urgent need for some form of rapid hardship fund for the minority of dairy farmers, who temporarily have no market for their milk, to avoid seeing cows slaughtered."" Conservative MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said he believed a targeted, time-limited payment could cost Â£10m to Â£20m. ""I don't want to see tens of thousands of cows slaughtered unnecessarily due to coronavirus,"" he said. The chair of the Welsh Affairs select committee, Stephen Crabb, said he understood why Defra wanted to take time to assess the problem but ""the time for action has come"". ""Some kind of hardship payment does need to be made available for the farmers most affected."" He added: ""The issue of slaughter has been raised by local farmers. It doesn't appear that it's likely to happen tomorrow but could, if the right action isn't taken, be a longer term consequence."" Chris Loder, the Conservative MP for West Dorset, said: ""The government must act urgently to provide a hardship fund to support dairy farmers in desperate need to avoid any culling of the national herd."" The National Farmers Union, Dairy UK and the Provision Trade Federation have proposed action including targeted grant support and a scheme whereby some cows would effectively be ""furloughed"". It's understood that, during recent conference calls, industry members have raised a ""doomsday scenario"" of 80,000 cows being culled - out of a national herd of nearly two million. However, that figure has been downplayed by some including Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, who described such a number as ""highly unlikely"". The plunge in demand from the hospitality sector comes as UK milk production approaches its annual seasonal peak. Phil Langslow, chair of the Provision Trade Federation, described the situation as a ""perfect storm"". Mr Langslow, who's also a director at County Milk Products, estimates that 20m litres of liquid milk a week would normally have been going into the food service with only around 20% of that market still viable during the current lockdown. In a letter to MPs last week Mr Eustice said: ""Between 5% and 10% of total milk production goes to the food service trade and there is therefore a small proportion of milk production that currently has no home. ""The vast majority of Britain's 10,000 dairy farmers continue to supply their contracts at the usual price."" But Mr Eustice's letter has attracted criticism from some industry figures. ""I haven't heard a single farmer who thought that was accurate,"" said Joe Stanley, Leicestershire NFU's vice-chair. He claimed that the government had ""vastly underplayed"" the problem. Dairy farms 'at risk' after drop in milk price Minister warns of 'crisis' in agri-food industry A Defra spokesperson said the government was working closely with the NFU, Dairy UK and other stakeholders. ""We have already relaxed competition laws to allow the dairy industry to reroute surplus milk and adapt to changes in the supply chain. ""We also welcome the initiative from milk suppliers and their farmers to temporarily reduce the amounts they are producing, through a range of options, so that when the demand returns it can be met by our dairy farmers. ""We will continue to work with the industry to understand the potential impacts on farmers and also urge them to access the existing package of government financial support available.""

"This video can not be played UK holds a minutes silence for coronavirus key worker deaths A minute's silence has been held across the UK to commemorate the key workers who have died with coronavirus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whoreturned to work on Monday,joined the tribute at 11:00 BST. More than 100 NHS and care staff have died with the virus, as have many transport and other key workers. Meanwhile, the son of a doctor who died hascalled on the governmentto issue a public apology for issues with personal protective equipment (PPE). Intisar Chowdhury, 18, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted ministers ""to accept their mistakes and let their mistakes become improvement rather than just ignore them and completely move on"". Intisar's father, Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, 53,who died earlier this month, had warned Prime Minister Boris Johnson about a lack of PPE five days before being hospitalised. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was also asked by Mr Chowdhury to apologise on LBC, and said ""listening to the voices on the front line is a very, very important part of how we improve"". Staff observe the minute's silence outside Salford Royal Hospital Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined the silence with Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill and Chancellor Rishi Sunak At 11:00, people across the country paused to join the minute's silence. Dame Donna Kinnair, head of the Royal College of Nursing, said she was ""heartened to hear how many people took part"". In Northern Ireland, assembly membershalted business to observe the silence, in Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford and other Welsh ministers were among thosepaying respects in Wales, and in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeonled the tribute in Edinburgh. The latest daily figures on Monday show a further 360 people died with the virus in UK hospitals, taking the total number of deaths to 21,092. This number includes 82 NHS staff and 16 care workers who were confirmed to have died in hospital in England. A separate BBC News analysis of published figures found thatat least 114 health workershave died with the virus across the UK. It is not known where they contracted Covid-19. Transport for London said the underground and bus network would be brought to a halt for the silence Staff outside Salford Royal Hospital reacted to the moving silence A veteran joins the silence outside Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS staff at the Mater Infirmorum Hospital in Belfast stood 2m apart to follow distancing rules Latest statisticsreleased on Tuesday from the Office for National Statistics- which count all deaths, not just those in hospitals - found the number of people who died in England and Wales hit a record high in the week ending 17 April. More than 22,000 people died - the highest since records began in 1993. Across the whole of the UK there were 24,686 deaths registered in the week after Easter - more than twice as many as normal. The rise is partly driven by an increasing number of deaths in care homes, which accounted for a third of all deaths. The figures show deaths in care homes were continuing to rise, compared with the number of deaths in hospitals which appears to have peaked and is coming down. BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe said the data ""showed the epidemic certainly hasn't reached its peak in care homes"". Remembering 100 NHS workers who have died 'Living legend' doctor dies after contracting virus Nurse, 84, 'gave her life to the NHS' Meanwhile, it comes as a BBC Panorama investigation foundthe government failed to buy enough PPE to cope with a pandemic. There were no gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in the government's pandemic stockpile when Covid-19 reached the UK, the programme reported. Government minister Victoria Atkins told BBC Breakfast she was ""very, very sorry to hear"" of the Panorama report. ""Like every other country in the world, [the virus] is unprecedented and the requirements for PPE have risen exponentially and we're doing our absolute best to address those needs and will continue to do so,"" she said. She added that, since the outbreak began, ""a billion pieces of PPE"" have been distributed across the UK. The Archbishop of York John Sentanu was among those inviting people to take part in the minute's silence - which coincided with International Workers Memorial Day. ""Workers should not be sent into danger without the correct PPE,"" he said and called for those on the front line to be ""given all the safety equipment they need"". NHS England medical director Stephen Powis said the silence ensured the health workers' ""contribution is remembered and appreciated"". Chief nursing officer Ruth May added: ""Every death is a tragedy but we feel the loss of fellow health and care workers particularly keenly."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer - who also joined the silence - said too many front-line workers had lost their lives, adding: ""We owe it to them to make sure they've got the right equipment, in the right place, at the right time."" On Monday, the government announced that families of front-line NHS and social care staff who died with the virus in England wouldreceive a Â£60,000 compensation payment. Cheryl Williams, a ward housekeeper, was ""a lynchpin of the care, comfort, and compassion"", North Middlesex University Hospital said Prerana Issar, NHS chief people officer, said that NHS England was considering how to formally commemorate all those who had died while working to care for others once the health service was through the peak of the virus.

"The number of prisoners believed to have been infected with coronavirus may be up to six times as many as the published figure, it has emerged. Public Health England (PHE) says it has found 1,783 ""possible/probable"" cases - on top of 304 confirmed infections across jails in England and Wales. PHE's report,externalsays there have been no ""explosive outbreaks"" in prisons, but ""significant threat levels"" remain. Measures to quarantine new and at-risk inmates are needed for a year, it adds. The report, published by the Ministry of Justice, says access to testing for prisoners has been ""limited and variable"". ""Therefore, the number of laboratory confirmed cases reported does not represent the true burden of infection in the prison system,"" it said. ""During outbreaks, where a number of positive laboratory samples have been received (usually around five or more) on prisoners who have been swabbed, then subsequent cases who meet the clinical case definition are included as 'possible/probable cases'."" Of the 1,783 ""possible/probable"" cases by the end of last week: 398 were in Welsh prisons 298 in the West Midlands 264 in south-east England Wales also had more confirmed cases (77) than anywhere else. PHE said officials had responded to outbreaks in 75 different ""custodial institutions"", with 35 inmates treated in hospital and 15 deaths. But the report says the frequency of outbreaks and the number of cases is reducing, indicating that the initial wave of infections is being ""contained effectively"" - which it says is a ""cause for cautious optimism"". Previous modelling suggested there could be between 1,800 and 2,300 deaths, depending on reductions in the prisoner population. Prisoners' families fear 'death sentences' over virus Virus response scheme sees only 33 prisoners released The report goes on to warn, however, that restrictions will be needed until the ""end of the financial year"", that is April 2021. ""In the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment, risks of large outbreaks in the prison estate will remain. ""These risks may be escalated later in the year relating to relaxation of wider community restrictions, some return of normal police and court activities."" With measures in place, the report estimates there will be 2,800 infections and 100 deaths. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? CORONAVIRUS IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?The rules on sick pay, wages and time off One of the measures involves restricting movements of prisoners between jails - known as ""compartmentalisation"" - in order to stop the ""seeding"" of infections. But the report notes that it has been achieved in only a limited way. It said: ""The most effective form of compartmentalisation is single-cell accommodation but it was recognised that this would require significant reductions in prisoner population to achieve across the prison estate (about 15,000 people was the estimate at the time the original advice was provided).""

"Free online job-related courses are being aimed at adults in the lockdown Adults at home during the coronavirus lockdown, including millions furloughed from their jobs, are being offered free online courses in digital skills. The Department for Education is launching a collection of job-related online courses, teaching numeracy, coding and internet skills. The Open University and Google are among the providers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said businesses should encourage staff to ""boost their skills"". He urged furloughed employees to ""improve their knowledge, build their confidence and support their mental health so they have skills they need to succeed after the coronavirus outbreak"". With uncertainty over the labour market in the months ahead, the adult training is focused on improving skills for online jobs, in the expectation that more people will be working remotely. Some high street firms 'will not survive the lockdown' More than nine million expected to be put on furlough Five firms booming despite the lockdown ""Maths and digital skills are highly prized by employers,"" said Matthew Fell, chief policy director of the CBI business organisation. TheSkills Toolkit,external, on the government's website from Tuesday, is a collection of training resources to help people use the lockdown to acquire jobs skills for when more businesses reopen: The Open University is providing courses on basic maths and how to write computer code Futurelearn is offering courses in digital skills and producing online content Google has a course in digital marketing Digital-inclusion charity the Good Things Foundation has resources to help people get started online Good Things Foundation chief executive Helen Milner said almost 12 million people in the UK were ""without the essential digital skills for life and work"". The Open University says that it has already seen a ""massive hike"" in the numbers of people using its free online courses. Mandy McDonagh, who is taking one of the Open University's fee-charging undergraduate courses, says she has used the lockdown as an opportunity to learn ""To be honest, despite the difficulty of concentrating, these studies have helped immensely for my sense of routine, purpose and self-belief. ""Out of this time of uncertainty I can still achieve something which I will be incredibly proud of,"" she says. The Department for Education says the number of digital jobs is continuing to grow faster than in most employment sectors. The online training during the lockdown is a preparation for the post-virus economy - with digital-related jobs expected to be more resilient than some other occupations.

"Malham Cove is a popular beauty spot in the Yorkshire Dales National Park People are ""blatantly ignoring"" lockdown rules by visiting beauty spots and no longer staying at home, police have said. North Yorkshire Police issued 61 fines over the weekend to people travelling to the area from West Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumbria and Kent. Day-trippers to the Yorkshire Dales accounted for the majority of fines. The force said people should not be trying to find ""loopholes"" to justify having a day out. Seventeen fines were issued in Malham, with 13 written in an hour, police said. One officer posted on Facebook about her experience at Malham Cove over the weekend. ""Politely engaging with folk to go back to where they came from (Kent, Barnsley, Bradford, Dewsbury, Accrington) their sense of entitlement kicked in, and I endured more abuse than I ever have dealing with drunken idiots outside nightclubs,"" she wrote. She said one group had spat on the ground in front of her, another man had hurled abuse at her in front of his children, and she had to break-up one group who decided to have a barbecue on parched ground at the top of Malham Cove. The national park has closed its car parks in a bid to persuade day-trippers not to come Chris Wildman, chair of Kirkby Malham Parish Council, said the good weather had brought more visitors to the area and it was quite disturbing for residents. ""It's our home and so people are genuinely frightened if they start seeing an increase in visitors. ""Everybody here is trying really hard to social distance and are staying away from towns and cities."" North Yorkshire Police said 31 fines were issued on Saturday and 30 on Sunday. Assistant Chief Constable Mike Walker said up to now the majority of residents and visitors had acted responsibly and abided by the rules. ""However, we are definitely starting to see a turning of the tide in some areas, with some blatantly ignoring the reason why we have been in a lockdown situation for the past five weeks and making a decision to no longer stay home and save lives,"" he said. ""As I have previously mentioned, this is not about finding loopholes in the guidance to justify having a day out. ""This is about keeping your elderly, vulnerable grandmother safe, your asthmatic child safe or your diabetic father safe.""
