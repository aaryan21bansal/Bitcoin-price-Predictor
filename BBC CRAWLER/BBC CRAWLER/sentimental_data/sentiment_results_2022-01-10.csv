"Ikea has cut sick pay for unvaccinated staff who need to self-isolate because of Covid exposure and in some cases for workers who test positive. The retail giant acknowledged it was an ""emotive topic"" but said its policy had to evolve with changing circumstances. From this week, sick pay cuts will be implemented at Wessex Water and in the US several major companies have started penalising unjabbed workers. It comes as firms struggle with mass staff absences and rising costs. At Ikea unvaccinated workers, who do not have mitigating circumstances, who test positive will be paid in line with company sick pay. Unvaccinated workers, without mitigating circumstances and required to isolate owing to being identified as a close contact, could now receive as little as Â£96.35 a week - the Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) minimum. Self-isolation guidance for people who have been jabbedwas relaxed last month.,externalHowever, there was no change to the guidance for unvaccinated people who come into contact with positive cases, and who must still self-isolate for 10 full days after their date of exposure to the virus. Covid staff shortages will continue into New Year Ikea to raise prices as supply problems bite Average wages at Ikea are between about Â£400 and Â£450, depending on location and, as is the case at many companies, staff get enhanced sick pay. The move was first reported bythe Mail on Sunday.,external Ikea, which employs about 10,000 people in the UK, said in a statement: ""Fully vaccinated co-workers or those that are unvaccinated owing to mitigating circumstances which, for example, could include pregnancy or other medical grounds, will receive full pay. ""Unvaccinated co-workers without mitigating circumstances that test positive with Covid will be paid full company sick pay in line with our company absence policy. ""Unvaccinated co-workers without mitigating circumstances who have been identified as close contacts of a positive case will be paid Statutory Sick Pay."" In England, people who are vaccinated with at least two doses need not self-isolate if they have been in close contact with someone infected with Covid. Unvaccinated people contacted through the government's test-and-trace system must still isolate by law. Many companies complained of labour shortages throughout 2021, and now are seeing mass absences due to the more infectious Omicron Covid strain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated on Monday that the data continued to show those people most seriously affected by Omicron remained the unvaccinated. Wessex Water's sick pay rule change comes into force this week. Any employee without at least one Covid-19 vaccination - who does not have a valid medical reason - or does not have a confirmed vaccination appointment, will get only statutory sick pay if required to self-isolate due to close contact with someone testing positive. A Wessex Water spokesperson said absences have soared this year: ""The vast majority of our workforce has been vaccinated and it's important as a company providing essential services with key worker employees, the remainder get vaccinated to protect themselves, customers and their colleagues. ""Absences due to Covid have doubled in the last week, so we need everyone to be available so we can continue to provide uninterrupted essential water and sewerage services."" The company said that throughout the pandemic it had not furloughed staff and those self-isolating had received full pay. Last year, supermarket Morrisons cut sick pay terms, while several companies, including banking giant Citigroup, introduced a ""no jab, no job"" policy. Delta Airlines imposed a surcharge on unvaccinated staff members of its healthcare plan. Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), told the BBC there were pros and cons with changing sick pay terms for certain workers. It could encourage staff to get vaccinated, but others might be less likely to test themselves or self-isolate because they could not afford time off work at the statutory rate of about Â£96. His organisation's official guidance was not to differentiate between employees, as the consequences could be complex and there were potential legal problems. ""You would have to manage it on a case-by-case basis because of legal risks,"" Mr Willmott said. Earlier this month, David Josephs, boss of food importer and retailer All Greens, told the BBC that staff at some firms were ignoring Covid rules for financial reasons. ""We know that in our sector a lot of staff do not get paid sick pay. Ours do - but staff who are on limited contracts or on minimum wage cannot afford to be off work,"" he said. Employment lawyer Sarah Ozanne, of CMS, also warned of complex legal issues and said striking the right balance was difficult. ""This action [by Ikea] seems more of a reaction to staff shortages and how to manage them than any intended 'discrimination' of the unvaccinated,"" she said. ""But employers should consider whether their actions are proportionate as a means of achieving the aim of getting employees back into work.""

"""Is this for real?"" That might be your reaction to what we know now - that one of Boris Johnson's most senior aides emailed around 100 staff in Downing Street for outdoor drinks in May 2020, during the intense early emergency of lockdown. Martin Reynolds, the principal private secretary (for how much longer?) invited dozens and dozens of staffers to drinks in the garden, socially distanced, but to many people's minds, in contradiction to the very strict and very clear public guidance to the public at the time that banned socialising in any form. A jog with a friend in the park or a solitary trudge along the same canal path was just about it. ""Is this for real?"" was in fact the reaction of one of the staff who was gobsmacked to receive the email, written down in black and white, in a message to another official shared at the time. Another, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" '100 invited' to Downing Street lockdown drinks The list of alleged government lockdown gatherings Those exchanges make it pretty clear that there were concerns at the time. Yet the event went ahead, with, I'm told, around 30 people in attendance, a long table set out in the garden for drinks, crisps and sausage rolls with, two eyewitnesses told me, the prime minister and his wife in attendance. Notwithstanding how many of you might feel reading the details of that event, and the planning that went into it, there are three main reasons why this latest bout of claims about what was happening in Number 10 are deeply troubling for Mr Johnson. First off, the email,,externala scoop for our colleagues at ITV, is evidence in black and white of a social event that was planned in advance. That flies in the face of the prime minister's insistence so far that there were ""no parties"". Evidence of a planned event is not the same as ad hoc chats or the odd drink after hours outdoors or in the office in a Covid-secure environment - the kind of events some in government think could be justified. With an official investigation under way by a senior and experienced official with a stringent reputation, that is troublesome. Second, the prime minister could lose a senior official over what happened, and there has long been speculation about which moderately senior head might roll in the aftermath of the inquiry. But if, as eyewitnesses have told us, Mr Johnson was there himself, he is personally right at the centre of the mess. Third, for most of Monday the chatter among MPs and ministers getting back into the parliamentary routine was that the mood had calmed, the Tory anger at No 10's chaos had eased off after a liberal application of mince pies and eggnog. Disillusionment with Downing Street was still extremely common but the heat, and with it the political pressure, had cooled somewhat. But now, with this new damaging fodder for the opposition, don't be so sure.

"A Ukrainian soldier stationed at the country's border with Russia. Moscow has deployed thousands of troops to its side of the border Russia has told the US that it has no intention of invading Ukraine, after officials from both countries met for high-stakes talks in Geneva. After a meeting that lasted for seven hours on Monday, both sides agreed to continue efforts to reduce tensions. But there was no sign of a major breakthrough following the talks. Around 100,000 Russian troops are believed to be near the border with Ukraine, prompting fears of an incursion and warnings from the West. The US has said there would be sanctions if Russia were to attack Ukraine. Russia, meanwhile, has warned the US not to ""underestimate the risks"" involved in Moscow's confrontation with the West. ""We explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions to attack Ukraine,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters following the meeting. He said the Russians had told their US counterparts ""that all measures for the combat training of troops and forces are carried out within our territory"" and that there was ""no reason to fear any escalation scenario in this regard"". US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman described the talks as ""frank and forthright"" discussions designed to encourage a better understanding of each side's security concerns. This was the first chance Russian and American diplomats had to discuss face to face the standoff over Ukraine, and Russia's demands for Nato to step back from eastern Europe. And while little agreement appears to have been reached, both sides aired their concerns and set out their demands with at least the possibility of talks continuing in the future. Yet the gap between both sides remains large. The US urged Russia to de-escalate the situation and remove its troops from Ukraine's border but it received no assurance that would happen. Russia demanded that Nato should give a cast-iron guarantee it would never offer membership to Ukraine. The US rejected this outright. The US offered some ideas for both countries to limit military exercises and missile deployments but there was no sense this would be enough for Russia. Optimists will point to the fact the talks were business-like, they did not break up in acrimony and Russia insisted it had no intention of invading Ukraine. Pessimists will note that even after such assurances, US officials said they were still not sure if Russia was serious about finding a diplomatic solution to this crisis. Ms Sherman said the US had pushed back on Russian proposals that were ""non-starters"" for the US government, including Russia's demand that Nato commit to never include Ukraine in the alliance. ""We will not allow anyone to slam closed Nato's open-door policy, which has always been central to the Nato alliance,"" she said. According to Ms Sherman, the US delegation told the Russians that any invasion would be met with ""significant cost and consequences well beyond what they faced in 2014"" when Russia annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine. Ukraine leader alleges coup plan involving Russians Nato warning over Russian build-up near Ukraine These measures could include sanctions against key financial institutions, export controls, ""enhancements of Nato force posture on allied territory"" and increased security assistance to Ukraine, she added. Mr Ryabkov said the talks had been ""business-like and professional"" but warned the US not to ""underestimate the risks"" of the tensions. The Geneva talks are the first of several meetings between US, allied and Russian officials this week, which will also include a meeting at Nato headquarters in Brussels and at the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which includes Russia. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line Monday's meeting, however, took place without the participation of US European allies, including Ukraine, prompting reassurances from Ms Sherman and other US officials that Ukraine, Europe and Nato would be included in any decisions. Earlier on Monday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell Fontelles said he believed a Russian invasion was still possible. ""There are 100,000 Russian troops on the other side of the border,"" he said. ""I suppose they haven't gone there to drink coffee!"" Mr Borrell added that he'd been told nothing would be agreed without the EU's ""strong co-operation, co-ordination and participation"". Russia has repeatedly denied it has any plans to launch a military operation in Ukraine. Last month, the Russian government published a series of demands including a commitment that Ukraine will never join Nato. Has Putin's war in Ukraine failed?

"One of Britain's largest energy suppliers has apologised after it advised customers they could cuddle pets and eat porridge to stay warm. Ovo Energy said it was ""embarrassed"" after a link to a blog ""containing energy-saving tips"" was sent to its SSE Energy Services customers. The company said it had removed the blog so it could ""update it"" with ""more meaningful information for customers"". It comes after concerns over the cost of living amid rising energy bills. Ovo Energy acquired SSE Energy Services in 2020 but the brands are still separate. In a statement to the BBC, Ovo Energy said it recognised the content of the blog was ""poorly judged and unhelpful"". ""We are embarrassed and sincerely apologise,"" the supplier added. ""We understand how difficult the situation will be for many of our customers this year."" On a now-deleted SSE webpage, which offered tips on ""keeping warm in winter without turning up the heating"", SSE suggested ""10 simple and cost-effective ways"" to stay warm and keep bills down. The advice included wearing extra layers and to keep moving by ""cleaning the house, challenging the kids to a hula-hoop contest, or doing a few star jumps"". Alongside stopping draughts, SSE said people could find ""extra heat"" by leaving your oven open after you've finished cooking and by having ""a cuddle with your pets and loved ones to help stay cosy"". Speaking to the Financial Times whichfirst reported the story,external, Darren Jones, chair of the Commons business select committee, called the advice ""insensitive"". ""Being told to put on a jumper instead of turning on your heating if you can't afford it, at a time of such difficulty for so many families, is plainly offensive,"" the Labour MP told the newspaper. In a tweet,externalfollowing Ovo Energy's apology, Mr Jones said: ""Good, I'm glad they apologised. I'm not sure who signed off a marketing campaign telling people to wear a jumper and eat porridge instead of turning on the heating if you can't afford it."" Household and businesses have seen their energy bills rise in recent months as energy suppliers pass on a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices. How much would a VAT cut on my energy bill save? How to save energy at home and help the planet Increased oil and gas demand in Asia, a rapid recovery of some economies after lockdown, and a summer with little wind to generate alternative power, have all contributed to rising energy costs. Another problem is that much of the UK's housing stock is ageing and very poor at retaining heat, leaving residents particularly exposed to jumps in gas prices. On Monday, the Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Group called on the government to prioritise energy saving through home improvements, sayingbetter insulation could save UK households more than Â£500 a yearon energy bills. Trade body Energy UK has predicted bills will surge by up to 50% in April, when the change to the price cap, due to be determined in February, kicks in. It said the average household could end up paying about Â£700 more per year.

"This video can not be played Johnson: Price rises making life very tough for people Boris Johnson says he is talking to Chancellor Rishi Sunak over how the government could help people with soaring energy prices. The prime minister is under pressure to act on rising household costs, ahead of further increases to capped bills due in April. Some Tory MPs want cuts to green levies and VAT to help bring bills down. Labour, which also wants VAT suspended, is also demanding higher taxes on oil and gas producers. The party said it would use money from the hike to pay for more generous government payments to help poorer households with costs. On Monday, Mr Johnson said ministers understood the difficulties people were facing, and ""we're certainly looking at what we can do"". Labour demands energy firm tax hike to cut bills How can the government solve the energy crisis? How much would a VAT cut on my energy bill save? Trade body Energy UK predicts bills willsurge by up to 50% in April, when the change to the price cap, due to be determined in February, kicks in. There have been warnings that average households could pay about Â£700 more per year, amid surging prices for wholesale gas worldwide. Speaking to reporters during a visit to a vaccination centre, Mr Johnson said rises were driven by ""general inflationary pressure"" caused by the world economy ""coming back from Covid"". But he added: ""We've got to help people, particularly people in low incomes, we've got to help people with the cost of their fuel - and that's what we're going to do."" Asked if he would meet Mr Sunak this week, he replied: ""I've been meeting the chancellor constantly. I met the chancellor last night to talk about it."" Mr Johnson is expected to hold his first formal discussions with Mr Sunak on Monday, although a decision on what to do is not expected imminently. Experts predict average annual bills could rise to about Â£2,000 next year Labour is warning that the expected increase in the energy cap from April, in combination with theplanned risein National Insurance on workers, will lead to a cost of living crisis for many households. The party wants an extra Â£3.5bn to be spent on thewarm homes discount,external, increasing it from Â£140 to Â£400 per year, while doubling the number of households eligible to 9.3 million, around a third of the UK total. It also wants to remove the 5% VAT rate on domestic energy bills from April for 12 months, which it says would produce an annual saving of Â£89 per household. The party says it would pay for its plans through a year-long 10 percentage point increase to the corporation tax paid by North Sea energy producers on their profits, along with higher-than expected VAT receipts due to inflation. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party was ""stepping into the vacuum of leadership that the government has left with a plan to actually reduce bills"". Labour will attempt to use a Commons debate on Tuesday to set up a vote next month on its proposals for a VAT cut. The Liberal Democrats have also called for a windfall tax on energy firms to pay more more generous support for poorer households, and its ten-year plan to improve home insulation. Speaking last week, leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""It can't be right that a few energy fat cats are raking it in from record gas prices while millions of people can't even afford to heat their homes."" But Oil and Gas UK, the offshore industry body, has said a windfall tax would offer ""false hope"" to consumers and damage the UK economy. It argues the levy would not benefit users long-term, as it would discourage investment and make the UK more reliant on imported foreign gas. Mr Johnson is also facing pressure from his own side to take action in the coming weeks to reduce costs on households. Earlier this month, agroup of Tory MPs and peerscalled on him to scrap VAT on bills, and review levies to help for government environmental policies. On Monday, Conservative MP Stephen McPartland told the BBC the government should introduce ""credit facilities"" to help energy firms cope with volatile prices. He said this would allow firms to draw on financial reserves as an alternative to increasing thegovernment cap on standard tariffsfrom April. Last week, Mr Johnson argued that a VAT cut would be too ""blunt"" a tool, as it would affect all households, including the richest, rather than targeting those most in need.

"The Welsh government has been in talks with the club's bosses because of the location of Chester FC Chester could look to switch Saturday's home match if there is no resolution in the row over claims they broke Welsh Covid rules, the BBC has been told. The English club, whose Deva Stadium straddles the England-Wales border, staged two home games over Christmas. The Welsh government said the club was subject to its Covid rules, which effectively ban crowds from matches. Talks have continued on Monday but a source said other options for the match against Brackley were being looked at. One includes switching it to play away as the two sides have not met yet and were due to play at Brackley's St James' Park on 7 May. If that is not possible, and no viable alternative can be agreed, the match is likely to be postponed. Coronavirus: Chester drive-in movie bogged down by lockdown loos Chester FC is an English club, says chairman after Covid 'rule break' Probe into Covid rule break at Welsh ground The possible alternatives come after club bosses warned the club could go bust if fans were barred from the stadium. They said the financial implications of this could be massive, and urged all involved to use ""common sense"". But the Welsh government said ""as a club based in Wales"", Chester FC would be eligible for support because of crowd restrictions. The two sides met on Monday and the club's board will meet later. Chester FC was warned by North Wales Police and Flintshire council about playing further home matches with crowds in the stadium while Covid restrictions on spectator numbers are in place. Since rules capping the number of spectators at events in Wales took effect on 26 December, Chester have hosted two home fixtures at Bumpers Lane - against AFC Telford and AFC Fylde - both in front of 2,000-plus crowds. The club had insisted it had been told it was not eligible for financial support - from the Â£3m available for clubs in Wales impacted by fan restrictions - as it was an English club, but the Welsh government argued it was, adding: ""As a club based in Wales, Chester FC would be eligible for support."" Club bosses said Chester FC was anEnglish club, playing in an English league, and so would expect that English rules would apply. Club chairman Andy Morris warned: ""This is an incredible mess we've found ourselves in. It's never been an issue for the past 30 years but in the last week or so we've found ourselves in a situation that's a bit of a farce. ""We're a supporter-owned club and all the money we generate is from the supporters. There's no rich benefactor that can write a check for Â£10,000 if it was a fine. ""Any fine or reduction in income if we play behind closed doors directly impacts our future as a football club."" Chester FC fans celebrate - but will they be stopped from watching matches at the Deva Stadium? As it stands it does not seem likely Chester will get permission from the Welsh government to get around the rules. Legally, with the Deva Stadium's pitch and stands in Wales, Welsh law applies and so the public health regulations set by the Welsh government apply. It would be a controversial move if the Welsh government chose to permit Chester FC to continue attracting spectators when other rugby and football teams in Wales cannot. But I'm told First Minister Mark Drakeford hopes a way can be found through this row - either through the club being compensated like others playing behind closed doors - or Chester plays elsewhere. The suggestion that a switch could be found is likely one that would help resolve the situation in Welsh government eyes. Mr Morris added: ""No one is disputing that the border runs through the stadium, but the stadium was built in the early 90s and ever since that date, the safety certificate has been issued by Cheshire council, we've been policed by Cheshire police, everything has been managed from an England perspective. ""We admit that a significant proportion of the stadium is in Wales, however the entrance to the car park, the front door to the building is in England and the only road in and out is in England so we believe we're in line with our associations' registrations and business registration that we should be treated as an English Club"". Earlier onBBC Radio Wales' Breakfast programme, he called for ""absolute clarity"", adding: ""On 2 January, Cheshire Police attended our game when this criminal act allegedly happened."" While the club received a Â£25,000 business support grant from Flintshire council, Mr Morris said thisChester FC could move game amid England-Wales rowwas because the bar area was in Wales, and it was a UK government support grant for the hospitality sector. On Sunday, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart waded into the row. He tweeted: ""Don't understand the confusion with Chester FC & whether they fall foul of Welsh gov Covid rules. ""They're in the English league, under Cheshire W & Chester Council, policed by Cheshire Constabulary. ""They don't even receive Welsh gov financial aid. Any chance of some common sense?""

Before the pandemic club chairman Mr Morris said the significance of the stadium's unique location had been regarded as little more than the answer to a common quiz question. On Saturday he said ground's location was no longer a joke and ""had become a very real problem"". It is not the first timethe club has been bogged down by Covid rules. In October 2020 a cinema event was held close to the club, but ran into issues as the club's toilets were on the Welsh side of the border, where a firebreak lockdown was taking place. A Welsh government spokesman said talks were held on Sunday and would continue on Monday. ""Throughout the pandemic we have followed scientific and public health advice to keep people safe. We have introduced additional restrictions on sporting events in Wales, which came into force on Boxing Day, to help control the rapid spread of the new omicron variant,"" he added. ""Chester City's stadium is in Wales and the club's home games are therefore subject to the current Welsh coronavirus restrictions. ""We have made a Â£3m budget available to support professional sports clubs and organisations affected by spectator restrictions. As a club based in Wales, Chester FC would be eligible for support.""

Witnesses have told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended the gathering on 20 May 2020. But Boris Johnson has declined to say whether he was among those there. The Metropolitan Police said it was in contact with the government over ""widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches"" of Covid rules. Labour has been granted an urgent question in the Commons at 12:30 GMT to push for answers from a minister. The party's leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said the prime minister needed to ""come clean"" about the gathering. Addressing Mr Johnson on Twitter, he added: ""Your deflections and distractions are absurd. Not only did you know about the parties in Downing Street, you attended them. ""Stop lying to the British public."" Laura Kuenssberg analysis: No escape for No 10 The list of alleged government lockdown gatherings What rules would the Downing Street party have broken? Anemail, revealed by ITV News,,externalinvited people to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening"". It was sent when lockdown restrictions were still in place. Twelve days later - on 1 June - rules in England were relaxed to allow groups of up to six people to meet outside. Health Minister Edward Argar told BBC Breakfast he understood the ""anger, sadness and upset many will feel about these allegations"". But he said it was ""important"" to allow an investigation to take place into gatherings in Downing Street before coming to any conclusions. However, former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told the BBC the PM did not need to wait for an inquiry to answer whether he attended. ""I can't understand if the prime minister attended why on earth he thought that was the right thing to do,"" she added. ""People are furious about this, what they gave up, how difficult it was, what happened to their own lives, and to think that this was going on? It is indefensible, it cannot be defended."" This video can not be played Watch former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson call the No 10 party ""indefensible"" Downing Street declined to comment as it said the gathering - like others reported to have happened under coronavirus restrictions during 2020 - is now being looked into as part of an ongoing independent investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray. A Met spokesperson said the force was ""aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at Downing Street on 20 May 2020 and is in contact with the Cabinet Office"", which oversees government policy. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister ""cannot run and cannot hide"" from the allegations. He added: ""It speaks to a rotten culture at the heart of this government and the rotten culture begins with the person in charge."" Hannah Brady said her father's death certificate had been signed on the same day the drinks took place The Wednesday 20 May gathering first came to light last week ina blog,externalby the PM's former adviser Dominic Cummings. ITV News has now published what appears to be the full email invitation sent on behalf of Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. It has the subject line ""Socially Distanced Drinks! [OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE-No 10 ONLY]"". ""After what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening,"" the email says. ""Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze."" Two eyewitnesses have told the BBC they saw Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie at the event in the garden. And sources have said that several Downing Street members of staff voiced concerns about drinks happening, with one claiming: ""There were conversations about the email being really unwise."" Another added: ""I remember people saying, 'What the hell?'"" Others said a long table had been set up in the garden for the event. A message sent by one Downing Street staffer to another at the time, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin (Reynolds) encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Another asked: ""Is this for real?"" In a Twitter post on the day of the gathering, when it was 25C (77F) in London, the Metropolitan Police reminded people they could only relax or exercise outside on their own, with their own household or one person from another household.

On the same day as the gathering, the then Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, gave theDowning Street coronavirus briefing,external- in which he confirmedanother 363 people,externalin the UK had died with Covid in the previous 24 hours. At the briefing, he told the public: ""You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay two metres apart."" ""Is this for real?"" That might be your reaction to what we know now - that one of Boris Johnson's most senior aides emailed around 100 staff in Downing Street for outdoor drinks in May 2020, during the intense early emergency of lockdown. Martin Reynolds, the principal private secretary (for how much longer?) invited dozens and dozens of staffers to drinks in the garden, socially distanced, but to many people's minds, in contradiction to the very strict and very clear public guidance to the public at the time that banned socialising in any form. A jog with a friend in the park or a solitary trudge along the same canal path was just about it. ""Is this for real?"" was in fact the reaction of one of the staff who was gobsmacked to receive the email, written down in black and white, in a message to another official shared at the time. Another, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Those exchanges make it pretty clear that there were concerns at the time. Yet the event went ahead, with, I'm told, around 30 people in attendance. Read more from Laurahere. You could only meet one other person from another household outdoors, with advice to remain 2m (6ft) apart Larger gatherings with people from other households were not allowed, apart from a few exceptions, such as funerals, or where the gathering was essential for work purposes People who could work from home were still asked to do so - but people could attend workplaces if necessary Schools, non-essential shops, hospitality venues and hairdressers remained closed Hannah Brady, spokeswoman for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said her father had died four days before the email was sent. ""At the time, everyone would have known that going to a party was wrong, so how can those running the country have thought it was OK?"" she asked. ""To make matters worse, in September last year I sat in that same garden, looked the prime minister in the eyes and told him how my dad had died,"" Ms Brady added. ""He told me he had done everything he could to protect my dad, knowing that he had partied in that same spot the very day that dad's death certificate was signed. It makes me feel sick to think about it."" Separately last month, the Guardian published a photograph taken on 15 May 2020 - five days before the drinks took place - showing the prime minister, his wife and 17 staff membersin the Downing Street garden. Mr Johnson has said this was not a party and those present were ""people at work, talking about work"". Sue Gray is heading the investigation into gatherings that took place in 2020 In December, the prime minister asked Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, to investigate a series of allegations about events taking place in government buildings in 2020 despite coronavirus restrictions being in force. Mr Case stepped down after suggestions one of the parties had happened in his own office and the investigation was passed to Sue Gray, another senior civil servant. Asked during a visit to a vaccination centre in west London if he had attended the 20 May drinks, the prime minister said: ""All that, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray."" His minister, Mr Argar, echoed that on Tuesday, saying Ms Gray would be allowed to look into the allegations ""without fear or favour"", and would ""want to act quickly"". He added: ""It is right whatever flows from thatâ¦ [if] people are shown to have broken the rules, appropriate disciplinary action is taken."" The prime minister's official spokesman added: ""There is an independent process going on to look into this, led by Sue Gray, and I can't comment further while that is taking place."" Tory MP Michael Fabricant told the BBC he understood the anger over the gathering, but claimed the PM was showing ""loyalty"" to his staff. ""Boris and others felt sorry for people who were working long, long hours and they were simply spilling out from their own offices into a secure garden, which is an integral part of No 10 Downing Street,"" he said. ""And you know what? I'd rather have a prime minister who felt for his staff and all those hardworking people than some cold fish who really couldn't care [at all] about them."" But Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson has consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us. ""He is trying to get officials to take the fall for his own mistakes, but he sets the tone for the way Downing Street and the rest of government operates."" The SNP called on the Tories to ""show [the PM] the door"" or risk ""the whole party will be tainted by the lies, arrogance and rule-breaking"", while the Liberal Democrats demanded a police investigation. The government has faced intense pressure over events held in an around Downing Street. 10 May 2020 Boris Johnson announced a plan to take the “first careful steps"" out of the lockdown that began in March 2020. But he said people should continue to ""obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them”. Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising. 15 May 2020 A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said, “those people were at work talking about work”. 20 May 2020 About 100 people were invited by email to “socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden” on behalf of the prime ministerâs principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended. Boris Johnson has confirmed he attended the event, saying he was there for 25 minutes and “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. 18 June 2020 A gathering took place in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. 19 June 2020 On Boris Johnsonâs birthday, up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to present the prime minister with a birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday, according to a report by ITV News. No 10 said staff had “gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes”. Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. 17 July 2020 Boris Johnson announced plans for a “significant return to normality"" in England by Christmas ""through targeted, local action” instead of national lockdowns. But he added that the timetable relied on “every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly”. 5 November 2020 With cases of coronavirus rising again, the prime minister told people in England that “we are once again asking you to stay at home” as a new national lockdown began. He said people should only leave their homes “for work if you canât work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies”. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes. 13 November 2020 Sources told the BBC that Downing Street staff members attended a gathering with Carrie Johnson in the flat where she and the prime minister live. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place. 27 November 2020 A leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources. 2 December 2020 The second national lockdown ended after four weeks but Boris Johnson replaced those restrictions with “tough tiers to keep this virus down”. London was placed in tier two, which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless “reasonably necessary” for work purposes. 10 December 2020 The Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited. 14 December 2020 The Conservative Party has admitted that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party's London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee. The Metropolitan Police is to speak to two people who attended the party. 15 December 2020 Multiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo - published by the Sunday Mirror - showed Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing. 16 December 2020 London moved into the highest tier of restrictions and Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time, said it was important “everyone is cautious” ahead of the festive period. The Department for Transport apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices that day, calling it “inappropriate"" and an ""error of judgment” by staff. 17 December 2020 A leaving party was held at the Cabinet Office for the outgoing head of the civil service Covid taskforce - the team responsible for drawing up coronavirus restrictions. Kate Josephs, now chief executive of Sheffield City Council, apologised for the event, saying she was “truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result”. 18 December 2020 Downing Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street. However, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister's then-press secretary Allegra Stratton, joking about reports of an event, saying: “This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.” 14 January 2021 A gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of two private secretaries. 12 April 2021 Lockdown restrictions were eased in England, with pubs and restaurants allowed to reopen with outdoor service only. However, working from home continued to be recommended and socialising indoors with people from other households was not allowed. Meeting others outdoors was limited to groups of six people or two households. 16 April 2021 Two parties were held by Downing Street staff at No 10, the night before Prince Philip's funeral. One of the events was a leaving party for the PM's then director of communications James Slack, who has apologised for the event and acknowledged it “should not have happened at the time that it did”. Boris Johnson was not at either party.

Not only did you know about the parties in Downing Street, you attended them. ""Stop lying to the British public."" Laura Kuenssberg analysis: No escape for No 10 The list of alleged government lockdown gatherings What rules would the Downing Street party have broken? Anemail, revealed by ITV News,,externalinvited people to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening"". It was sent when lockdown restrictions were still in place. Twelve days later - on 1 June - rules in England were relaxed to allow groups of up to six people to meet outside. Health Minister Edward Argar told BBC Breakfast he understood the ""anger, sadness and upset many will feel about these allegations"". But he said it was ""important"" to allow an investigation to take place into gatherings in Downing Street before coming to any conclusions. However, former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told the BBC the PM did not need to wait for an inquiry to answer whether he attended. ""I can't understand if the prime minister attended why on earth he thought that was the right thing to do,"" she added. ""People are furious about this, what they gave up, how difficult it was, what happened to their own lives, and to think that this was going on? It is indefensible, it cannot be defended."" This video can not be played Watch former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson call the No 10 party ""indefensible"" Downing Street declined to comment as it said the gathering - like others reported to have happened under coronavirus restrictions during 2020 - is now being looked into as part of an ongoing independent investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray. A Met spokesperson said the force was ""aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at Downing Street on 20 May 2020 and is in contact with the Cabinet Office"", which oversees government policy. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister ""cannot run and cannot hide"" from the allegations. He added: ""It speaks to a rotten culture at the heart of this government and the rotten culture begins with the person in charge."" Hannah Brady said her father's death certificate had been signed on the same day the drinks took place The Wednesday 20 May gathering first came to light last week ina blog,externalby the PM's former adviser Dominic Cummings. ITV News has now published what appears to be the full email invitation sent on behalf of Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. It has the subject line ""Socially Distanced Drinks! [OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE-No 10 ONLY]"". ""After what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening,"" the email says. ""Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze."" Two eyewitnesses have told the BBC they saw Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie at the event in the garden. And sources have said that several Downing Street members of staff voiced concerns about drinks happening, with one claiming: ""There were conversations about the email being really unwise."" Another added: ""I remember people saying, 'What the hell?'"" Others said a long table had been set up in the garden for the event. A message sent by one Downing Street staffer to another at the time, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin (Reynolds) encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Another asked: ""Is this for real?"" In a Twitter post on the day of the gathering, when it was 25C (77F) in London, the Metropolitan Police reminded people they could only relax or exercise outside on their own, with their own household or one person from another household.

On the same day as the gathering, the then Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, gave theDowning Street coronavirus briefing,external- in which he confirmedanother 363 people,externalin the UK had died with Covid in the previous 24 hours. At the briefing, he told the public: ""You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay two metres apart."" ""Is this for real?"" That might be your reaction to what we know now - that one of Boris Johnson's most senior aides emailed around 100 staff in Downing Street for outdoor drinks in May 2020, during the intense early emergency of lockdown. Martin Reynolds, the principal private secretary (for how much longer?) invited dozens and dozens of staffers to drinks in the garden, socially distanced, but to many people's minds, in contradiction to the very strict and very clear public guidance to the public at the time that banned socialising in any form. A jog with a friend in the park or a solitary trudge along the same canal path was just about it. ""Is this for real?"" was in fact the reaction of one of the staff who was gobsmacked to receive the email, written down in black and white, in a message to another official shared at the time. Another, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Those exchanges make it pretty clear that there were concerns at the time. Yet the event went ahead, with, I'm told, around 30 people in attendance. Read more from Laurahere. You could only meet one other person from another household outdoors, with advice to remain 2m (6ft) apart Larger gatherings with people from other households were not allowed, apart from a few exceptions, such as funerals, or where the gathering was essential for work purposes People who could work from home were still asked to do so - but people could attend workplaces if necessary Schools, non-essential shops, hospitality venues and hairdressers remained closed Hannah Brady, spokeswoman for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said her father had died four days before the email was sent. ""At the time, everyone would have known that going to a party was wrong, so how can those running the country have thought it was OK?"" she asked. ""To make matters worse, in September last year I sat in that same garden, looked the prime minister in the eyes and told him how my dad had died,"" Ms Brady added. ""He told me he had done everything he could to protect my dad, knowing that he had partied in that same spot the very day that dad's death certificate was signed. It makes me feel sick to think about it."" Separately last month, the Guardian published a photograph taken on 15 May 2020 - five days before the drinks took place - showing the prime minister, his wife and 17 staff membersin the Downing Street garden. Mr Johnson has said this was not a party and those present were ""people at work, talking about work"". Sue Gray is heading the investigation into gatherings that took place in 2020 In December, the prime minister asked Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, to investigate a series of allegations about events taking place in government buildings in 2020 despite coronavirus restrictions being in force. Mr Case stepped down after suggestions one of the parties had happened in his own office and the investigation was passed to Sue Gray, another senior civil servant. Asked during a visit to a vaccination centre in west London if he had attended the 20 May drinks, the prime minister said: ""All that, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray."" His minister, Mr Argar, echoed that on Tuesday, saying Ms Gray would be allowed to look into the allegations ""without fear or favour"", and would ""want to act quickly"". He added: ""It is right whatever flows from thatâ¦ [if] people are shown to have broken the rules, appropriate disciplinary action is taken."" The prime minister's official spokesman added: ""There is an independent process going on to look into this, led by Sue Gray, and I can't comment further while that is taking place."" Tory MP Michael Fabricant told the BBC he understood the anger over the gathering, but claimed the PM was showing ""loyalty"" to his staff. ""Boris and others felt sorry for people who were working long, long hours and they were simply spilling out from their own offices into a secure garden, which is an integral part of No 10 Downing Street,"" he said. ""And you know what? I'd rather have a prime minister who felt for his staff and all those hardworking people than some cold fish who really couldn't care [at all] about them."" But Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson has consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us. ""He is trying to get officials to take the fall for his own mistakes, but he sets the tone for the way Downing Street and the rest of government operates."" The SNP called on the Tories to ""show [the PM] the door"" or risk ""the whole party will be tainted by the lies, arrogance and rule-breaking"", while the Liberal Democrats demanded a police investigation. The government has faced intense pressure over events held in an around Downing Street. 10 May 2020 Boris Johnson announced a plan to take the “first careful steps"" out of the lockdown that began in March 2020. But he said people should continue to ""obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them”. Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising. 15 May 2020 A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said, “those people were at work talking about work”. 20 May 2020 About 100 people were invited by email to “socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden” on behalf of the prime ministerâs principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended. Boris Johnson has confirmed he attended the event, saying he was there for 25 minutes and “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. 18 June 2020 A gathering took place in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. 19 June 2020 On Boris Johnsonâs birthday, up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to present the prime minister with a birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday, according to a report by ITV News. No 10 said staff had “gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes”. Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. 17 July 2020 Boris Johnson announced plans for a “significant return to normality"" in England by Christmas ""through targeted, local action” instead of national lockdowns. But he added that the timetable relied on “every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly”. 5 November 2020 With cases of coronavirus rising again, the prime minister told people in England that “we are once again asking you to stay at home” as a new national lockdown began. He said people should only leave their homes “for work if you canât work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies”. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes. 13 November 2020 Sources told the BBC that Downing Street staff members attended a gathering with Carrie Johnson in the flat where she and the prime minister live. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place. 27 November 2020 A leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources. 2 December 2020 The second national lockdown ended after four weeks but Boris Johnson replaced those restrictions with “tough tiers to keep this virus down”. London was placed in tier two, which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless “reasonably necessary” for work purposes. 10 December 2020 The Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited. 14 December 2020 The Conservative Party has admitted that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party's London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee. The Metropolitan Police is to speak to two people who attended the party. 15 December 2020 Multiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo - published by the Sunday Mirror - showed Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing. 16 December 2020 London moved into the highest tier of restrictions and Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time, said it was important “everyone is cautious” ahead of the festive period. The Department for Transport apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices that day, calling it “inappropriate"" and an ""error of judgment” by staff. 17 December 2020 A leaving party was held at the Cabinet Office for the outgoing head of the civil service Covid taskforce - the team responsible for drawing up coronavirus restrictions. Kate Josephs, now chief executive of Sheffield City Council, apologised for the event, saying she was “truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result”. 18 December 2020 Downing Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street. However, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister's then-press secretary Allegra Stratton, joking about reports of an event, saying: “This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.” 14 January 2021 A gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of two private secretaries. 12 April 2021 Lockdown restrictions were eased in England, with pubs and restaurants allowed to reopen with outdoor service only. However, working from home continued to be recommended and socialising indoors with people from other households was not allowed. Meeting others outdoors was limited to groups of six people or two households. 16 April 2021 Two parties were held by Downing Street staff at No 10, the night before Prince Philip's funeral. One of the events was a leaving party for the PM's then director of communications James Slack, who has apologised for the event and acknowledged it “should not have happened at the time that it did”. Boris Johnson was not at either party.

"Novak Djokovic sought a medical exemption from Australia's strict Covid visa regulations on the basis that he'd contracted the infection in mid-December. Mr Djokovic was tested in Serbia, where you are legally required to isolate for 14 days following a positive Covid test. After days of speculation over public engagements he apparently attended following his positive test, he has now said he did appear in public during this period of isolation. Here is a timeline of events from what we know so far. Mr Djokovic attended a Euroleague basketball game in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, between Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona. After the game, numerous people who attended tested positive for Covid-19, so it is possible this is where Mr Djokovic became infected. Mr Djokovic had front row seats at the Euroleague basketball game in Belgrade on 14 December Mr Djokovic says he took a lateral flow test on 16 December following the Covid outbreak at the basketball game. He says this came back negative, but that he also took a PCR test ""out an abundance of caution"". In court documents, Mr Djokovic's lawyerssubmitted evidence,externalthat confirms he took a PCR test just after 13:00 on 16 December. The document from the Institute of Public Health of Serbia states the result came back positive seven hours later, at about 20:00 on the same day. Mr Djokovic says he wasn't notified about his positive PCR result until the following day. Mr Djokovic attended a panel discussion and a ceremony for the unveiling of a stamp in his honour in Belgrade on 16 December (before 20:00), which he posted about on Twitter the next day.

It has beenreported by French newspaper L'Equipe,externalthat Mr Djokovic attended an interview and photo shoot with their paper in Belgrade on 18 December. He has since admitted attending this engagement, which he says was ""an error of judgement and I accept I should have rescheduled"". Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic told the BBCthat it was ""a clear breach of the rules"" if Mr Djokovic continued with public events, knowing he had Covid. The paper says he wore a face mask during the interview, but removed it for the photo shoot.

This is where he was quizzed by border officials and his visa was revoked after he confirmed he wasn't vaccinated. In Mr Djokovic's Australian travel entry form -  released by the federal court - it was stated that he had not travelled anywhere else in the 14 days prior to his arrival there. Mr Djokovic says the form was filled in by a member of his team who - in ""human error"" - had ticked the wrong box about his previous travel before coming to Australia. Australian immigration officials said on Tuesday they were investigating whether he had made a ""false declaration"" - which would be grounds for a visa cancellation.

"A Ukrainian soldier stationed at the country's border with Russia. Moscow has deployed thousands of troops to its side of the border Russia has told the US that it has no intention of invading Ukraine, after officials from both countries met for high-stakes talks in Geneva. After a meeting that lasted for seven hours on Monday, both sides agreed to continue efforts to reduce tensions. But there was no sign of a major breakthrough following the talks. Around 100,000 Russian troops are believed to be near the border with Ukraine, prompting fears of an incursion and warnings from the West. The US has said there would be sanctions if Russia were to attack Ukraine. Russia, meanwhile, has warned the US not to ""underestimate the risks"" involved in Moscow's confrontation with the West. ""We explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions to attack Ukraine,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters following the meeting. He said the Russians had told their US counterparts ""that all measures for the combat training of troops and forces are carried out within our territory"" and that there was ""no reason to fear any escalation scenario in this regard"". US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman described the talks as ""frank and forthright"" discussions designed to encourage a better understanding of each side's security concerns. This was the first chance Russian and American diplomats had to discuss face to face the standoff over Ukraine, and Russia's demands for Nato to step back from eastern Europe. And while little agreement appears to have been reached, both sides aired their concerns and set out their demands with at least the possibility of talks continuing in the future. Yet the gap between both sides remains large. The US urged Russia to de-escalate the situation and remove its troops from Ukraine's border but it received no assurance that would happen. Russia demanded that Nato should give a cast-iron guarantee it would never offer membership to Ukraine. The US rejected this outright. The US offered some ideas for both countries to limit military exercises and missile deployments but there was no sense this would be enough for Russia. Optimists will point to the fact the talks were business-like, they did not break up in acrimony and Russia insisted it had no intention of invading Ukraine. Pessimists will note that even after such assurances, US officials said they were still not sure if Russia was serious about finding a diplomatic solution to this crisis. Ms Sherman said the US had pushed back on Russian proposals that were ""non-starters"" for the US government, including Russia's demand that Nato commit to never include Ukraine in the alliance. ""We will not allow anyone to slam closed Nato's open-door policy, which has always been central to the Nato alliance,"" she said. According to Ms Sherman, the US delegation told the Russians that any invasion would be met with ""significant cost and consequences well beyond what they faced in 2014"" when Russia annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine. Ukraine leader alleges coup plan involving Russians Nato warning over Russian build-up near Ukraine These measures could include sanctions against key financial institutions, export controls, ""enhancements of Nato force posture on allied territory"" and increased security assistance to Ukraine, she added. Mr Ryabkov said the talks had been ""business-like and professional"" but warned the US not to ""underestimate the risks"" of the tensions. The Geneva talks are the first of several meetings between US, allied and Russian officials this week, which will also include a meeting at Nato headquarters in Brussels and at the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which includes Russia. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line Monday's meeting, however, took place without the participation of US European allies, including Ukraine, prompting reassurances from Ms Sherman and other US officials that Ukraine, Europe and Nato would be included in any decisions. Earlier on Monday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell Fontelles said he believed a Russian invasion was still possible. ""There are 100,000 Russian troops on the other side of the border,"" he said. ""I suppose they haven't gone there to drink coffee!"" Mr Borrell added that he'd been told nothing would be agreed without the EU's ""strong co-operation, co-ordination and participation"". Russia has repeatedly denied it has any plans to launch a military operation in Ukraine.

"This video can not be played Watch: The moment Durst is sentenced to life in prison for murder Millionaire convicted murderer Robert Durst has died in prison at the age of 78, according to his lawyer. Durst died as a California prisoner after being convicted in September of killing his friend Susan Berman. He murdered her to stop her talking to police about his wife's disappearance. Police believe he killed two others. The US real estate heir turned fugitive unwittingly confessed in an HBO crime documentary series about himself. Durst's lawyer, Chip Lewis, confirmed that he died at the San Joaquin General Hospital while in the custody of the California Department of Corrections. He said that his death was due to ""natural causes"" and that he had been suffering from numerous medical issues. Durst was sentenced to life in prison in October for the 2000 killing of Berman, who was his long-time confidante and spokeswoman. His trial had been delayed for more than a year due to the Covid pandemic. Two days after his sentencinghe was admitted to hospital with Covid and placed on a ventilator, according to his trial lawyer. Durst - whose family have owned a series of New York City skyscrapers, including an investment in the World Trade Center - was investigated after a recording of him confessing was used in the 2015 HBO documentary series The Jinx. ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course,""he was recorded saying to himselfin an apparent hot mic moment. Robert Durst: A life of violence Prosecutors say that he also murdered his neighbour, Morris Black, while living as a fugitive in Texas nine months after killing Berman. Durst claimed to have shot him accidentally, before going on to dismember his body and dump the parts in Galveston Bay. After a 45-day manhunt, he was arrested for shoplifting a chicken sandwich from a grocery store in Pennsylvania, only a few miles from where he attended university. He was found with thousands of dollars in cash in his rental car, as well as cannabis and Black's driving licence. He claimed self-defence at his 2003 trial, and was acquitted after arguing that he fled because he thought his story would not be believed. Durst is also suspected in the 1982 death of his wife Kathie Durst, whose body has never been found. She was legally declared dead in 2017. He was formally indicted for her murder in November by the Westchester Country District Attorney's office in New York. ""After 40 years spent seeking justice for her death, IÂ knowÂ how upsetting this newsÂ must be for Kathleen Durst'sÂ family,"" District Attorney MiriamÂ Rocah said in a statement on Monday. ""WeÂ hadÂ hoped to allow them the opportunity to see Mr Durst finally face chargesÂ for Kathleen's murderÂ because we know that all families never stop wanting closure, justice and accountability."" The office added that more information on the Kathie Durst case would be released to the public in the coming days.

Diddly Squat Farm, in Chadlington, is the site of the former Top Gear host's Amazon Studios series, Clarkson's Farm. A West Oxfordshire District Council (WODC) planning sub-committee declined the plan on Monday. Clarkson said it would enhance farming and tourism in the area and the refusal meant a ""very bad day for farming"". When asked how frustrated he was, he said: ""Very, and so will all the local farmers."" Planning officers saidthe proposal to renovate a lambing shedinto a restaurant was out of keeping with the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The shed was built in 2020 after a new flock of sheep was bought to diversify the farm business. It has now been merged with another local farmer's flock, the council said. But council officers said the building has since been used, without planning permission, as a cafe and a bar area. Clarkson posed for selfies with fans as he arrived for a village meeting in September Ahead of Monday's meeting, a total of 53 objections were received by the council, along with 12 letters of support. Chadlington Parish Council said it held a public meeting in November to decide its view on the ""divisive and contentious"" application but a vote was inconclusive. In September Clarkson admitted the farm had ""swamped"" the village but said it led to increased trade for businesses. He hosted a residents' meeting on the farm that month, when heunveiled plans for the new restaurant. Clarksontold Jeremy Vine: ""There is more traffic, yes, but there is more business. ""The village shop is doing better, the cafe in the village, the pub in the village - they are all doing better. ""They are swamped with people but they are swamped with people spending money."" The authority said it ""recently"" served Clarkson's farm with a planning contravention notice after allegations that products sold in its shop were not grown, reared or produced on the farm, or from other local producers. If proved, that would be in contravention of a condition agreed when that was givenplanning permission in November 2019, the council said.

"As many as 100 people were invited to a ""bring-your-own-booze"" drinks event in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown, it is understood. Witnesses have told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended the gathering on 20 May 2020. But Boris Johnson has declined to say whether he was among those there. The Metropolitan Police said it was in contact with the government over ""widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches"" of Covid rules. Labour has been granted an urgent question in the Commons at 12:30 GMT to push for answers from a minister. The party's leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said the prime minister needed to ""come clean"" about the gathering. Addressing Mr Johnson on Twitter, he added: ""Your deflections and distractions are absurd. Not only did you know about the parties in Downing Street, you attended them. ""Stop lying to the British public."" Laura Kuenssberg analysis: No escape for No 10 The list of alleged government lockdown gatherings What rules would the Downing Street party have broken? Anemail, revealed by ITV News,,externalinvited people to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening"". It was sent when lockdown restrictions were still in place. Twelve days later - on 1 June - rules in England were relaxed to allow groups of up to six people to meet outside. Health Minister Edward Argar told BBC Breakfast he understood the ""anger, sadness and upset many will feel about these allegations"". But he said it was ""important"" to allow an investigation to take place into gatherings in Downing Street before coming to any conclusions. However, former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told the BBC the PM did not need to wait for an inquiry to answer whether he attended. ""I can't understand if the prime minister attended why on earth he thought that was the right thing to do,"" she added. ""People are furious about this, what they gave up, how difficult it was, what happened to their own lives, and to think that this was going on? It is indefensible, it cannot be defended."" This video can not be played Watch former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson call the No 10 party ""indefensible"" Downing Street declined to comment as it said the gathering - like others reported to have happened under coronavirus restrictions during 2020 - is now being looked into as part of an ongoing independent investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray. A Met spokesperson said the force was ""aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at Downing Street on 20 May 2020 and is in contact with the Cabinet Office"", which oversees government policy. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister ""cannot run and cannot hide"" from the allegations. He added: ""It speaks to a rotten culture at the heart of this government and the rotten culture begins with the person in charge."" Hannah Brady said her father's death certificate had been signed on the same day the drinks took place The Wednesday 20 May gathering first came to light last week ina blog,externalby the PM's former adviser Dominic Cummings. ITV News has now published what appears to be the full email invitation sent on behalf of Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. It has the subject line ""Socially Distanced Drinks! [OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE-No 10 ONLY]"". ""After what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening,"" the email says. ""Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze."" Two eyewitnesses have told the BBC they saw Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie at the event in the garden. And sources have said that several Downing Street members of staff voiced concerns about drinks happening, with one claiming: ""There were conversations about the email being really unwise."" Another added: ""I remember people saying, 'What the hell?'"" Others said a long table had been set up in the garden for the event. A message sent by one Downing Street staffer to another at the time, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin (Reynolds) encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Another asked: ""Is this for real?"" In a Twitter post on the day of the gathering, when it was 25C (77F) in London, the Metropolitan Police reminded people they could only relax or exercise outside on their own, with their own household or one person from another household.

On the same day as the gathering, the then Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, gave theDowning Street coronavirus briefing,external- in which he confirmedanother 363 people,externalin the UK had died with Covid in the previous 24 hours. At the briefing, he told the public: ""You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay two metres apart."" ""Is this for real?"" That might be your reaction to what we know now - that one of Boris Johnson's most senior aides emailed around 100 staff in Downing Street for outdoor drinks in May 2020, during the intense early emergency of lockdown. Martin Reynolds, the principal private secretary (for how much longer?) invited dozens and dozens of staffers to drinks in the garden, socially distanced, but to many people's minds, in contradiction to the very strict and very clear public guidance to the public at the time that banned socialising in any form. A jog with a friend in the park or a solitary trudge along the same canal path was just about it. ""Is this for real?"" was in fact the reaction of one of the staff who was gobsmacked to receive the email, written down in black and white, in a message to another official shared at the time. Another, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Those exchanges make it pretty clear that there were concerns at the time. Yet the event went ahead, with, I'm told, around 30 people in attendance. Read more from Laurahere. You could only meet one other person from another household outdoors, with advice to remain 2m (6ft) apart Larger gatherings with people from other households were not allowed, apart from a few exceptions, such as funerals, or where the gathering was essential for work purposes People who could work from home were still asked to do so - but people could attend workplaces if necessary Schools, non-essential shops, hospitality venues and hairdressers remained closed Hannah Brady, spokeswoman for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said her father had died four days before the email was sent. ""At the time, everyone would have known that going to a party was wrong, so how can those running the country have thought it was OK?"" she asked. ""To make matters worse, in September last year I sat in that same garden, looked the prime minister in the eyes and told him how my dad had died,"" Ms Brady added. ""He told me he had done everything he could to protect my dad, knowing that he had partied in that same spot the very day that dad's death certificate was signed. It makes me feel sick to think about it."" Separately last month, the Guardian published a photograph taken on 15 May 2020 - five days before the drinks took place - showing the prime minister, his wife and 17 staff membersin the Downing Street garden. Mr Johnson has said this was not a party and those present were ""people at work, talking about work"". Sue Gray is heading the investigation into gatherings that took place in 2020 In December, the prime minister asked Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, to investigate a series of allegations about events taking place in government buildings in 2020 despite coronavirus restrictions being in force. Mr Case stepped down after suggestions one of the parties had happened in his own office and the investigation was passed to Sue Gray, another senior civil servant. Asked during a visit to a vaccination centre in west London if he had attended the 20 May drinks, the prime minister said: ""All that, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray."" His minister, Mr Argar, echoed that on Tuesday, saying Ms Gray would be allowed to look into the allegations ""without fear or favour"", and would ""want to act quickly"". He added: ""It is right whatever flows from thatâ¦ [if] people are shown to have broken the rules, appropriate disciplinary action is taken."" The prime minister's official spokesman added: ""There is an independent process going on to look into this, led by Sue Gray, and I can't comment further while that is taking place."" Tory MP Michael Fabricant told the BBC he understood the anger over the gathering, but claimed the PM was showing ""loyalty"" to his staff. ""Boris and others felt sorry for people who were working long, long hours and they were simply spilling out from their own offices into a secure garden, which is an integral part of No 10 Downing Street,"" he said. ""And you know what? I'd rather have a prime minister who felt for his staff and all those hardworking people than some cold fish who really couldn't care [at all] about them."" But Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson has consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us. ""He is trying to get officials to take the fall for his own mistakes, but he sets the tone for the way Downing Street and the rest of government operates."" The SNP called on the Tories to ""show [the PM] the door"" or risk ""the whole party will be tainted by the lies, arrogance and rule-breaking"", while the Liberal Democrats demanded a police investigation. The government has faced intense pressure over events held in an around Downing Street. 10 May 2020 Boris Johnson announced a plan to take the “first careful steps"" out of the lockdown that began in March 2020. But he said people should continue to ""obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them”. Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising. 15 May 2020 A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said, “those people were at work talking about work”. 20 May 2020 About 100 people were invited by email to “socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden” on behalf of the prime ministerâs principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended. Boris Johnson has confirmed he attended the event, saying he was there for 25 minutes and “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. 18 June 2020 A gathering took place in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. 19 June 2020 On Boris Johnsonâs birthday, up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to present the prime minister with a birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday, according to a report by ITV News. No 10 said staff had “gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes”. Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. 17 July 2020 Boris Johnson announced plans for a “significant return to normality"" in England by Christmas ""through targeted, local action” instead of national lockdowns. But he added that the timetable relied on “every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly”. 5 November 2020 With cases of coronavirus rising again, the prime minister told people in England that “we are once again asking you to stay at home” as a new national lockdown began. He said people should only leave their homes “for work if you canât work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies”. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes. 13 November 2020 Sources told the BBC that Downing Street staff members attended a gathering with Carrie Johnson in the flat where she and the prime minister live. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place. 27 November 2020 A leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources. 2 December 2020 The second national lockdown ended after four weeks but Boris Johnson replaced those restrictions with “tough tiers to keep this virus down”. London was placed in tier two, which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless “reasonably necessary” for work purposes. 10 December 2020 The Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited. 14 December 2020 The Conservative Party has admitted that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party's London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee. The Metropolitan Police is to speak to two people who attended the party. 15 December 2020 Multiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo - published by the Sunday Mirror - showed Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing. 16 December 2020 London moved into the highest tier of restrictions and Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time, said it was important “everyone is cautious” ahead of the festive period. The Department for Transport apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices that day, calling it “inappropriate"" and an ""error of judgment” by staff. 17 December 2020 A leaving party was held at the Cabinet Office for the outgoing head of the civil service Covid taskforce - the team responsible for drawing up coronavirus restrictions. Kate Josephs, now chief executive of Sheffield City Council, apologised for the event, saying she was “truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result”. 18 December 2020 Downing Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street. However, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister's then-press secretary Allegra Stratton, joking about reports of an event, saying: “This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.” 14 January 2021 A gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of two private secretaries. 12 April 2021 Lockdown restrictions were eased in England, with pubs and restaurants allowed to reopen with outdoor service only. However, working from home continued to be recommended and socialising indoors with people from other households was not allowed. Meeting others outdoors was limited to groups of six people or two households. 16 April 2021 Two parties were held by Downing Street staff at No 10, the night before Prince Philip's funeral. One of the events was a leaving party for the PM's then director of communications James Slack, who has apologised for the event and acknowledged it “should not have happened at the time that it did”. Boris Johnson was not at either party.

"This video can not be played ""We are coming for you"" - Michael Gove's warning to firms that cut corners, sought to profiteer and mis-sold dangerous products No leaseholder living in a building higher than 11m, around four to six storeys high, ""will ever face any costs"" for fixing dangerous cladding, the housing secretary has said. Michael Gove has given firms until March to agree how to help leaseholders trapped in ""unsellable homes"". He warned those who had mis-sold unsafe cladding or cut corners on homes that the government was ""coming for you"". The cladding crisis has left many with crippling bills to fix unsafe homes. Residents in blocks 11-18m high had been ineligible for government support to remove unsafe cladding, but Mr Gove confirmed on Monday that the government was scrapping ""the proposal for loans and long term debt for medium rise leaseholders"". Why is cladding unsafe and what is it costing residents? ""No leaseholder living in a building above 11m, will ever face any costs for fixing dangerous cladding,"" Mr Gove told the House of Commons. ""They are blameless and it is morally wrong that they should be asked to pay for the price."" The housing secretary said businesses who manufactured combustible cladding and insulation, ""many of whom have made vast profits"" at the height of the pandemic, ""must pay now, instead of leaseholders"". He added companies would have the chance ""to do the right thing"", but warned if necessary, the government would ""impose a solution upon them in law."" Following his speech, Labour's Lisa Nandy said it was a ""relief"" that were was a consensus that  ""blameless leaseholders must not pay"". However, the shadow housing secretary questioned what made Mr Gove think he could force developers ""who for four years have refused to do the right thing, to pay up"". Mr Gove said earlier some building companies had shown leadership and covered the costs but others ""had not shouldered their responsibilities."" Charlotte Meehan lives with her husband in an East London development that has a range of fire safety issues, including flammable cladding, combustible insulation and missing cavity barriers. She told the BBC she wanted to move to start a family, but it was impossible: ""We are completely trapped, we can't sell our flat it's worthless."" Leaseholders have had to pay Â£500,000 over the last two years for a 24-hour waking watch, resulting in their service charge doubling. The development's reserves for essential repairs are also ""seriously depleted"" leaving it in a ""dire state of disrepair"". She welcomed Mr Gove's plan but said it felt ""half baked"" as it does not cover non-cladding fire safety issues or interim costs. ""People are going bankrupt and losing their homes based on interim costs,"" she said. In the wake of the Grenfell fire, which killed 72 people in 2017, flammable cladding and other fire safety defects were discovered in hundreds of blocks of flats across the UK. The government has so far only promised to pay to remove cladding in taller buildings, not those between 11m and 18m high. Removing cladding can cost millions of pounds per block, with the cost often being borne by individual flat owners, under the leasehold system in England and Wales. In his letter, Mr Gove warned he would take ""all steps necessary"" to make developers pay including: Restricting access to government funding and future procurements Using planning powers or changing the tax system Or, if the industry fails to take responsibility, imposing ""a solution in law"". The time limit for leaseholders to sue builders over defective flats will also be extended from six to 30 years. by Sarah Corker, BBC business correspondent It's estimated that the average cladding bill is around Â£40,000 per leaseholder. Some people have received bills of more than Â£200,000, more than they paid for their flats in the first place. This package of measures is expected to relieve some of that financial pressure, but it by no means covers everything. These proposals ignore non-cladding problems - leaseholders fear they will still face astronomical bills to fix defective insulation, missing fire breaks and flammable balconies. Campaigners say it makes no sense to make buildings ""half safe"". This is a partial solution. It is also unclear how the government intends to force or coerce developers to pay to fix these faults. There is no new money from Treasury. If Michael Gove is unsuccessful in recouping money from the industry it will have to come out of existing departmental budgets. So that is less money for levelling up and less money for home building as a consequence. Developers often argue that they met building regulations at the time and should not be liable for the cost of removing unsafe cladding. However, some, such as housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, have already promised to foot the bill for issues at their buildings. Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, said that as well as developers and government, other parties should now contribute. ""[That] not least [would include] material manufacturers who designed, tested and sold materials that developers purchased in good faith that were later proved to not be fit for purpose,"" he said. This video can not be played 'My life is on hold until the crisis is over' Liz Vick from Salford is disappointed by the government's plans. She lives in a low-rise building which faces fires safety issues due to missing cavity barriers, not cladding, so she's still on the hook to pay the costs. ""We are still waiting for a big bill for remediation,"" she told the BBC. ""It could be anything between Â£50,000 to Â£100,000 per leaseholder."" She says such a large bill would push her into bankruptcy and the constant stress has affected her mental health. ""The only way to describe it is you're living in survival mode 24/7, whether that be in terms of facing financial ruin, or burning to death in a building,"" she said. ""We can't move on with our lives, we can't afford to start a family. My life has been on hold and will be on hold until this crisis is over."" The government says the vast majority of lower height buildings are safe and others that do have combustible cladding may also be safe or could be made safe using existing fire safety measures such as sprinklers or alarms. However, it said a small number have unsafe cladding that must be addressed. Cladding campaigners have long asked that the government accept both the principle that buildings under 18.5m ought to be covered and that leaseholders should not have to pay. They cautiously welcomed the government's new proposals, but warned they ignored the costs of fixing other fire safety issues discovered on thousands of tower blocks across UK. There is also no help for the many buildings under 11m high with dangerous cladding.

"As many as 100 people were invited to a ""bring-your-own-booze"" drinks event in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown, it is understood. Witnesses have told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended the gathering on 20 May 2020. But Boris Johnson has declined to say whether he was among those there. The Metropolitan Police said it was in contact with the government over ""widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches"" of Covid rules. Labour has been granted an urgent question in the Commons at 12:30 GMT to push for answers from a minister. The party's leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said the prime minister needed to ""come clean"" about the gathering. Addressing Mr Johnson on Twitter, he added: ""Your deflections and distractions are absurd. Not only did you know about the parties in Downing Street, you attended them. ""Stop lying to the British public."" Laura Kuenssberg analysis: No escape for No 10 The list of alleged government lockdown gatherings What rules would the Downing Street party have broken? Anemail, revealed by ITV News,,externalinvited people to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening"". It was sent when lockdown restrictions were still in place. Twelve days later - on 1 June - rules in England were relaxed to allow groups of up to six people to meet outside. Health Minister Edward Argar told BBC Breakfast he understood the ""anger, sadness and upset many will feel about these allegations"". But he said it was ""important"" to allow an investigation to take place into gatherings in Downing Street before coming to any conclusions. However, former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told the BBC the PM did not need to wait for an inquiry to answer whether he attended. ""I can't understand if the prime minister attended why on earth he thought that was the right thing to do,"" she added. ""People are furious about this, what they gave up, how difficult it was, what happened to their own lives, and to think that this was going on? It is indefensible, it cannot be defended."" This video can not be played Watch former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson call the No 10 party ""indefensible"" Downing Street declined to comment as it said the gathering - like others reported to have happened under coronavirus restrictions during 2020 - is now being looked into as part of an ongoing independent investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray. A Met spokesperson said the force was ""aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at Downing Street on 20 May 2020 and is in contact with the Cabinet Office"", which oversees government policy. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister ""cannot run and cannot hide"" from the allegations. He added: ""It speaks to a rotten culture at the heart of this government and the rotten culture begins with the person in charge."" Hannah Brady said her father's death certificate had been signed on the same day the drinks took place The Wednesday 20 May gathering first came to light last week ina blog,externalby the PM's former adviser Dominic Cummings. ITV News has now published what appears to be the full email invitation sent on behalf of Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. It has the subject line ""Socially Distanced Drinks! [OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE-No 10 ONLY]"". ""After what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening,"" the email says. ""Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze."" Two eyewitnesses have told the BBC they saw Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie at the event in the garden. And sources have said that several Downing Street members of staff voiced concerns about drinks happening, with one claiming: ""There were conversations about the email being really unwise."" Another added: ""I remember people saying, 'What the hell?'"" Others said a long table had been set up in the garden for the event. A message sent by one Downing Street staffer to another at the time, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin (Reynolds) encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Another asked: ""Is this for real?"" In a Twitter post on the day of the gathering, when it was 25C (77F) in London, the Metropolitan Police reminded people they could only relax or exercise outside on their own, with their own household or one person from another household.

On the same day as the gathering, the then Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, gave theDowning Street coronavirus briefing,external- in which he confirmedanother 363 people,externalin the UK had died with Covid in the previous 24 hours. At the briefing, he told the public: ""You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay two metres apart."" ""Is this for real?"" That might be your reaction to what we know now - that one of Boris Johnson's most senior aides emailed around 100 staff in Downing Street for outdoor drinks in May 2020, during the intense early emergency of lockdown. Martin Reynolds, the principal private secretary (for how much longer?) invited dozens and dozens of staffers to drinks in the garden, socially distanced, but to many people's minds, in contradiction to the very strict and very clear public guidance to the public at the time that banned socialising in any form. A jog with a friend in the park or a solitary trudge along the same canal path was just about it. ""Is this for real?"" was in fact the reaction of one of the staff who was gobsmacked to receive the email, written down in black and white, in a message to another official shared at the time. Another, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Those exchanges make it pretty clear that there were concerns at the time. Yet the event went ahead, with, I'm told, around 30 people in attendance. Read more from Laurahere. You could only meet one other person from another household outdoors, with advice to remain 2m (6ft) apart Larger gatherings with people from other households were not allowed, apart from a few exceptions, such as funerals, or where the gathering was essential for work purposes People who could work from home were still asked to do so - but people could attend workplaces if necessary Schools, non-essential shops, hospitality venues and hairdressers remained closed Hannah Brady, spokeswoman for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said her father had died four days before the email was sent. ""At the time, everyone would have known that going to a party was wrong, so how can those running the country have thought it was OK?"" she asked. ""To make matters worse, in September last year I sat in that same garden, looked the prime minister in the eyes and told him how my dad had died,"" Ms Brady added. ""He told me he had done everything he could to protect my dad, knowing that he had partied in that same spot the very day that dad's death certificate was signed. It makes me feel sick to think about it."" Separately last month, the Guardian published a photograph taken on 15 May 2020 - five days before the drinks took place - showing the prime minister, his wife and 17 staff membersin the Downing Street garden. Mr Johnson has said this was not a party and those present were ""people at work, talking about work"". Sue Gray is heading the investigation into gatherings that took place in 2020 In December, the prime minister asked Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, to investigate a series of allegations about events taking place in government buildings in 2020 despite coronavirus restrictions being in force. Mr Case stepped down after suggestions one of the parties had happened in his own office and the investigation was passed to Sue Gray, another senior civil servant. Asked during a visit to a vaccination centre in west London if he had attended the 20 May drinks, the prime minister said: ""All that, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray."" His minister, Mr Argar, echoed that on Tuesday, saying Ms Gray would be allowed to look into the allegations ""without fear or favour"", and would ""want to act quickly"". He added: ""It is right whatever flows from thatâ¦ [if] people are shown to have broken the rules, appropriate disciplinary action is taken."" The prime minister's official spokesman added: ""There is an independent process going on to look into this, led by Sue Gray, and I can't comment further while that is taking place."" Tory MP Michael Fabricant told the BBC he understood the anger over the gathering, but claimed the PM was showing ""loyalty"" to his staff. ""Boris and others felt sorry for people who were working long, long hours and they were simply spilling out from their own offices into a secure garden, which is an integral part of No 10 Downing Street,"" he said. ""And you know what? I'd rather have a prime minister who felt for his staff and all those hardworking people than some cold fish who really couldn't care [at all] about them."" But Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson has consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us. ""He is trying to get officials to take the fall for his own mistakes, but he sets the tone for the way Downing Street and the rest of government operates."" The SNP called on the Tories to ""show [the PM] the door"" or risk ""the whole party will be tainted by the lies, arrogance and rule-breaking"", while the Liberal Democrats demanded a police investigation. The government has faced intense pressure over events held in an around Downing Street. 10 May 2020 Boris Johnson announced a plan to take the “first careful steps"" out of the lockdown that began in March 2020. But he said people should continue to ""obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them”. Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising. 15 May 2020 A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said, “those people were at work talking about work”. 20 May 2020 About 100 people were invited by email to “socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden” on behalf of the prime ministerâs principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended. Boris Johnson has confirmed he attended the event, saying he was there for 25 minutes and “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. 18 June 2020 A gathering took place in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. 19 June 2020 On Boris Johnsonâs birthday, up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to present the prime minister with a birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday, according to a report by ITV News. No 10 said staff had “gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes”. Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. 17 July 2020 Boris Johnson announced plans for a “significant return to normality"" in England by Christmas ""through targeted, local action” instead of national lockdowns. But he added that the timetable relied on “every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly”. 5 November 2020 With cases of coronavirus rising again, the prime minister told people in England that “we are once again asking you to stay at home” as a new national lockdown began. He said people should only leave their homes “for work if you canât work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies”. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes. 13 November 2020 Sources told the BBC that Downing Street staff members attended a gathering with Carrie Johnson in the flat where she and the prime minister live. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place. 27 November 2020 A leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources. 2 December 2020 The second national lockdown ended after four weeks but Boris Johnson replaced those restrictions with “tough tiers to keep this virus down”. London was placed in tier two, which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless “reasonably necessary” for work purposes. 10 December 2020 The Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited. 14 December 2020 The Conservative Party has admitted that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party's London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee.

"Ikea has cut sick pay for unvaccinated staff who need to self-isolate because of Covid exposure and in some cases for workers who test positive. The retail giant acknowledged it was an ""emotive topic"" but said its policy had to evolve with changing circumstances. From this week, sick pay cuts will be implemented at Wessex Water and in the US several major companies have started penalising unjabbed workers. It comes as firms struggle with mass staff absences and rising costs. At Ikea unvaccinated workers, who do not have mitigating circumstances, who test positive will be paid in line with company sick pay. Unvaccinated workers, without mitigating circumstances and required to isolate owing to being identified as a close contact, could now receive as little as Â£96.35 a week - the Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) minimum. Self-isolation guidance for people who have been jabbedwas relaxed last month.,externalHowever, there was no change to the guidance for unvaccinated people who come into contact with positive cases, and who must still self-isolate for 10 full days after their date of exposure to the virus. Covid staff shortages will continue into New Year Ikea to raise prices as supply problems bite Average wages at Ikea are between about Â£400 and Â£450, depending on location and, as is the case at many companies, staff get enhanced sick pay. The move was first reported bythe Mail on Sunday.,external Ikea, which employs about 10,000 people in the UK, said in a statement: ""Fully vaccinated co-workers or those that are unvaccinated owing to mitigating circumstances which, for example, could include pregnancy or other medical grounds, will receive full pay. ""Unvaccinated co-workers without mitigating circumstances that test positive with Covid will be paid full company sick pay in line with our company absence policy. ""Unvaccinated co-workers without mitigating circumstances who have been identified as close contacts of a positive case will be paid Statutory Sick Pay."" In England, people who are vaccinated with at least two doses need not self-isolate if they have been in close contact with someone infected with Covid. Unvaccinated people contacted through the government's test-and-trace system must still isolate by law. Many companies complained of labour shortages throughout 2021, and now are seeing mass absences due to the more infectious Omicron Covid strain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated on Monday that the data continued to show those people most seriously affected by Omicron remained the unvaccinated. Wessex Water's sick pay rule change comes into force this week. Any employee without at least one Covid-19 vaccination - who does not have a valid medical reason - or does not have a confirmed vaccination appointment, will get only statutory sick pay if required to self-isolate due to close contact with someone testing positive. A Wessex Water spokesperson said absences have soared this year: ""The vast majority of our workforce has been vaccinated and it's important as a company providing essential services with key worker employees, the remainder get vaccinated to protect themselves, customers and their colleagues. ""Absences due to Covid have doubled in the last week, so we need everyone to be available so we can continue to provide uninterrupted essential water and sewerage services."" The company said that throughout the pandemic it had not furloughed staff and those self-isolating had received full pay. Last year, supermarket Morrisons cut sick pay terms, while several companies, including banking giant Citigroup, introduced a ""no jab, no job"" policy. Delta Airlines imposed a surcharge on unvaccinated staff members of its healthcare plan. Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), told the BBC there were pros and cons with changing sick pay terms for certain workers. It could encourage staff to get vaccinated, but others might be less likely to test themselves or self-isolate because they could not afford time off work at the statutory rate of about Â£96. His organisation's official guidance was not to differentiate between employees, as the consequences could be complex and there were potential legal problems. ""You would have to manage it on a case-by-case basis because of legal risks,"" Mr Willmott said. Earlier this month, David Josephs, boss of food importer and retailer All Greens, told the BBC that staff at some firms were ignoring Covid rules for financial reasons. ""We know that in our sector a lot of staff do not get paid sick pay. Ours do - but staff who are on limited contracts or on minimum wage cannot afford to be off work,"" he said. Employment lawyer Sarah Ozanne, of CMS, also warned of complex legal issues and said striking the right balance was difficult. ""This action [by Ikea] seems more of a reaction to staff shortages and how to manage them than any intended 'discrimination' of the unvaccinated,"" she said. ""But employers should consider whether their actions are proportionate as a means of achieving the aim of getting employees back into work.""

"The Queen will be 96 when the main Jubilee celebrations kick off in June Buckingham Palace has unveiled the full line-up of celebrations to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee this year. Street parties, a concert with some of the world's ""biggest entertainment stars"" and a chance to see the Queen's homes up close are all part of the plan to mark her 70 years on the throne. It will culminate in a four-day UK bank holiday weekend from 2 to 5 June. The first event begins on Monday, with a competition to invent a new pudding to celebrate the Queen's reign. Finalists will be judged by an expert panel including Dame Mary Berry and Masterchef's Monica Galetti. The winning recipe will be made available to the public and the pudding will be enjoyed at Big Jubilee Lunches during the bank holiday weekend. What do people buy the Queen for her Jubilee? On 6 February the Queen will become the first British monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee, marking a 70-year reign. A series of celebrations will take place throughout the year. The Queen marked 50 years on the throne in 2002, with the Duke of Edinburgh by her side She rode in the Golden State Coach as part of the celebrations As with the Queen's Golden and Diamond Jubilees, the first week in June has been chosen for the celebratory weekend, with the summer offering a better chance of good weather than February. To create the four-day weekend, the late May Spring Bank Holiday will be moved to 2 June and an additional one-off bank holiday on 3 June created. It is not clear which events the Queen will attend herself. She was advised by her medical team to rest for several weeks after an overnight hospital stay in October. The majority of the jubilee duties will probably be given to the rest of the family, including the heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales, alongside his wife the Duchess of Cornwall. This jubilee will be the Queen's first without her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, who died in April last year. It's going to be puddings, parties, parades and pageants, in honour of the platinum jubilee. There isn't really a template for celebrating a British monarch's 70-year reign, because it's not happened before. The nearest was Queen Victoria's 63 years and elsewhere you have to go back to 18th-Century France and Louis XIV, who reached 72 years. In this current bleak mid-Covid winter, the jubilee offers the warming prospect of a four-day bank holiday in June, with concerts, parties and pubs open until 1am. The ""platinum pudding"" competition is in the tradition of royal-related dishes like Coronation Chicken, invented for the Queen's coronation in 1953. So expect a lot of trifling puns. The celebrations are also a reminder of how much the Queen has been a constant figure. A recent study showed for 85% of the population she's the only monarch they've ever known. This will be a marker for memories in many people's lives. Prince Philip joined the Queen on board the Royal Barge Spirit of Chartwell as part of the celebrations in 2012 The Queen taking part in a Silver Jubilee walkabout in 1977 During the festivities, Sandringham and Balmoral will be open for visitors to enjoy the celebrations across the long weekend in June. And during the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, a River Of Hope - made up of 200 silk flags decorated with images of hope drawn by children - will make its way along the Mall in central London. As part of the Queen's Green Canopy initiative, some 60,000 trees have already been planted to mark the year, as people have been encouraged to""plant a tree for the jubilee"". On10 Januarythe Platinum Pudding Competition starts. Members of the public are invited to create a dish to dedicate to the Queen's reign. From12 to 15 May, more than 500 horses and 1,000 performers will take part in a 90-minute show at Windsor Castle, taking the audience on a journey through history from Elizabeth I to present day. The first day of the long weekend isThursday 2 Juneand will see Trooping the Colour held in full for the first time since the pandemic. There will be more than 1,400 parading soldiers, 200 horses and 400 musicians taking part. Tickets are available to the public from next weekon this site,external. Also that day, Platinum Jubilee beacons will be lit in more than 1,500 locations across the UK, the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and UK Overseas Territories. For the first time, the capital cities of Commonwealth countries will also light beacons. OnFriday 3 June- the second day of the Bank Holiday weekend - a Service of Thanksgiving for the Queen's reign will be held at St Paul's Cathedral. OnSaturday 4 Junethe Queen will be joined by members of the Royal Family at the Derby, held at Epsom Downs. There will also be a Platinum Party at Buckingham Palace, with members of the public invited to apply to attend a live concert. Performers have yet to be named, but it is billed as bringing together some of the world's biggest stars to celebrate the most significant moments from the Queen's seven-decade reign. The ballot for UK residents to secure tickets will be launched in February. OnSunday 5 Junepeople across the country will be invited to sit down together to take part in the Big Jubilee Lunch, with street parties held across the UK. That day's events will also include the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, which will feature 5,000 people from the UK and the Commonwealth performing around the area of Buckingham Palace. The palace promises ""pomp and ceremony, street arts, theatre, music, circus, costumes as well as cutting-edge visual technology"". Primary and secondary school children are invited tocreate a picture of their hopes and aspirations,externalfor the planet over the next 70 years. A selection of these will be transferred on to silk flags, which will carried by secondary school pupils in the pageant. InJuly, three displays marking the Queen's accession to the throne, the coronation and jubilees will be put on at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. It will include portraits as well as the jewellery and outfits worn for each occasion. What are your plans for the Jubilee?

"The application for Jeremy Clarkson's farm was turned down by West Oxfordshire District Council A planned new restaurant for TV personality Jeremy Clarkson's Oxfordshire farm has been refused permission.

"Boris Johnson says the government will ""look at the science"" over possibly cutting the minimum Covid isolation period from seven days to five And after newspaper reports that free lateral flow tests could end, the PM says we'll continue to use testing as an ""important line of defence"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove also denies the government plans to stop supplying free lateral flow tests, calling them vital The UK records another 142,224 coronavirus cases and 77 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Novak Djokovic's family have welcomed a court decision allowing him to stay in Australia and say he has already returned to the tennis court The tennis star hopes to defend his Australian Open title but the government could yet make another move to block his entry over his vaccination status Edited by James Clarke That's all from today's live page team. We'll be back tomorrow, bringing you all the Covid-related news, in the UK and around the world. Your live page writers today were Chris Giles, Victoria Lindrea and Mary O'Connor. The editors were James Clarke and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. Have a good evening. Monday's live page is nearly at an end. Here is a round-up of the main coronavirus-related stories we have covered today.    Students of Kakungulu Memorial Secondary school in the Ugandan capital Kampala attend a class Ofcom says it wonât investigate ITV's Lorraine showafter Dr Hilary Jones made an inaccurate statement about Covid-19 figures. The media watchdog received 3,833 complaints after he incorrectly said 90% of the Covid patients in hospital were unvaccinated - a figure that was more applicable to those in intensive care. The claim was made on 6 December. A clarification was aired two days later. Ofcom says it has ""told ITV that greater care should be taken by trusted medical experts when presenting facts and figures on public health issues"". The leader of Rotherham council has called for a return to remote meetings amid spiralling numbers of Covid-19 cases. Labour's Chris Read says it is ""perverse"" that meetings are taking place in person despite government guidance urging people to work from home due to the rapid spread of the Omicron Covid variant. Legislation allowing council meetings to be held virtually from April 2020 expired in May 2021. Speaking ahead of the next full council meeting on Wednesday, which will see 59 councillors plus staff, public and press meet at the town's Magna centre, Read says there's a ""cost and complication"" to in-person meetings. ""It seems wrong to me that the government are telling people to work from home where you can, but specifically saying you councillors can put your health at risk by going and all sitting together in one big room,"" he tellsthe Local Democracy Reporting Service. In the seven days to 3 January, Rotherham recorded 2,479 new infections per 100,000 people, above the England average of 1,758 cases. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities says councils should follow government guidance and that it will be ""responding shortly"" to evidence submitted regarding ""a longer-term decision about whether to make express provision for councils to meet remotely on a permanent basis"".

Novak Djokovic was tested in Serbia on 16 December - regulations in the country require people to isolate for 14 days following a positive Covid result More now on Novak Djokovic whoâs won a court battle in Australia overturning his visa cancellation. We know he sought a medical exemption from the country's strict Covid regulations on the basis that he'd contracted the infection in December. There have been questions over whether the tennis star broke Covid rules in his home country Serbia, apparently attending several public engagements in the days after his positive test. Our colleagues at Reality Check have compiled a timeline of events from what we know so far - you can read ithere. Almost half (46%) of teachers have been asked to cover lessons for absent colleagues, according to a poll by a teaching union. The survey of  nearly 7,000 NASUWT members in England suggests 23% say staff absences due to Covid-19 are having a major impact on their school, while 61% say they are having some impact. Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, describes the poll as ""concerning"". ""Our members are telling us that staff absences due to Covid-19 are having serious impacts on teaching and learning,"" he says. ""Higher rates of staff absence are making a very challenging situation much worse for schools struggling to maintain appropriate staffing levels without disrupting pupils' education. ""Whilst the start of term saw around one in 10 teachers absent due to coronavirus, these numbers are likely to increase in the absence of effective measures to ensure Covid-safety in classrooms."" Dr Roach adds: ""Urgent additional investment is needed in providing air filtration units to every classroom where they are needed. ""Ensuring good ventilation is vital to minimising further disruption to pupils' education."" A UK council is appealing for volunteers among its 30,000-strong workforce to help out in its 23 care homes amid staff shortages due to Covid. Derbyshire County Councilis looking for employees, who've had two Covid vaccines and their booster jab, to take on duties such as catering and laundry. Helen Jones, the council's executive director of adult social care and health, says âit is a real opportunity to make a huge difference and to help some of Derbyshire's most vulnerable people at this extraordinary time"". Staff from all areas of the council have been asked to take on shifts Latest vaccination data shows about 195,000 jabs were given yesterday, Sunday 9 January - including 22,205 first doses, 31,360 second doses and 141, 495 boosters -according to the latest government data.,external A total of 35,664,164 boosters or third doses have now been given across the UK - with PM Boris Johnson saying on Monday about 90% of the over-50s have now been boosted. The latest goverment data has revealed a further 142,224 positive Covid cases have been registered in the UK in the past 24 hours. In addition there were 77 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid in the previous 28 days. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Cabinet ministers received a Covid data
update earlier from England's Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty, with
sources describing the briefing as ""more positive"" than in recent
weeks. The BBC has been told the latest data showed key graphs depicting cases across English regions, admissions to Intensive Care Units and
hospitalisations appeared to be âflatteningâ. It's understood ministers were told by
scientists that next week they should be in a position to know whether Plan B
restrictions will be needed in England beyond 26
January, when they are expected to come to an end. Data showing the percentage of the
population testing positive in each of the four  nations stood at:  Sources present at the meeting described the
different percentages as ""marginal"" when factors such as population density,
geography and demographics were accounted for.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The man can see the car from his new home but cannot use or return it A man has racked up more than Â£1,000 in arrears
on a rental car in China, after a swift lockdown meant he was unable to return
it. Mr Liu lives in the northern city of Xiâan, and
rented a car on 17 December to move house. However, while moving his luggage, his community
went into swift lockdown, meaning he was not allowed out of his building
to return the car. Mr Liu told Houlang Video he wasnât told of
the developments mid-move, and epidemic-related personnel wouldnât even
let him go to his car. A lot of his luggage was still in it, and so he had to
ask a neighbour if he could borrow a duvet.  Mr Liu is still in lockdown, and is being charged by the minute for his vehicle. He has so far spent 10,279 yuan ($1,612; Â£1,188) on his car. His woes have generated significant attention on social media, and many Chinese are commenting online that they hope he can get the charge quashed. There have now been more than 2,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the city of Xiâan. An outbreak began in early December, and some13 million residents have been in strict lockdown for over two weeks. The Global Times newspaper says the figures in this outbreak make it theâlargest domestically-transmitted epidemic since [the] Wuhan outbreakâ,external.

The Port of Dover's chief executive, Doug Bannister, is calling on the government forsupport in getting hold of daily lateral flow Covid testsfor its workers. Last week, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said100,000 key workers would receive daily tests. The port has applied to be included in the scheme saying staff are key workers who maintain ""the operations and the critical flow of goods into the nation"". The Cabinet Office says the UK Health Security Agency will run the testing programme with employers and further details would be set out in the coming days. Earlier, the family of men's tennis champion Novak Djokovic held a press conference after he won a court battle to overturn the cancellation of his Australian visa on Covid vaccination grounds. Watch the video below for the moment they ended the press conference after being asked aboutthe world number one testing positive for Covid on 16 December yet still attending public events in the days that followed. This video can not be played Novak Djokovic family end press conference after Covid event question As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world, there have beenmore than 300 million confirmed casesand more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. Meanwhile, nearly every nation in the world is now administering Covid vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 89 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark, the UK and Bahrain have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. Downing Street has denied the Prime Minister's principal private secretary - Martin Reynolds - is to be moved to another position, following claims he invited staff to drinks in the garden of No 10 in May 2020 - in apparent breach of Covid rules. ""The Prime Minister has full confidence in his team. There is no change in that post,"" the PM's official spokesman says. He refused to respond to reports Boris Johnson had attended the same event. ""There is an independent process going on to look into this, led by Sue Gray, and I can't comment further while that is taking place,"" the spokesman says. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says Johnson would have ""serious questions to answer"" if found to have attended a lockdown-breaking party but adds: ""We need to let the inquiry take its course, see what the findings are."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst The National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest, will hold the opening and closing ceremonies of Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics Over the weekend, there was an outbreak of the Omicron variant in the eastern Chinese city of Tianjin. As a result,Chinese media are reporting that Chinaâs nearby capital city Beijing is âon high alertâ,external. It is now 25 days until the Beijing Winter Olympics, and there are fears thatcases could spill over from Tianjin,external, given that âmany people commute from there to work in Beijingâ. Train tickets from Tianjin to Beijing have today been suspended, and people are being urged not to travel between the two cities. In recent months, the media have sought to reassure people that the Olympic Games will go ahead without a hitch, stressing heightened Covid-19 preventative measures are in place. Tickets will not be made available to overseas spectators,externalat this yearâs event and visitors to the Games will be part of a âclosed loopâ, meaning they are kept separate from locals. China Daily notes that as part of this, designated transport is being arranged for Olympic-related personnel. The Beijing Traffic Management Bureau has factored in that there could be circumstances where people might come into contact. It saysshould a traffic accident occur in the city,external, âcitizens should keep their distance and avoid contact with the vehicle or its occupantsâ. BBC Radio 5 Live Tim Richards, chief executive of the Vue Cinemas chain, says
reducing the isolation period from seven days to five would help his cinema
staff return to work faster. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 LiveâsWake Up To Money podcast, he says
the chain has had to âborrow some staff from one cinema to put in another,â due
to absences. âWeâve been hit by Omicron as hard as
everyone else has, itâs meant a lot of work,"" he adds. Vue employs almost 5,000 staff at 91
sites across the UK and Ireland. But thereâs some positive news for the industry, which has been
hit hard in the pandemic. Cinema visits are up 68% compared with 2020, according to Cinema UK. And there were five million admissions in the week up to
Christmas. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent A Whitehall source has denied the government is working on a
plan for living with Covid in the long term. But there's speculation about what changes that might eventually
entail. The government has already said in its Autumn and Winter Covid
plan for this year that one day lateral flow tests will have to be paid for by
businesses and individuals that benefit from them, rather than by the taxpayer.
But the source said ministers had not even made a decision about when such a
decision might be needed. Then there's the period you must isolate for if you have Covid. That's
already come down from an automatic 10 days to seven if you test negative on
the final two, after ministers asked the UK Health Security Agency to review the
rule. But the UKHSA estimates there's a 10-30% chance than an individual
could still be infectious on day six, so it's not coming down any further for now.
That's why ministers who are enthusiastic about people being stuck home for
less time say they would support a change if the science changed. There are other questions, such as when does the government stop
financial support for people who are isolating? You don't get a cheque if
you've got a cold, the argument goes. The PM's adviser-turned-enemy Dominic Cummings wrote
in a blog post last week that the government had also failed to plan ahead for
future variants. These issues will come to a head in the build-up to 26 January when
the measures implementing Plan B in England are due to expire. And again at the
end of March when the legislation that underpins much of the response to Covid
lapses, too. Labour leader Keir Starmer pictured on a visit to Northumberland last month. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he would back a reduction in the Covid isolation period if the science supports it. Speaking to reporters via video call from isolation after testing positive for the virus last week, Sir Keir says he will be ""guided by the science"" and would be ""inclined to support"" a cut in the quarantine period if scientists and medical experts say it was safe. He adds there are ""many, many people in isolation - including myself - who will be watching that science very, very carefully"". Sir Keir insists the continued supply of free lateral flow tests is ""absolutely crucial at the moment"" and warns against withdrawing ""one of the most important means of our protection at the moment"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlierthe UK would continue to use testing""as one of our most important lines of defence for as long as is necessary"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Johnson: Price rises making life very tough for people Boris Johnson says he is talking to Chancellor Rishi Sunak over how the government could help people with soaring energy prices. The prime minister is under pressure to act on rising household costs, ahead of further increases to capped bills due in April. Some Tory MPs want cuts to green levies and VAT to help bring bills down. Labour, which also wants VAT suspended, is also demanding higher taxes on oil and gas producers. The party said it would use money from the hike to pay for more generous government payments to help poorer households with costs. On Monday, Mr Johnson said ministers understood the difficulties people were facing, and ""we're certainly looking at what we can do"". Labour demands energy firm tax hike to cut bills How can the government solve the energy crisis? How much would a VAT cut on my energy bill save? Trade body Energy UK predicts bills willsurge by up to 50% in April, when the change to the price cap, due to be determined in February, kicks in. There have been warnings that average households could pay about Â£700 more per year, amid surging prices for wholesale gas worldwide. Speaking to reporters during a visit to a vaccination centre, Mr Johnson said rises were driven by ""general inflationary pressure"" caused by the world economy ""coming back from Covid"". But he added: ""We've got to help people, particularly people in low incomes, we've got to help people with the cost of their fuel - and that's what we're going to do."" Asked if he would meet Mr Sunak this week, he replied: ""I've been meeting the chancellor constantly. I met the chancellor last night to talk about it."" Mr Johnson is expected to hold his first formal discussions with Mr Sunak on Monday, although a decision on what to do is not expected imminently. Experts predict average annual bills could rise to about Â£2,000 next year Labour is warning that the expected increase in the energy cap from April, in combination with theplanned risein National Insurance on workers, will lead to a cost of living crisis for many households. The party wants an extra Â£3.5bn to be spent on thewarm homes discount,external, increasing it from Â£140 to Â£400 per year, while doubling the number of households eligible to 9.3 million, around a third of the UK total. It also wants to remove the 5% VAT rate on domestic energy bills from April for 12 months, which it says would produce an annual saving of Â£89 per household. The party says it would pay for its plans through a year-long 10 percentage point increase to the corporation tax paid by North Sea energy producers on their profits, along with higher-than expected VAT receipts due to inflation. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party was ""stepping into the vacuum of leadership that the government has left with a plan to actually reduce bills"". Labour will attempt to use a Commons debate on Tuesday to set up a vote next month on its proposals for a VAT cut. The Liberal Democrats have also called for a windfall tax on energy firms to pay more more generous support for poorer households, and its ten-year plan to improve home insulation. Speaking last week, leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""It can't be right that a few energy fat cats are raking it in from record gas prices while millions of people can't even afford to heat their homes."" But Oil and Gas UK, the offshore industry body, has said a windfall tax would offer ""false hope"" to consumers and damage the UK economy. It argues the levy would not benefit users long-term, as it would discourage investment and make the UK more reliant on imported foreign gas. Mr Johnson is also facing pressure from his own side to take action in the coming weeks to reduce costs on households. Earlier this month, agroup of Tory MPs and peerscalled on him to scrap VAT on bills, and review levies to help for government environmental policies. On Monday, Conservative MP Stephen McPartland told the BBC the government should introduce ""credit facilities"" to help energy firms cope with volatile prices. He said this would allow firms to draw on financial reserves as an alternative to increasing thegovernment cap on standard tariffsfrom April. Last week, Mr Johnson argued that a VAT cut would be too ""blunt"" a tool, as it would affect all households, including the richest, rather than targeting those most in need.

"As many as 100 people were invited to a ""bring-your-own-booze"" drinks event in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown, it is understood. Witnesses have told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended the gathering on 20 May 2020. But Boris Johnson has declined to say whether he was among those there. The Metropolitan Police said it was in contact with the government over ""widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches"" of Covid rules. Labour has been granted an urgent question in the Commons at 12:30 GMT to push for answers from a minister. The party's leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said the prime minister needed to ""come clean"" about the gathering. Addressing Mr Johnson on Twitter, he added: ""Your deflections and distractions are absurd. Not only did you know about the parties in Downing Street, you attended them. ""Stop lying to the British public."" Laura Kuenssberg analysis: No escape for No 10 The list of alleged government lockdown gatherings What rules would the Downing Street party have broken? Anemail, revealed by ITV News,,externalinvited people to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening"". It was sent when lockdown restrictions were still in place. Twelve days later - on 1 June - rules in England were relaxed to allow groups of up to six people to meet outside. Health Minister Edward Argar told BBC Breakfast he understood the ""anger, sadness and upset many will feel about these allegations"". But he said it was ""important"" to allow an investigation to take place into gatherings in Downing Street before coming to any conclusions. However, former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told the BBC the PM did not need to wait for an inquiry to answer whether he attended. ""I can't understand if the prime minister attended why on earth he thought that was the right thing to do,"" she added. ""People are furious about this, what they gave up, how difficult it was, what happened to their own lives, and to think that this was going on? It is indefensible, it cannot be defended."" This video can not be played Watch former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson call the No 10 party ""indefensible"" Downing Street declined to comment as it said the gathering - like others reported to have happened under coronavirus restrictions during 2020 - is now being looked into as part of an ongoing independent investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray. A Met spokesperson said the force was ""aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at Downing Street on 20 May 2020 and is in contact with the Cabinet Office"", which oversees government policy. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister ""cannot run and cannot hide"" from the allegations. He added: ""It speaks to a rotten culture at the heart of this government and the rotten culture begins with the person in charge."" Hannah Brady said her father's death certificate had been signed on the same day the drinks took place The Wednesday 20 May gathering first came to light last week ina blog,externalby the PM's former adviser Dominic Cummings. ITV News has now published what appears to be the full email invitation sent on behalf of Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. It has the subject line ""Socially Distanced Drinks! [OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE-No 10 ONLY]"". ""After what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening,"" the email says. ""Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze."" Two eyewitnesses have told the BBC they saw Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie at the event in the garden. And sources have said that several Downing Street members of staff voiced concerns about drinks happening, with one claiming: ""There were conversations about the email being really unwise."" Another added: ""I remember people saying, 'What the hell?'"" Others said a long table had been set up in the garden for the event. A message sent by one Downing Street staffer to another at the time, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin (Reynolds) encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Another asked: ""Is this for real?"" In a Twitter post on the day of the gathering, when it was 25C (77F) in London, the Metropolitan Police reminded people they could only relax or exercise outside on their own, with their own household or one person from another household.

On the same day as the gathering, the then Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, gave theDowning Street coronavirus briefing,external- in which he confirmedanother 363 people,externalin the UK had died with Covid in the previous 24 hours. At the briefing, he told the public: ""You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay two metres apart."" ""Is this for real?"" That might be your reaction to what we know now - that one of Boris Johnson's most senior aides emailed around 100 staff in Downing Street for outdoor drinks in May 2020, during the intense early emergency of lockdown. Martin Reynolds, the principal private secretary (for how much longer?) invited dozens and dozens of staffers to drinks in the garden, socially distanced, but to many people's minds, in contradiction to the very strict and very clear public guidance to the public at the time that banned socialising in any form. A jog with a friend in the park or a solitary trudge along the same canal path was just about it. ""Is this for real?"" was in fact the reaction of one of the staff who was gobsmacked to receive the email, written down in black and white, in a message to another official shared at the time. Another, shown to the BBC, said: ""Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?"" Those exchanges make it pretty clear that there were concerns at the time. Yet the event went ahead, with, I'm told, around 30 people in attendance. Read more from Laurahere. You could only meet one other person from another household outdoors, with advice to remain 2m (6ft) apart Larger gatherings with people from other households were not allowed, apart from a few exceptions, such as funerals, or where the gathering was essential for work purposes People who could work from home were still asked to do so - but people could attend workplaces if necessary Schools, non-essential shops, hospitality venues and hairdressers remained closed Hannah Brady, spokeswoman for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said her father had died four days before the email was sent. ""At the time, everyone would have known that going to a party was wrong, so how can those running the country have thought it was OK?"" she asked. ""To make matters worse, in September last year I sat in that same garden, looked the prime minister in the eyes and told him how my dad had died,"" Ms Brady added. ""He told me he had done everything he could to protect my dad, knowing that he had partied in that same spot the very day that dad's death certificate was signed. It makes me feel sick to think about it."" Separately last month, the Guardian published a photograph taken on 15 May 2020 - five days before the drinks took place - showing the prime minister, his wife and 17 staff membersin the Downing Street garden. Mr Johnson has said this was not a party and those present were ""people at work, talking about work"". Sue Gray is heading the investigation into gatherings that took place in 2020 In December, the prime minister asked Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, to investigate a series of allegations about events taking place in government buildings in 2020 despite coronavirus restrictions being in force. Mr Case stepped down after suggestions one of the parties had happened in his own office and the investigation was passed to Sue Gray, another senior civil servant. Asked during a visit to a vaccination centre in west London if he had attended the 20 May drinks, the prime minister said: ""All that, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray."" His minister, Mr Argar, echoed that on Tuesday, saying Ms Gray would be allowed to look into the allegations ""without fear or favour"", and would ""want to act quickly"". He added: ""It is right whatever flows from thatâ¦ [if] people are shown to have broken the rules, appropriate disciplinary action is taken."" The prime minister's official spokesman added: ""There is an independent process going on to look into this, led by Sue Gray, and I can't comment further while that is taking place."" Tory MP Michael Fabricant told the BBC he understood the anger over the gathering, but claimed the PM was showing ""loyalty"" to his staff. ""Boris and others felt sorry for people who were working long, long hours and they were simply spilling out from their own offices into a secure garden, which is an integral part of No 10 Downing Street,"" he said. ""And you know what? I'd rather have a prime minister who felt for his staff and all those hardworking people than some cold fish who really couldn't care [at all] about them."" But Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson has consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us. ""He is trying to get officials to take the fall for his own mistakes, but he sets the tone for the way Downing Street and the rest of government operates."" The SNP called on the Tories to ""show [the PM] the door"" or risk ""the whole party will be tainted by the lies, arrogance and rule-breaking"", while the Liberal Democrats demanded a police investigation. The government has faced intense pressure over events held in an around Downing Street. 10 May 2020 Boris Johnson announced a plan to take the “first careful steps"" out of the lockdown that began in March 2020. But he said people should continue to ""obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them”. Legal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising. 15 May 2020 A photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said, “those people were at work talking about work”. 20 May 2020 About 100 people were invited by email to “socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden” on behalf of the prime ministerâs principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended. Boris Johnson has confirmed he attended the event, saying he was there for 25 minutes and “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. 18 June 2020 A gathering took place in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. 19 June 2020 On Boris Johnsonâs birthday, up to 30 people gathered in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to present the prime minister with a birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday, according to a report by ITV News. No 10 said staff had “gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes”. Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. 17 July 2020 Boris Johnson announced plans for a “significant return to normality"" in England by Christmas ""through targeted, local action” instead of national lockdowns. But he added that the timetable relied on “every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly”. 5 November 2020 With cases of coronavirus rising again, the prime minister told people in England that “we are once again asking you to stay at home” as a new national lockdown began. He said people should only leave their homes “for work if you canât work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies”. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes. 13 November 2020 Sources told the BBC that Downing Street staff members attended a gathering with Carrie Johnson in the flat where she and the prime minister live. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place. 27 November 2020 A leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources. 2 December 2020 The second national lockdown ended after four weeks but Boris Johnson replaced those restrictions with “tough tiers to keep this virus down”. London was placed in tier two, which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless “reasonably necessary” for work purposes. 10 December 2020 The Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited. 14 December 2020 The Conservative Party has admitted that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party's London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee. The Metropolitan Police is to speak to two people who attended the party. 15 December 2020 Multiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo - published by the Sunday Mirror - showed Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing. 16 December 2020 London moved into the highest tier of restrictions and Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time, said it was important “everyone is cautious” ahead of the festive period. The Department for Transport apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices that day, calling it “inappropriate"" and an ""error of judgment” by staff. 17 December 2020 A leaving party was held at the Cabinet Office for the outgoing head of the civil service Covid taskforce - the team responsible for drawing up coronavirus restrictions. Kate Josephs, now chief executive of Sheffield City Council, apologised for the event, saying she was “truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result”. 18 December 2020 Downing Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street. However, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister's then-press secretary Allegra Stratton, joking about reports of an event, saying: “This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.” 14 January 2021 A gathering was held in No 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of two private secretaries. 12 April 2021 Lockdown restrictions were eased in England, with pubs and restaurants allowed to reopen with outdoor service only. However, working from home continued to be recommended and socialising indoors with people from other households was not allowed. Meeting others outdoors was limited to groups of six people or two households. 16 April 2021 Two parties were held by Downing Street staff at No 10, the night before Prince Philip's funeral. One of the events was a leaving party for the PM's then director of communications James Slack, who has apologised for the event and acknowledged it “should not have happened at the time that it did”. Boris Johnson was not at either party.

Here is a round-up of the main coronavirus-related stories we have covered today.    Students of Kakungulu Memorial Secondary school in the Ugandan capital Kampala attend a class Ofcom says it wonât investigate ITV's Lorraine showafter Dr Hilary Jones made an inaccurate statement about Covid-19 figures. The media watchdog received 3,833 complaints after he incorrectly said 90% of the Covid patients in hospital were unvaccinated - a figure that was more applicable to those in intensive care. The claim was made on 6 December. A clarification was aired two days later. Ofcom says it has ""told ITV that greater care should be taken by trusted medical experts when presenting facts and figures on public health issues"". The leader of Rotherham council has called for a return to remote meetings amid spiralling numbers of Covid-19 cases. Labour's Chris Read says it is ""perverse"" that meetings are taking place in person despite government guidance urging people to work from home due to the rapid spread of the Omicron Covid variant. Legislation allowing council meetings to be held virtually from April 2020 expired in May 2021. Speaking ahead of the next full council meeting on Wednesday, which will see 59 councillors plus staff, public and press meet at the town's Magna centre, Read says there's a ""cost and complication"" to in-person meetings. ""It seems wrong to me that the government are telling people to work from home where you can, but specifically saying you councillors can put your health at risk by going and all sitting together in one big room,"" he tellsthe Local Democracy Reporting Service. In the seven days to 3 January, Rotherham recorded 2,479 new infections per 100,000 people, above the England average of 1,758 cases. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities says councils should follow government guidance and that it will be ""responding shortly"" to evidence submitted regarding ""a longer-term decision about whether to make express provision for councils to meet remotely on a permanent basis"".

Novak Djokovic was tested in Serbia on 16 December - regulations in the country require people to isolate for 14 days following a positive Covid result More now on Novak Djokovic whoâs won a court battle in Australia overturning his visa cancellation. We know he sought a medical exemption from the country's strict Covid regulations on the basis that he'd contracted the infection in December. There have been questions over whether the tennis star broke Covid rules in his home country Serbia, apparently attending several public engagements in the days after his positive test. Our colleagues at Reality Check have compiled a timeline of events from what we know so far - you can read ithere. Almost half (46%) of teachers have been asked to cover lessons for absent colleagues, according to a poll by a teaching union. The survey of  nearly 7,000 NASUWT members in England suggests 23% say staff absences due to Covid-19 are having a major impact on their school, while 61% say they are having some impact. Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, describes the poll as ""concerning"". ""Our members are telling us that staff absences due to Covid-19 are having serious impacts on teaching and learning,"" he says. ""Higher rates of staff absence are making a very challenging situation much worse for schools struggling to maintain appropriate staffing levels without disrupting pupils' education. ""Whilst the start of term saw around one in 10 teachers absent due to coronavirus, these numbers are likely to increase in the absence of effective measures to ensure Covid-safety in classrooms."" Dr Roach adds: ""Urgent additional investment is needed in providing air filtration units to every classroom where they are needed. ""Ensuring good ventilation is vital to minimising further disruption to pupils' education."" A UK council is appealing for volunteers among its 30,000-strong workforce to help out in its 23 care homes amid staff shortages due to Covid. Derbyshire County Councilis looking for employees, who've had two Covid vaccines and their booster jab, to take on duties such as catering and laundry.

The latest goverment data has revealed a further 142,224 positive Covid cases have been registered in the UK in the past 24 hours. In addition there were 77 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid in the previous 28 days. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Cabinet ministers received a Covid data
update earlier from England's Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty, with
sources describing the briefing as ""more positive"" than in recent
weeks. The BBC has been told the latest data showed key graphs depicting cases across English regions, admissions to Intensive Care Units and
hospitalisations appeared to be âflatteningâ. It's understood ministers were told by
scientists that next week they should be in a position to know whether Plan B
restrictions will be needed in England beyond 26
January, when they are expected to come to an end. Data showing the percentage of the

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The man can see the car from his new home but cannot use or return it A man has racked up more than Â£1,000 in arrears
on a rental car in China, after a swift lockdown meant he was unable to return
it. Mr Liu lives in the northern city of Xiâan, and
rented a car on 17 December to move house. However, while moving his luggage, his community
went into swift lockdown, meaning he was not allowed out of his building
to return the car. Mr Liu told Houlang Video he wasnât told of
the developments mid-move, and epidemic-related personnel wouldnât even
let him go to his car. A lot of his luggage was still in it, and so he had to
ask a neighbour if he could borrow a duvet.  Mr Liu is still in lockdown, and is being charged by the minute for his vehicle. He has so far spent 10,279 yuan ($1,612; Â£1,188) on his car. His woes have generated significant attention on social media, and many Chinese are commenting online that they hope he can get the charge quashed. There have now been more than 2,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the city of Xiâan. An outbreak began in early December, and some13 million residents have been in strict lockdown for over two weeks. The Global Times newspaper says the figures in this outbreak make it theâlargest domestically-transmitted epidemic since [the] Wuhan outbreakâ,external.

The Port of Dover's chief executive, Doug Bannister, is calling on the government forsupport in getting hold of daily lateral flow Covid testsfor its workers. Last week, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said100,000 key workers would receive daily tests. The port has applied to be included in the scheme saying staff are key workers who maintain ""the operations and the critical flow of goods into the nation"". The Cabinet Office says the UK Health Security Agency will run the testing programme with employers and further details would be set out in the coming days. Earlier, the family of men's tennis champion Novak Djokovic held a press conference after he won a court battle to overturn the cancellation of his Australian visa on Covid vaccination grounds. Watch the video below for the moment they ended the press conference after being asked aboutthe world number one testing positive for Covid on 16 December yet still attending public events in the days that followed. This video can not be played Novak Djokovic family end press conference after Covid event question As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world, there have beenmore than 300 million confirmed casesand more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. Meanwhile, nearly every nation in the world is now administering Covid vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 89 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark, the UK and Bahrain have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. Downing Street has denied the Prime Minister's principal private secretary - Martin Reynolds - is to be moved to another position, following claims he invited staff to drinks in the garden of No 10 in May 2020 - in apparent breach of Covid rules. ""The Prime Minister has full confidence in his team. There is no change in that post,"" the PM's official spokesman says. He refused to respond to reports Boris Johnson had attended the same event. ""There is an independent process going on to look into this, led by Sue Gray, and I can't comment further while that is taking place,"" the spokesman says. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says Johnson would have ""serious questions to answer"" if found to have attended a lockdown-breaking party but adds: ""We need to let the inquiry take its course, see what the findings are."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst The National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest, will hold the opening and closing ceremonies of Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics Over the weekend, there was an outbreak of the Omicron variant in the eastern Chinese city of Tianjin. As a result,Chinese media are reporting that Chinaâs nearby capital city Beijing is âon high alertâ,external. It is now 25 days until the Beijing Winter Olympics, and there are fears thatcases could spill over from Tianjin,external, given that âmany people commute from there to work in Beijingâ. Train tickets from Tianjin to Beijing have today been suspended, and people are being urged not to travel between the two cities. In recent months, the media have sought to reassure people that the Olympic Games will go ahead without a hitch, stressing heightened Covid-19 preventative measures are in place. Tickets will not be made available to overseas spectators,externalat this yearâs event and visitors to the Games will be part of a âclosed loopâ, meaning they are kept separate from locals. China Daily notes that as part of this, designated transport is being arranged for Olympic-related personnel. The Beijing Traffic Management Bureau has factored in that there could be circumstances where people might come into contact. It saysshould a traffic accident occur in the city,external, âcitizens should keep their distance and avoid contact with the vehicle or its occupantsâ. BBC Radio 5 Live Tim Richards, chief executive of the Vue Cinemas chain, says
reducing the isolation period from seven days to five would help his cinema
staff return to work faster. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 LiveâsWake Up To Money podcast, he says
the chain has had to âborrow some staff from one cinema to put in another,â due
to absences. âWeâve been hit by Omicron as hard as
everyone else has, itâs meant a lot of work,"" he adds. Vue employs almost 5,000 staff at 91
sites across the UK and Ireland. But thereâs some positive news for the industry, which has been
hit hard in the pandemic. Cinema visits are up 68% compared with 2020, according to Cinema UK. And there were five million admissions in the week up to
Christmas. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent A Whitehall source has denied the government is working on a
plan for living with Covid in the long term. But there's speculation about what changes that might eventually
entail. The government has already said in its Autumn and Winter Covid
plan for this year that one day lateral flow tests will have to be paid for by
businesses and individuals that benefit from them, rather than by the taxpayer.
But the source said ministers had not even made a decision about when such a
decision might be needed. Then there's the period you must isolate for if you have Covid. That's
already come down from an automatic 10 days to seven if you test negative on
the final two, after ministers asked the UK Health Security Agency to review the
rule. But the UKHSA estimates there's a 10-30% chance than an individual
could still be infectious on day six, so it's not coming down any further for now.
That's why ministers who are enthusiastic about people being stuck home for
less time say they would support a change if the science changed. There are other questions, such as when does the government stop
financial support for people who are isolating? You don't get a cheque if
you've got a cold, the argument goes. The PM's adviser-turned-enemy Dominic Cummings wrote
in a blog post last week that the government had also failed to plan ahead for
future variants. These issues will come to a head in the build-up to 26 January when
the measures implementing Plan B in England are due to expire. And again at the
end of March when the legislation that underpins much of the response to Covid
lapses, too. Labour leader Keir Starmer pictured on a visit to Northumberland last month. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he would back a reduction in the Covid isolation period if the science supports it. Speaking to reporters via video call from isolation after testing positive for the virus last week, Sir Keir says he will be ""guided by the science"" and would be ""inclined to support"" a cut in the quarantine period if scientists and medical experts say it was safe. He adds there are ""many, many people in isolation - including myself - who will be watching that science very, very carefully"". Sir Keir insists the continued supply of free lateral flow tests is ""absolutely crucial at the moment"" and warns against withdrawing ""one of the most important means of our protection at the moment"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlierthe UK would continue to use testing""as one of our most important lines of defence for as long as is necessary"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played ""We are coming for you"" - Michael Gove's warning to firms that cut corners, sought to profiteer and mis-sold dangerous products No leaseholder living in a building higher than 11m, around four to six storeys high, ""will ever face any costs"" for fixing dangerous cladding, the housing secretary has said. Michael Gove has given firms until March to agree how to help leaseholders trapped in ""unsellable homes"". He warned those who had mis-sold unsafe cladding or cut corners on homes that the government was ""coming for you"". The cladding crisis has left many with crippling bills to fix unsafe homes. Residents in blocks 11-18m high had been ineligible for government support to remove unsafe cladding, but Mr Gove confirmed on Monday that the government was scrapping ""the proposal for loans and long term debt for medium rise leaseholders"". Why is cladding unsafe and what is it costing residents? ""No leaseholder living in a building above 11m, will ever face any costs for fixing dangerous cladding,"" Mr Gove told the House of Commons. ""They are blameless and it is morally wrong that they should be asked to pay for the price."" The housing secretary said businesses who manufactured combustible cladding and insulation, ""many of whom have made vast profits"" at the height of the pandemic, ""must pay now, instead of leaseholders"". He added companies would have the chance ""to do the right thing"", but warned if necessary, the government would ""impose a solution upon them in law."" Following his speech, Labour's Lisa Nandy said it was a ""relief"" that were was a consensus that  ""blameless leaseholders must not pay"". However, the shadow housing secretary questioned what made Mr Gove think he could force developers ""who for four years have refused to do the right thing, to pay up"". Mr Gove said earlier some building companies had shown leadership and covered the costs but others ""had not shouldered their responsibilities."" Charlotte Meehan lives with her husband in an East London development that has a range of fire safety issues, including flammable cladding, combustible insulation and missing cavity barriers. She told the BBC she wanted to move to start a family, but it was impossible: ""We are completely trapped, we can't sell our flat it's worthless."" Leaseholders have had to pay Â£500,000 over the last two years for a 24-hour waking watch, resulting in their service charge doubling. The development's reserves for essential repairs are also ""seriously depleted"" leaving it in a ""dire state of disrepair"". She welcomed Mr Gove's plan but said it felt ""half baked"" as it does not cover non-cladding fire safety issues or interim costs. ""People are going bankrupt and losing their homes based on interim costs,"" she said. In the wake of the Grenfell fire, which killed 72 people in 2017, flammable cladding and other fire safety defects were discovered in hundreds of blocks of flats across the UK. The government has so far only promised to pay to remove cladding in taller buildings, not those between 11m and 18m high. Removing cladding can cost millions of pounds per block, with the cost often being borne by individual flat owners, under the leasehold system in England and Wales. In his letter, Mr Gove warned he would take ""all steps necessary"" to make developers pay including: Restricting access to government funding and future procurements Using planning powers or changing the tax system Or, if the industry fails to take responsibility, imposing ""a solution in law"". The time limit for leaseholders to sue builders over defective flats will also be extended from six to 30 years. by Sarah Corker, BBC business correspondent It's estimated that the average cladding bill is around Â£40,000 per leaseholder. Some people have received bills of more than Â£200,000, more than they paid for their flats in the first place. This package of measures is expected to relieve some of that financial pressure, but it by no means covers everything. These proposals ignore non-cladding problems - leaseholders fear they will still face astronomical bills to fix defective insulation, missing fire breaks and flammable balconies. Campaigners say it makes no sense to make buildings ""half safe"". This is a partial solution. It is also unclear how the government intends to force or coerce developers to pay to fix these faults. There is no new money from Treasury. If Michael Gove is unsuccessful in recouping money from the industry it will have to come out of existing departmental budgets. So that is less money for levelling up and less money for home building as a consequence. Developers often argue that they met building regulations at the time and should not be liable for the cost of removing unsafe cladding. However, some, such as housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, have already promised to foot the bill for issues at their buildings. Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, said that as well as developers and government, other parties should now contribute. ""[That] not least [would include] material manufacturers who designed, tested and sold materials that developers purchased in good faith that were later proved to not be fit for purpose,"" he said. This video can not be played 'My life is on hold until the crisis is over' Liz Vick from Salford is disappointed by the government's plans. She lives in a low-rise building which faces fires safety issues due to missing cavity barriers, not cladding, so she's still on the hook to pay the costs. ""We are still waiting for a big bill for remediation,"" she told the BBC. ""It could be anything between Â£50,000 to Â£100,000 per leaseholder."" She says such a large bill would push her into bankruptcy and the constant stress has affected her mental health. ""The only way to describe it is you're living in survival mode 24/7, whether that be in terms of facing financial ruin, or burning to death in a building,"" she said. ""We can't move on with our lives, we can't afford to start a family. My life has been on hold and will be on hold until this crisis is over."" The government says the vast majority of lower height buildings are safe and others that do have combustible cladding may also be safe or could be made safe using existing fire safety measures such as sprinklers or alarms. However, it said a small number have unsafe cladding that must be addressed. Cladding campaigners have long asked that the government accept both the principle that buildings under 18.5m ought to be covered and that leaseholders should not have to pay. They cautiously welcomed the government's new proposals, but warned they ignored the costs of fixing other fire safety issues discovered on thousands of tower blocks across UK. There is also no help for the many buildings under 11m high with dangerous cladding.

Before the UK left the EU, users were able to use their calls, texts, and data allowance in their mobile plans in any EU country after the bloc removed roaming charges in 2017. However, the EU trade deal of December 2020 gave mobile operators the option of reintroducing charges.

Virgin Media O2 - the company that owns the Virgin Mobile and O2 networks - said a family of four going abroad for two weeks could see an extra Â£100 on their bill, based on analysis of rates from other providers. ""We're starting the year by giving our customers some certainty: we will not be reintroducing roaming fees in Europe for customers on O2 or Virgin Mobile,"" said Gareth Turpin, chief commercial officer. ""With many Brits now looking to plan a trip abroad, we've got our customers covered and extra roaming charges will be one less thing to worry about."" Vodafone plans to bring back roaming charges at the end of January, while EE is set to in March. Both networks delayed reintroducing the charges earlier due to testing and technical issues respectively. Meanwhile, Three is to introduce fees in May. Customers who joined or upgraded with EE after 7 July 7 2021 face a Â£2 daily roaming charge in EU countries, while Vodafone will charge the same fee for people who joined the network after 11 August 11 or upgraded or renewed their contract. However, both companies will offer deals to avoid the fee, with EE customers able to buy a 30-day roaming pass for Â£10 and Vodafone users able to pay Â£1 a day for an eight or 15-day pass. Three will bring in the Â£2 daily charge for people who joined or upgraded after 1 October 2021. Sue Davies, head of consumer protection policy at Which?, said it was ""reassuring"" that Virgin Media O2 had offered some certainty to customers. ""As the UK continues to negotiate trade deals, it should take the opportunity to lower the cost of roaming for consumers travelling around the world,"" she added.

"The Covid restrictions in place across Scotland are helping to reduce the spread of the Omicron variant, a government adviser has said. An update on thecurrent restrictionswill be given by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at Holyrood on Tuesday. But national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch says measures such as the closure of nightclubs are making a difference. The Scottish government has faced criticism that the rules are too tough. The latestScottish government Covid report,externalshows average daily cases in Scotland (2,824 per one million population in the week to 6 January) was higher than in England (2,615 per one million) which has fewer Covid restrictions. But Prof Leitch points out that Scotland's rates are well below Wales and Northern Ireland, adding that it is the ""worrying"" increases in Covid hospitalisations which should be the focus. Virus hospital patients increase by 50% in a week One million cases - but what's the true figure? What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Speaking on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme, he said the restrictions regime in place ""is protecting people"" despite the scale of infection rates. He added: ""Should we still be protecting the public from these case rates if they are just going to go anyway? ""I think yes is the answer to that. I think the protections reduce the size of the wave and they also potentially elongate the wave to allow you to get more people vaccinated and spread the hospitalisations and intensive care cases out over a longer period. ""That's got to be good. Now that is not always good if you own a pub or a nursery and people are having to self-isolate, so it's a real balance in there between the number of cases, the numbers off work but I still think it is the right thing to do to try and reduce that case rate."" The hospitality trade has been required to introduce a raft of changes as part of the latest Covid restrictions which are in force until 17 January Prof Leitch also revealed ministers will begin giving out separate figures for positive Covid cases caught on both lateral flow and PCR tests. This follows changes announced last week which meanpeople who have no symptoms but record a positive lateral flow test result will no longer have to go for a PCR test. Peter Duthie, chief executive of the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow, told BBC Scotland his business has lost about Â£2m in revenue as a result of the latest restrictions with events such as the Irn Bru Carnival, which would have attracted 150,000 people in the post-Christmas period, curtailed. He said: ""It's been a hugely challenging couple of years for the industry and just when a degree of fragile confidence was returning before Christmas we were then hit by this further lockdown. ""Events matter to people - whether it's sporting events, concerts, live exhibitions - they all play a big part in people's lives. ""We understand it's a challenging situation, what we're looking for is as much clarity as we can get on the circumstances in which we can reopen."" Meanwhile, Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, told Good Morning Scotland that the balance in managing harms throughout the pandemic had not been right. He said: ""I'm concerned why a lot of the evidence - such as the complete lack of necessity to keep us indoors because this virus does not transmit outdoors - was there from very early on and yet somehow, through the scientific advisory systems and the politicians, this didn't get translated into public health action. ""As a result we all spent a lot of time having our activities curtailed for very little effect and far too long in my view."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

Virgin Media O2 - the company that owns the Virgin Mobile and O2 networks - said a family of four going abroad for two weeks could see an extra Â£100 on their bill, based on analysis of rates from other providers. ""We're starting the year by giving our customers some certainty: we will not be reintroducing roaming fees in Europe for customers on O2 or Virgin Mobile,"" said Gareth Turpin, chief commercial officer. ""With many Brits now looking to plan a trip abroad, we've got our customers covered and extra roaming charges will be one less thing to worry about."" Vodafone plans to bring back roaming charges at the end of January, while EE is set to in March. Both networks delayed reintroducing the charges earlier due to testing and technical issues respectively. Meanwhile, Three is to introduce fees in May. Customers who joined or upgraded with EE after 7 July 7 2021 face a Â£2 daily roaming charge in EU countries, while Vodafone will charge the same fee for people who joined the network after 11 August 11 or upgraded or renewed their contract. However, both companies will offer deals to avoid the fee, with EE customers able to buy a 30-day roaming pass for Â£10 and Vodafone users able to pay Â£1 a day for an eight or 15-day pass. Three will bring in the Â£2 daily charge for people who joined or upgraded after 1 October 2021. Sue Davies, head of consumer protection policy at Which?, said it was ""reassuring"" that Virgin Media O2 had offered some certainty to customers. ""As the UK continues to negotiate trade deals, it should take the opportunity to lower the cost of roaming for consumers travelling around the world,"" she added. ""The UK and EU should also work to strike a deal on roaming charges to stop companies chipping away at the roaming benefits customers have become used to and to ensure the high charges people used to face do not return."" In April last year, a Â£31bn mergerbetween Virgin Media and O2 was approved,making it one of the the UK's largest entertainment and telecoms firms.

"Pregnant women are being urged not to delay getting their Covid jab or booster in a government campaign. More than 96% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid symptoms between May and October last year were unvaccinated, according to the UK Obstetric Surveillance System. The campaign will share testimonies of pregnant women who have had the jab on radio and social media. The government said the vaccine was safe and had no impact on fertility. How can I get my booster jab? Covid vaccines safe in pregnancy, data shows Mums who had Covid urge pregnant women to get jabs In December,the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation added pregnant women to the priority list for the vaccine, saying they were at heightened risk from Covid. Around one in five pregnant women admitted to hospital with the virus needed to be delivered pre-term to help them recover, and one in five of their babies needed care in the neonatal unit, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Since April 2021, mothers-to-be have been offered the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna jab. Around 84,000 pregnant women have received one dose and more than 80,000 have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine since then, the department said. At the beginning of the UK vaccine programme, the advice was for pregnant women to be offered vaccines if they were in a high-risk group or at high risk of exposure. Prof Lucy Chappell, chief scientific adviser to the DHSC, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a third of unvaccinated pregnant women with Covid-19 needed help with breathing and one in six were admitted to intensive care. ""We've also seen stillbirths and neonatal deaths in the latest wave,"" she said. Prof Chappell said the vaccine causes pregnant women to produce antibodies against the virus, which cross over to their babies and give them protection too. This video can not be played Watch: Sultana Ashiq's twins were born by Caesarean section while she was in a coma with Covid Dr Jen Jardine, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is seven months pregnant and has had her booster jab, said: ""Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident that the Covid-19 vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. ""I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me, if you haven't had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midwife if you still have questions and then book right away today."" The UK recorded 141,472 new cases on Sunday, as well as 97 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - although the number of deaths recorded over weekends tends to be lower because of reporting delays. The total number of cases over the past seven days is up 6.6% on the previous week, while the figure for deaths is up 30.9%. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, said he was confident the health service's frontline ""will hold"". However NHS services outside London will be stretched ""perilously thin"", he told the BBC's Sunday Morning show, adding: ""We shouldn't underestimate the degree of pressure that many trusts are seeing."" Meanwhile, daily testing of 100,000 critical workers in industries including food processing, transport and the border force is due to begin on Monday. On Sunday, Minister Nadhim Zahawi denied reports the government was planning to stop supplying free lateral flow tests, saying 425 million of them had been ordered in January. He also told the BBC cutting the self-isolation period for people who test positive to five dayswould ""certainly help"" with staff absences.

Students of Kakungulu Memorial Secondary school in the Ugandan capital Kampala attend a class Ofcom says it wonât investigate ITV's Lorraine showafter Dr Hilary Jones made an inaccurate statement about Covid-19 figures. The media watchdog received 3,833 complaints after he incorrectly said 90% of the Covid patients in hospital were unvaccinated - a figure that was more applicable to those in intensive care. The claim was made on 6 December. A clarification was aired two days later. Ofcom says it has ""told ITV that greater care should be taken by trusted medical experts when presenting facts and figures on public health issues"". The leader of Rotherham council has called for a return to remote meetings amid spiralling numbers of Covid-19 cases. Labour's Chris Read says it is ""perverse"" that meetings are taking place in person despite government guidance urging people to work from home due to the rapid spread of the Omicron Covid variant. Legislation allowing council meetings to be held virtually from April 2020 expired in May 2021. Speaking ahead of the next full council meeting on Wednesday, which will see 59 councillors plus staff, public and press meet at the town's Magna centre, Read says there's a ""cost and complication"" to in-person meetings. ""It seems wrong to me that the government are telling people to work from home where you can, but specifically saying you councillors can put your health at risk by going and all sitting together in one big room,"" he tellsthe Local Democracy Reporting Service. In the seven days to 3 January, Rotherham recorded 2,479 new infections per 100,000 people, above the England average of 1,758 cases. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities says councils should follow government guidance and that it will be ""responding shortly"" to evidence submitted regarding ""a longer-term decision about whether to make express provision for councils to meet remotely on a permanent basis"".

Novak Djokovic was tested in Serbia on 16 December - regulations in the country require people to isolate for 14 days following a positive Covid result More now on Novak Djokovic whoâs won a court battle in Australia overturning his visa cancellation. We know he sought a medical exemption from the country's strict Covid regulations on the basis that he'd contracted the infection in December. There have been questions over whether the tennis star broke Covid rules in his home country Serbia, apparently attending several public engagements in the days after his positive test. Our colleagues at Reality Check have compiled a timeline of events from what we know so far - you can read ithere. Almost half (46%) of teachers have been asked to cover lessons for absent colleagues, according to a poll by a teaching union. The survey of  nearly 7,000 NASUWT members in England suggests 23% say staff absences due to Covid-19 are having a major impact on their school, while 61% say they are having some impact. Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, describes the poll as ""concerning"". ""Our members are telling us that staff absences due to Covid-19 are having serious impacts on teaching and learning,"" he says. ""Higher rates of staff absence are making a very challenging situation much worse for schools struggling to maintain appropriate staffing levels without disrupting pupils' education. ""Whilst the start of term saw around one in 10 teachers absent due to coronavirus, these numbers are likely to increase in the absence of effective measures to ensure Covid-safety in classrooms."" Dr Roach adds: ""Urgent additional investment is needed in providing air filtration units to every classroom where they are needed. ""Ensuring good ventilation is vital to minimising further disruption to pupils' education."" A UK council is appealing for volunteers among its 30,000-strong workforce to help out in its 23 care homes amid staff shortages due to Covid. Derbyshire County Councilis looking for employees, who've had two Covid vaccines and their booster jab, to take on duties such as catering and laundry. Helen Jones, the council's executive director of adult social care and health, says âit is a real opportunity to make a huge difference and to help some of Derbyshire's most vulnerable people at this extraordinary time"".

The latest goverment data has revealed a further 142,224 positive Covid cases have been registered in the UK in the past 24 hours. In addition there were 77 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid in the previous 28 days. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Cabinet ministers received a Covid data
update earlier from England's Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty, with
sources describing the briefing as ""more positive"" than in recent
weeks. The BBC has been told the latest data showed key graphs depicting cases across English regions, admissions to Intensive Care Units and
hospitalisations appeared to be âflatteningâ. It's understood ministers were told by
scientists that next week they should be in a position to know whether Plan B
restrictions will be needed in England beyond 26

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The man can see the car from his new home but cannot use or return it A man has racked up more than Â£1,000 in arrears
on a rental car in China, after a swift lockdown meant he was unable to return
it. Mr Liu lives in the northern city of Xiâan, and
rented a car on 17 December to move house. However, while moving his luggage, his community
went into swift lockdown, meaning he was not allowed out of his building
to return the car. Mr Liu told Houlang Video he wasnât told of
the developments mid-move, and epidemic-related personnel wouldnât even
let him go to his car. A lot of his luggage was still in it, and so he had to
ask a neighbour if he could borrow a duvet.  Mr Liu is still in lockdown, and is being charged by the minute for his vehicle. He has so far spent 10,279 yuan ($1,612; Â£1,188) on his car. His woes have generated significant attention on social media, and many Chinese are commenting online that they hope he can get the charge quashed. There have now been more than 2,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the city of Xiâan. An outbreak began in early December, and some13 million residents have been in strict lockdown for over two weeks. The Global Times newspaper says the figures in this outbreak make it theâlargest domestically-transmitted epidemic since [the] Wuhan outbreakâ,external. SEE ALSO:Xiâan residents in lockdown trade goods for food amid shortage. The Port of Dover's chief executive, Doug Bannister, is calling on the government forsupport in getting hold of daily lateral flow Covid testsfor its workers. Last week, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said100,000 key workers would receive daily tests. The port has applied to be included in the scheme saying staff are key workers who maintain ""the operations and the critical flow of goods into the nation"". The Cabinet Office says the UK Health Security Agency will run the testing programme with employers and further details would be set out in the coming days. Earlier, the family of men's tennis champion Novak Djokovic held a press conference after he won a court battle to overturn the cancellation of his Australian visa on Covid vaccination grounds. Watch the video below for the moment they ended the press conference after being asked aboutthe world number one testing positive for Covid on 16 December yet still attending public events in the days that followed. This video can not be played Novak Djokovic family end press conference after Covid event question As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world, there have beenmore than 300 million confirmed casesand more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. Meanwhile, nearly every nation in the world is now administering Covid vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 89 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark, the UK and Bahrain have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. Downing Street has denied the Prime Minister's principal private secretary - Martin Reynolds - is to be moved to another position, following claims he invited staff to drinks in the garden of No 10 in May 2020 - in apparent breach of Covid rules. ""The Prime Minister has full confidence in his team. There is no change in that post,"" the PM's official spokesman says. He refused to respond to reports Boris Johnson had attended the same event. ""There is an independent process going on to look into this, led by Sue Gray, and I can't comment further while that is taking place,"" the spokesman says. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says Johnson would have ""serious questions to answer"" if found to have attended a lockdown-breaking party but adds: ""We need to let the inquiry take its course, see what the findings are."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst The National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest, will hold the opening and closing ceremonies of Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics Over the weekend, there was an outbreak of the Omicron variant in the eastern Chinese city of Tianjin. As a result,Chinese media are reporting that Chinaâs nearby capital city Beijing is âon high alertâ,external. It is now 25 days until the Beijing Winter Olympics, and there are fears thatcases could spill over from Tianjin,external, given that âmany people commute from there to work in Beijingâ. Train tickets from Tianjin to Beijing have today been suspended, and people are being urged not to travel between the two cities. In recent months, the media have sought to reassure people that the Olympic Games will go ahead without a hitch, stressing heightened Covid-19 preventative measures are in place. Tickets will not be made available to overseas spectators,externalat this yearâs event and visitors to the Games will be part of a âclosed loopâ, meaning they are kept separate from locals. China Daily notes that as part of this, designated transport is being arranged for Olympic-related personnel. The Beijing Traffic Management Bureau has factored in that there could be circumstances where people might come into contact. It saysshould a traffic accident occur in the city,external, âcitizens should keep their distance and avoid contact with the vehicle or its occupantsâ. BBC Radio 5 Live Tim Richards, chief executive of the Vue Cinemas chain, says
reducing the isolation period from seven days to five would help his cinema
staff return to work faster. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 LiveâsWake Up To Money podcast, he says
the chain has had to âborrow some staff from one cinema to put in another,â due
to absences. âWeâve been hit by Omicron as hard as
everyone else has, itâs meant a lot of work,"" he adds. Vue employs almost 5,000 staff at 91
sites across the UK and Ireland. But thereâs some positive news for the industry, which has been
hit hard in the pandemic. Cinema visits are up 68% compared with 2020, according to Cinema UK. And there were five million admissions in the week up to
Christmas. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent A Whitehall source has denied the government is working on a
plan for living with Covid in the long term. But there's speculation about what changes that might eventually
entail. The government has already said in its Autumn and Winter Covid
plan for this year that one day lateral flow tests will have to be paid for by
businesses and individuals that benefit from them, rather than by the taxpayer.
But the source said ministers had not even made a decision about when such a
decision might be needed. Then there's the period you must isolate for if you have Covid. That's
already come down from an automatic 10 days to seven if you test negative on
the final two, after ministers asked the UK Health Security Agency to review the
rule. But the UKHSA estimates there's a 10-30% chance than an individual
could still be infectious on day six, so it's not coming down any further for now.
That's why ministers who are enthusiastic about people being stuck home for
less time say they would support a change if the science changed. There are other questions, such as when does the government stop
financial support for people who are isolating? You don't get a cheque if
you've got a cold, the argument goes. The PM's adviser-turned-enemy Dominic Cummings wrote
in a blog post last week that the government had also failed to plan ahead for
future variants. These issues will come to a head in the build-up to 26 January when
the measures implementing Plan B in England are due to expire. And again at the
end of March when the legislation that underpins much of the response to Covid
lapses, too. Labour leader Keir Starmer pictured on a visit to Northumberland last month. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he would back a reduction in the Covid isolation period if the science supports it. Speaking to reporters via video call from isolation after testing positive for the virus last week, Sir Keir says he will be ""guided by the science"" and would be ""inclined to support"" a cut in the quarantine period if scientists and medical experts say it was safe. He adds there are ""many, many people in isolation - including myself - who will be watching that science very, very carefully"". Sir Keir insists the continued supply of free lateral flow tests is ""absolutely crucial at the moment"" and warns against withdrawing ""one of the most important means of our protection at the moment"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlierthe UK would continue to use testing""as one of our most important lines of defence for as long as is necessary"". Â© 2025 BBC.

This video can not be played Novak Djokovic family end press conference after Covid event question As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world, there have beenmore than 300 million confirmed casesand more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. Meanwhile, nearly every nation in the world is now administering Covid vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 89 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark, the UK and Bahrain have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. Downing Street has denied the Prime Minister's principal private secretary - Martin Reynolds - is to be moved to another position, following claims he invited staff to drinks in the garden of No 10 in May 2020 - in apparent breach of Covid rules. ""The Prime Minister has full confidence in his team. There is no change in that post,"" the PM's official spokesman says. He refused to respond to reports Boris Johnson had attended the same event. ""There is an independent process going on to look into this, led by Sue Gray, and I can't comment further while that is taking place,"" the spokesman says. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says Johnson would have ""serious questions to answer"" if found to have attended a lockdown-breaking party but adds: ""We need to let the inquiry take its course, see what the findings are."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst The National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest, will hold the opening and closing ceremonies of Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics Over the weekend, there was an outbreak of the Omicron variant in the eastern Chinese city of Tianjin. As a result,Chinese media are reporting that Chinaâs nearby capital city Beijing is âon high alertâ,external. It is now 25 days until the Beijing Winter Olympics, and there are fears thatcases could spill over from Tianjin,external, given that âmany people commute from there to work in Beijingâ. Train tickets from Tianjin to Beijing have today been suspended, and people are being urged not to travel between the two cities. In recent months, the media have sought to reassure people that the Olympic Games will go ahead without a hitch, stressing heightened Covid-19 preventative measures are in place. Tickets will not be made available to overseas spectators,externalat this yearâs event and visitors to the Games will be part of a âclosed loopâ, meaning they are kept separate from locals. China Daily notes that as part of this, designated transport is being arranged for Olympic-related personnel. The Beijing Traffic Management Bureau has factored in that there could be circumstances where people might come into contact. It saysshould a traffic accident occur in the city,external, âcitizens should keep their distance and avoid contact with the vehicle or its occupantsâ. BBC Radio 5 Live Tim Richards, chief executive of the Vue Cinemas chain, says
reducing the isolation period from seven days to five would help his cinema
staff return to work faster. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 LiveâsWake Up To Money podcast, he says
the chain has had to âborrow some staff from one cinema to put in another,â due
to absences. âWeâve been hit by Omicron as hard as
everyone else has, itâs meant a lot of work,"" he adds. Vue employs almost 5,000 staff at 91
sites across the UK and Ireland. But thereâs some positive news for the industry, which has been
hit hard in the pandemic. Cinema visits are up 68% compared with 2020, according to Cinema UK. And there were five million admissions in the week up to
Christmas. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent A Whitehall source has denied the government is working on a
plan for living with Covid in the long term. But there's speculation about what changes that might eventually
entail. The government has already said in its Autumn and Winter Covid
plan for this year that one day lateral flow tests will have to be paid for by
businesses and individuals that benefit from them, rather than by the taxpayer.
But the source said ministers had not even made a decision about when such a
decision might be needed. Then there's the period you must isolate for if you have Covid. That's
already come down from an automatic 10 days to seven if you test negative on
the final two, after ministers asked the UK Health Security Agency to review the
rule. But the UKHSA estimates there's a 10-30% chance than an individual
could still be infectious on day six, so it's not coming down any further for now.
That's why ministers who are enthusiastic about people being stuck home for
less time say they would support a change if the science changed. There are other questions, such as when does the government stop
financial support for people who are isolating? You don't get a cheque if
you've got a cold, the argument goes. The PM's adviser-turned-enemy Dominic Cummings wrote
in a blog post last week that the government had also failed to plan ahead for
future variants. These issues will come to a head in the build-up to 26 January when
the measures implementing Plan B in England are due to expire. And again at the
end of March when the legislation that underpins much of the response to Covid
lapses, too. Labour leader Keir Starmer pictured on a visit to Northumberland last month. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he would back a reduction in the Covid isolation period if the science supports it. Speaking to reporters via video call from isolation after testing positive for the virus last week, Sir Keir says he will be ""guided by the science"" and would be ""inclined to support"" a cut in the quarantine period if scientists and medical experts say it was safe. He adds there are ""many, many people in isolation - including myself - who will be watching that science very, very carefully"". Sir Keir insists the continued supply of free lateral flow tests is ""absolutely crucial at the moment"" and warns against withdrawing ""one of the most important means of our protection at the moment"".

Ofcom says it has ""told ITV that greater care should be taken by trusted medical experts when presenting facts and figures on public health issues"". The leader of Rotherham council has called for a return to remote meetings amid spiralling numbers of Covid-19 cases. Labour's Chris Read says it is ""perverse"" that meetings are taking place in person despite government guidance urging people to work from home due to the rapid spread of the Omicron Covid variant. Legislation allowing council meetings to be held virtually from April 2020 expired in May 2021. Speaking ahead of the next full council meeting on Wednesday, which will see 59 councillors plus staff, public and press meet at the town's Magna centre, Read says there's a ""cost and complication"" to in-person meetings. ""It seems wrong to me that the government are telling people to work from home where you can, but specifically saying you councillors can put your health at risk by going and all sitting together in one big room,"" he tellsthe Local Democracy Reporting Service. In the seven days to 3 January, Rotherham recorded 2,479 new infections per 100,000 people, above the England average of 1,758 cases. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities says councils should follow government guidance and that it will be ""responding shortly"" to evidence submitted regarding ""a longer-term decision about whether to make express provision for councils to meet remotely on a permanent basis"".

Novak Djokovic was tested in Serbia on 16 December - regulations in the country require people to isolate for 14 days following a positive Covid result More now on Novak Djokovic whoâs won a court battle in Australia overturning his visa cancellation. We know he sought a medical exemption from the country's strict Covid regulations on the basis that he'd contracted the infection in December. There have been questions over whether the tennis star broke Covid rules in his home country Serbia, apparently attending several public engagements in the days after his positive test. Our colleagues at Reality Check have compiled a timeline of events from what we know so far - you can read ithere. Almost half (46%) of teachers have been asked to cover lessons for absent colleagues, according to a poll by a teaching union. The survey of  nearly 7,000 NASUWT members in England suggests 23% say staff absences due to Covid-19 are having a major impact on their school, while 61% say they are having some impact. Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, describes the poll as ""concerning"". ""Our members are telling us that staff absences due to Covid-19 are having serious impacts on teaching and learning,"" he says. ""Higher rates of staff absence are making a very challenging situation much worse for schools struggling to maintain appropriate staffing levels without disrupting pupils' education. ""Whilst the start of term saw around one in 10 teachers absent due to coronavirus, these numbers are likely to increase in the absence of effective measures to ensure Covid-safety in classrooms."" Dr Roach adds: ""Urgent additional investment is needed in providing air filtration units to every classroom where they are needed. ""Ensuring good ventilation is vital to minimising further disruption to pupils' education."" A UK council is appealing for volunteers among its 30,000-strong workforce to help out in its 23 care homes amid staff shortages due to Covid. Derbyshire County Councilis looking for employees, who've had two Covid vaccines and their booster jab, to take on duties such as catering and laundry. Helen Jones, the council's executive director of adult social care and health, says âit is a real opportunity to make a huge difference and to help some of Derbyshire's most vulnerable people at this extraordinary time"". Staff from all areas of the council have been asked to take on shifts Latest vaccination data shows about 195,000 jabs were given yesterday, Sunday 9 January - including 22,205 first doses, 31,360 second doses and 141, 495 boosters -according to the latest government data.,external A total of 35,664,164 boosters or third doses have now been given across the UK - with PM Boris Johnson saying on Monday about 90% of the over-50s have now been boosted. The latest goverment data has revealed a further 142,224 positive Covid cases have been registered in the UK in the past 24 hours. In addition there were 77 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid in the previous 28 days. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Cabinet ministers received a Covid data
update earlier from England's Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty, with
sources describing the briefing as ""more positive"" than in recent
weeks. The BBC has been told the latest data showed key graphs depicting cases across English regions, admissions to Intensive Care Units and
hospitalisations appeared to be âflatteningâ. It's understood ministers were told by
scientists that next week they should be in a position to know whether Plan B
restrictions will be needed in England beyond 26
January, when they are expected to come to an end. Data showing the percentage of the
population testing positive in each of the four  nations stood at:  Sources present at the meeting described the
different percentages as ""marginal"" when factors such as population density,
geography and demographics were accounted for.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The man can see the car from his new home but cannot use or return it A man has racked up more than Â£1,000 in arrears
on a rental car in China, after a swift lockdown meant he was unable to return
it. Mr Liu lives in the northern city of Xiâan, and
rented a car on 17 December to move house. However, while moving his luggage, his community
went into swift lockdown, meaning he was not allowed out of his building
to return the car. Mr Liu told Houlang Video he wasnât told of
the developments mid-move, and epidemic-related personnel wouldnât even
let him go to his car. A lot of his luggage was still in it, and so he had to
ask a neighbour if he could borrow a duvet.  Mr Liu is still in lockdown, and is being charged by the minute for his vehicle. He has so far spent 10,279 yuan ($1,612; Â£1,188) on his car. His woes have generated significant attention on social media, and many Chinese are commenting online that they hope he can get the charge quashed. There have now been more than 2,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the city of Xiâan. An outbreak began in early December, and some13 million residents have been in strict lockdown for over two weeks. The Global Times newspaper says the figures in this outbreak make it theâlargest domestically-transmitted epidemic since [the] Wuhan outbreakâ,external.

"The Queen will be 96 when the main Jubilee celebrations kick off in June Buckingham Palace has unveiled the full line-up of celebrations to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee this year. Street parties, a concert with some of the world's ""biggest entertainment stars"" and a chance to see the Queen's homes up close are all part of the plan to mark her 70 years on the throne. It will culminate in a four-day UK bank holiday weekend from 2 to 5 June. The first event begins on Monday, with a competition to invent a new pudding to celebrate the Queen's reign. Finalists will be judged by an expert panel including Dame Mary Berry and Masterchef's Monica Galetti. The winning recipe will be made available to the public and the pudding will be enjoyed at Big Jubilee Lunches during the bank holiday weekend. What do people buy the Queen for her Jubilee? On 6 February the Queen will become the first British monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee, marking a 70-year reign. A series of celebrations will take place throughout the year. The Queen marked 50 years on the throne in 2002, with the Duke of Edinburgh by her side She rode in the Golden State Coach as part of the celebrations As with the Queen's Golden and Diamond Jubilees, the first week in June has been chosen for the celebratory weekend, with the summer offering a better chance of good weather than February. To create the four-day weekend, the late May Spring Bank Holiday will be moved to 2 June and an additional one-off bank holiday on 3 June created. It is not clear which events the Queen will attend herself. She was advised by her medical team to rest for several weeks after an overnight hospital stay in October. The majority of the jubilee duties will probably be given to the rest of the family, including the heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales, alongside his wife the Duchess of Cornwall. This jubilee will be the Queen's first without her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, who died in April last year. It's going to be puddings, parties, parades and pageants, in honour of the platinum jubilee. There isn't really a template for celebrating a British monarch's 70-year reign, because it's not happened before. The nearest was Queen Victoria's 63 years and elsewhere you have to go back to 18th-Century France and Louis XIV, who reached 72 years. In this current bleak mid-Covid winter, the jubilee offers the warming prospect of a four-day bank holiday in June, with concerts, parties and pubs open until 1am. The ""platinum pudding"" competition is in the tradition of royal-related dishes like Coronation Chicken, invented for the Queen's coronation in 1953. So expect a lot of trifling puns. The celebrations are also a reminder of how much the Queen has been a constant figure. A recent study showed for 85% of the population she's the only monarch they've ever known. This will be a marker for memories in many people's lives. Prince Philip joined the Queen on board the Royal Barge Spirit of Chartwell as part of the celebrations in 2012 The Queen taking part in a Silver Jubilee walkabout in 1977 During the festivities, Sandringham and Balmoral will be open for visitors to enjoy the celebrations across the long weekend in June. And during the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, a River Of Hope - made up of 200 silk flags decorated with images of hope drawn by children - will make its way along the Mall in central London. As part of the Queen's Green Canopy initiative, some 60,000 trees have already been planted to mark the year, as people have been encouraged to""plant a tree for the jubilee"". On10 Januarythe Platinum Pudding Competition starts. Members of the public are invited to create a dish to dedicate to the Queen's reign. From12 to 15 May, more than 500 horses and 1,000 performers will take part in a 90-minute show at Windsor Castle, taking the audience on a journey through history from Elizabeth I to present day. The first day of the long weekend isThursday 2 Juneand will see Trooping the Colour held in full for the first time since the pandemic. There will be more than 1,400 parading soldiers, 200 horses and 400 musicians taking part. Tickets are available to the public from next weekon this site,external. Also that day, Platinum Jubilee beacons will be lit in more than 1,500 locations across the UK, the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and UK Overseas Territories. For the first time, the capital cities of Commonwealth countries will also light beacons. OnFriday 3 June- the second day of the Bank Holiday weekend - a Service of Thanksgiving for the Queen's reign will be held at St Paul's Cathedral. OnSaturday 4 Junethe Queen will be joined by members of the Royal Family at the Derby, held at Epsom Downs. There will also be a Platinum Party at Buckingham Palace, with members of the public invited to apply to attend a live concert. Performers have yet to be named, but it is billed as bringing together some of the world's biggest stars to celebrate the most significant moments from the Queen's seven-decade reign. The ballot for UK residents to secure tickets will be launched in February. OnSunday 5 Junepeople across the country will be invited to sit down together to take part in the Big Jubilee Lunch, with street parties held across the UK. That day's events will also include the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, which will feature 5,000 people from the UK and the Commonwealth performing around the area of Buckingham Palace. The palace promises ""pomp and ceremony, street arts, theatre, music, circus, costumes as well as cutting-edge visual technology"". Primary and secondary school children are invited tocreate a picture of their hopes and aspirations,externalfor the planet over the next 70 years. A selection of these will be transferred on to silk flags, which will carried by secondary school pupils in the pageant. InJuly, three displays marking the Queen's accession to the throne, the coronation and jubilees will be put on at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. It will include portraits as well as the jewellery and outfits worn for each occasion. What are your plans for the Jubilee?

In the seven days to 3 January, Rotherham recorded 2,479 new infections per 100,000 people, above the England average of 1,758 cases. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities says councils should follow government guidance and that it will be ""responding shortly"" to evidence submitted regarding ""a longer-term decision about whether to make express provision for councils to meet remotely on a permanent basis"".

Novak Djokovic was tested in Serbia on 16 December - regulations in the country require people to isolate for 14 days following a positive Covid result More now on Novak Djokovic whoâs won a court battle in Australia overturning his visa cancellation. We know he sought a medical exemption from the country's strict Covid regulations on the basis that he'd contracted the infection in December. There have been questions over whether the tennis star broke Covid rules in his home country Serbia, apparently attending several public engagements in the days after his positive test. Our colleagues at Reality Check have compiled a timeline of events from what we know so far - you can read ithere. Almost half (46%) of teachers have been asked to cover lessons for absent colleagues, according to a poll by a teaching union. The survey of  nearly 7,000 NASUWT members in England suggests 23% say staff absences due to Covid-19 are having a major impact on their school, while 61% say they are having some impact. Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, describes the poll as ""concerning"". ""Our members are telling us that staff absences due to Covid-19 are having serious impacts on teaching and learning,"" he says. ""Higher rates of staff absence are making a very challenging situation much worse for schools struggling to maintain appropriate staffing levels without disrupting pupils' education. ""Whilst the start of term saw around one in 10 teachers absent due to coronavirus, these numbers are likely to increase in the absence of effective measures to ensure Covid-safety in classrooms."" Dr Roach adds: ""Urgent additional investment is needed in providing air filtration units to every classroom where they are needed. ""Ensuring good ventilation is vital to minimising further disruption to pupils' education."" A UK council is appealing for volunteers among its 30,000-strong workforce to help out in its 23 care homes amid staff shortages due to Covid. Derbyshire County Councilis looking for employees, who've had two Covid vaccines and their booster jab, to take on duties such as catering and laundry. Helen Jones, the council's executive director of adult social care and health, says âit is a real opportunity to make a huge difference and to help some of Derbyshire's most vulnerable people at this extraordinary time"". Staff from all areas of the council have been asked to take on shifts Latest vaccination data shows about 195,000 jabs were given yesterday, Sunday 9 January - including 22,205 first doses, 31,360 second doses and 141, 495 boosters -according to the latest government data.,external A total of 35,664,164 boosters or third doses have now been given across the UK - with PM Boris Johnson saying on Monday about 90% of the over-50s have now been boosted. The latest goverment data has revealed a further 142,224 positive Covid cases have been registered in the UK in the past 24 hours. In addition there were 77 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid in the previous 28 days. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News Cabinet ministers received a Covid data
update earlier from England's Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty, with
sources describing the briefing as ""more positive"" than in recent
weeks. The BBC has been told the latest data showed key graphs depicting cases across English regions, admissions to Intensive Care Units and
hospitalisations appeared to be âflatteningâ. It's understood ministers were told by
scientists that next week they should be in a position to know whether Plan B
restrictions will be needed in England beyond 26

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The man can see the car from his new home but cannot use or return it A man has racked up more than Â£1,000 in arrears
on a rental car in China, after a swift lockdown meant he was unable to return
it. Mr Liu lives in the northern city of Xiâan, and
rented a car on 17 December to move house. However, while moving his luggage, his community
went into swift lockdown, meaning he was not allowed out of his building
to return the car. Mr Liu told Houlang Video he wasnât told of
the developments mid-move, and epidemic-related personnel wouldnât even
let him go to his car. A lot of his luggage was still in it, and so he had to
ask a neighbour if he could borrow a duvet.  Mr Liu is still in lockdown, and is being charged by the minute for his vehicle. He has so far spent 10,279 yuan ($1,612; Â£1,188) on his car. His woes have generated significant attention on social media, and many Chinese are commenting online that they hope he can get the charge quashed. There have now been more than 2,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the city of Xiâan. An outbreak began in early December, and some13 million residents have been in strict lockdown for over two weeks. The Global Times newspaper says the figures in this outbreak make it theâlargest domestically-transmitted epidemic since [the] Wuhan outbreakâ,external.

The Port of Dover's chief executive, Doug Bannister, is calling on the government forsupport in getting hold of daily lateral flow Covid testsfor its workers. Last week, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said100,000 key workers would receive daily tests. The port has applied to be included in the scheme saying staff are key workers who maintain ""the operations and the critical flow of goods into the nation"". The Cabinet Office says the UK Health Security Agency will run the testing programme with employers and further details would be set out in the coming days. Earlier, the family of men's tennis champion Novak Djokovic held a press conference after he won a court battle to overturn the cancellation of his Australian visa on Covid vaccination grounds. Watch the video below for the moment they ended the press conference after being asked aboutthe world number one testing positive for Covid on 16 December yet still attending public events in the days that followed. This video can not be played Novak Djokovic family end press conference after Covid event question As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world, there have beenmore than 300 million confirmed casesand more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. Meanwhile, nearly every nation in the world is now administering Covid vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 89 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark, the UK and Bahrain have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. Downing Street has denied the Prime Minister's principal private secretary - Martin Reynolds - is to be moved to another position, following claims he invited staff to drinks in the garden of No 10 in May 2020 - in apparent breach of Covid rules. ""The Prime Minister has full confidence in his team. There is no change in that post,"" the PM's official spokesman says. He refused to respond to reports Boris Johnson had attended the same event. ""There is an independent process going on to look into this, led by Sue Gray, and I can't comment further while that is taking place,"" the spokesman says. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says Johnson would have ""serious questions to answer"" if found to have attended a lockdown-breaking party but adds: ""We need to let the inquiry take its course, see what the findings are."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst The National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest, will hold the opening and closing ceremonies of Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics Over the weekend, there was an outbreak of the Omicron variant in the eastern Chinese city of Tianjin. As a result,Chinese media are reporting that Chinaâs nearby capital city Beijing is âon high alertâ,external. It is now 25 days until the Beijing Winter Olympics, and there are fears thatcases could spill over from Tianjin,external, given that âmany people commute from there to work in Beijingâ. Train tickets from Tianjin to Beijing have today been suspended, and people are being urged not to travel between the two cities. In recent months, the media have sought to reassure people that the Olympic Games will go ahead without a hitch, stressing heightened Covid-19 preventative measures are in place. Tickets will not be made available to overseas spectators,externalat this yearâs event and visitors to the Games will be part of a âclosed loopâ, meaning they are kept separate from locals. China Daily notes that as part of this, designated transport is being arranged for Olympic-related personnel. The Beijing Traffic Management Bureau has factored in that there could be circumstances where people might come into contact. It saysshould a traffic accident occur in the city,external, âcitizens should keep their distance and avoid contact with the vehicle or its occupantsâ. BBC Radio 5 Live Tim Richards, chief executive of the Vue Cinemas chain, says
reducing the isolation period from seven days to five would help his cinema
staff return to work faster. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 LiveâsWake Up To Money podcast, he says
the chain has had to âborrow some staff from one cinema to put in another,â due
to absences. âWeâve been hit by Omicron as hard as
everyone else has, itâs meant a lot of work,"" he adds. Vue employs almost 5,000 staff at 91
sites across the UK and Ireland. But thereâs some positive news for the industry, which has been
hit hard in the pandemic. Cinema visits are up 68% compared with 2020, according to Cinema UK. And there were five million admissions in the week up to
Christmas. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent A Whitehall source has denied the government is working on a
plan for living with Covid in the long term. But there's speculation about what changes that might eventually
entail. The government has already said in its Autumn and Winter Covid
plan for this year that one day lateral flow tests will have to be paid for by
businesses and individuals that benefit from them, rather than by the taxpayer.
But the source said ministers had not even made a decision about when such a
decision might be needed. Then there's the period you must isolate for if you have Covid. That's
already come down from an automatic 10 days to seven if you test negative on
the final two, after ministers asked the UK Health Security Agency to review the
rule. But the UKHSA estimates there's a 10-30% chance than an individual
could still be infectious on day six, so it's not coming down any further for now.
That's why ministers who are enthusiastic about people being stuck home for
less time say they would support a change if the science changed. There are other questions, such as when does the government stop
financial support for people who are isolating? You don't get a cheque if
you've got a cold, the argument goes. The PM's adviser-turned-enemy Dominic Cummings wrote
in a blog post last week that the government had also failed to plan ahead for
future variants. These issues will come to a head in the build-up to 26 January when
the measures implementing Plan B in England are due to expire. And again at the
end of March when the legislation that underpins much of the response to Covid
lapses, too. Labour leader Keir Starmer pictured on a visit to Northumberland last month. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he would back a reduction in the Covid isolation period if the science supports it. Speaking to reporters via video call from isolation after testing positive for the virus last week, Sir Keir says he will be ""guided by the science"" and would be ""inclined to support"" a cut in the quarantine period if scientists and medical experts say it was safe. He adds there are ""many, many people in isolation - including myself - who will be watching that science very, very carefully"". Sir Keir insists the continued supply of free lateral flow tests is ""absolutely crucial at the moment"" and warns against withdrawing ""one of the most important means of our protection at the moment"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlierthe UK would continue to use testing""as one of our most important lines of defence for as long as is necessary"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"A health worker inoculates a man with a third dose in Delhi on Monday India has begun giving booster doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to priority groups amid a surge in infections. Health and frontline workers and people above 60 years old with comorbidities are currently eligible to take the jab. The drive began as India battles a spike in Covid cases fuelled by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. Early studies from other countries have suggested that a booster vaccine may provide more protection against Omicron. India records first death with Omicron variant The highly transmissive Omicron variant was first discovered in South Africa in November. Since then, several countries have expanded their booster programmes or shortened the gap between jabs to shore up protection against the variant. In India, the booster shot - dubbed a ""precaution dose"" by Prime Minister Narendra Modi - will be the same vaccine that was given to a person for their first and second doses. India has been mainly administering two locally-manufactured vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, since its vaccination drive began in January 2021. On Sunday, India reported more than 179,000 new infections for the past 24 hours, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the national capital Delhi and financial centre Mumbai. On the same day, Mr Modi chaired a review meeting with top officials, and asked for ""technical support"" to be provided to states reporting more cases. The government had begun administering vaccines to 15-18-year-olds last week - it has said that 31% of Indians in this age group have been given the first dose so far. Is India ready for a third wave of Covid-19? More than 91% adults have been partially vaccinated so far, while 66% have received both doses. But experts say that still leaves millions of unvaccinated people - many with underlying health problems that could increase the severity of the infection - at risk. The spread of Omicron has also increased worries - India has confirmed a total of 4,003 cases of Omicron, with Maharashtra state reporting the highest (1,126), followed by Rajasthan (529) and Delhi (513). The country has so far recorded more than 35 million Covid cases and about 483,000 deaths from the virus.

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (right) met the foreign secretary in London on Monday, along with Lord Dodds (left) The UK government must set out a timetable for how and when changes will be made to the Northern Ireland Protocol, the Democratic Unionist Party leader has said. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was speaking after talks with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on Monday. Earlier, he indicated he had paused a threat to pull DUP ministers from the Stormont Executive. Mary Lou McDonald said she was assured the protocol would stay. The Sinn FÃ©in leader held separate talks with Ms Truss on Monday. In a statement after his meeting, Sir Jeffrey did not repeat threats over the future of the executive. Instead, he said he told the foreign secretary, the UK's new lead negotiator with the EU in post-Brexit talks, that the government must guarantee there will be no checks on goods travelling from Great Britain that will stay within Northern Ireland. ""For our part we will use all measures at our disposal to continue to oppose the implementation of the current arrangements flowing from the protocol and we have made it clear to the government that we will not be implementers of protocol arrangements,"" he continued. The DUP leader said he urged the government to set out how it will deliver on proposed protocol changesoutlined in a command paper last year,external. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss replaced Lord Frost as the UK's lead negotiator with the EU in post-Brexit talks He added that the protocol had weakened Northern Ireland's governing arrangements. ""Balance can only be restored when Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market is restored and the damaging protocol consequences are reversed,"" he said. The meetings with Ms Truss come a day after she said shewould not accept a deal which meant goods from Great Britain being checked as they enter Northern Ireland. The foreign secretary said on Sunday that she was prepared to trigger Article 16 to suspend the agreement if necessary. The EU said it was ""not too impressed"" with Ms Truss' threat. Speaking after her meeting with Ms Truss on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said she had been assured that the protocol was ""here to stay"". Allow Twitter content?

She added that the stakes were high in the negotiations and said the DUP's strategy ""can't hold progress back"". Michelle O'Neill accused the DUP of engaging in political stunts Mrs McDonald's party colleague, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, added that the DUP had been ""engaged in political stunts"". ""I'm very sure that they are engaged in playing to the gallery,"" she said. ""I'm very sure that their position is more about the election that's upcoming rather than what's in the best interests of the people here."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described Sir Jeffrey's strategy over the protocol as a ""foolish crusade"" which is creating uncertainty and chaos. ""Parties that are serious about government should be seeking to work together to improve the lives of people in our communities,"" the Foyle MP continued. ""Instead we have establishment parties in a toxic race to see who can bring the government down first to meet their own selfish needs. People are sick of it."" Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the DUP's actions were ""beyond embarrassing at this stage"". ""Could we all now just focus on ensuring devolution delivers for those who elected us during the last few weeks of this mandate?"" she questioned in a social media post. In 2019, the prime ministeragreed a deal, known as the protocol,and for the last six months the UK has been attempting to renegotiate it. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. That also creates a new Irish Sea trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, with some goods needing to be checked as they enter Northern Ireland. In July, the UK proposed an arrangement in which goods from Great Britain, which are due to stay in Northern Ireland, would not be checked and would have minimal paperwork. Goods which are due to move onwards to the Republic of Ireland would be checked at Northern Ireland's ports. The EU published its own proposals in October, which it said would significantly reduce, but not eliminate, checks on goods. It has previously said that the easiest way to reduce checks would be for the UK to sign up to a Swiss-style agri-food agreement. That would involve all of the UK following the relevant EU rules, something the government says it could not accept. ""I will not sign up to anything which sees the people of Northern Ireland unable to benefit from the same decisions on taxation and spending as the rest of the UK, or which still sees goods moving within our own country being subject to checks,"" Ms Truss saidin the Sunday Telegraph.,external The EU's ambassador to the UK said it was not helpful to keep agitating the issue of triggering Article 16. Ms Truss is due to hold two days of talks with her European Union counterpart, MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, over Thursday and Friday. Sir Jeffrey feels that the UK government should provide imminently the plan to put in place the measures set out in the UK's command paper and also to list the timeline which they have in mind. He is being careful not to set any dates in his statement, nor does he go as far as to suggest that the institutions at Stormont are under threat. He does not, for instance, talk about things being unsustainable at Stormont if the protocol remains intact. But what he does say is that he will use all measures at his disposal to continue to oppose the implementation of the current arrangements, whatever he means by that. Ms Truss said that when she meets Mr Å efÄoviÄ, the EU's lead post-Brexit negotiator, she will be ""putting forward our constructive proposals to resolve the situation"". It is not yet clear if these differ from the July proposals. What is Article 16? Liz Truss replaces Lord Frost in post-Brexit talks A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What is Article 16 and why does it matter? She has also repeated the UK's willingness to use the Article 16 mechanism of the protocol. Article 16 sets out the process for taking unilateral ""safeguard""measures if either the EU or UK concludes that the deal is leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade. Those safeguards would amount to suspending parts of the deal. Ms Truss said: ""I want a negotiated solution, but if we have to use legitimate provisions including Article 16, I am willing to do that. ""This safeguard clause was explicitly designed - and agreed to by all sides - to ease acute problems because of the sensitivity of the issues at play."" The protocol created a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK The EU has said it does not believe the use of Article 16 is justified and that its deployment could lead to the collapse of the wider Brexit deal, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. JoÃ£o Vale de Almeida, the EU's ambassador to the UK, said it was not helpful to ""keep agitating the issue"" of triggering Article 16. ""We've heard this before from the government, so we're not surprised. We are not too impressed,"" he told Sky News. ""I think we should focus on - at least that's where we are focused on - is trying to find solutions for difficulties in the implementation of the protocol"". The EU was ""even more eager"" to find compromises, he added. What is Article 16 and why does it matter?

"Injury: This toddler needed stitches after a ceiling collapse Damp, debris and falling ceilings - a BBC investigation into accommodation for asylum seekers has uncovered serial concerns about housing conditions. Refugee organisations say they hear regularly about properties residents believe are unsafe, and they struggle to get help on a national phone line. The concerns come after a year of mounting controversy over how the Home Office is managing asylum seekers. But it said it was providing ""safe, comfortable and secure"" accommodation. Projections suggest the UK could house 80,000 asylum seekers by next year. The government puts asylum seekers in accommodation run separately to social housing. After previous criticisms, the Home Office reorganised contracts in 2019 under three companies: Mears, Serco and Clearspring Ready Homes. A fourth contract paid for a national phone line, Migrant Help, to handle complaints and pass them to the housing companies. Some 41,000 asylum seekers are living under the main scheme Housing for others, including hotels, brings the total nearer 65,000 Officials project there could be 80,000 by next spring Home Office pays about Â£560 per person per month - the lower end of the UK rental market Total costs depend on how many people are in the system but it's projected to be Â£4bn over 10 years Despite these changes, and more money devoted to the contracted homes, some support organisations say they still find residents who are concerned they are in poor-quality housing. Residents like Adam and his family, housed last year in West Yorkshire. The police officer and his wife fled sectarian tensions in an African nation and were placed in a home in Bradford. Last May, a bathroom leak developed and water began coming through downstairs. Adam reported it and there were visits by a repair team. Two weeks after the problem emerged, a ceiling collapsed. Escaped injury: Adam's wife with their daughter moments after the ceiling came in As the debris fell, Adam's wife instinctively bent over her daughter to protect her. He says: ""I was in the room upstairs, and all of a sudden I heard a noise and the missus was on the floor... all the plaster and wood was on her head. My baby was shouting and screaming."" The baby was unscathed, but Adam's wife received treatment for concussion. ""I could have lost my baby that day. I think it's in the system where things are going wrong - it's not the people - I think it's a system."" The home was provided by Mears - and it told the BBC a repair team had not found water ingress or timber decay before the incident. The firm said it had responded properly and promptly once it became aware. This video can not be played Residents in asylum housing film the conditions they are living in Mears moved Adam and his family to a new home - the BBC saw that property, which was clean and safe. A spokesman for the company said: ""As the only new provider, taking over from the previous contracts, this has been a time of transition as we have worked to make improvements and bring accommodation and support up to the new standards where many properties had been in constant use for many years. ""During the pandemic, in line with all social landlords, we prioritised more serious repairs and paused less serious repairs. A catch-up programme is now under way."" There is no suggestion Adam and his family's incident is the norm - but research indicates that neither was it an isolated experience. That collapse was predated by another in Bradford in the autumn of 2020, in which a child suffered an open head wound that required stitching. Refugee Action, a support organisation, said the Sudanese mother and her support worker had tried to flag her concerns on the national phone line. Mears moved the family to a new home after the incident. London: A ceiling collapses after a leak In another example from last May, a family in London say they too repeatedly called Migrant Help to report a leak in the property. The father recorded a video of the aftermath of the collapse for Migrant Help. The provider, Clearsprings Ready Homes, declined to comment. ""I've worked in this area of work for nearly 20 years. And I've never seen it as bad in terms of the housing and the accommodation that people are experiencing,"" says Tim Naor-Hilton, chief executive of Refugee Action. ""Our partners across the sector are also reporting very similar things. We are very, very worried that there is going to be some catastrophic incident at some point, somewhere in the country."" When refugee charities made Freedom of Information requests about the severity and frequency of complaints, and about how Migrant Help was performing, the Home Office turned them down. But a September 2021 Home Office survey of asylum seekers, obtained by the BBC, hints at a mixed picture. Only six out of ten respondents were happy or very happy with accommodation. The residents who had concerns complained about cleanliness on moving-in and the responsiveness to requests for repairs. Debris from a ceiling fall in London The survey's low response rate means it is hard to draw firm conclusions - so BBC News contacted more than 30 community organisations whose caseworkers have thousands of contacts with asylum seekers every year. Eight out of ten of the organisations told us that most weeks they heard concerns about accommodation. A quarter said they heard reports every day. Some asylum seekers told the charities they felt their homes were generally unclean, and the most common problems were reports of mould or a lack of hot water. Twenty-three of the organisations had come across clients worried about ceilings - although there was no suggestion that this was commonplace. The vast majority of organisations believed the service from the Migrant Help phone line was highly variable, poor, or exceptionally poor, with half saying it could take three goes to get a complaint logged. The Home Office says the BBC's survey is not representative - but one striking example from a year ago in Greater Manchester illustrates the concerns shared by many in the sector. Residents of a house there say they spent six weeks on the phone to Migrant Help complaining about problems with a blocked drain. There was ultimately a flood of sewage up through the kitchen sink. Blockage: Sewage flowed into this kitchen The provider of that home, Serco, has declined to comment - but the BBC understands the company had checked the home over before the residents moved in and believes it then did everything possible to deal with the problem with the drains once it was made aware. Ultimately, the area's wastewater utility company dug up the road to replace the drain while the damaged parts of the home were refitted. In 2020 a High Court judge ruled that the Home Office wasfailing to properly monitor accommodation,externalin one particular part of the system Independent inspectors havetwice criticised reception facilities on the Kent coastfor migrants arriving by boat - saying they are very poor Another report found that migrants were then being housed incramped and filthy conditions at Napier Barracksnear Folkestone, where there was a mass outbreak of Covid The High Court later ruledconditions at Napier to be unlawful. In 2020 the National Audit Office said the Home Office hadlearnt some lessons on the accommodation system,external- but it was too soon to know whether the new contracts would deliver The Home Office said 80% of surveyed residents were satisfied with Migrant Help - but the phone line had also experienced unprecedented demand due to factors including the pandemic. It was satisfied that it was now meeting its targets. The BBC has tried to contact Migrant Help separately for comment. ""We are dealing with unprecedented pressures on the asylum system and, despite this, we continue to ensure that the accommodation provided is safe, comfortable and secure,"" said a Home Office spokesman. ""We remain satisfied that our accommodation contractors [are] providing a good standard of accommodation and we have strict processes in place to respond promptly to maintenance issues and any complaints from residents. We take complaints extremely seriously and where issues do arrive we ensure they are acted upon quickly."" Back in West Yorkshire, Adam, the police officer-turned-asylum seeker, is still waiting for his case to be decided. But he's also urging the Home Office to look again at whether the accommodation system is working properly. ""I don't need any compensation,"" he says. ""I just don't want someone to be a victim like me in the future."" Residents in asylum housing film conditions.

"Supermarket Morrisons is to scrap 'use by' dates on most of its milk in a move it says will stop millions of pints being poured down the sink. The retailer will instead place 'best before' on 90% of its own-brand milk and encourage customers to use a sniff test to check quality. Recycling charity Wrap said Morrisons was the first supermarket to make the move, which starts later this month. Ian Goode, senior milk buyer at Morrisons, said it was a ""bold step"". Milk is the third most wasted food and drink product in the UK, after potatoes and bread, with around 490 million pints wasted every year, according to Wrap. It also estimates 85 million pints of milk waste may be due to customers following 'use by' labels, despite research showing it can be used days after the date. Morrisons believes the move could save seven million pints of its own-brand milk being poured away each year. 'Use by' are the dates until which perishable food can be cooked and consumed safely. 'Best before' on food is guidance for when the product should be consumed to get the best quality, taste and texture. Morrisons said its research showed that milk does not need to be labelled as a perishable food. ""The dates on the milk will stay the same - it is what we are asking customers to do which is changing,"" the supermarket said. Mr Goode said: ""Wasted milk means wasted effort by our farmers and unnecessary carbon being released into the atmosphere. ""Good quality, well-kept milk has a good few days life after normal 'use by' dates - and we think it should be consumed, not tipped down the sink. ""So we're taking a bold step today and asking customers to decide whether their milk is still good to drink. Generations before us have always used the sniff test - and I believe we can too."" This video can not be played Five tricks for longer food freshness Marcus Gover, of Wrap, said: ""I am delighted that Morrisons is the first UK supermarket to take this important step to help reduce household food waste - it shows real leadership and we look forward to more retailers reviewing date labels on their products and taking action."" Morrisons has already scrapped 'use by' dates across some of its own-brand yogurt and hard cheese ranges. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said it was alright to have 'use by' or 'best before' on milk depending on the processing and type. But there must be clear labelling, and the dates printed on all food and drink must be based on ""robust evidence about the product concerned"". The FSA also pointed out that when dealing with food generally, sniffing is not an appropriate safety test, especially with products that could cause food poisoning.
