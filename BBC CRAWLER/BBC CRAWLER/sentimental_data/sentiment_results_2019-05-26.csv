"Seats in the European Parliament representing England, Scotland and Wales are distributed according to the D'Hondt system, a type of proportional representation. The nations are divided into 11 electoral regions: nine in England, plus Scotland and Wales. For this election, Gibraltar votes as part of a combined constituency with the south-west of England. Parties vying for election submit a list of candidates to voters in each region. A system devised by Victor D'Hondt, a Belgian lawyer and mathematician active in the 19th Century, dictates the results: In the first round of counting the party with the most votes wins a seat for the candidate at the top of its list In the second round the winning party's vote is divided by two, and whichever party comes out on top in the re-ordered results wins a seat for their top candidate The process repeats itself, with the original vote of the winning party in each round being divided by one plus their running total of MEPs, until all the seats for the region have been taken By way of example, here are the results for one region of England, the West Midlands, in 2014, which had a total of seven seats in the European Parliament up for grabs. For simplicity's sake, only the five largest parties by vote share are included: UKIP wins the largest number of votes and the candidate at the top of their list is elected. As UKIP already has one candidate elected, its vote is divided by two (one, plus the number of MEPs it has). Now, Labour comes out on top and the candidate at the top of its list of candidates is elected. After Labour's vote is divided by two (one plus the number of MEPs it has), the Conservative Party wins and its top candidate for the region is also elected. After the Conservative vote has been divided by two, UKIP is back on top. The candidate in second place on its list is elected. Since two UKIP candidates have now been elected, their original vote tally is divided by three (one plus the number of MEPs elected) and Labour secures top spot and a second MEP for the region. The original Labour vote is now divided by three (one plus the two MEPs from round five), leaving the Conservative Party to top this round and win a seat for the second person on its list. The Conservative Party vote is now divided by three, leaving UKIP in first place to win the final seat for the third candidate on its list. In Northern Ireland,a different systemis used to elect its three MEPs. Voters have a ""single transferable vote"", meaning that they are able to rank the candidates in order of preference. To make the system work, officials first need to calculate a quota. They take the total number of valid votes cast, divide it by the number of seats available plus one, and then add one. In the first round, if any candidate secures more first-preference votes than the quota, they are elected. Surplus votes, ie those received above the quota, are redistributed among the other candidates. If not enough candidates have yet reached the quota, then the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated, and the lower-preference votes of their supporters are again re-allocated. This process is repeated until the three posts have been filled. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"This photo showing a long queue up to the summit of Everest has gone viral in recent days Nepal's tourism authority has denied accusations that the rise in Mount Everest deaths is solely due to overcrowding. The department's director general Dandu Raj Ghimire said other factors including adverse weather conditions had also contributed. Ten climbers have been reported dead or missing this season. Photos of long queues near the summit have been widely shared as record numbers ascended the mountain in May. Why Mount Everest's summit gets so crowded How deadly is Mount Everest? Mr Ghimire said 381 people had ascended Everest this spring but as periods of fine weather had been short, the number of people on the routes had been ""higher than expected"". In his statement, Mr Ghimire put the current death toll at eight, although 10 people have been reported dead or missing so far. Briton Robin Haynes Fisher, 44, died on Saturdayminutes after reaching Everest's summit. Mr Fisher photographed before ascending Mount Everest Kevin Hynes, 56, from Ireland, died in his tent on Fridayand SÃ©amus Lawless, also Irish, is presumed dead after falling near the summit. One Nepalese, four Indians, an Austrian and an American are also dead or missing. A local tour organiser told AFP that one of the Indian climbers, Nihal Ashpak Bhagwan, died of exhaustion after being ""stuck in traffic for more than 12 hours"". Mr Ghimire offered ""heartfelt condolences to those who've passed away and prayers to those who are still missing"". ""Mountaineering in the Himalayas is in itself an adventurous, complex and sensitive issue requiring full awareness yet tragic accidents are unavoidable,"" he said.

"Whorlton Hall, near Castle Barnard, looked after 17 adults with learning difficulties and autism A former inspector at the Care Quality Commission says a 2015 report into Whorlton Hall hospital which presented ""warning bells"" went unpublished. Barry Stanley-Wilkinson says he wrote the report four years before BBC Panorama revealed the alleged abuse of patients with learning disabilities and autism. The CQC said the draft report raised no concerns about abusive practices. The claims come after 10 workers at the specialist hospital were arrested. Seven men and three women were arrested last weekat addresses in Barnard Castle, Bishop Auckland, Darlington and Stockton over the alleged abuse of patients. An undercover BBC Panorama investigation into the specialist hospital in County Durham - a 17-bed unit for adults with learning difficulties and autism - appeared to show patients being mocked, intimidated and restrained. Cygnet, the firm that runs the 17-bed hospital unit for adults with learning difficulties and autism, said it was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the allegations. The company only took over the running of the centre at the turn of the year and said it was ""co-operating fully"" with the police investigation. The site had at least 100 visits by official agencies in the year before the alleged abuse was discovered. Mr Stanley-Wilkinson says he noticed a ""very poor culture"" was evident when he led the 2015 inspection. He told the BBC that he had raised concerns over the ""very poor culture"" in a report he wrote - four years prior to the BBC investigation. He said: ""I strongly believe that anybody that can understand organisational culture reading that report would agree that there was definitely warning bells there. ""I was extremely upset. This should have been listened to back in 2015 and I said quite openly, when I left the organisation, that I felt it had neglected its promise to people with learning disabilities."" He said it was the only report he wrote in nearly a decade of working at the CQC which wasn't published. In a statement, the CQC said the report went through a ""rigorous peer review process"". It said the draft report ""did not raise any concerns about abusive practice"". The CQC said a later inspection rated the hospital as ""good overall"". In a statement it said: ""We are in the process of commissioning a review into what we could have done differently or better in our regulation of Whorlton Hall and these allegations will be fully investigated as part of this. ""We will update on the progress and findings of this review in our Public Board meetings.""

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""Never speak ill of our fellow Conservative"" Dominic Raab has been making his pitch to become Conservative leader, as Michael Gove becomes the eighth MP to join the race to succeed Theresa May. Mr Raab told the BBC he would fight for a ""fairer"" Brexit deal with the EU - but if that were not possible, the UK would leave with no deal in October. Mr Gove confirmed he would run to ""deliver Brexit"" and unite the party. Chancellor Philip Hammond said it would be a ""dangerous strategy"" to ignore Parliament, which has opposed no-deal. Boris Johnson, the favourite in the contest, outlinedhis approach to Brexit,externalin his column in Monday's Daily Telegraph, saying: ""No one sensible would aim exclusively for a no-deal outcome. No one responsible would take no-deal off the table."" Tory leadership contenders - who's standing? The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister On Friday, Mrs May announced she would be standing down as Tory leader on 7 June, saying it was time for another prime minister to try to deliver Brexit. It came after a backlash by her MPs against her plan to get the withdrawal deal she had negotiated with the EU through the Commons, which has already rejected it three times. The UK is now set to leave the European Union on 31 October, after the original Brexit date of 29 March was delayed twice owing to the parliamentary deadlock. The delay has meant the UK has had to take part in elections to the European Parliament, three years after it voted to leave the bloc. This video can not be played Gove becomes the eighth candidate to put himself forward Mr Gove, the environment secretary, confirmed on Sunday that he would run for leader, saying: ""I believe that I'm ready to unite the Conservative and Unionist Party, ready to deliver Brexit, and ready to lead this great country."" Speaking to Nick Robinson forBBC Radio 4 podcast Political Thinkingat Hay Festival, Mr Gove explained why he was running, saying: ""The particular mix of experience I have means I can make a contribution."" Mr Gove also said he had changed his mind from 2016 - when he described himself as being ""incapable"" of being Tory leader - adding he had ""evolved as a politician"". While he did not set out his leadership proposal, he did say that the future prime minister would need an eye for detail, as the ""process for taking us out of the European Union requires that"". Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and former Commons leader Andrea Leadsom revealed their leadership bids in the Sunday newspapers. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the UK's previous negotiations with the EU over the withdrawal agreement had not been ""resolute"" enough, and a no-deal Brexit had been taken ""off the table"".

He added: ""I don't want a WTO Brexit but I think unless you are willing to keep our promises as politiciansâ¦ we put ourselves in a much weaker position in terms of getting a deal."" Mrs May, who was at church on Sunday with her husband Philip, resigned on Friday He said there was ""no case for a further extension"" past the current date the UK is due to leave the EU, 31 October. But Chancellor Philip Hammond called for compromise, saying the suggestion that it was possible to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement was a ""fig leaf"" for ""what is actually a policy of leaving on no-deal terms"". That policy was clearly opposed by Parliament, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""This is a parliamentary democracy.

This video can not be played Former Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom confirms leadership bid Asked if she favoured a no-deal Brexit, Ms Leadsom said: ""Of course, in order to succeed in a negotiation you have to be prepared to leave without a deal, but I have a three-point plan for Brexit, for how we get out of the European Union. ""I'm very optimistic about it. My role as leader of the Commons means that I've had a very good insight into what needs to be done, and I look forward to setting that out once the campaign starts."" This video can not be played Philip Hammond: ""A prime minister who ignores Parliament cannot expect to survive very long"" They have joined Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, his predecessor Boris Johnson, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock in the battle for the leadership. Tory MPs have until the week beginning 10 June to put their name forward, and the party hopes a new leader will be in place by the end of July. Members will have the final say on who wins, after the shortlist is whittled down to two by a series of votes by Tory MPs. In theSunday Telegraph,external, party chairman Brandon Lewis said the party membership had swelled by 36,000 in the last year - bringing the total to more than 160,000. Mrs May will continue as prime minister while the leadership contest takes place. By Vicki Young, BBC chief political correspondent How the UK leaves the EU has consumed British politics for three years and anyone who wants to be prime minister now has to explain how they can succeed where Theresa May failed. All the contenders in this race face the same dilemma. The first hurdle is to persuade a deeply divided parliamentary party that they have a solution that breaks the stalemate but keeps the party intact. Next they must appeal to the Tory membership - and many of them have no problem with a no-deal Brexit. Finally they will have to govern, and that means winning the confidence of the House of Commons. MPs have already voted overwhelmingly against leaving the EU without a deal and it would take only a handful of Conservative MPs to bring down a prime minister who tried to do so. Some candidates have stressed the need to get a Brexit deal through Parliament. Mr Hunt toldthe Sunday Times,externalhe had the business experience to secure an agreement. ""Doing deals is my bread and butter,"" he said. And in a direct criticism of Boris Johnson, Mr Stewart said: ""I would not serve in the cabinet of someone explicitly pushing for a no-deal Brexit."" Mr Hancock said Mrs May's successor must be ""brutally honest"" about the ""trade-offs"" required to get a deal through Parliament. Environment Secretary Mr Gove said it would be better for the UK ""if we secure a deal and leave the EU in an orderly way"" but added that he had ""come to grips"" with preparing for a no-deal outcome. Meanwhile, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watsontold the Observer,externalthat his party must fully commit to supporting another referendum. Speaking on BBC Radio 5Live's Pienaar's Politics, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said the ""usual suspects"" would blame leader Jeremy Corbyn if Labour performed poorly in the European elections. This video can not be played Shami Chakrabarti: ""What I just heard from Dominic Raab was terrifying to me"" He said: ""Tom Watson's already out, surprise surprise, trying to take on the role of Prince Machiavelli, but I've got news for Tom. Machiavelli was effective. He's a poor imitation of that. If he's trying to turn Labour members against Corbyn and in his favour, then he's going to lose disastrously.

"This video can not be played The winners and losers of European election night The Brexit Party was the clear winner in the UK's European elections, while the pro-EU Lib Dems came second. The Conservatives and Labour suffered heavy losses, with the former getting less than 10% of the vote. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said he was ready to ""take on"" the main parties in a general election. Mr Farage's party won 29 seats, the Lib Dems 16, Labour 10, the Greens seven, the Tories four, the SNP three, and Plaid Cymru and the DUP one each. The elections came after Prime Minister Theresa May tried three times to secure MPs' backing for her Brexit plan andannounced her resignationafter her fourth attempt prompted a backlash. LIVE: UK European election 2019 results UK results at-a-glance The UK picture in maps and charts What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit Mr Farage told the BBC: ""With a big, simple message - which is we've been badly let down by two parties who have broken their promises - we have topped the poll in a fairly dramatic style. ""The two-party system now serves nothing but itself. I think they are an obstruction to the modernising of politics... and we are going to take them on."" The UK elected 73 MEPs Turnout was just below 37% - the second highest in any European election in the UK The Brexit Party received the highest share of the vote in nine of the 12 regions - with 32% overall The Conservative Party was in fifth place The Lib Dems took second place with 20% of the vote Labour Party fell to third place overall, with less than 15% of the vote The Green Party also made gains, seeing its best performance since 1989 Newly-formed Change UK did not win any seats, while UKIP haemorrhaged support to The Brexit Party Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said he was ""pleasantly surprised"" by his party's ""very good result"". He added that there was ""a majority of people in the country who don't want to leave the European Union now"". Polling expert Sir John Curtice said the results showed how polarised the country had become over Brexit. Were these results an overwhelming cry for us to leave the EU whatever the cost? Or a sign, with some slightly convoluted arithmetic, that the country now wants another referendum to stop Brexit all together? Guess what, the situation is not quite so black and white, whatever you will hear in the coming hours about the meaning of these numbers. The Brexit Party's success was significant and Nigel Farage's new group is the biggest single winner. But the Lib Dems, Greens, Plaid and SNP - all parties advocating the opposite - were victors too.

What we know so far about the results EU-wide Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Who were the winners and losers? But Labour only received 9.3% of the vote - a loss in vote share of 16.6% - leaving it with no MEPs in Scotland for the first time. In Northern Ireland, the DUP (which supports leaving the EU), Sinn Fein (Remain), and the Alliance Party (Remain)all won a seat each. Brexiteer and Conservative MEP for the South East Daniel Hannan - one of only three Tory MEPs elected - said it was his party's ""worst ever result"". ""We voted to leave (the EU) and we haven't left - it's that simple,"" he told the BBC. Tory leadership hopeful and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the public had delivered ""a crushing rebuke"" to both major parties for failing to deliver Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is facing increasing pressure from senior members of his party to back another referendum on Brexit, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying it is the only way through the deadlock. ""If there can be a deal, great, but it needs to go back to the people,"" Mr McDonnell said. ""If it's a no-deal, we've got to block it and the one way of doing that is going back to the people and arguing the case against it because it could be catastrophic for our economy."" This video can not be played McDonnell: Brexit 'needs to go back to the people' But the leader of the Unite Union, Len McCluskey, said Labour's attempt to ""unite the nation"" over Brexit was ""an honourable objective that must not be abandoned"". And Mr Corbyn wrote to his MPs that it was ""clear that the deadlock in Parliament can now only be broken by the issue going back to the people through a general election or a public vote. We areready to support a public vote on any deal."" Green Party co-leader Sian Berrysaid the case for a further referendum was stronger than ever, adding that it was ""the way to draw a line under the Brexit chaos"". Change UK, which also opposes Brexit, failed to win any seats in the election, butleader Heidi Allen told the BBCher party - newly formed from former Labour and Tory MPs - was ""down, but we are not out"". Meanwhile, UKIP, which Mr Farage used to lead, lost all its MEPs, and saw a fall in its vote share of more than 20 points. The party's former deputy leader, Mike Hookem - who lost his seat in Yorkshire and the Humber - blamed UKIP leader Gerard Batten for the result. He highlighted Mr Batten's association with former EDL leader Tommy Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - who also failed to win a seat in the North West Region, where he ran as an independent.

Alternatively, there's further coverage and news as it happens on the BBC News Channel. What happened? So, with results declared up and down the country, the Brexit Party have started from their official launch six weeks ago, to winning 31% of the vote and 29 seats representing the UK in the European Parliament. The Lib Dems came second, gaining 15 seats to win 16 overall. They got 20% of the vote. Labour came third, securing 14% of the vote, and losing 10 of their 20 MEPs from the 2014 Parliament. The Greens came fourth, receiving 12% of the vote. They were awarded seven MEP seats, up from three last time around. The Conservatives came sixth, scoring just 9% of the vote, losing 15 MEPs, and ending up with four seats in the European Parliament. In Scotland, the big story remains the SNP's dominance over other parties - with them winning another MEP seat at this election. In Wales, Plaid Cymru held on to their sole seat. UKIP and Change UK failed to win any seats. Counting continues in Northern Ireland, where the DUP's Diane Dodds is the first to be elected to one of its three European seats. Sinn Fein and the Alliance Party look set to win the other two. Naomi Long, who looks set to secure one of Northern Ireland's three European Parliament seats, says she is overwhelmed by the result. Jeremy Corbyn has written to Labour MPs to say the party is ""ready to support a public vote on any deal"", according to a New Statesman political correspondent. He urged them to ""stay united"", although he acknowledged they were ""understandably concerned"" at the outcome of the EU elections. ""In Parliament our responsibility is to ensure that a Tory civil war does not push us into a no-deal Brexit,"" says the letter, posted on Twitter by Patrick Maguire. ""But it is also clear that the deadlock can now only be broken by the issue going back to the people through a general election or a public vote. We are ready to support a public vote on any deal.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC News Channel Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable says the party's ""next big task"" is to work with others to prevent the UK from ""crashing out of the European Union by accident"". He says it is ""very clear"" that there is a ""clear majority in the country who want to stop Brexit"". ""We've had a brilliant result, we've got a lot now to build on,"" he adds. He says he was ""pleasantly surprised"" at the results overnight, although it was ""clear that we had momentum"". ""The only way now to resolve the issue is to go back to the public,"" he says. Sir Vince adds that ""Jeremy Corbyn's position is now very weak"" and Labour's results were ""almost humiliating"". He says he would be surprised if both Labour and the Conservatives ""survive intact"" during the next general election. Turning to the upcoming Liberal Democrat leadership race, he says he does not have a preference for who takes over. It's won the largest share of the vote and the most seats in the UK's European elections and it's very clear the Brexit Party wants to leave the EU as soon as possible. But with many of its policies unknown and no manifesto, it's not clear exactly what a Brexit Party Brexit would look like. The party's leader Nigel Farage says he wants a ""clean-break"" Brexit, abandoning Theresa May's withdrawal agreement, but he avoids using the term ""no-deal"" Brexit. He wants its newly elected MEPs to play a ""major role"" in the Brexit negotiations but, as the Brexit Party is not in government and has no MPs in the House of Commons, that is unlikely. While the party is offering simple solutions, the Brexit process is a lot more complex. Read more on this here. Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart has been out and about in east London, following his party's hammering in the Euro elections. Mr Stewart tweeted a call for people to come along and talk to him about issues ""beyond Brexit"".

"Seats in the European Parliament representing England, Scotland and Wales are distributed according to the D'Hondt system, a type of proportional representation. The nations are divided into 11 electoral regions: nine in England, plus Scotland and Wales. For this election, Gibraltar votes as part of a combined constituency with the south-west of England. Parties vying for election submit a list of candidates to voters in each region. A system devised by Victor D'Hondt, a Belgian lawyer and mathematician active in the 19th Century, dictates the results: In the first round of counting the party with the most votes wins a seat for the candidate at the top of its list In the second round the winning party's vote is divided by two, and whichever party comes out on top in the re-ordered results wins a seat for their top candidate The process repeats itself, with the original vote of the winning party in each round being divided by one plus their running total of MEPs, until all the seats for the region have been taken By way of example, here are the results for one region of England, the West Midlands, in 2014, which had a total of seven seats in the European Parliament up for grabs. For simplicity's sake, only the five largest parties by vote share are included: UKIP wins the largest number of votes and the candidate at the top of their list is elected. As UKIP already has one candidate elected, its vote is divided by two (one, plus the number of MEPs it has). Now, Labour comes out on top and the candidate at the top of its list of candidates is elected. After Labour's vote is divided by two (one plus the number of MEPs it has), the Conservative Party wins and its top candidate for the region is also elected. After the Conservative vote has been divided by two, UKIP is back on top. The candidate in second place on its list is elected. Since two UKIP candidates have now been elected, their original vote tally is divided by three (one plus the number of MEPs elected) and Labour secures top spot and a second MEP for the region. The original Labour vote is now divided by three (one plus the two MEPs from round five), leaving the Conservative Party to top this round and win a seat for the second person on its list. The Conservative Party vote is now divided by three, leaving UKIP in first place to win the final seat for the third candidate on its list. In Northern Ireland,a different systemis used to elect its three MEPs. Voters have a ""single transferable vote"", meaning that they are able to rank the candidates in order of preference. To make the system work, officials first need to calculate a quota. They take the total number of valid votes cast, divide it by the number of seats available plus one, and then add one. In the first round, if any candidate secures more first-preference votes than the quota, they are elected. Surplus votes, ie those received above the quota, are redistributed among the other candidates. If not enough candidates have yet reached the quota, then the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated, and the lower-preference votes of their supporters are again re-allocated. This process is repeated until the three posts have been filled. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Thousands of supporters spilled onto the roads as an open-top bus carried players from Hampden Park after the Scottish Cup final.

""While this is unfortunate, it is outwith our control and we hope to have another event in the near future to celebrate today's momentous occasion.''

"This photo showing a long queue up to the summit of Everest has gone viral in recent days Nepal's tourism authority has denied accusations that the rise in Mount Everest deaths is solely due to overcrowding. The department's director general Dandu Raj Ghimire said other factors including adverse weather conditions had also contributed. Ten climbers have been reported dead or missing this season. Photos of long queues near the summit have been widely shared as record numbers ascended the mountain in May. Why Mount Everest's summit gets so crowded How deadly is Mount Everest? Mr Ghimire said 381 people had ascended Everest this spring but as periods of fine weather had been short, the number of people on the routes had been ""higher than expected"". In his statement, Mr Ghimire put the current death toll at eight, although 10 people have been reported dead or missing so far. Briton Robin Haynes Fisher, 44, died on Saturdayminutes after reaching Everest's summit. Mr Fisher photographed before ascending Mount Everest Kevin Hynes, 56, from Ireland, died in his tent on Fridayand SÃ©amus Lawless, also Irish, is presumed dead after falling near the summit. One Nepalese, four Indians, an Austrian and an American are also dead or missing. A local tour organiser told AFP that one of the Indian climbers, Nihal Ashpak Bhagwan, died of exhaustion after being ""stuck in traffic for more than 12 hours"". Mr Ghimire offered ""heartfelt condolences to those who've passed away and prayers to those who are still missing"". ""Mountaineering in the Himalayas is in itself an adventurous, complex and sensitive issue requiring full awareness yet tragic accidents are unavoidable,"" he said.

"The NHS has banned the sale of high-energy drinks to children in Scottish hospitals. Shops within hospitals will not be permitted to sell the stimulating drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The ban applies to drinks with an added caffeine content of more than 150mg per litre in an effort to promote a healthy diet. But doctors are calling for the ban to be extended to all under-16s, not just in NHS buildings. All NHS catering sites will also adopt the policy. The move is part of the latest update to the Healthcare Retail Standard, a set of rules all retailers operating in NHS sites in Scotland must adhere to. It aims to increase the amount of healthier food and drinks in shops in NHS buildings, with tighter rules around what can be promoted. Mostmajor supermarkets stopped selling the drinks to under-16s in March 2018, while a teaching union has warned they are having a detrimental effect on both the health and the attention span of pupils. New restrictions on baby food are also being introduced to promote healthy eating as early as possible. Products will have to contain no added sugar or salt and be unsweetened. Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick said: ""The Healthcare Retail Standard supports healthier eating across the NHS estate and it is right that our hospitals show a lead in providing food and drink which is health promoting. ""The HRS ensures that at least 50% of food and 70% of drinks on sale are healthier options. ""This supports the Scottish government's strategy of working to improve Scotland's diet and tackle health inequalities.""

"Robin Fisher was descending from the summit of Everest when he collapsed A British man died on Saturday minutes after summiting Mount Everest, bringing to 10 the total death toll this season on the world's highest peak. Robin Haynes Fisher, 44, reportedly fell ill while descending from the summit. An Irish man,Kevin Hynes, also died on Everest on Friday. Nepal is facing scrutiny for issuing a record 381 permits, at $11,000 (Â£8,600) each, for this year's Spring season. There have been reports of overcrowding and queuing climbers near the summit. This weeka photograph showing the tailbacks on Everest has been shared widelyon social media. Mr Fisher made it to Everest's summit on Saturday morning but collapsed and died only 150m down from the peak, his expedition company confirmed. Guides tried to help Mr Fisher after he ""suddenly fell down"", Murari Sharma of Everest Parivar Expedition said. The recent death toll has already eclipsed the total for 2018 Despite efforts to wake him and to give him oxygen and water, the climber remained unresponsive and guides radioed their base camp to confirm he had died just 45 minutes after Mr Fisher had stood atop the mountain. Reports said one of his Sherpa guides had also complained of feeling ill, and was rescued to a lower camp. A statement from the Birmingham-based British climber's family paid tribute to an ""aspirational adventurer"" who ""lived life to the full"". ""We are deeply saddened by his loss as he still had so many more adventures and dreams to fulfil, the statement added. ""Everyone who ever met him in any capacity will always remember the positive impact he had on their lives."" In total 20 have died in this year's Spring season on the region's mountains Kevin Hynes, 56, from Ireland died on Friday on the northern Tibet side of the mountain. The father-of-two passed away in his tent at 7,000m (23,000ft) after turning back before reaching the mountain's peak. Why Everest's summit gets so crowded How deadly is Mount Everest? Sherpa climbs Everest twice in a week, setting record 24 ascents Other deaths from this week include four people from India, one person from Nepal, an Austrian and an American. A second Irish man, professor SÃ©amus Lawless, is presumed dead after falling on the mountain last week. In a statement on Friday, his family said that the search for his body had been called off in order to not endanger others. There are some 41 teams with 378 climbers who have permits to climb Everest during the spring climbing season in Nepal. That season lasts about three months and generally runs from March through May, and is usually a time when the weather is relatively warmer, views clearer and the chances of snow and rain lower. However, conditions this year have been worse than usual, with high winds leaving a large number of climbers a narrow time frame to reach the summit. This has led to long queues at difficult points on the mountain, exposing climbers to physically taxing conditions for longer than expected. Rising numbers of people climbing - and dying - on Everest has led for calls for permits to be limited. The number of people climbing Everest in 2019 could - after the busy autumn climbing season - exceed last year's record of 807 people reaching the summit.

"The Scottish government has given Â£70,000 to improve the help for families of missing people. The cash will also support vulnerable people who are at risk of going missing. About 55 people - adults and children - are reported missing in Scotland every day. While missing, they are at a higher risk of coming to harm. A new independent working group will help authorities work together to help missing people and those close to them. Anne Foster, whose stepmother disappeared more than a decade ago, said it would be ""absolutely amazing"" to have a more structured form of support for the families left behind. Minister for Community Safety, Ash Denham, has launched a group of expert professionals to look at the gaps which exist in the provision of services. The working group will support the delivery of Scotland's National Missing Persons Framework. The funding will be used to establish a national development co-ordinator who will work closely with local authorities to improve how they and other organisations work together to support vulnerable people and help prevent individuals from going missing. About 23,000 missing persons investigations are undertaken by Police Scotland every year and this latest funding takes the Scottish government's total investment in support for missing people, their families and those at risk of going missing to more than Â£360,000 since 2016. Ms Denham said: ""Families and friends of those who go missing face a huge trauma, particularly when their loved-one remains missing long term. ""The majority of missing people are returned safely within a couple of days but we must continue to improve how we safeguard and support the most vulnerable in Scotland. ""The work of our new national development co-ordinator and working group will build on recent progress and enhance multi-agency working to improve outcomes for missing people and their families."" The scheme has been welcomed by the family of a woman from Livingston who has been missing since 17 June 2008. May Ferns, who was 88, was last seen on a shopping trip to Edinburgh's Princes Street. Her husband Bill has since died without knowing what happened to her. May Ferns went missing on a shopping trip in 2008 Mrs Ferns' step-daughter Anne Foster said she was ""absolutely delighted"" that Scotland was ""leading the way"" with the new working group. She said: ""For people left behind, it's incredibly traumatic. ""I got a lot of support from Missing People Scotland but a lot of people are not aware of the charity. ""They are not aware of the psychological and emotional help that they can get. To have a form of structured support for people who have gone missing or have been left behind is absolutely amazing."" Anne Foster is grateful for the support she got after her step-mother went missing Mrs Foster said there had been ""no signs"" that her step-mother would vanish. She said: ""People have asked us if she had dementia, but she was sharp as a tack. ""Despite her age and frailty, there was was no indication that she could go missing. ""She loved her family - she loved being with her step-children and her grandchildren. She was very much a family member. ""Not knowing is absolute torture. It's not like a death where it's a natural progression in life. You know what's happened to that person and you can celebrate their life and have a finality. ""With May, it's constantly living in limbo."" Prof Hester Parr, who will chair the working group, said: ""This group is comprised of expert professionals with special insights into the complex social and spatial issue of missing persons. ""The working group will assess the national impact of the National Framework for Missing People in Scotland to identify best practice and the gaps which still exist in the provision of professional services to help missing people and their families. ""There is a pressing need to make the ambitions in the Framework a reality and act as more than a symbolic document. This will ensure Scotland remains an international leader in terms of support for missing people."" Susannah Drury of the Missing People charity said: ""It is vital that every one of these people receives the response and support they need, wherever they live.""

"The Scottish government has given Â£70,000 to improve the help for families of missing people. The cash will also support vulnerable people who are at risk of going missing. About 55 people - adults and children - are reported missing in Scotland every day. While missing, they are at a higher risk of coming to harm. A new independent working group will help authorities work together to help missing people and those close to them. Anne Foster, whose stepmother disappeared more than a decade ago, said it would be ""absolutely amazing"" to have a more structured form of support for the families left behind. Minister for Community Safety, Ash Denham, has launched a group of expert professionals to look at the gaps which exist in the provision of services. The working group will support the delivery of Scotland's National Missing Persons Framework. The funding will be used to establish a national development co-ordinator who will work closely with local authorities to improve how they and other organisations work together to support vulnerable people and help prevent individuals from going missing. About 23,000 missing persons investigations are undertaken by Police Scotland every year and this latest funding takes the Scottish government's total investment in support for missing people, their families and those at risk of going missing to more than Â£360,000 since 2016. Ms Denham said: ""Families and friends of those who go missing face a huge trauma, particularly when their loved-one remains missing long term. ""The majority of missing people are returned safely within a couple of days but we must continue to improve how we safeguard and support the most vulnerable in Scotland. ""The work of our new national development co-ordinator and working group will build on recent progress and enhance multi-agency working to improve outcomes for missing people and their families."" The scheme has been welcomed by the family of a woman from Livingston who has been missing since 17 June 2008. May Ferns, who was 88, was last seen on a shopping trip to Edinburgh's Princes Street. Her husband Bill has since died without knowing what happened to her. May Ferns went missing on a shopping trip in 2008 Mrs Ferns' step-daughter Anne Foster said she was ""absolutely delighted"" that Scotland was ""leading the way"" with the new working group. She said: ""For people left behind, it's incredibly traumatic. ""I got a lot of support from Missing People Scotland but a lot of people are not aware of the charity. ""They are not aware of the psychological and emotional help that they can get. To have a form of structured support for people who have gone missing or have been left behind is absolutely amazing."" Anne Foster is grateful for the support she got after her step-mother went missing Mrs Foster said there had been ""no signs"" that her step-mother would vanish. She said: ""People have asked us if she had dementia, but she was sharp as a tack. ""Despite her age and frailty, there was was no indication that she could go missing. ""She loved her family - she loved being with her step-children and her grandchildren. She was very much a family member. ""Not knowing is absolute torture. It's not like a death where it's a natural progression in life. You know what's happened to that person and you can celebrate their life and have a finality. ""With May, it's constantly living in limbo."" Prof Hester Parr, who will chair the working group, said: ""This group is comprised of expert professionals with special insights into the complex social and spatial issue of missing persons. ""The working group will assess the national impact of the National Framework for Missing People in Scotland to identify best practice and the gaps which still exist in the provision of professional services to help missing people and their families. ""There is a pressing need to make the ambitions in the Framework a reality and act as more than a symbolic document. This will ensure Scotland remains an international leader in terms of support for missing people."" Susannah Drury of the Missing People charity said: ""It is vital that every one of these people receives the response and support they need, wherever they live.""

"Former cabinet members Dominic Raab and Andrea Leadsom are the latest Tory MPs to announce they will run for party leader. They become the sixth and seventh candidates to enter the race after Theresa May said she would resign as party leader on 7 June. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Raab said the UK needed to leave the EU on October 31 ""at the latest"". Ms Leadsom said she also supported a no-deal Brexit ""if necessary"". The former Commons leader and Environment Secretary told the Sunday Times  to ""succeed in a negotiation, you have to be prepared to walk away."" Mr Raab - Mrs May's Brexit Secretary before he resigned in November 2018  - said he would ""prefer"" a deal but he said the country needed to ""demonstrate unflinching resolve"" to leave when negotiations end in October. Andrea Leadsom is the latest MP to announce she will stand to become the next prime minister Environment secretary, Michael Gove is also set to announce he will contend for the leadership role, according to the Sunday Times. His supporter - former farming minister, George Eustice - told the paper the next Conservative leader needed to ""respect Brexit"" and ""have the wherewithal to deliver it"". Party bosses expect a new leader to be chosen by the end of July. Who's standing? How the new Tory leader will be chosen Mrs May will continue as prime ministerwhile the leadership contest takes place. Five other candidates have so far confirmed their intention to stand: Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt International Development Secretary Rory Stewart Health Secretary Matt Hancock Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson Former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson, Rory Stewart and Esther McVey have also said they will run for the leadership All the leadership contenders have strived to make their position on Brexit clear totheir electors- the 313 Tory MPs who choose a shortlist and the 124.000 party members who will have the final say. Mr Hancock said Mrs May's successor must be more ""brutally honest"" about the ""trade-offs"" required to get a deal through Parliament. Mr Stewart said he would not serve under rival Boris Johnson because of his backing for a no-deal exit. Mr Hunt told the Sunday Times he had the business experience to avoid a no-deal Brexit. By contrast, Ms McVey told a listener to LBC radio the UK ""had to come out"", and if it that meant a no-deal Brexit then ""that's what it's got to be"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock said he would be ""brutally honest"" on Brexit Mr Raab - also a Brexiteer - told the Mail on Sunday: ""We can't live in a country where politicians make promises to respect your vote in a referendum, and then junk them if they don't like the verdict. ""The country now feels stuck in the mud, humiliated by Brussels and incapable of finding a way forward. The prime minister has announced her resignation. It's time for a new direction."" Mr Raab said ""leadership with conviction"" was needed to change the dynamic of Brexit. He added: ""I will fight for a fairer deal on Brexit, a fairer deal for British workers, and a fairer society where every child can fulfil their potential."" At the time of his resignation as Brexit Secretary Mr Raab said he quit over ""fatal flaws"" in the draft Brexit agreement with the EU. In his Mail in Sunday interview, he said there was still time to negotiate changes to the Northern Irelandbackstop- the agreement to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. He described it as the ""Backstop of EU laws"", over which he said the UK had no say over. He said: ""That is a reasonable, limited, request and would work in all sides' interests. ""It is the only solution MPs have approved. But, we will not be taken seriously in Brussels, unless we are clear that we will walk away on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms, if the EU doesn't budge"" Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class. But Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all: 86% fall into the ABC1 category. Around a quarter of them are, or were, self-employed and nearly half of them work, or used to, in the private sector. Nearly four out of 10 put their annual income at over Â£30,000, and one in 20 put it at over Â£100,000. As such, Tory members are considerably better-off than most voters. Read more from Prof Tim Bale here Tory MPs have until the week commencing 10 June to put their name forward, and any of them can stand - as long as they have the backing of two parliamentary colleagues. The candidates will be whittled down until two remain, and in July all party members will vote to decide on the winner. The last leader elected by the membership was David Cameron in 2005. Theresa May was unopposed in 2016. It will be the first time Conservative members have directly elected a prime minister, as opposed to a leader of the opposition.

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""Never speak ill of our fellow Conservative"" Dominic Raab has been making his pitch to become Conservative leader, as Michael Gove becomes the eighth MP to join the race to succeed Theresa May. Mr Raab told the BBC he would fight for a ""fairer"" Brexit deal with the EU - but if that were not possible, the UK would leave with no deal in October. Mr Gove confirmed he would run to ""deliver Brexit"" and unite the party. Chancellor Philip Hammond said it would be a ""dangerous strategy"" to ignore Parliament, which has opposed no-deal. Boris Johnson, the favourite in the contest, outlinedhis approach to Brexit,externalin his column in Monday's Daily Telegraph, saying: ""No one sensible would aim exclusively for a no-deal outcome. No one responsible would take no-deal off the table."" Tory leadership contenders - who's standing? The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister On Friday, Mrs May announced she would be standing down as Tory leader on 7 June, saying it was time for another prime minister to try to deliver Brexit. It came after a backlash by her MPs against her plan to get the withdrawal deal she had negotiated with the EU through the Commons, which has already rejected it three times. The UK is now set to leave the European Union on 31 October, after the original Brexit date of 29 March was delayed twice owing to the parliamentary deadlock. The delay has meant the UK has had to take part in elections to the European Parliament, three years after it voted to leave the bloc. This video can not be played Gove becomes the eighth candidate to put himself forward Mr Gove, the environment secretary, confirmed on Sunday that he would run for leader, saying: ""I believe that I'm ready to unite the Conservative and Unionist Party, ready to deliver Brexit, and ready to lead this great country."" Speaking to Nick Robinson forBBC Radio 4 podcast Political Thinkingat Hay Festival, Mr Gove explained why he was running, saying: ""The particular mix of experience I have means I can make a contribution."" Mr Gove also said he had changed his mind from 2016 - when he described himself as being ""incapable"" of being Tory leader - adding he had ""evolved as a politician"". While he did not set out his leadership proposal, he did say that the future prime minister would need an eye for detail, as the ""process for taking us out of the European Union requires that"". Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and former Commons leader Andrea Leadsom revealed their leadership bids in the Sunday newspapers. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the UK's previous negotiations with the EU over the withdrawal agreement had not been ""resolute"" enough, and a no-deal Brexit had been taken ""off the table"".

He added: ""I don't want a WTO Brexit but I think unless you are willing to keep our promises as politiciansâ¦ we put ourselves in a much weaker position in terms of getting a deal."" Mrs May, who was at church on Sunday with her husband Philip, resigned on Friday He said there was ""no case for a further extension"" past the current date the UK is due to leave the EU, 31 October. But Chancellor Philip Hammond called for compromise, saying the suggestion that it was possible to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement was a ""fig leaf"" for ""what is actually a policy of leaving on no-deal terms"". That policy was clearly opposed by Parliament, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""This is a parliamentary democracy.

This video can not be played Philip Hammond: ""A prime minister who ignores Parliament cannot expect to survive very long"" They have joined Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, his predecessor Boris Johnson, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock in the battle for the leadership. Tory MPs have until the week beginning 10 June to put their name forward, and the party hopes a new leader will be in place by the end of July. Members will have the final say on who wins, after the shortlist is whittled down to two by a series of votes by Tory MPs. In theSunday Telegraph,external, party chairman Brandon Lewis said the party membership had swelled by 36,000 in the last year - bringing the total to more than 160,000. Mrs May will continue as prime minister while the leadership contest takes place. By Vicki Young, BBC chief political correspondent How the UK leaves the EU has consumed British politics for three years and anyone who wants to be prime minister now has to explain how they can succeed where Theresa May failed. All the contenders in this race face the same dilemma. The first hurdle is to persuade a deeply divided parliamentary party that they have a solution that breaks the stalemate but keeps the party intact. Next they must appeal to the Tory membership - and many of them have no problem with a no-deal Brexit. Finally they will have to govern, and that means winning the confidence of the House of Commons. MPs have already voted overwhelmingly against leaving the EU without a deal and it would take only a handful of Conservative MPs to bring down a prime minister who tried to do so. Some candidates have stressed the need to get a Brexit deal through Parliament. Mr Hunt toldthe Sunday Times,externalhe had the business experience to secure an agreement. ""Doing deals is my bread and butter,"" he said. And in a direct criticism of Boris Johnson, Mr Stewart said: ""I would not serve in the cabinet of someone explicitly pushing for a no-deal Brexit."" Mr Hancock said Mrs May's successor must be ""brutally honest"" about the ""trade-offs"" required to get a deal through Parliament. Environment Secretary Mr Gove said it would be better for the UK ""if we secure a deal and leave the EU in an orderly way"" but added that he had ""come to grips"" with preparing for a no-deal outcome. Meanwhile, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watsontold the Observer,externalthat his party must fully commit to supporting another referendum. Speaking on BBC Radio 5Live's Pienaar's Politics, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said the ""usual suspects"" would blame leader Jeremy Corbyn if Labour performed poorly in the European elections. This video can not be played Shami Chakrabarti: ""What I just heard from Dominic Raab was terrifying to me"" He said: ""Tom Watson's already out, surprise surprise, trying to take on the role of Prince Machiavelli, but I've got news for Tom. Machiavelli was effective. He's a poor imitation of that. If he's trying to turn Labour members against Corbyn and in his favour, then he's going to lose disastrously.

"This video can not be played Amanda Eller spoke to the press from her hospital bed A woman who was found alive two weeks after going missing in Hawaii has told of her ""life or death"" ordeal. Amanda Eller, 35, was last seen on 8 May. Family and friends had launched an intense search effort and offered a cash reward for her safe return. Ms Eller was found on Friday when she waved down a rescue helicopter. Reports say she got lost and injured while hiking on Maui. Photographs show her dirty and slightly injured, but smiling after being rescued. The yoga instructor was found slightly injured, in a deep ravine, by volunteers In an emotional video posted to Facebook on Saturday, the yoga instructor described how she endured ""the toughest days of my life"" while injured in the Hawaiian wilds. Filmed from a hospital bed next to her boyfriend, Benjamin Konkol, she said she ""chose life"" despite ""times of total fear and loss and wanting to give up"". ""I wasn't going to take the easy way out, even if that meant more suffering and pain for myself,"" she said in the video. In another video, taken at a local hospital, Ms Eller's father said he was ""bawling like a baby"" when his daughter was found. Her mother described her as being in ""surprisingly good shape"" considering how long she had been missing. Hiker rescued after hours in quicksand Man survives after taking on mountain lion Local reports suggest she has lost weight, but survived after foraging on berries and local water sources.
