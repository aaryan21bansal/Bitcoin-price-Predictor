"This video can not be played Redknapp has 'no magic wand' for Blues Birmingham City have appointed Harry Redknapp as their new manager. The ex-West Ham, Tottenham and QPR boss succeeds Gianfranco Zola, whoresignedon Monday after a 2-0 defeat by fellow Championship strugglers Burton Albion. Blues are 20th in the table, three points above the relegation zone with three games left, and travel to local rivals Aston Villa on Sunday. ""Birmingham are a proper football club but they are in a precarious position,"" Redknapp, 70, told Talksport. Redknapp chants Birmingham City anthem Redknapp's appointment was announced just 16 hours after Zola's departure, and he says he will initially take charge until the end of the season. He took charge of Jordan for two World Cup qualifiers last year, and worked as an adviser to Derby County last season, but has not managed in England since leaving QPR in February 2015. An FA Cup winner with Portsmouth in 2008, he led Tottenham to the Champions League quarter-finals during a four-year spell at White Hart Lane. In 2016, he was made a director at Wimborne Town and a football consultant for Australian side Central Coast Mariners. Steve Cotterill (left) worked with Harry Redknapp at QPR Redknapp will be assisted by former Bristol City boss Steve Cotterill, who previously worked with him at QPR. ""I got a phone call last night at 7pm from the people at Birmingham,"" he said. ""I drove to London and had a 10-15-minute meeting with them and said: 'I'll come and do it.' ""My wife said to me 'are you mad or what?' but I get fed up sitting around doing nothing."" Blues could be in the relegation zone by the time Redknapp takes charge of his first match, at Villa Park. Should Blackburn and Nottingham Forest both win on Saturday, Birmingham would slip into the bottom three. After facing Villa, Blues host promotion-chasing Huddersfield Town before visiting Bristol City on the final day of the regular season. ""It's a real challenge,"" said Redknapp. ""I'll live up there until the end of the season, and if I keep them up I'll sit down and talk about next season. ""It's not really a risk. They have won two out 22. I haven't got a magic wand. I'm not going to turn them into Real Madrid. We need a win."" Harry Redknapp's managerial career and win ratio Jordan:March 2016 interim manager QPR:Nov 2012-Feb 2015 (34.2%) (First 3 games in charge: DDD) Tottenham:Oct 2008-June 2012 (49.5%) (First 3 games in charge: WDW) Portsmouth:Dec 2005-Oct 2008 (42.5%) (First 3 games in charge: LWD) Southampton:Dec 2004-Dec 2005 (26.5%) (First 3 games in charge: DLD) Portsmouth:Mar 2002-Nov 2004 (46.5%) (First 3 games in charge: LDD) West Ham:Aug 1994-May 2001 (37%) (First 3 games in charge: DLL) Bournemouth:Oct 1983-June 1992 (39.2%) (First 3 games in charge: WDW) When Gary Rowett was sacked in December, Blues were seventh in the table, outside the play-off places only on goal difference, but two wins in 24 matches during Zola's four-month tenure have plunged them into trouble. Speaking when Zola was appointed, director Panos Pavlakis said the Italian's ""pedigree"" matched their ambition to ""move in a new direction"". But, after Monday's defeat by Burton, Zola said: ""I sacked myself. ""I am sorry because I came to Birmingham with huge expectations. It is not that I like quitting, but Birmingham deserves better."" First team coaches Pierluigi Casiraghi and Gabriele Cioffi, fitness coach Andrea Caronti and video analyst Sebastiano Porcu, all part of Zola's backroom team, have followed the Italian out of St Andrew's, but goalkeeper coach Kevin Hitchcock retains his role at the club.

"A look at the life and times of the UK's Prime Minister, Theresa May, who has decided to call a general election for 8 June. Theresa May is Britain's second female prime minister but, unlike her predecessor Margaret Thatcher, she came to power without an election. She took over as leader of the governing Conservative Party last July following the resignation of David Cameron, who had gambled everything on Britain voting to stay in the European Union. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May had been against Brexit but she cleverly managed to keep the Eurosceptics in her party on side during the referendum campaign by keeping a low profile. She reaped her reward by emerging as the unchallenged successor to Mr Cameron - portraying herself as a steady, reliable pair of hands who would deliver the will of the people and take Britain out of the EU in as orderly a fashion as possible. The plan was for there to be no election until 2020, butas the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg explains, the political logic for going to the country earlier became inescapable. With a commanding lead in the opinion polls, the bigger gamble might well have been to wait another three years and risk Brexit negotiations turning sour or the opposition Labour Party recovering ground. Theresa May, back row, right, in the 1999 shadow cabinet The 60-year-old former home secretary has a reputation for a steady, unshowy approach to politics, although she was known in her early days at Westminster for her exotic taste in footwear and a fondness for high fashion (she named a lifetime subscription toVogue as the luxury item she would take to a desert island). She battled her way through the Westminster boy's club as one of a handful of women on the Conservative benches - she would later be joined by more female colleagues thanks, in part, to her own efforts as party chairman to get women candidates into winnable seats. She developed a reputation as a tough, critics would say inflexible, operator, who was not afraid of delivering unpalatable home truths. Some in the Conservative Party have never forgiven her for a 2002 conference speech in which she told members that ""you know what some people call us - the nasty party"". Her lectures to Police Federation conferences as home secretary about the need for reform and to tackle corruption added to this steely reputation. She was always ambitious but her rise through the ranks was steady, rather than meteoric. Who is Theresa May? This video can not be played Theresa May: We need proven leadership to negotiate the best deal Date of birth:1 October 1956 (aged 60) Job:MP for Maidenhead since 1997. Home Secretary since May 2010 Education:Mainly state-educated at Wheatley Park Comprehensive School with a brief time at an independent school; St Hugh's College, Oxford Family:Married to Philip May Hobbies:Cooking - she says she owns 100 recipe books. Occasional mountain walks. On BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2014, she chose Abba's Dancing Queen and Walk Like A Man, from the musical Jersey Boys, among her picks, alongside Mozart and Elgar. On her party's future:""(It is) nothing less than the patriotic duty of our party to unite and to govern in the best interests of the whole country. We need a bold, new positive vision for the future of our country - a country that works not for a privileged few but for every one of us."" Says people want more than just a ""Brexit PM"" and has vowed to unify the Leave and Remain factions in the party. The daughter of a Church of England vicar, Hubert, who died from injuries sustained in a car crash when she was only 25, Theresa May's middle class background has more in keeping with the last female occupant of Downing Street, Margaret Thatcher, than her immediate predecessor. Theresa May married her husband Philip in 1980 Born in Sussex but raised largely in Oxfordshire, Mrs May - both of whose grandmothers are reported to have been in domestic service - attended a state primary, an independent convent school and then a grammar school in the village of Wheatley, which became the Wheatley Park Comprehensive School during her time there. The young Theresa Brasier, as she was then, threw herself into village life, taking part in a pantomime that was produced by her father and working in the bakery on Saturdays to earn pocket money. Friends recall a tall, fashion-conscious young woman who from an early age spoke of her ambition to be the first woman prime minister. The young Theresa Brasier at a function in the village hall Like Margaret Thatcher, she went to Oxford University to study and, like so many others of her generation, found that her personal and political lives soon became closely intertwined. In 1976, in her third year, she met her husband Philip, who was president of the Oxford Union, a well-known breeding ground for future political leaders. The story has it that they were introduced at a Conservative Association disco by the subsequent Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto. They married in 1980. Her university friend Pat Frankland, speaking in 2011 on a BBC Radio 4 profile of the then home secretary, said: ""I cannot remember a time when she did not have political ambitions. ""I well remember, at the time, that she did want to become the first woman prime minister and she was quite irritated when Margaret Thatcher got there first."" Theresa May is seen here as a child with her parents Hubert and Zaidee There are no tales of drunken student revelry, but Pat Frankland and other friends say May was not the austere figure she would later come to be seen as, saying she had a sense of fun and a full social life. After graduating with a degree in Geography, May went to work in the City, initially starting work at the Bank of England and later rising to become head of the European Affairs Unit of the Association for Payment Clearing Services. But it was already clear that she saw her future in politics. She was elected as a local councillor in Merton, south London, and served her ward for a decade, rising to become deputy leader. However, she was soon setting her sights even higher. Mrs May, who has become a confidante as well as role model for aspiring female MPs - told prospective candidates before the 2015 election that ""there is always a seat out there with your name on it"". This video can not be played A look at Theresa May's journey to the top job In her case - like that of Margaret Thatcher - it took a bit of time for her to find hers. She first dipped her toe in the water in 1992, where she stood in the safe Labour seat of North West Durham, coming a distant second to Hilary Armstrong, who went on to become Labour's chief whip in the Blair government. Her fellow candidates in that contest also included a very youthful Tim Farron, who is now Lib Dem leader. Two years later, she stood in Barking, east London, in a by-election where - with the Conservative government at the height of its unpopularity - she got fewer than 2,000 votes and saw her vote share dip more than 20%. But her luck was about to change. The Conservatives' electoral fortunes may have hit a nadir in 1997, when Tony Blair came to power in a Labour landslide, but there was a silver lining for the party and for the aspiring politician when she won the seat of Maidenhead in Berkshire. It's a seat she has held ever since. Mrs May first stood for Parliament in 1992 in North West Durham Theresa May has described her husband Philip as her rock Theresa May bumps into rock star Alice Cooper outside a BBC studio in 2010 An early advocate of Conservative ""modernisation"" in the wilderness years that followed, Mrs May quickly joined the shadow cabinet in 1999 under William Hague as shadow education secretary and in 2002 she became the party's first female chairman under Iain Duncan Smith. She then held a range of senior posts under Michael Howard but was conspicuously not part of the ""Notting Hill set"" which grabbed control of the party after its third successive defeat in 2005 and laid David Cameron and George Osborne's path to power. This was perhaps reflected in the fact that she was initially given the rather underwhelming job of shadow leader of the House of Commons. But she gradually raised her standing and by 2009 had become shadow work and pensions secretary. Nevertheless, her promotion to the job of home secretary when the Conservatives joined with the Lib Dems to form the first coalition government in 70 years was still something of a surprise - given that Chris Grayling had been shadowing the brief in opposition. While the Home Office turned out to be the political graveyard of many a secretary of state in previous decades, Mrs May refused to let this happen - mastering her brief with what was said to be a microscopic attention to detail and no little willingness to enter into battles with fellow ministers when she thought it necessary. Theresa May initially fell down the pecking order under David Cameron but worked her way back up While some in Downing Street worried that the Home Office was becoming her own personal fiefdom, she engendered loyalty among her ministers and was regarded as ""unmovable"" as her tough-talking style met with public approval even when the department's record did not always seem so strong. In his memoir of his time in office, former Lib Dem minister David Laws says: ""She would frequently clash with George Osborne over immigration. She rarely got on anything but badly with Michael Gove. She and Cameron seemed to view each other with mutual suspicion. ""I first met her in 2010. I was sitting in my Treasury office, overlooking St James's Park, me in one armchair and the home secretary in the other, with no officials present. She looked nervous. ""I felt she was surprised to find herself as home secretary. Frankly, I didn't expect her to last more than a couple of years."" Despite her liberal instincts in some policy areas, she frequently clashed with the then deputy prime minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, particularly over her plan to increase internet surveillance to combat terrorism, dubbed the ""Snooper's Charter"" by the Lib Dems. After one ""difficult"" meeting with Mr Clegg, he reportedly told David Laws: ""You know, I've grown to rather like Theresa May... 'She's a bit of an Ice Maiden and has no small talk whatsoever - none. I have quite difficult meetings with her. Cameron once said, 'She's exactly like that with me too!' ""She is instinctively secretive and very rigid, but you can be tough with her and she'll go away and think it all through again."" Mrs May has confronted what she sees as vested interests in the police The new prime minister is a self-declared feminist On the plus side crime levels fell, the UK avoided a mass terrorist attack and in 2013, she successfully deported radical cleric Abu Qatada - something she lists as one of her proudest achievements, along with preventing the extradition to America of computer hacker Gary McKinnon. She was not afraid to take on vested interests, stunning the annual conference of the Police Federation in 2014 by telling them corruption problems were not just limited to ""a few bad apples"" and threatening to end the federation's automatic right to enrol officers as its members. However, the Passport Office suffered a near meltdown while she faced constant criticism over the government's failure to meet its promise to get net migration down to below 100,000 a year. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who went up against her in the Commons as shadow home secretary,told The Guardian:,external""I respect her style - it is steady and serious. She is authoritative in parliament - superficial attacks on her bounce off. ""The flip side is that she is not fleet of foot when crises build, she digs in her heels (remember the Passport Agency crisis in 2014 when the backlog caused hundreds to miss their holidays, and the Border Force crisis in 2011 when border checks were axed). ""And she hides when things go wrong. No interviews, no quotes, nothing to reassure people or to remind people she even exists. It's helped her survive as home secretary - but if you are prime minister, eventually the buck has to stop."" There was a bitter public row with cabinet colleague Michael Gove over the best way to combat Islamist extremism, which ended with Mr Gove having to apologise to the prime minister and Mrs May having to sack a long-serving special adviser - a turf war which is said to have led to a diminution in her admiration for the prime minister. Former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke also had run-ins with her and was recorded on camera ahead of an interview last week saying that Mrs May was good at her job but a ""bloody difficult woman"" - before adding as an aside, a bit like Mrs Thatcher. A reference to be Conservative leader can hardly come better than that. Mrs May has never been one of the most clubbable of politicians and is someone who prefers not having to tour the tea rooms of the House of Commons - where tittle-tattle is freely exchanged. She has rarely opened up about her private life although she revealed in 2013 that she had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and would require insulin injections twice a day for the rest of her life - something she says she had come to terms with and which would not affect her career. Mrs May's taste in footwear has kept photographers interested for more than a decade Generally thought to be in the mainstream of Conservative thinking on most economic and law and order issues, she has also challenged convention by attacking police stop and search powers and calling for a probe into the application of Sharia Law in British communities. She also expressed a personal desire to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights but later said she would not pursue this as PM due to a lack of parliamentary support - an example of what many believe will be pragmatism in office. Her social attitudes are slightly harder to pin down. She backed same sex marriage. She expressed a personal view in 2012 that the legal limit on abortion should be lowered from 24 to 20 weeks. Along with most Conservative MPs she voted against an outright ban on foxhunting. What is undisputable is that at 59, Mrs May was the oldest leader to enter Downing Street since James Callaghan in 1976 and is the first prime minister since Ted Heath who does not have children. Mrs May has worked closely with David Cameron and will now succeed him Mrs May has been the most senior female Cabinet minister for the past six years One of Westminster's shrewdest as well as toughest operators, Mrs May's decision to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU but to do so in an understated way and to frame her argument in relatively narrow security terms reaped dividends after the divisive campaign. During what turned out to be a short-lived leadership campaign, Mrs May played strongly on her weight of experience, judgement and reliability in a time of crisis. The first months of Mrs May's time in Downing Street have been dominated by the process of divorcing the UK from the EU - but there have been signs that she won't be content with the ""safe pair of hands"" tag that is often  attached to her. Brexit, she has said, won't be allowed purely to define her time in office and she has promised a radical programme of social reform, underpinned by values of One Nation Toryism, to promote social mobility and opportunity for the more disadvantaged in society. Policies such as new grammar schools or more selection have been put forward - but with a slender parliamentary majority of 17 her government had little breathing room on bringing forward tightly contested legislation. So, despite promising not to hold a general election before she had to, in 2020, she has now decided to seek a mandate for her own particular brand of Conservatism to, as she put it, to ""guarantee certainty and security for the years ahead"".

"The world has been consumed by the fear of war in Korea over the past week - everywhere, it seems, except Korea.  The BBC's correspondent in the South Korean capital says there is a disconnect between the hyped-up atmosphere and the reality on the ground. I get emails from people in Europe asking me whether nuclear war is about to start - and then I look out of the window, in Seoul, and see a market where people amble gently between the stalls, sampling street food. Around the world, headlines scream ""danger"" - but at what would be the epicentre of any war, there's not the slightest sign of fear. While tension mounts far away, street dancers in Seoul accost passers-by with pamphlets advertising a concert. Who's right? The headline writers or the putative war victims? Has the world suddenly got much more dangerous? In one way, it obviously has. North Korea is closer to possessing effective nuclear warheads and missiles, simply because it's had longer to sort out the problems. North Korea tests missiles every one or two weeks to learn from their mistakes. Speaking at the DMZ, US Vice-President Mike Pence said the ""era of strategic patience is over"" But the expert view is that North Korea does not have the capability to strike the United States. It is making progress, but it isn't there yet. A day after the fearsome display of missiles in Pyongyang, North Korea launched a dud - another one. The other new element is President Trump himself. He's been sending different messages, which require a little analysis. Under President Obama, the policy was called ""strategic patience"" - squeeze North Korea with sanctions, persuade others to do the same, particularly China, and sit it out. At the demilitarized zone (DMZ) this week, Vice-President Mike Pence said the ""era of strategic patience is over"". Pence warns North Korea not to test Donald Trump North Korea 'will test missiles weekly', senior official tells BBC North Korea: What can the outside world do? North Korea nuclear: US 'working with China' on response But is it? Or does it continue under another name? The military option - an attack on North Korean nuclear installations - was considered by previous presidents and ruled out because half the population of South Korea lives in the greater Seoul area, which is within easy range of North Korean artillery. That remains true. Decapitation - the assassination of Kim Jong-un - has also not happened for a variety of reasons: success couldn't be guaranteed, and it isn't clear what orders the military might have to retaliate against South Korea if the north's ""supreme leader"" were attacked. That hasn't changed. Kim Jong-Un has defied international pressure to abandon his nuclear weapons programme Whether the policy really has changed depends on whether President Trump has a different attitude to risk and the potential cost of war, perhaps a war that would suck in China. In 1994, President Clinton considered attacking North Korean nuclear sites. The United States had information the regime was about to move fuel rods from its reactor at Yongbyon, to the north of Pyongyang, to a reprocessing centre (the first step in making a nuclear bomb). Plans  were made to send fighters and cruise missiles to attack, but the order was never given. President Clinton's Defence Secretary William Perry feared retaliation against South Korea. But it was a plan that scared the North Koreans and enabled a deal to be done. The US provided fuel to a fuel-starved economy, and North Korea agreed to freeze its programme (though it then cheated and the deal fell apart in 2002). Today, Mr Perry believes the opportunity for what he calls ""creative diplomacy"" is there, particularly because China may be more helpful than it was during the Clinton presidency. North Korea has to believe that the United States might attack and that, on this reasoning, makes President Trump's unpredictability an asset. The recent parade in Pyongyang featured what appeared to be a new class of land-based ballistic missile In recent days, the administration has downplayed the idea of attacking North Korea. National security adviser Lt Gen HR McMaster said on Sunday: ""All our options are on the table."" But, crucially, he added: ""It's time for us to undertake all actions we can, short of a military option, to try to resolve this peacefully."" There is a pessimistic view and an optimistic view. The bleak view is that President Trump is way out of his depth and acts impulsively. On this reading, we are in great danger. Sir Max Hastings, the author of an acclaimed history of the Korean War, has written: ""As ever with this president, it is impossible to judge whether he means what he says, or even understands the significance of his words."" He cited a scenario that in his view echoed the way the world stumbled into war in 1914, through the ""dysfunctional personality"" of a leader. The nightmare scenario now would be: ""The United States delivers an ultimatum to North Korea, insisting it renounces its nuclear weapons. ""The half-crazed regime in the capital, Pyongyang, refuses. ""US aircraft and missiles strike at Kim Jong-Un's nuclear facilities. ""North Korea's neighbour and ally, China, responds by hitting carriers of the US Seventh Fleet in the Pacific. ""Suddenly, a major war erupts."" Might Mr Trump negotiate with North Korea? But there is a more peaceful scenario, suggested by some experts in South Korea. Prof John Delury, of Yonsei University, in Seoul, says: ""The smart play for Mr Trump would be to return to those five wise words he said about Mr Kim on the campaign trail, 'I would speak to him.' ""The United States should swiftly negotiate a bilateral deal that freezes Mr Kim's nuclear and missile programme."" Under this scenario, money - a lot of money - would be given to North Korea in order to improve its economy. There would probably have to be a guarantee that the regime wouldn't be toppled. In this case, Kim Jong-un would have to be ready to negotiate (a huge if) and some trust would have to be put in him not to cheat and not to keep demanding more (another big if). Which way will Trump jump?

"The US-led coalition appears confident that fighters of the so-called Islamic State (IS) will be defeated in Mosul. But the battle for Iraq's second largest city has already been going on for six months and the Iraqi forces have only just reached the edges of the old city. Optimism has been tempered by the slow progress of what has become a brutal fight for every street. In the words of the US coalition spokesman Col John Dorrian ""the fight's been very, very slow and very, very hardâ¦ its gut-busting"". We joined the Iraqi forces about to launch yet another assault to take more territory. Over the past few weeks, the initial advance has slowed to a crawl with the front lines relatively static. They want to break the deadlock. This is the story of just one battle. This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Beale and cameraman Barnaby Mitchell are embedded with Iraqi troops They mass under the cover of darkness. The same Iraq units who've been fighting here for months. The troops both battle hardened and battle weary. It's supposed to be a surprise dawn attack. But IS will be lying in wait. As we move forward on foot we soon come under fire. We follow one of the Iraqi commanders, Maj Mohammed, as he sets up a makeshift headquarters in an abandoned house that's already seen heavy fighting. There's IS graffiti on the walls. Battle for west Mosul: Bombs 'fall like rain' on front line 'First chemical attack' in Mosul battle Iraqi forces retake Mosul's Badoush prison As his troops advance there is a sudden, panicked call on the radio. It's his first casualties. They've walked into a booby-trapped building: several men have been injured and they're calling for help. The battle to drive IS fighters out of Mosul has been going on for six months There's no let-up in the fighting as dawn breaks amid the heavy thud of machine guns firing on both sides. We hear coalition aircraft overhead. Then a whoosh and a thud, followed by an explosion. One of the IS heavy machine guns has been silenced by a coalition airstrike. There are several more over the next few hours - uncomfortably close. An Iraqi soldier smiles and points as a bomb travels at speed towards another IS-held building nearby. In the distance we can now see the black flag of IS flying. And nearer, the buildings and the holes in the wall from where they're firing. There's another whoosh, thud and boom and then a plume of smoke from an air strike. We're told to stay inside because the Iraqi forces have heard a small IS drone. They're often armed with grenades. Five hours later, the battle is still raging over the same few streets. An Iraqi armoured bulldozer tries to clear a path through the wrecked cars and rubble to help the advance. But the driver is targeted by an IS rocket-propelled grenade. There's a frantic effort to free him from the cabin. His comrades eventually succeed but he's lost limbs and is bleeding profusely. The Iraqi forces have to contend with booby traps and air attacks from IS drones No-one can question the bravery of the Iraqi forces, but you can see the losses and the expectations of victory weighing heavily on their shoulders. We ask to leave when IS begin to mortar the Iraqi positions. The impact sends brick and concrete flying through the air. The building we are taking shelter in shudders and then there's a cloud of debris. Someone shouts ""Gas!"" but thankfully it's not. We leave in the same Humvee we first arrived in. The seats are now stained in blood from ferrying the wounded. By the end of the day, the Iraqi forces have taken a few more streets. But this is unforgiving, urban warfare and for the Iraqi forces there is still a mountain to climb.

"This video can not be played Heligoland: When Britain blew up an island Brexit may have triggered a political earthquake in Europe, but 70 years ago the UK sent real shockwaves across the seas with the largest non-nuclear explosion of that era. As one of the four victorious allied powers after World War Two, Britain was governing a large area of occupied Germany. The British sector included the tiny island of Heligoland, which had long been a source of diplomatic tension between the two countries. So, when in 1947 the British needed a safe place to dispose of thousands of tonnes of unexploded ammunition, Heligoland must have seemed an obvious choice. The code-name for the plan combined the British flair for understatement with the military taste for the literal-minded; it was to be called Operation Big Bang. The Heligoland Big Bang was the largest non-nuclear detonation to date Heligoland had been a German naval fortress, and historian Jan RÃ¼ger, author of Heligoland: Britain, Germany, and the Struggle for the North Sea, says Operation Big Bang was designed by the British to make a big point. ""They're very clear that there's a symbolic side to this [operation] and that is the German tradition of militarism,"" he explains. ""There's a sense that Prussian militarism and its threat to Britain has to end and that's very much how Operation Big Bang is received in Britain."" The operation was carefully stage-managed - the old black and white pictures even include a close-up of a Royal Navy officer's finger triggering the blast. Aerial footage shows the entire horizon erupting in a huge grey curtain of mud, sand and rock. For the Royal Navy and the British Army of Occupation it was mission accomplished. Heligoland was evacuated during World War Two For the people of Heligoland it felt very different. Europe in 1946 and 1947 was in chaos, with millions of displaced and dispossessed families drifting between camps or sheltering in ruined buildings. The island had been evacuated during the war and many Heligolanders were living in exile in the coastal city of Cuxhaven about 60km (37 miles) to the south. Olaf Ohlsen, who was 11 years old in 1947, gathered with the rest of the exiled population on the cliffs to listen for the sound of the explosion. Few people in history can have lived through such a moment, standing at the edge of sea knowing that they would hear but not see an explosion that they knew would destroy their homes. Heligolander Olaf Ohlsen was 11 years old when the detonation took place Olaf says everyone knew that the explosion would be shattering. ""Even in Hamburg, which is more than 150 km (93 miles) from the island,"" he told me, ""a schoolteacher kept a document which said the British had warned everyone to leave doors and windows open to help the buildings withstand the blast."" Olaf's father was among the pessimists who believed that Britain's real intention was to blow up the island behind a literal smokescreen created by the destruction of the captured ammunition. He still recalls the first time his father brought news of what had happened after the blast, shouting with excitement: ""Heligoland is still here, it's still here."" In the middle of the 20th Century Heligoland still mattered to its people, fiercely independent speakers of a Friesian dialect who are neither British nor German. Heligoland was a German military base in both world wars But it had lost the strategic importance that made it a crucial bone of contention between the great powers of Europe a hundred years earlier. Britain occupied Heligoland in the Napoleonic period as part of its complex manoeuvrings to deny the French leader the support of the navies of Scandinavia as he took over huge parts of Europe. Thus the British found themselves with a handy naval base that guarded the entrance to the port of Hamburg and allowed it to slip secret agents freely into Napoleonic Europe. By the time they gifted it to the Kaiser in 1890, though, its usefulness appeared to be at an end. Detlev Rickmers, a local hotel owner whose family have been Heligolanders for 500 years, says that even though it's more than a century since the link was broken, a sense of Britishness ran through the population for a long time after 1890. ""Of course there was a British governor, there was a sense of being British,"" he says. ""There were connections to Britain. My grandfather told me that he always remembered the excitement of the days when the salesman would call from Huntley and Palmer."" In the wake of the Big Bang, of course, things are very different. 70 years on, the crater from the explosion is still a feature of the island The British bombing operation acted as a kind of catalyst for a new form of post-war German nationalism. There were campaigns for the island to be returned to German sovereignty and for a rebuilding programme to allow the Heligolanders to go home. Historian Jan RÃ¼ger says that perhaps for the last time Operation Big Bang had made Heligoland part of a larger historical argument. ""As always in history there's a paradoxical side to these events,"" he says. ""In this case it lies in the way that all over Germany this is seen as a moment that victimises the Germans and allows them to see themselves as victims after a war in which the rest of Europe has been the victim of German aggression."" The British bombing left Heligoland's landscape pock-marked and cratered. But the island endured: a stubborn lump of rock in the North Sea. And while most visitors are drawn these days by the lure of duty-free shopping, Heligoland has a fascinating story to tell to anyone who'll listen.

"For more than two thousand years people have believed that joint pain could be triggered by bad weather, but the link has never been proven. Now, by harnessing the power of thousands of volunteers, doctors hope to unravel the mystery. And the new technique could offer countless solutions to a whole host of ailments. ""I'm always in pain, 24/7,"" says Becky Mason, sitting at home on her sofa in Alsager near Manchester. Like millions of people around the world she suffers from pains in her muscles and stiffness in her joints. ""I know, if it's going to be a very damp cold day, it's likely that my pain is going to be worse."" She has discussed it with her GP and has always wondered if there really is a link between her pain and the weather. Becky isn't alone. The link between joint pain and bad weather has long been suspected by patients and medical professionals alike and the theory dates back at least to Roman times and possible earlier. ""Is it an old wives tale? Am I imagining it?"" she asks. It's a question she finally hopes to answer, not by visiting a hospital or undergoing tests, but simply by using her smartphone. Each day she enters information about how she feels into an app on her phone, the phone's GPS pinpoints her location, pulls the latest weather information from the internet, and fires a package of data to a team of researchers. On its own Becky's data is of limited interest, but she isn't acting alone. More than 13,000 volunteers have signed up for the same study, sending vast quantities of information into a database - more than four million data points so far. Volunteers using the 'Cloudy with a chance of pain app', developed by data capture firm umotif The app, called ""Cloudy with a Chance of Pain"" is part of a research project being run by Will Dixon. He is a consultant rheumatologist at Salford Royal Hospital and has spent years researching joint pain. ""At almost every clinic I run, one or more patients will tell me that their joint pains are better or worse because of the weather"" he says, but until now he has never had the means of collecting enough data to find a conclusive answer. Which is perhaps a good point to explain Will Dixon'sotherjob title - Professor of Digital Epidemiology. Traditional epidemiologists study health and disease in particular populations. Usually it means collecting data in person - asking patients to visit you, or heading out into the field. 'Shoe leather epidemiology', it is sometimes called. Professor Will Dixon But digital epidemiology allows patients to send detailed information over the internet - which means they can do it more regularly, and of course you can get many more people to take part, thousands more; numbers that would be unthinkable using the old methods. By combing through that data, Professor Dixon hopes it will be possible to find correlations and clues that would have been hidden to doctors just a decade ago. His team will analyse the data over the coming year, and hope to find a definitive answer to the question. World Hacks is a new BBC team looking at global problems. We meet the people fixing the world. Get the World Hacks podcast Check out our Facebook page,external The technique isn't just limited to arthritis research. Another study underway in the US has recruited more than 20,000 participants using an app that asks them to say ""ahhhhhhh"" into their phone. Named mPower, and built using technology developed by British academic Max Little, the project hopes to find out more about the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease. If the ""ahhhhhhh"" sound is smooth and unbroken, it has likely come from a healthy patient. But if it breaks and wavers, it could suggest that the patient may have Parkinson's. By monitoring the precise pattern and pitch of the noise, it may even be possible to determine how advanced the disease has become, or how strongly its symptoms are being felt at a given moment. Using that information, it could allow patients to take much more specific doses of a drug to help manage the disease. The software is even being used in a clinical trial for a new drug. And again, it is the accumulation of vast amounts of data, volunteered by thousands of participants, that is making the study possible. Another app, soon to be launched, will allow users to photograph their plate of food, and use artificial intelligence to work out what's on the plate. The technology could help people determine the nutritional content of their meal, and allow public health bodies to track how well any particular population is eating. It is being developed by Marcel Salathe, also a Professor of Digital Epidemiology and founder of what is likely the world's first lab dedicated to the field of study. Marcel Salathe is a professor of digital epidemiology at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne He thinks the discipline could have particular benefits in parts of the world where basic medical infrastructure is lacking, but lots of people have smart-phones. Digital epidemiology could become the reporting network through which sickness outbreaks are initially detected, he says. But vast amounts of data don't come without their own unique set of difficulties, he warns. ""The data can be extremely noisy,"" he explains. ""Dealing with very large data sets and finding a needle in the haystack is very challenging from a technical perspective."" Perhaps the most interesting part of this new technique is the motivation of the people donating their data. 'Cloudy with a Chance of Pain' may never reap rewards for Becky herself, yet she seems quite happy to spend her time putting her data into a smartphone app and then sending this off to a remote location. ""When you're in pain all the time, it's easy to get low,"" she says ""I'm at home and I can't work which makes me feel useless. But [with this app] I can still be helpful, and that's so powerful in my tiny little world, it helps me in a massive way.""

"This video can not be played The BBCâs John Sudworth asks North Koreaâs vice-foreign minister what message he has for Donald Trump Two days ago, I stood on the edge of Kim Il-sung Square in the centre of Pyongyang and watched, with a mixture of awe and unease, as North Korea's giant military parade passed by. Back in that same location today, the vast space of the square was almost empty except for a few government workers on foot and the odd car - which pretty much sums up the traffic situation, or lack of it, in this isolated, sanction-hit city. My government minders ushered me up the steps of the foreign ministry and I soon found myself sitting face to face with Vice-Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol. Were some of the weapons on display in the parade, as many analysts have speculated, new intercontinental ballistic missiles? I asked him. ""The respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un in his historic new year address this year said that we are at the final stage of preparations to launch an ICBM (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile),"" he replied. ""I'm no military expert,"" he went on, ""but I hope that there was an ICBM among the missiles shown at the parade."" What can the outside world do about N Korea? All about North Korea's missiles This video can not be played The BBC's John Sudworth, in Pyongyang, explains what may happen next North Korea needs such weapons, he said, ""in order to protect our government and system from threat and provocation from the United States"". And in a direct riposte to US President Donald Trump and his assertion that North Korea will not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, Mr Han added this. ""According to our own schedule we'll be conducting more tests on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis."" North Korea has long been seen to use provocation and brinkmanship to raise tension for its own strategic advantage. It is then able to win diplomatic and economic concessions through negotiations to defuse the crisis, only later to go on to renege on its disarmament commitments. As the cycle begins again, at each stage, it moves a step closer to its goal of becoming a fully-fledged nuclear power. But while the current state of technological advancement of North Korea's weapons programme matters deeply to the outside world, in particular its near neighbours, the hostile rhetoric is rarely something to take at face value. Read between the lines and, mostly, it is always conditional, peppered with ifs and buts, as it was today. ""If the US goes on with their reckless option of using military means then that would mean from that very day, an all out war,"" Mr Han told me. The interview does though give a hint of the new worrying unpredictability at play. Donald Trump's recent ordering of the airstrike on a Syrian airbase has clearly rattled Pyongyang and the threat now is not simply of retaliation to an attack, but even, Mr Han suggests, to the planning of one. ""If the USA encroaches upon our sovereignty then it will provoke our immediate counter reaction and if it is planning a military attack against us, we will react with a nuclear pre-emptive strike by our own style and method."" Experts say an all-out war is very unlikely However, despite the posturing on both sides, the risks, most observers agree, are still limited. For the US and its allies, war carries incalculable risks and although Washington insists that all options are on the table, it now appears to be signalling that diplomacy and toughened sanctions are the most likely way forward. It is as yet unclear how, having failed before, those things will force this most totalitarian of states to give up its nuclear weapons. As Vice-Foreign Minister Han made clear to me, North Korea has learned the lessons from recent history, in particular the US-led attempts at regime change in Iraq and Libya. ""If the balance of power is not there, then the outbreak of war is imminent and unavoidable."" ""If one side has nukes and the other side doesn't, and they're on bad terms, war will inevitably break out,"" he said. ""This is the lesson shown by the reality of the countries in the Middle East, including Libya and Syria where people are suffering from great misfortune."" The vice-foreign minister said North Korean people are guaranteed their human rights Within the city limits of Pyongyang, foreign journalists get to see very little of ordinary life on these carefully choreographed and highly controlled media tours. Even further beyond reach, good evidence shows, lie the vast political prisons in which all dissent and opposition to the system, however mild, is crushed. Rather than building nuclear weapons, I ask Mr Han, wouldn't North Korea be better improving life for its own people, perhaps starting with abolishing those gulags? ""We do not tolerate any others criticising our style of socialism and we believe in the choice we have made,"" Mr Han replies. ""The masses are the centre of our state and their security and human rights are guaranteed."" ""As for the so called political prison camps you have just mentioned,"" he went on, ""it is something that our enemies have fabricated and it has been disseminated by their followers in order to demonise our country"". The message is clear. Militarised and isolated, North Korea has the right to follow its own path and, Mr Han apparently believes, no one will be able to stop it. So far, he has been proven right.

"Lisbonne and Hawaii were saved from a house fire thanks to home security tech Christophe Deschamps was watching a basketball game with his wife and three children when he received an alert on his smartphone. The home security system told him something was wrong, so he quickly accessed the video feed on his phone. ""I could see smoke,"" he says. Their home, in the Wallonia region of southern Belgium, was on fire. The family's thoughts immediately turned to their two Bernese Mountain dogs - Lisbonne and Hawaii - locked in the garage. A terrible family tragedy was threatening to unfold. The video images now showed the smoke getting thicker and brightness coming from flames off-camera. The fire alarm had already alerted the firefighters, so the Deschamps family rushed home as quickly as they could. ""It was more important for us to save the dogs than the house,"" says Christophe. ""My wife was crying and panicking, thinking the dogs could die."" The security camera recorded the progress of the fire in the Deschamps' home Fortunately, Lisbonne and Hawaii were saved with just 20cm of air left to breathe above the floor of the smoke-filled garage. But the fire damage to the house took six months to repair. The dogs' lucky escape was due to the indoor security camera Christophe had installed. The smart camera, made by Netatmo, sends alerts when it hears an alarm - whether smoke, carbon monoxide or security - and automatically starts recording. It is also one of the first smart home cameras featuring face recognition technology capable of distinguishing between people it knows and strangers. Parents working late can receive alerts when their kids arrive home, for example, and will receive an ""unknown face seen"" alert if someone breaks in. The French company says evidence collected by its smart cameras has led to the successful prosecution of burglars. Netatmo's video camera includes facial recognition capability The connected home security market is expanding fast, with companies such as Withings, Nest, D-Link, Netgear, Philips, Panasonic - not to mention the tech behemoths Apple, Amazon and Samsung - all offering an expanding array of internet-connected smart gadgets, from thermostats to motion-sensitive cameras with infrared and audio capability. ""We put the connected home security market at 95.4 million unit sales in 2016,"" says Francesco Radicati, a technology specialist at consultancy Ovum. ""Service providers, such as Qivicon, AT&T Digital Life, and Vivint Smart Home, are selling device multi-packs including multiple sensors, and these are proving very popular. ""We estimate the market will grow to 744 million devices sold in 2021."" Innovations are coming on to the market thick and fast. For example, connected light bulb firm LIFX has produced a version that can beam infrared light outdoors, enabling a compatible security camera, such as the Nest Cam Outdoor, to see better in the dark. The key innovation, however, has been the integration of the smartphone into such connected networks, giving users remote control wherever they have an internet connection. Google-owned Nest is developing a suite of connected home devices But aren't all these security cameras intrusive and even a little voyeuristic? Netatmo has addressed this issue by making its Welcome camera programmable, so you can disable recording for individuals you specify. And most camera systems can be disabled remotely. It isn't just our homes that technology is helping keep safe. Cars are also a common target for thieves. This is why Matej Persolja, 33, founded CarLock, a company based in Nova Gorica, Slovenia, and San Francisco in the US. CarLock's system plugs into a vehicle's onboard diagnostics port and sends an alarm to your phone if your vehicle is moved, the engine starts, it detects unusual vibration, or if the gadget is disconnected. Mr Persolja started the business after thinking his car had been stolen. It turned out his car had only been moved to make way for construction work taking place in the area. CarLock can track your car's position ""Before I learned that, I was almost certain my car had been stolen and I still remember that awful feeling,"" he says. The CarLock system enables owners to track the location of their car if it has been stolen and also acts like a telematics box recording driving behaviour and the general health of the engine. And there are a growing number of remote control apps for cars on the market. Viper's SmartStart app - currently only available in the US and Canada - enables you to start your car, lock and unlock it, and track its movements remotely using your smartphone. Remote starting is useful for de-icing your car in the mornings while you get ready for work and have breakfast. Even if someone sees the car running and a thief smashes a window to steal it, the physical key is still needed to drive the car off. You can also keep an eye on your kids' driving habits and receive an alert if they take the car beyond a geographical point that you specify. Ford is even integrating Amazon's Alexa voice-activated software into its cars, enabling drivers to remotely start their cars with a voice command and personal identification number. Of course, the elephant in the room with all these connected security products is the risk of being hacked. The UK'sNational Cyber Security Centre recently demonstratedhow a connected doll could be hacked and used to open remote control door locks. Andpoorly secured security cameras have been hijacked to carry out web attacks.

"A look at the life and times of the UK's Prime Minister, Theresa May, who has decided to call a general election for 8 June. Theresa May is Britain's second female prime minister but, unlike her predecessor Margaret Thatcher, she came to power without an election. She took over as leader of the governing Conservative Party last July following the resignation of David Cameron, who had gambled everything on Britain voting to stay in the European Union. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May had been against Brexit but she cleverly managed to keep the Eurosceptics in her party on side during the referendum campaign by keeping a low profile. She reaped her reward by emerging as the unchallenged successor to Mr Cameron - portraying herself as a steady, reliable pair of hands who would deliver the will of the people and take Britain out of the EU in as orderly a fashion as possible. The plan was for there to be no election until 2020, butas the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg explains, the political logic for going to the country earlier became inescapable. With a commanding lead in the opinion polls, the bigger gamble might well have been to wait another three years and risk Brexit negotiations turning sour or the opposition Labour Party recovering ground. Theresa May, back row, right, in the 1999 shadow cabinet The 60-year-old former home secretary has a reputation for a steady, unshowy approach to politics, although she was known in her early days at Westminster for her exotic taste in footwear and a fondness for high fashion (she named a lifetime subscription toVogue as the luxury item she would take to a desert island). She battled her way through the Westminster boy's club as one of a handful of women on the Conservative benches - she would later be joined by more female colleagues thanks, in part, to her own efforts as party chairman to get women candidates into winnable seats. She developed a reputation as a tough, critics would say inflexible, operator, who was not afraid of delivering unpalatable home truths. Some in the Conservative Party have never forgiven her for a 2002 conference speech in which she told members that ""you know what some people call us - the nasty party"". Her lectures to Police Federation conferences as home secretary about the need for reform and to tackle corruption added to this steely reputation. She was always ambitious but her rise through the ranks was steady, rather than meteoric. Who is Theresa May? This video can not be played Theresa May: We need proven leadership to negotiate the best deal Date of birth:1 October 1956 (aged 60) Job:MP for Maidenhead since 1997. Home Secretary since May 2010 Education:Mainly state-educated at Wheatley Park Comprehensive School with a brief time at an independent school; St Hugh's College, Oxford Family:Married to Philip May Hobbies:Cooking - she says she owns 100 recipe books. Occasional mountain walks. On BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2014, she chose Abba's Dancing Queen and Walk Like A Man, from the musical Jersey Boys, among her picks, alongside Mozart and Elgar. On her party's future:""(It is) nothing less than the patriotic duty of our party to unite and to govern in the best interests of the whole country. We need a bold, new positive vision for the future of our country - a country that works not for a privileged few but for every one of us."" Says people want more than just a ""Brexit PM"" and has vowed to unify the Leave and Remain factions in the party. The daughter of a Church of England vicar, Hubert, who died from injuries sustained in a car crash when she was only 25, Theresa May's middle class background has more in keeping with the last female occupant of Downing Street, Margaret Thatcher, than her immediate predecessor. Theresa May married her husband Philip in 1980 Born in Sussex but raised largely in Oxfordshire, Mrs May - both of whose grandmothers are reported to have been in domestic service - attended a state primary, an independent convent school and then a grammar school in the village of Wheatley, which became the Wheatley Park Comprehensive School during her time there. The young Theresa Brasier, as she was then, threw herself into village life, taking part in a pantomime that was produced by her father and working in the bakery on Saturdays to earn pocket money. Friends recall a tall, fashion-conscious young woman who from an early age spoke of her ambition to be the first woman prime minister. The young Theresa Brasier at a function in the village hall Like Margaret Thatcher, she went to Oxford University to study and, like so many others of her generation, found that her personal and political lives soon became closely intertwined. In 1976, in her third year, she met her husband Philip, who was president of the Oxford Union, a well-known breeding ground for future political leaders. The story has it that they were introduced at a Conservative Association disco by the subsequent Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto. They married in 1980. Her university friend Pat Frankland, speaking in 2011 on a BBC Radio 4 profile of the then home secretary, said: ""I cannot remember a time when she did not have political ambitions. ""I well remember, at the time, that she did want to become the first woman prime minister and she was quite irritated when Margaret Thatcher got there first."" Theresa May is seen here as a child with her parents Hubert and Zaidee There are no tales of drunken student revelry, but Pat Frankland and other friends say May was not the austere figure she would later come to be seen as, saying she had a sense of fun and a full social life. After graduating with a degree in Geography, May went to work in the City, initially starting work at the Bank of England and later rising to become head of the European Affairs Unit of the Association for Payment Clearing Services. But it was already clear that she saw her future in politics. She was elected as a local councillor in Merton, south London, and served her ward for a decade, rising to become deputy leader. However, she was soon setting her sights even higher. Mrs May, who has become a confidante as well as role model for aspiring female MPs - told prospective candidates before the 2015 election that ""there is always a seat out there with your name on it"". This video can not be played A look at Theresa May's journey to the top job In her case - like that of Margaret Thatcher - it took a bit of time for her to find hers. She first dipped her toe in the water in 1992, where she stood in the safe Labour seat of North West Durham, coming a distant second to Hilary Armstrong, who went on to become Labour's chief whip in the Blair government. Her fellow candidates in that contest also included a very youthful Tim Farron, who is now Lib Dem leader. Two years later, she stood in Barking, east London, in a by-election where - with the Conservative government at the height of its unpopularity - she got fewer than 2,000 votes and saw her vote share dip more than 20%. But her luck was about to change. The Conservatives' electoral fortunes may have hit a nadir in 1997, when Tony Blair came to power in a Labour landslide, but there was a silver lining for the party and for the aspiring politician when she won the seat of Maidenhead in Berkshire. It's a seat she has held ever since. Mrs May first stood for Parliament in 1992 in North West Durham Theresa May has described her husband Philip as her rock Theresa May bumps into rock star Alice Cooper outside a BBC studio in 2010 An early advocate of Conservative ""modernisation"" in the wilderness years that followed, Mrs May quickly joined the shadow cabinet in 1999 under William Hague as shadow education secretary and in 2002 she became the party's first female chairman under Iain Duncan Smith. She then held a range of senior posts under Michael Howard but was conspicuously not part of the ""Notting Hill set"" which grabbed control of the party after its third successive defeat in 2005 and laid David Cameron and George Osborne's path to power. This was perhaps reflected in the fact that she was initially given the rather underwhelming job of shadow leader of the House of Commons. But she gradually raised her standing and by 2009 had become shadow work and pensions secretary. Nevertheless, her promotion to the job of home secretary when the Conservatives joined with the Lib Dems to form the first coalition government in 70 years was still something of a surprise - given that Chris Grayling had been shadowing the brief in opposition. While the Home Office turned out to be the political graveyard of many a secretary of state in previous decades, Mrs May refused to let this happen - mastering her brief with what was said to be a microscopic attention to detail and no little willingness to enter into battles with fellow ministers when she thought it necessary. Theresa May initially fell down the pecking order under David Cameron but worked her way back up While some in Downing Street worried that the Home Office was becoming her own personal fiefdom, she engendered loyalty among her ministers and was regarded as ""unmovable"" as her tough-talking style met with public approval even when the department's record did not always seem so strong. In his memoir of his time in office, former Lib Dem minister David Laws says: ""She would frequently clash with George Osborne over immigration. She rarely got on anything but badly with Michael Gove. She and Cameron seemed to view each other with mutual suspicion. ""I first met her in 2010. I was sitting in my Treasury office, overlooking St James's Park, me in one armchair and the home secretary in the other, with no officials present. She looked nervous. ""I felt she was surprised to find herself as home secretary. Frankly, I didn't expect her to last more than a couple of years."" Despite her liberal instincts in some policy areas, she frequently clashed with the then deputy prime minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, particularly over her plan to increase internet surveillance to combat terrorism, dubbed the ""Snooper's Charter"" by the Lib Dems. After one ""difficult"" meeting with Mr Clegg, he reportedly told David Laws: ""You know, I've grown to rather like Theresa May... 'She's a bit of an Ice Maiden and has no small talk whatsoever - none. I have quite difficult meetings with her. Cameron once said, 'She's exactly like that with me too!' ""She is instinctively secretive and very rigid, but you can be tough with her and she'll go away and think it all through again."" Mrs May has confronted what she sees as vested interests in the police The new prime minister is a self-declared feminist On the plus side crime levels fell, the UK avoided a mass terrorist attack and in 2013, she successfully deported radical cleric Abu Qatada - something she lists as one of her proudest achievements, along with preventing the extradition to America of computer hacker Gary McKinnon. She was not afraid to take on vested interests, stunning the annual conference of the Police Federation in 2014 by telling them corruption problems were not just limited to ""a few bad apples"" and threatening to end the federation's automatic right to enrol officers as its members. However, the Passport Office suffered a near meltdown while she faced constant criticism over the government's failure to meet its promise to get net migration down to below 100,000 a year. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who went up against her in the Commons as shadow home secretary,told The Guardian:,external""I respect her style - it is steady and serious. She is authoritative in parliament - superficial attacks on her bounce off. ""The flip side is that she is not fleet of foot when crises build, she digs in her heels (remember the Passport Agency crisis in 2014 when the backlog caused hundreds to miss their holidays, and the Border Force crisis in 2011 when border checks were axed). ""And she hides when things go wrong. No interviews, no quotes, nothing to reassure people or to remind people she even exists. It's helped her survive as home secretary - but if you are prime minister, eventually the buck has to stop."" There was a bitter public row with cabinet colleague Michael Gove over the best way to combat Islamist extremism, which ended with Mr Gove having to apologise to the prime minister and Mrs May having to sack a long-serving special adviser - a turf war which is said to have led to a diminution in her admiration for the prime minister. Former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke also had run-ins with her and was recorded on camera ahead of an interview last week saying that Mrs May was good at her job but a ""bloody difficult woman"" - before adding as an aside, a bit like Mrs Thatcher. A reference to be Conservative leader can hardly come better than that. Mrs May has never been one of the most clubbable of politicians and is someone who prefers not having to tour the tea rooms of the House of Commons - where tittle-tattle is freely exchanged. She has rarely opened up about her private life although she revealed in 2013 that she had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and would require insulin injections twice a day for the rest of her life - something she says she had come to terms with and which would not affect her career. Mrs May's taste in footwear has kept photographers interested for more than a decade Generally thought to be in the mainstream of Conservative thinking on most economic and law and order issues, she has also challenged convention by attacking police stop and search powers and calling for a probe into the application of Sharia Law in British communities. She also expressed a personal desire to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights but later said she would not pursue this as PM due to a lack of parliamentary support - an example of what many believe will be pragmatism in office. Her social attitudes are slightly harder to pin down. She backed same sex marriage. She expressed a personal view in 2012 that the legal limit on abortion should be lowered from 24 to 20 weeks. Along with most Conservative MPs she voted against an outright ban on foxhunting. What is undisputable is that at 59, Mrs May was the oldest leader to enter Downing Street since James Callaghan in 1976 and is the first prime minister since Ted Heath who does not have children. Mrs May has worked closely with David Cameron and will now succeed him Mrs May has been the most senior female Cabinet minister for the past six years One of Westminster's shrewdest as well as toughest operators, Mrs May's decision to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU but to do so in an understated way and to frame her argument in relatively narrow security terms reaped dividends after the divisive campaign. During what turned out to be a short-lived leadership campaign, Mrs May played strongly on her weight of experience, judgement and reliability in a time of crisis. The first months of Mrs May's time in Downing Street have been dominated by the process of divorcing the UK from the EU - but there have been signs that she won't be content with the ""safe pair of hands"" tag that is often  attached to her. Brexit, she has said, won't be allowed purely to define her time in office and she has promised a radical programme of social reform, underpinned by values of One Nation Toryism, to promote social mobility and opportunity for the more disadvantaged in society. Policies such as new grammar schools or more selection have been put forward - but with a slender parliamentary majority of 17 her government had little breathing room on bringing forward tightly contested legislation. So, despite promising not to hold a general election before she had to, in 2020, she has now decided to seek a mandate for her own particular brand of Conservatism to, as she put it, to ""guarantee certainty and security for the years ahead"".

"This video can not be played How Brighton went from Football League survivors to Premier League promotion The story of a team rising from the bottom tier of England's Football League to the top is an increasingly familiar one, with Hull, Swansea and Bournemouth among the most recent examples. But few of those tales have been more remarkable than that of Brighton & Hove Albion, whose promotion to the top flight was confirmed withvictory over Wiganon Monday. BBC Sport speaks to pundits, players and manager Chris Hughton about the Premier League newcomers who, just 20 years ago, were battling to stay in the Football League. It took until the very last day of the 1996-97 season before Brighton could breathe easy, as a 1-1 draw with Hereford secured their league status. Despite the result, Brighton's former owners went ahead with the sale of their old Goldstone Ground, leaving the club to share Gillingham's Priestfield Stadium for two seasons. The club then moved back to Brighton, playing at the Withdean Stadium - a site not originally built for football - before finally switching to their current Amex Stadium home in 2011 under the ownership of Tony Bloom. Brighton's Amex Stadium was expanded to its current capacity of 30,750 during the 2012-13 season ""What happened on Monday is just the sensational fulfilment of so many people's dreams,"" said BBC pundit Mark Clemmit. ""The one name I keep thinking about is Dick Knight, who sort of galvanised everybody in 1997, because don't forget not only did they nearly go out of the league, but they lost their stadium then as well. ""The owners at the time kind of pulled it from under the club, and have never ever been forgiven by the supporters. ""It was Dick Knight who picked it up by the bootstraps, plus several others that accompanied him - but he was the majority shareholder."" Brighton had looked destined to complete their journey from bottom to top 12 months ago, but a 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough on the final day of the regular season meant they missed out on goal difference. Further disappointment was to follow, as their hopes of reaching the Premier League were dashed with a 3-1 aggregate loss to Sheffield Wednesday in the play-off semi-finals. It was not an unfamiliar feeling for Seagulls fans, who had suffered defeat at the same stage in both 2013 and 2014. Brighton keeper David Stockdale tweeted this message following Brighton's 2-0 defeat by Sheffield Wednesday in the first leg of the play-off semi-finals last season ""I'm incredibly proud of the way they've bounced back - but there are no surprises,"" Hughton, 58, told BBC Sussex. ""We've got a group of lads that are capable of doing it, but being capable of doing it and doing it are two different things. ""They've been good all season. They've bounced back, they've shown a really good determination and a real desire to want to win as many games as possible."" Brighton captain Bruno added: ""It's been five years now for me and it's been hard because we were really close to getting promoted for three seasons. ""Last season was tough for us and we were really close - but this season we've been outstanding."" Hughton is no stranger to the Premier League, having guided Newcastle to Championship promotion in 2010, then led Norwich to an 11th-place finish in the top flight in the 2012-13 season. The former Republic of Ireland defender has turned Brighton into one of the defensively strongest sides in the Championship since taking over in December 2014, keeping 47 clean sheets in 111 league games in charge. ""When you look at where Chris has been, he's done really well everywhere he's gone,"" said former Republic team-mate pundit Mark Lawrenson, now a BBC pundit. ""Because he's quiet, people sort of assume that he's a nice bloke and that people can ride roughshod over him - but you can't. ""There's a real steely determination in there and I think as he's gone from job to job he's embraced the way football's changed."" Hughton's success comes despite only taking his first managerial role in 2009, when he replaced Alan Shearer as Newcastle boss. ""I think a lot of people, for a long time, had him marked down as an assistant or a coach,"" added Clemmit. Hughton had spells as manager of Newcastle, Birmingham and Norwich before taking charge at Brighton ""He's already won one title with Newcastle United, he's got another team promoted, and then in his other two full seasons in the Championship he took Birmingham to the play-offs and he took Brighton to the play-offs. ""Even during the celebrations yesterday, you could see he was containing it. He was modest enough not to get involved in the players' celebrations, one eye on getting the title over the line. ""There'd be some justice as well in that, wouldn't there? Norwich, one of the teams that dismissed him, that didn't see the merits of letting him have a proper long-term go, is where he could secure the title on Friday."" The bond Hughton has helped to create at Brighton this year has been tested by adversity off the field. In November, French winger Anthony Knockaert's father died, prompting at least 10 of his team-mates and Hughtonto travel to Franceto offer support at the funeral. The 25-year-old has responded in sterling fashion on the field, contributing 15 goals on his way to being crowned Championship Player of the Year. ""It has been the best thing I have seen in football, to come all the way from England to the funeral,"" he said in December. ""It means a lot for me and my family and I will never forget it."" Championship Player of the Year Knockaert signed for Brighton from Standard Liege in January 2016 Brighton have also dealt with the absence of defender Connor Goldson, who had heart surgery after routine cardiac screening discovered a defect in December. ""Obviously there have been things the whole season that have brought us even closer together, but we're a close group anyway no matter what happens,"" the 24-year-old told BBC Sussex. ""That's why we're always here for each other. Obviously things happen in life, and what happened with Anthony's dad was a sad moment for him. ""With me this year, obviously I wasn't needed, but we all pulled together, we're all a team. ""We're all a team of friends and that's what gets us to where we are."" The perks of promotion... Match of the Day host Gary Lineker congratulated Brighton on their achievements While securing the Championship title with victory at Carrow Road on Friday is the immediate aim, Hughton and Bloom can now start preparing for life in the top tier. While some teams might look to splash the cash in pursuit of Premier League survival, Hughton appears to favour a more cautious approach. ""The only way to do it is to recruit sensibly, to not put the club in a position where you're going well above your means,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""There is a huge gap between what you need to pay for players in the Championship and the fees that are demanded for Premier League players. ""What we've got to do is to try to make sure that we get that balance right."" Aston Villa owner Tony Xia was another paying tribute to Brighton following their promotion Now, only four months from starting their Premier League campaign, 20 years on from being on the brink of disaster, where do the club go from here? ""The great thing for them is that because of the new training ground, and because of the actual ground, they are ready and set up for the Premier League,"" said Lawrenson, a former Brighton player. ""So if they can just survive, in inverted commas, that first season in the Premier League, I do think they're a club that will push on from there.""

"Much of Tesla's value can be attributed to the fanatical support of Elon Musk Some of my finest swearing takes place while driving, or rather crawling, alongthe 880,external- a congested, polluted, almost-always-jammed monstrosity of a freeway that slithers past Teslaâs car-making plant in Fremont, California. Each time Iâm unfortunate enough to find myself on this stretch, Iâm struck by the symbolism: a road thick with fumes, overlooked by a factory working overtime to change that. From that vantage point itâs pretty hard not to root for Elon Muskâs company, or at the very least his vision for a cleaner, more sustainable energy industry. So far, heâs making incredible progress. âCan you name any other car company, in the history of mankind, that has gotten to where Tesla has in 10 years?â asks Bob, a Tesla fan I meet after he pulled into the factory to charge his beloved car. I canât, of course. Tesla's rise has been astronomical, bordering on absurd. Earlier this month, Tesla (albeit briefly) became the most valuable car company in the US, overtaking both Ford and General Motors. Two companies that, as well as being around for decades before Mr Musk was even born, sell vastly more cars than Tesla - and make far more money doing it. But that doesn't matter to investors, who have been falling over themselves to buy up Teslaâs stock, pushing it to a valuation of around $50bn - more than double what it should be, according to some. âThe marketâs giving them credit now for something they may or may not become,â said Brian Johnson, an automotive analyst at investment bank Barclays Capital. Elonâs Matrix Tesla Motors wasnât founded by Elon Musk, but it for sure wouldnât have survived without him. He doesnât do many interviews, and declined to speak to me for this article. But thatâs OK - because much like this countryâs current president, Mr Musk does much of his thinking aloud, on Twitter. He uses it to speak directly to his fans, bypassing the necessity of using the press to get his message out. Often, Iâm told, without warning his long-suffering communications team in advance. âStormy weather in Shortvilleâ¦â wasone such tweet,externalsent, gleefully, on 4 April as Teslaâs stock was riding high. He was having a risky dig at all those investors who sold off Tesla stock at the high price on the assumption they could buy it back again when the price dropped - skimming off the profit. Itâs a tweet that might come back to bite him, predicted Mr Johnson, who draws parallels withthat iconic scene,externalin the Matrix, where lead character Neo is given a choice of a red pill - and discover reality - or a blue pill, meaning blissful ignorance of the truth. Tesla is not currently capable of making cars quickly enough to handle demand âInvestors are very happy to take the blue pill right now,â Mr Johnson said. âEspecially when the stock has been going up like it has. ""A red pill view would lead you to a more conservative view of the valuation and not wanting to chase this rally too far.â He believes blue-pillers see Teslaâs headstart in battery manufacture, autonomy and other energy-related side projects as giving the company an unbeatable, perhaps even monopolistic advantage. But itâs far from certain. ""Tesla may be one of the finalists,â Mr Johnson said. ""But not the only one. Youâre not talking about an industry structure that becomes iPhone-like. âWeâre skeptical.â Pre-order pressure Just over a year ago,I stood and watchedas Mr Musk took to a stage in Los Angeles and unveiled the Model 3, his most important product yet. His loyal fans whooped and hollered. Unlike the cars that came before it, the Model 3 was meant for people with slightly more modest incomes - $35,000, minus the incentives offered to people buying green vehicles. As well as cars, Tesla now has plans to produce an electric articulated lorry That night, he invited pre-orders - and he got them by the hundreds of thousands. Problem is, he doesnât yet have a factory capable of building them quickly enough. Last year Tesla made 80,000 cars. General Motors made 10 million. Mr Musk has invested massively in streamlining and innovating the Tesla production line in Fremont, but itâs a huge task. âWe have to see the proof that they can make the car, that it comes in at the price they promised, and that they can make a lot of them,â said Ashlee Vance, a Silicon Valley-based journalist and author of Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future. âTesla has not done a good job of making lots of cars,â he added. ""If they are not able to get the Model 3 out quickly and then keep the factory coming along it becomes this huge cost sink for Tesla.â Keep on trucking Mr Musk is used to people telling him his ambitions are too great, or that his promises are recklessly optimistic. But over the years, since his fortune-making days as co-founder of PayPal, Mr Musk has developed an incredible ability to deflect missed targets with even bigger ones. As investors wait on Tesla to deliver on those Model 3s, for example, Mr Musk is busy tweeting about his planned September unveiling of a electric powered articulated lorry. And a pick-up truck. His Gigafactory -the largest factory floor in the world- is just getting operational, and already he is talking about building two or three more.Or perhaps even 100,external. What Mr Musk has created is a sense of excitement that has followers locked in admiration, and investors gripped by FOMO - the Fear Of Missing Out. What if Tesla becomes the next Apple, the next Amazon. What if itâs even bigger than that? Whatever your assessment of the valuation, thereâs no questioning that the Cult of Elon is stronger than ever - and it adds billions to Teslaâs value. âThis is almost all about the personality,â added Mr Vance. ""If you put almost any other executive in charge of this company thereâs no way it has the same glow around it. ""Now that heâs hit his stride, more people have become believers in this guy. Itâs almost impossible to separate the personality from the company.â ___________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Tesla will unveil electric lorry in September Tesla board 'too close to Elon Musk' Tesla reports record car deliveries Tech Tent: Elonâs amazing week Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA firefighters say 'no possibility' of containing blazes as fifth wildfire breaks out Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires Starmer and Badenoch clash over call for grooming inquiry How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

"Malala Yousafzai's mother Toor Pekai Yousafzai is rarely in the public eye Over the past five years, Malala Yousafzai has become one of the world's most famous young women - the schoolgirl shot in Pakistan who built a new life in Birmingham after surgery, then campaigned for education for all girls, won the Nobel Peace Prize and inspired the world with her life story. Now her mother, Toor Pekai Yousafzai, has spoken to the BBC for the first time to explain how her own life has changed in the past five years. ""It was very hard when I left everyone behind,"" says Toor Pekai. ""We didn't expect to live in a foreign country. ""When other people leave their country they accept everything that comes their way and they're ready for it, but we couldn't prepare. ""We had to suddenly leave Pakistan. The attack changed everything. We had to focus on Malala's life."" Very few readers will recognise Toor Pekai from her picture. Whenever Malala attends a high-profile function to promote her cause, she is invariably accompanied by her father Ziauddin, who hasoften been interviewed about his daughter's many successes. Meanwhile, Malala's mother has played her own low-profile, but important, role at home with the rest of the family in Birmingham. Toor Pekai explains: ""When Malala was being treated in hospital we were very busy looking after her. Then she wrote a book and we were busy with that too, so that's why I wasn't in the public eye. ""But now I'm trying to help other people get an education, so from now on I want to be more involved in these kinds of things. But if these interviews were in my own language it would be easier!"" Sign-up to get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external And it is clear that Toor Pekai has her own compelling story to tell about the events that brought Malala across the world. She still gets visibly upset as she remembers watching Malala fighting for her life in hospital. Her hands twist together and she cries but her smile comes back quickly when she thinks about her daughter's life now, the success she has already had and what the future holds. Every year of Malala's life is a bonus for Toor Pekai. ""Last year I wrote in her birthday card 'you are my four year old daughter' because I now keep count of the years since the attack. It's like she is reborn from that point."" Malala is a high-profile figure around the world, but just a teenage daughter at home Toor Pekai's life is now rooted here in the UK, looking after Malala and her two sons. Despite Malala winning a Nobel Peace Prize and mixing with world leaders she still has to tell her to clean her room and look after herself. In fact, when she describes her day-to-day relationship with her daughter, it sounds like just any other mother dealing with a millennial teenager. ""She doesn't eat very well and doesn't drink enough water. She doesn't go to sleep on time and studies until midnight. We tell her to eat fruit and do her prayers, and she tells her brothers, but she doesn't."" Although Toor Pekai did not get an education herself in Pakistan, she now attends English classes in Birmingham and has built a network of friends through that. ""Some of them are from Swat and I knew them from back there already. Recently another friend of mine came from Peshawar. ""There aren't any people from Pakistan in my English class but there are people from Iraq, Iran and one from Afghanistan. We have parties and I cook rice, chicken and fish, and they like my food.""

"Prince Harry has revealed he sought counselling after coming close to a ""complete breakdown"" while struggling to deal with the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. His revelationhas led others to share their experiences of how they coped with losing a parent at a young age. Here they tell their stories. Kathryn Watson, 33, from Newcastle, lost her mum, Heather, to lymphoma cancer when she was 19. Kathryn (right) struggled with anger after her mum, Heather (left), died from cancer ""My mum was ill for about 18 months and it was really quite sudden. She went from being an outgoing person to simply not being there. ""I dealt with her death badly. I went straight into doing the logistical stuff and, because of my age, there was a lot of pressure from people for it not to affect my life. ""I found I lost quite a few friends because they didn't know how to cope with me. I was so busy trying to be 'normal', you don't know how to talk to people. ""When I read Prince Harry's story I thought that's exactly how I felt. You just keep going and everybody else forgets about it. ""Over the years I completely ignored my mum's death. Life gets back to normal and no-one talks about it. Kathryn says counselling helped her deal with the grief of losing her mum ""What really spoke to me was Prince Harry talking about his anger. I felt that a lot. I turned to the gym and exercise and running. ""What also really touched me was that the age at which we dealt with it was the same. ""When I got to 28 and 29 I thought 'I can't keep going on with this'. It's the realisation it's not going to fade. ""Now, I'm able to open up and work through my grief. I think it is a maturity thing. ""Counselling has brought me to a good place. It's about finding the right counsellor for you - it's so important. ""I feel relieved and a lot calmer. I still have bad days but I now know if I'm going into one it will pass and I know who to contact and who to talk to. ""It doesn't seem so overwhelming or daunting now."" Andy Savage, 37, from Nantwich, Cheshire, was 12 when his mum, Diane, died from a blood clot in her lung. Andy, pictured with his mum, Diane, says he is not the person he would have been if she had stayed alive ""It was completely out of the blue.  I was 12 at the time, my younger brother was nine and my sister was six. They were taken into care, our family was split up. ""We had been the typical little family back then. My dad couldn't cope afterwards, his grief was as big as ours. ""You lose several things when you lose your mum. You lose someone very close to you but you also lose the person who takes care of you. There's a mixture of emotions. ""I can't think of anything that decimates someone's life more as a kid than taking their mum away from them. ""There was a lot of anger for me personally. It messes up your life in a lot of different ways. I dropped out of school, didn't really get an education and didn't look after myself too well. Andy, pictured with step-daughter Emily, says that, like Prince Harry, he had a chaotic period after losing his mum ""It's only looking back now, that I realise it was linked to my mum's death. I know I'm not the person I would've been if she had stayed alive. ""Like Prince Harry, I had that chaotic period. I went off the rails in my late teens because I didn't have any guidance, I did what I wanted to do. I burnt myself out quite quickly. ""I think it's vital you find something in life that's your passion, whether it's sport or a hobby - something to give your life meaning. ""I was lucky that social services were there and they provided counselling sessions. For me it was massively beneficial, but not everyone's a talker. ""As Harry said, venting at someone, letting it all out has got to be a good thing. It helps you make sense of what's happened."" Susan Steel, 55, from Hull, lost her dad, Gerry, who suffered from hypercholesterolemia, at the age of 12. Susan's dad Gerry - pictured with her at the beach in 1963 - died at the family home after a long illness ""My dad had been unwell for quite some time. On the day he died he'd come out of hospital and I remember coming out of school and seeing him in the passenger seat. ""For the first time I thought that's not my dad. He was shrivelling away. ""That evening my mum was in the kitchen and me and my sister were watching the 9 O'Clock news with my dad. ""We heard a clatter and the table turned over and we turned around and his eyes were rolling. I charged out screaming, I knew what had happened. I never saw him again. ""Now I can't really remember him. I think a lot of it you block out. ""I saw a child psychiatrist at the time because I wouldn't go to school. I had separation anxiety from my mum. I didn't understand it at the time. ""I couldn't concentrate at school and I didn't do very well in my A-levels. I couldn't eat either and lost loads of weight. Susan, pictured with her husband Martin, sought counselling for panic attacks in her adult life ""It did affect everything but I didn't really realise at the time it might be related to losing my dad. ""I avoided relationships and when I met my husband I started to have panic attacks and that's when I started to see a counsellor. That's when I understood it. ""I had a mistrust of men, I feared my husband would leave me. ""I had a really good GP who recognised it was connected to my dad and sent me to a counsellor. ""You do bottle it up. You don't go there. Counselling is not an easy option, it's very painful. ""But I remember coming home and I would feel really free. It really did help, without a shadow of a doubt.""

"This video can not be played The BBCâs John Sudworth asks North Koreaâs vice-foreign minister what message he has for Donald Trump Two days ago, I stood on the edge of Kim Il-sung Square in the centre of Pyongyang and watched, with a mixture of awe and unease, as North Korea's giant military parade passed by. Back in that same location today, the vast space of the square was almost empty except for a few government workers on foot and the odd car - which pretty much sums up the traffic situation, or lack of it, in this isolated, sanction-hit city. My government minders ushered me up the steps of the foreign ministry and I soon found myself sitting face to face with Vice-Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol. Were some of the weapons on display in the parade, as many analysts have speculated, new intercontinental ballistic missiles? I asked him. ""The respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un in his historic new year address this year said that we are at the final stage of preparations to launch an ICBM (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile),"" he replied. ""I'm no military expert,"" he went on, ""but I hope that there was an ICBM among the missiles shown at the parade."" What can the outside world do about N Korea? All about North Korea's missiles This video can not be played The BBC's John Sudworth, in Pyongyang, explains what may happen next North Korea needs such weapons, he said, ""in order to protect our government and system from threat and provocation from the United States"". And in a direct riposte to US President Donald Trump and his assertion that North Korea will not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, Mr Han added this. ""According to our own schedule we'll be conducting more tests on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis."" North Korea has long been seen to use provocation and brinkmanship to raise tension for its own strategic advantage. It is then able to win diplomatic and economic concessions through negotiations to defuse the crisis, only later to go on to renege on its disarmament commitments. As the cycle begins again, at each stage, it moves a step closer to its goal of becoming a fully-fledged nuclear power. But while the current state of technological advancement of North Korea's weapons programme matters deeply to the outside world, in particular its near neighbours, the hostile rhetoric is rarely something to take at face value. Read between the lines and, mostly, it is always conditional, peppered with ifs and buts, as it was today. ""If the US goes on with their reckless option of using military means then that would mean from that very day, an all out war,"" Mr Han told me. The interview does though give a hint of the new worrying unpredictability at play. Donald Trump's recent ordering of the airstrike on a Syrian airbase has clearly rattled Pyongyang and the threat now is not simply of retaliation to an attack, but even, Mr Han suggests, to the planning of one. ""If the USA encroaches upon our sovereignty then it will provoke our immediate counter reaction and if it is planning a military attack against us, we will react with a nuclear pre-emptive strike by our own style and method."" Experts say an all-out war is very unlikely However, despite the posturing on both sides, the risks, most observers agree, are still limited. For the US and its allies, war carries incalculable risks and although Washington insists that all options are on the table, it now appears to be signalling that diplomacy and toughened sanctions are the most likely way forward. It is as yet unclear how, having failed before, those things will force this most totalitarian of states to give up its nuclear weapons. As Vice-Foreign Minister Han made clear to me, North Korea has learned the lessons from recent history, in particular the US-led attempts at regime change in Iraq and Libya. ""If the balance of power is not there, then the outbreak of war is imminent and unavoidable."" ""If one side has nukes and the other side doesn't, and they're on bad terms, war will inevitably break out,"" he said. ""This is the lesson shown by the reality of the countries in the Middle East, including Libya and Syria where people are suffering from great misfortune."" The vice-foreign minister said North Korean people are guaranteed their human rights Within the city limits of Pyongyang, foreign journalists get to see very little of ordinary life on these carefully choreographed and highly controlled media tours. Even further beyond reach, good evidence shows, lie the vast political prisons in which all dissent and opposition to the system, however mild, is crushed. Rather than building nuclear weapons, I ask Mr Han, wouldn't North Korea be better improving life for its own people, perhaps starting with abolishing those gulags? ""We do not tolerate any others criticising our style of socialism and we believe in the choice we have made,"" Mr Han replies. ""The masses are the centre of our state and their security and human rights are guaranteed."" ""As for the so called political prison camps you have just mentioned,"" he went on, ""it is something that our enemies have fabricated and it has been disseminated by their followers in order to demonise our country"". The message is clear. Militarised and isolated, North Korea has the right to follow its own path and, Mr Han apparently believes, no one will be able to stop it. So far, he has been proven right.
