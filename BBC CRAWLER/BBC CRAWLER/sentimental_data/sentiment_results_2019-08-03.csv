"This video can not be played Watch day three's best moments as first Test evenly poised Men's Ashes: First Specsavers Test, Edgbaston (day three of five) Australia 284(Smith 144, Broad 5-86)& 124-3(Smith 46*) England 374(Burns 133, Root 57, Stokes 50) Australia lead by 34 runs Scorecard England are once again searching for a way to remove Australia's Steve Smith after a see-saw third day left the first Ashes Test deliciously poised. Smith, who crafted a superb 144 in the first innings, moved serenely to 46 not out to take the tourists to 124-3, a lead of 34 when bad light ended play early at Edgbaston. At 27-2, Australia were in danger of being blown out of the contest on Saturday evening, only for Smith - in his first Test since returning from a year-long ban - to add 48 with Usman Khawaja and an unbroken 49 with Travis Head. Former captain Smith silenced a riotous crowd, one that was baying for Australian misery when David Warner was dismissed and, earlier, during a ninth-wicket stand of 65 between Chris Woakes and Stuart Broad. Woakes made 37 not out and Broad 29 to rescue England from a collapse of four wickets for 18 runs, which included 3-4 in 11 balls. They helped the hosts to 374 all out and a first-innings advantage of 90, which seemed about the minimum required to negate the challenge of batting last on a surface offering increasing amounts of turn. However, the pitch is also losing pace, removing the encouragement on offer for the pace bowlers. In their quest to dislodge Smith and run through Australia on Sunday, England again look set to be without their all-time leading wicket-taker James Anderson, who batted but did not bowl on Saturday because of a calf injury. Agnew: Smith is not immortal - he is just batting rather close to it England already on Plan X to Smith - Vaughan This video can not be played 'The big breakthrough' - Stokes removes Khawaja with his second ball Saturday at Edgbaston is renowned for its boisterous, beer-fuelled crowd, many of whom make the effort of fancy dress. While the Pope, builders, some crayons and the England 1966 World Cup winners partied in the Hollies Stand, singing long after the light intervened, the game was manoeuvred into a tantalising position. England began with the opportunity to bat Australia out of the game, only for the collapse, then the Woakes-Broad partnership to see fortunes fluctuate throughout the morning and afternoon. The key to the whole contest, though, appears to be Smith, who arrived when his team were wobbling but simply picked up from where he left off in the first innings. If England can find a way to prise him out early on Sunday, they will be in prime position to limit the chase to something manageable. If he bats into the afternoon, he could put the game beyond the hosts. Fourteen years on from the memorable Ashes contest that England won by two runs, Edgbaston could yet serve up another classic. This video can not be played 'Whoops!' Archer stops play at Edgbaston Even without Anderson, England made early inroads into the Australia batting, removing Warner and fellow ball-tampering conspirator Cameron Bancroft to fuel the fervour of the Edgbaston crowd. When Warner got stuck between playing and leaving Broad to be caught behind on review, he was given a deafening and prolonged send-off, with Bancroft shovelling off-spinner Moeen Ali to short leg soon after. However, that signalled the arrival of Smith and a change in the complexion of the evening. After being dropped by Jos Buttler at gully off the expensive Moeen on 11, Khawaja played some sweet drives, while Smith slipped into his trademark fidgeting, shuffling and working the ball off the pads. It took a vicious delivery from Stokes to remove Khawaja, one that jagged back off the pitch and found the inside edge on the way through to Jonny Bairstow. Head, though, was a solid ally to the former captain, and the only other hint of further alarm came when a Rory Burns shy at the stumps missed when Head was short of his ground. The greatest discomfort Smith felt was being hit on the helmet by Stokes and, in truth, the bad light and rain that followed gave England a welcome opportunity to regroup. This video can not be played 'That looks horrible!' Moeen bowled by Lyon offering no shot England were in danger of wasting the position earned on Friday as Australia got the rewards their second-day bowling deserved. From 267-4, Stokes looked fluent in moving from 38 to 50, only for his loose waft at Pat Cummins to begin the slide. Off-spinner Nathan Lyon finally took the edge of Burns, who added eight to his overnight 125, and in the same over, the horribly short-of-form Moeen shouldered arms and lost his off stump. When Bairstow slashed at Peter Siddle, England were only 16 ahead. They were steadied by the experience and calm authority of Woakes and Broad, who defended stoutly and accumulated without risk, steadily raising the level of noise in a Hollies Stand that rejoiced when Warner fielded on the boundary and Smith was asked to bowl. Curiously, Australia left gaps for singles and were reluctant to test Broad with the short ball. When they did, he helped Cummins into the hands of fine leg. Anderson bravely offered hobbling support to Woakes for another six overs and nine runs, before the number 11 miscued Lyon to mid-on. Former England captain Michael Vaughan on BBC Test Match Special:""I can't say which team is on top at the moment - it all hinges on that first half-hour tomorrow morning. ""Steve Smith is a freak of nature. If England can remove him, they will go on to win the match. If he bats for another hour, England could be chasing 180-plus. And that's where I get nervous."" England's Chris Woakes on TMS:""If you could sort out a dodgy breakfast for him that would be great. ""We'll go back to the drawing board and figure out what works best on this wicket. We might have to look to attack at one end and hold at the other."" Australia's James Pattinson on TMS:""It's about getting stuck in again and trying to bat all day tomorrow. Whatever lead we can get, it's going to be a tricky chase. ""Steve Smith is a superstar and superstars peel off runs. He's been waiting for this moment for a long time.""

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a one-off cash boost of Â£1.8bn for NHS hospitals in England. Of this, almost Â£1bn will be available immediately to go towards new equipment and upgrades to 20 hospitals. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Mr Johnson said he was ""determined to deliver"" the promises of the Brexit referendum campaign and increase NHS spending. But Labour said it fell ""significantly short"" of the amount needed by the NHS and would not reverse years of cuts. The money is coming from the Treasury and is not a re-allocation of funds from the Department of Health. It is on top of an extra Â£20bn a year by 2023 announced by former prime minister Theresa May last year. Around Â£850m - spread over five years - will go towards funding the 20 hospital upgrades that Mr Johnson promised in his first speech as PM outside Downing Street. The remaining money is expected to help clear a backlog of existing upgrade work and infrastructure projects. He will formally announce the funding on Monday, when he is expected to identify the hospitals which will get money to upgrade wards and repair buildings. Theresa May unveils Â£20bn boost for NHS Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn? But the health think tank the Nuffield Trust said the latest funding, which is less than 1% of NHS England's annual budget, would ""only be a fraction of what it would cost to really upgrade 20 hospitals"". Nigel Edwards, the Nuffield Trust's chief executive, added that it it was a ""down payment on the staggering Â£6bn needed to clear the backlog"" of NHS maintenance. However, he said it was encouraging to see money put towards capital funding - used for equipment and repairs - ""which will help stop hospitals deteriorating even further"". In October, NHS Digital figures showed thatNHS trusts had a backlog of around Â£6bn,externalof repairs or replacements that needed carrying out. The NHS in England can hardly do anything other than welcome new money from the Treasury to invest in hospital buildings and launch new construction projects. But the Â£1bn this year to clear the backlog should be set against a total of Â£6bn which hospital leaders and think tanks believe is the total of work outstanding, including repairs and refurbishment of dilapidated facilities. On top of that is Â£850m for 20 hospitals to carry out major upgrades, but spread over five years. The latest announcement covers capital spending as opposed to day-to-day running costs. After raids on these capital budgets to prop up NHS frontline services in recent years, health service staff will feel there is some way to go to make up the lost ground - and only a small step forward has been taken.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Writing in the Sunday Times, Mr Johnson praised the ""astonishing achievements"" of the NHS, but highlighted the staffing pressures, along with the delays and cancellations facing patients. ""Which is why I am so determined to deliver now on the promises of that 2016 referendum campaign: not just to honour the will of the people, but to increase the cash available for this amazing national institution,"" he said. In the run-up to the Brexit referendum, a campaign bus used by Vote Leave claimed the UK sent Â£350m a week to the European Union and suggested the money could instead be spent on the NHS. However,analysis by the BBC found that claim to be misleading. In his column on Sunday, Mr Johnson wrote: ""It is thanks to this country's strong economic performance that we are now able to announce Â£1.8bn more for the NHS to buy vital new kit and confirm new upgrades for 20 hospitals across the country."" He said the government was also starting work on plans to ""tackle the injustice"" of social care - a problem ""that has been shirked for decades"". The PM added that Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chancellor Sajid Javid had already met the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, as they wanted to ensure the cash ""gets through to the right places"". Writing in the Sun on Sunday,external, Mr Hancock said the money would boost hospitals across the country - from Cornwall to Newcastle - by providing new intensive care wards, children's units and mental health facilities. Saying that the upgrades ""are just the start"", he added that the government wanted to take a more ""strategic"" approach to capital spending, and move away from ""piecemeal and uncoordinated"" decisions. There are also expected to be extra funding settlements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as part ofthe Barnett formula- which is used to decide how much devolved governments will receive when funding is increased in areas such as health and education in England. AroundÂ£115bn was spent on the NHS England budget,externallast year. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble The best and the rest - what we've learned from the NHS Tracker GP numbers in first sustained drop for 50 years Responding to the funding announcement, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the Â£1.8bn pledged fell ""significantly short of what's needed to provide quality, safe care to patients after years of Tory cuts"". He added: ""Tory ministers have repeatedly cut capital investment budgets in recent years. These smash-and-grab raids have meant over Â£4bn slashed and seen the NHS repair bill spiral to Â£6bn, putting patient safety seriously at risk."" He told Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme the investment promised by Mr Johnson might not actually take place, claiming only Â£100m of Â£2.5bn of health spending announcements over the past two years had been delivered. Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Baroness Jolly said Mr Johnson's pledge would ""not be worth the paper it's written on"" if and when a no-deal Brexit took place. Cancer Research UK said the investment would go ""some way to address the immense strain"" the NHS is under but said the staffing shortage should take priority. Policy director Emma Greenwood added: ""Upgrades to hospitals are welcome but the NHS is experiencing a staffing crisis. And it's impossible to diagnose more cancers at an early stage without the right staff."" Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn?

"This video can not be played Russia protests: Police arrest scores of illegal demonstrators More than 600 people have been detained over an unauthorised protest in Moscow, amid reports of police violence. Protesters had gathered in the Russian capital after authorities disqualified a number of opposition candidates from standing in local elections. Leading activist Lyubov Sobol was arrested before she could reach the rally, attended by 1,500 people. Video from the rally shows officers using their batons against demonstrators while making arrests. Russian officials initially said there had been just 30 arrests and 350 attendees. Monitoring group OVD-Info, which runs a hotline for reporting detentions, had been keeping a running toll, which rapidly jumped from a few dozen arrests to several hundred. The woman driving Russia's opposition protests Officers in riot gear had earlier moved into the capital and warned people not to protest. Russian news agency TASS reported that one police officer had been injured while making an arrest. But protesters also reported mistreatment at the hands of police. Footage broadcast on Russian television and shared on social media showed police pin people to the ground, kicking or using batons on them. One man told Dozhd TV channel that one such person had been removed from the police van for a beating after asking officers to identify themselves. Banned from rallying, the organisers designated this a Saturday ""stroll"" with multiple gathering points along Moscow's boulevard ring. So it wasn't always obvious who was protesting. The old ladies on the benches? The man walking his dog? The food delivery man, right in the middle of it? To the riot police, out in huge numbers in helmets and body armour, it didn't seem to matter much. They erected metal barriers and blocked off roads. Then a woman's voice came over a loudspeaker, to declare that the security forces included conscripts. ""Your sons are among them!"", she said. Then those conscripts - and the professionals - swooped and grabbed people. I saw one man being carried off upside down still strapped to his bicycle. Once again, hundreds have been detained. This time, though, the police mostly kept their batons buckled to their belts. But the defiance I heard from protesters suggests they'll be back. Alexander Svidersky, a member of a district electoral commission, said he was arrested while out with his dog, which he managed to pass off to an acquaintance before being bundled into a police van. OVD-Info reported he said he was later taken out and hit around the kidneys before being dragged to another van. Detainees at one police station also told OVD-Info they were threatened with having their fingers ""cut off"" if they did not allow their fingerprints to be taken. Ms Sobol, a lawyer and video blogger, is one of the candidates excluded from the local elections. She has been on hunger strike for 21 days, and called on others to join the unsanctioned protest on Saturday. She was in a taxi about to set off for the rally when police officers dragged her into a black van. Ms Sobol was about to head to the unauthorised protest when she was taken by police Hours after her arrest,she tweeted from a police station,external, saying she had spent three hours being driven ""all over Moscow"" by a dozen masked officers. Authorities said she was being held for violating regulations for street demonstrations. In July, Ms Sobol was dragged out of the electoral commission office on a sofa. Speaking to independent broadcaster Dozhd before her detention, she said the authorities ""are doing everything they can to try to intimidate the opposition"". ""That is why it is important to come out today to show that Muscovites are not afraid of provocation and they are ready to continue to stand up for their rights,"" she added. This video can not be played Lawyer Lyubov Sobol filmed herself being dragged out on a sofa Georgy Alburov, from the anti-corruption group FBK, which has links to prominent opposition leader Alexei Navalny, tweeted from the back of a police vehiclesaying he had been arrested at the protest.,external Shortly afterwards, Russian officials announced an investigation into FBK for alleged money laundering of a billion roubles  ($15.3m, Â£16.6m) - though it did not name any individuals. The nation's investigative committee said that funds had been knowingly obtained through criminal means. Authorities detained more than 1,000 demonstrators last weekendduring a demonstration, one of the biggest crackdowns in years. Election authorities have barred opposition candidates from taking part in Moscow city authority elections planned for 8 September. Officials said many of the signatures required for their candidacy applications were invalid. But protesters say they were excluded for political reasons. Another protest held in solidarity in St Petersburg on Saturday had some 1,000 attendees - but it had not been banned by local officials, and there are no reports of arrests. Authorities have launched an investigation into the protests. On Friday, they detained a number of men - including Alexey Minyaylo, an independent politician and aide to Ms Sobol - in connection with the ""mass unrest"", a charge which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in jail. Opposition politician Konstantin Yankauskas, who is one of the banned election candidates, completed a seven-day jail sentence on Saturday - and was immediately re-arrested as he left the detention facility.

Police said officers had been forced to find some people who had gone back to their homes Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Swann said the risk during those trips ""was extraordinarily high"" and they had caused problems. ""The vast majority of those who have been allowed back in to Whaley Bridge have been fantastic,"" she said. ""However, there have been a very small minority of people who have returned to their homes and have not presented back at the road block at which they entered.

Grab-and-go for danger zone residents Whaley Bridge dam emergency in pictures Earlier on Sunday, Derbyshire Deputy Chief Fire Officer Gavin Tomlinson said teams at Whaley Bridge had made good progress. ""We now know we have taken around 35% of the contents of reservoir out now and we are aiming to get it down about 25% where we think it is at a safe level,"" he said.

"The pilots were arrested before boarding a scheduled flight to Newark Two United Airlines pilots have been arrested at Glasgow Airport for allegedly failing a breath test before boarding a flight to Newark, New Jersey. The men, aged 45 and 61, have not been charged but remain in custody and are expected to appear before Paisley Sheriff Court on Tuesday. Police Scotland confirmed officers were called to the airport at 07:35 BST. The men were arrested before boarding flight UA162. It was expected to take off for Newark at about 09:00 but was cancelled. United Airlines said in a statement the safety of its customers and crew was ""always our top priority"". It said: ""We hold all of our employees to the highest standards and have a strict, no tolerance policy for alcohol. ""These pilots were immediately removed from service and we are fully cooperating with local authorities.

"This video can not be played Russia protests: Police arrest scores of illegal demonstrators More than 600 people have been detained over an unauthorised protest in Moscow, amid reports of police violence. Protesters had gathered in the Russian capital after authorities disqualified a number of opposition candidates from standing in local elections. Leading activist Lyubov Sobol was arrested before she could reach the rally, attended by 1,500 people. Video from the rally shows officers using their batons against demonstrators while making arrests. Russian officials initially said there had been just 30 arrests and 350 attendees. Monitoring group OVD-Info, which runs a hotline for reporting detentions, had been keeping a running toll, which rapidly jumped from a few dozen arrests to several hundred. The woman driving Russia's opposition protests Officers in riot gear had earlier moved into the capital and warned people not to protest. Russian news agency TASS reported that one police officer had been injured while making an arrest. But protesters also reported mistreatment at the hands of police. Footage broadcast on Russian television and shared on social media showed police pin people to the ground, kicking or using batons on them. One man told Dozhd TV channel that one such person had been removed from the police van for a beating after asking officers to identify themselves. Banned from rallying, the organisers designated this a Saturday ""stroll"" with multiple gathering points along Moscow's boulevard ring. So it wasn't always obvious who was protesting. The old ladies on the benches? The man walking his dog? The food delivery man, right in the middle of it? To the riot police, out in huge numbers in helmets and body armour, it didn't seem to matter much. They erected metal barriers and blocked off roads. Then a woman's voice came over a loudspeaker, to declare that the security forces included conscripts. ""Your sons are among them!"", she said. Then those conscripts - and the professionals - swooped and grabbed people. I saw one man being carried off upside down still strapped to his bicycle. Once again, hundreds have been detained. This time, though, the police mostly kept their batons buckled to their belts. But the defiance I heard from protesters suggests they'll be back. Alexander Svidersky, a member of a district electoral commission, said he was arrested while out with his dog, which he managed to pass off to an acquaintance before being bundled into a police van. OVD-Info reported he said he was later taken out and hit around the kidneys before being dragged to another van. Detainees at one police station also told OVD-Info they were threatened with having their fingers ""cut off"" if they did not allow their fingerprints to be taken. Ms Sobol, a lawyer and video blogger, is one of the candidates excluded from the local elections. She has been on hunger strike for 21 days, and called on others to join the unsanctioned protest on Saturday. She was in a taxi about to set off for the rally when police officers dragged her into a black van. Ms Sobol was about to head to the unauthorised protest when she was taken by police Hours after her arrest,she tweeted from a police station,external, saying she had spent three hours being driven ""all over Moscow"" by a dozen masked officers. Authorities said she was being held for violating regulations for street demonstrations. In July, Ms Sobol was dragged out of the electoral commission office on a sofa. Speaking to independent broadcaster Dozhd before her detention, she said the authorities ""are doing everything they can to try to intimidate the opposition"". ""That is why it is important to come out today to show that Muscovites are not afraid of provocation and they are ready to continue to stand up for their rights,"" she added. This video can not be played Lawyer Lyubov Sobol filmed herself being dragged out on a sofa Georgy Alburov, from the anti-corruption group FBK, which has links to prominent opposition leader Alexei Navalny, tweeted from the back of a police vehiclesaying he had been arrested at the protest.,external Shortly afterwards, Russian officials announced an investigation into FBK for alleged money laundering of a billion roubles  ($15.3m, Â£16.6m) - though it did not name any individuals. The nation's investigative committee said that funds had been knowingly obtained through criminal means. Authorities detained more than 1,000 demonstrators last weekendduring a demonstration, one of the biggest crackdowns in years. Election authorities have barred opposition candidates from taking part in Moscow city authority elections planned for 8 September. Officials said many of the signatures required for their candidacy applications were invalid. But protesters say they were excluded for political reasons. Another protest held in solidarity in St Petersburg on Saturday had some 1,000 attendees - but it had not been banned by local officials, and there are no reports of arrests. Authorities have launched an investigation into the protests. On Friday, they detained a number of men - including Alexey Minyaylo, an independent politician and aide to Ms Sobol - in connection with the ""mass unrest"", a charge which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in jail. Opposition politician Konstantin Yankauskas, who is one of the banned election candidates, completed a seven-day jail sentence on Saturday - and was immediately re-arrested as he left the detention facility.

"The National Crime Agency said 60 weapons were found concealed in the car A man from Dublin has been charged with illegally importing firearms after 60 weapons were found in a car arriving in Dover from Calais. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the guns were found concealed in a Volkswagen Passat by the Border Force and NCA on Friday. It is believed to be the largest seizure of lethal-purpose weapons at a UK port. Robert Keogh, 37, is due to appear at Margate Magistrates' Court on Monday. The NCA's Andrea Wilson said the removal of a ""huge haul"" of lethal firearms would make ""a significant impact"" on the organised crime group which tried to import them. She said: ""There's little doubt that these weapons would have gone on the criminal market and into the hands of seriously dangerous individuals."" Among the weapons discovered in the car was a Sig Sauer P226 blank-firing handgun with a barrel converted to fire live ammunition. Another 59 firearms were found hidden deep inside the car's bumper and both rear quarter panels.

Police have said they do not believe it was a random attack and have appealed for information. Det Sgt Clare Cassidy said: ""Thankfully the occupants of the house, a man and a woman, both aged 62 years, were not injured, however, this was very frightening for them and if they hadn't heard the noise outside and called the emergency services so quickly, this could have been so much worse.

"Engineers feared Whaley Bridge could be swamped if the Toddbrook Reservoir burst Hundreds of people have been evacuated from the Derbyshire town of Whaley Bridge after part of a dam collapsed. So what has happened at Toddbrook Reservoir, and how safe are Britain's dams? Toddbrook Reservoir has what is known as an earth dam. Richard Coackley, former president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, said the structures, also referred to as earthfill or embankment dams, feature: A core made from puddle clay, the same watertight material used to make canals, to stop water going through the dam Soil which surrounds the core and helps to hold it in place Over time, the earth on either side of the core compacts, increasing the stability of the dam Spillways - usually made of concrete - which drain water away when water levels get too high, a bit like an overflow on a bath Heavy rainfall caused water levels in the reservoir to rise and start flowing over the auxiliary - or emergency - spillway. The structure failed and was partly eroded away by water flowing over it. Alan Warren, chairman of the British Dam Society, said the cause was unclear. ""We don't know whether the concrete was inadequate or whether there was some problem underneath those concrete slabs which means the slabs fell into a void that had been forming underneath,"" he said. ""Maybe the joints in the slabs weren't properly sealed, and water was getting in through the joints."" Mr Coackley said photos suggested water had washed away soil beneath the slabs but the clay core was still intact. ""That's why the dam is still secure there at this stage,"" he said. Derwent Dam in Derbyshire is famous for being where the Dambusters practised their air raids during World War Two There are about 2,000 dams in England and Wales and about 800 in Scotland, according to Mr Coackley. They have various owners and serve a range of purposes, he said. ""Water companies providing drinking water are major ones, then there are reservoirs providing water supplies to the original canal system. ""There are other dams just for fishing and there are other dams just for sailing and water sports. Other dams are to provide water for agriculture."" Toddbrook's dam was built in the 1830s to create the reservoir, providing hydraulic power and water for the canal system. It still provides that water and is owned by the Canal and River Trust. Mr Coackley said Toddbrook helped to create wealth for Whaley Bridge before goods could be transported by road, and was still important for tourism and the local economy. The Canal and River Trust said the dam was ""absolutely fine"" when inspected in November All reservoirs in England and Wales with a capacity above 25,000 cubic metres above ground level must comply with theReservoirs Act,external. Every dam must have a supervising civil engineer and an inspecting civil engineer to file annual safety reports to Defra, Mr Coackley said. ""That's part of an Act of Parliament that goes back 100 years."" The Canal and River Trust said the annual inspection of Toddbrook Reservoir in November was ""absolutely fine"". This coincided with an independent inspection taking place every 10 years, and this was fine, too. ""Our engineers also inspect the reservoir twice-weekly and this is how we picked up the problem,"" said a spokeswoman. Scotland hasits own, separate Reservoirs Act,external, which requires owners to file safety reports with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. This video can not be played Aerial views of one of the Oroville Dam's two damaged spillways Mr Coackley said failures were ""very unusual indeed"". Prof Nigel Wright, a civil engineer and expert in flood risk management, said the last such evacuation in the UK was in 2007, whencracks appeared in the dam at Ulley Reservoir,external, near Rotherham, following heavy rain. Anew spillway was later builtto replace the original which collapsed during the floods. ""Since that, the government has insisted that a lot of dams have been reanalysed to check what the danger is and come up with plans for evacuation if necessary,"" said Prof Wright, of Nottingham Trent University. According to anEnvironment Agency report,external, the last time anyone died due to a dam disaster in the UK was in 1925, when two dams burst,killing 16 people in the north Wales village of Dolgarrog. That led to improved construction requirements under the Reservoirs Act, introduced in 1930 and updated in 1975. The UK's worst-ever dam disaster was the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864, which claimed at least 240 lives. Elsewhere in the world, dam disasters still lead to major loss of life. In January,300 people died in a mudslideafter a dam collapsed near Brumadinho in Brazil. Mr Warren, of the British Dam Society, said the Whaley Bridge incident was similar to one atOroville in California in 2017. ""A spillway was damaged, then the auxiliary spillway came into operation and there was erosion on the auxiliary spillway which meant they had to evacuate people downstream,"" he said. Most residents were evacuated from Whaley Bridge on Thursday While the failure of a dam could potentially kill hundreds or thousands of people, Mr Coackley said regular checks and maintenance, together with emergency plans, should prevent this. ""There are lots of people living below these dams and they are as safe as you can get,"" he said. ""It's not a disaster yet. Everything has gone according to plan with the Environment Agency and the emergency services all working with the inspecting engineer on what will be a pre-arranged plan. ""Every reservoir and dam has one of these plans in case of an emergency."" Prof Wright said the evacuation was a precaution, but the right thing to do. ""There's always a chance that you will move people and then nothing will happen, but that's much better than not moving them and then something happens,"" he said. Mr Coackley said engineers elsewhere would be looking at the implications of Toddbrook. ""There will be more checks. Dam engineers will be noting what's going on,"" he said. ""It's really important as an engineer to analyse why this has happened and make sure all of the other dams are safe.""

"This video can not be played Russia protests: Police arrest scores of illegal demonstrators More than 600 people have been detained over an unauthorised protest in Moscow, amid reports of police violence. Protesters had gathered in the Russian capital after authorities disqualified a number of opposition candidates from standing in local elections. Leading activist Lyubov Sobol was arrested before she could reach the rally, attended by 1,500 people. Video from the rally shows officers using their batons against demonstrators while making arrests. Russian officials initially said there had been just 30 arrests and 350 attendees. Monitoring group OVD-Info, which runs a hotline for reporting detentions, had been keeping a running toll, which rapidly jumped from a few dozen arrests to several hundred. The woman driving Russia's opposition protests Officers in riot gear had earlier moved into the capital and warned people not to protest. Russian news agency TASS reported that one police officer had been injured while making an arrest. But protesters also reported mistreatment at the hands of police. Footage broadcast on Russian television and shared on social media showed police pin people to the ground, kicking or using batons on them. One man told Dozhd TV channel that one such person had been removed from the police van for a beating after asking officers to identify themselves. Banned from rallying, the organisers designated this a Saturday ""stroll"" with multiple gathering points along Moscow's boulevard ring. So it wasn't always obvious who was protesting. The old ladies on the benches? The man walking his dog? The food delivery man, right in the middle of it? To the riot police, out in huge numbers in helmets and body armour, it didn't seem to matter much. They erected metal barriers and blocked off roads. Then a woman's voice came over a loudspeaker, to declare that the security forces included conscripts. ""Your sons are among them!"", she said. Then those conscripts - and the professionals - swooped and grabbed people. I saw one man being carried off upside down still strapped to his bicycle. Once again, hundreds have been detained. This time, though, the police mostly kept their batons buckled to their belts. But the defiance I heard from protesters suggests they'll be back. Alexander Svidersky, a member of a district electoral commission, said he was arrested while out with his dog, which he managed to pass off to an acquaintance before being bundled into a police van. OVD-Info reported he said he was later taken out and hit around the kidneys before being dragged to another van. Detainees at one police station also told OVD-Info they were threatened with having their fingers ""cut off"" if they did not allow their fingerprints to be taken. Ms Sobol, a lawyer and video blogger, is one of the candidates excluded from the local elections. She has been on hunger strike for 21 days, and called on others to join the unsanctioned protest on Saturday. She was in a taxi about to set off for the rally when police officers dragged her into a black van. Ms Sobol was about to head to the unauthorised protest when she was taken by police Hours after her arrest,she tweeted from a police station,external, saying she had spent three hours being driven ""all over Moscow"" by a dozen masked officers. Authorities said she was being held for violating regulations for street demonstrations. In July, Ms Sobol was dragged out of the electoral commission office on a sofa. Speaking to independent broadcaster Dozhd before her detention, she said the authorities ""are doing everything they can to try to intimidate the opposition"". ""That is why it is important to come out today to show that Muscovites are not afraid of provocation and they are ready to continue to stand up for their rights,"" she added. This video can not be played Lawyer Lyubov Sobol filmed herself being dragged out on a sofa Georgy Alburov, from the anti-corruption group FBK, which has links to prominent opposition leader Alexei Navalny, tweeted from the back of a police vehiclesaying he had been arrested at the protest.,external Shortly afterwards, Russian officials announced an investigation into FBK for alleged money laundering of a billion roubles  ($15.3m, Â£16.6m) - though it did not name any individuals. The nation's investigative committee said that funds had been knowingly obtained through criminal means. Authorities detained more than 1,000 demonstrators last weekendduring a demonstration, one of the biggest crackdowns in years. Election authorities have barred opposition candidates from taking part in Moscow city authority elections planned for 8 September. Officials said many of the signatures required for their candidacy applications were invalid. But protesters say they were excluded for political reasons. Another protest held in solidarity in St Petersburg on Saturday had some 1,000 attendees - but it had not been banned by local officials, and there are no reports of arrests. Authorities have launched an investigation into the protests. On Friday, they detained a number of men - including Alexey Minyaylo, an independent politician and aide to Ms Sobol - in connection with the ""mass unrest"", a charge which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in jail. Opposition politician Konstantin Yankauskas, who is one of the banned election candidates, completed a seven-day jail sentence on Saturday - and was immediately re-arrested as he left the detention facility.

"This video can not be played Ashes: England's Rory Burns scores maiden Test century v Australia on day two at Edgbaston Men's Ashes: First Specsavers Test, Edgbaston (day two of five) Australia 284:Smith 144, Broad 5-86 England 267-4:Burns 125*, Root 57 England trail by 17 runs Scorecard Rory Burns' maiden Test century led a determined England batting effort on the second day of the first Ashes Test against Australia at Edgbaston. The left-handed opener, playing his eighth match, battled through an attritional day for 125 not out. With Joe Root making 57 in a second-wicket stand of 132 and Ben Stokes an unbeaten 38, England reached 267-4, trailing by 17. England had slices of luck. Burns was on 21 when he would have been lbw to Nathan Lyon had Australia opted to review, while Root survived a James Pattinson delivery hitting off stump but not dislodging the bails when he was on nine. Those incidents were characteristic of a day when Australia bowled well for little reward in front of another noisy crowd that celebrated every England run and basked in the warm evening sunshine. Only when they persuaded the umpires to change the ball did the tourists have a period of success, with Joe Denly and Jos Buttler falling in the space of four overs. But Stokes, given a hero's welcome after his performance in the World Cup final, joined Burns in an unbroken stand of 73 for the fifth wicket. It leaves England in a strong position, even if they are likely to need a healthy first-innings lead to negate the disadvantage of batting last on a pitch already offering sharp turn. 'I was ready to run through a brick wall' - Burns inspired by 2005 Ashes winners 'Burns finally cracks the curse of the England opener' Arthur in frame for England job Listen: TMS podcast - Burns batting something 'Alastair Cook would be proud of' This video can not be played Burns survives lbw appeal on 21 as Australia unwisely decide not to review Speaking before the series, England coach Trevor Bayliss said ""you do not have to be Einstein"" to deduce that an unreliable top order was their biggest obstacle to regaining the Ashes. In an unconvincing display against Ireland last week, when England were bowled out for 85 in the first innings, it was Burns who looked the most vulnerable. Here, though, the Surrey man was the mainstay of a collective England showing of old-fashioned batting values - patience, watchfulness and occupation of the crease. It meant that the action was much more sedate than the chaos of the opening day, but the home crowd were just as keen to sing for England and taunt the Australians. Like Thursday, umpiring errors were a feature, but more forgivable. It was a surprise when Burns was shown to be lbw to Lyon, the noise of ball hitting stump actually led to Root being given caught behind and a tiny inside edge was not detected when he was given leg before to Peter Siddle on 14. Both were overturned. On top of England's solid day with the bat, there was also the welcome sight of James Anderson running on the outfield, but there is still no news from the scan on his injured calf. This video can not be played Unbelievable! - Ball hits stumps but Root survives Following Australia's Steve Smith on day one, Burns became the second idiosyncratic centurion of the Test, with his leaning stance, glance to mid-wicket as the bowler runs in and bat that comes down from the direction of gully. After England resumed on 10-0, Jason Roy edged to first slip for 10, leaving Burns and Root to grind through the rest of the morning and well into the afternoon. Root scored only 11 from his first 60 balls, but gradually increased in fluency. Burns left well, scored mainly square of the wicket on both sides and had the fortune of a number of edges not going to hand. Just as England were gaining momentum, Root patted a drive back to Siddle that the bowler held one-handed, with Denly and Buttler following soon after. Burns continued the battle. He spent 37 minutes on 92 and 35 balls in the 90s before a single off Lyon - confirmed after he was shown to have beaten a direct hit to the non-striker's end - sparked an emotional celebration and chants of his name from the Hollies Stand. Together with Stokes, he repelled the second new ball to take England to the brink of parity. This video can not be played Watch Burns reach his maiden Test century Bar bowling a fraction too short in the morning and off-spinner Lyon occasionally drifting on to the pads of England's left-handers, Australia toiled honestly and without the rub of the green. How different might the day have been had the bails fallen when Pattinson got through Root to hit the off stump? On another occasion, one of Burns' edges could have found a slip fielder. They were at least boosted 58 overs into the day when they convinced the umpires that the ball had gone out of shape and were given a replacement that swung much more than the previous version. Pattinson immediately shaped one into Denly that pinned him leg before, while Cummins' away movement had Buttler edge to third slip. That, though, was the best it got for the visitors, who at one point gave an over to Matthew Wade, a wicketkeeper by trade. After an unsuccessful review against Burns, the day ended with Australia being subjected to a barrage of mock appeals from the Hollies. England v Australia - highlights & reaction This video can not be played 'A big breakthrough' - Roy out for 10 England's Rory Burns on BBC Test Match Special:""It is something I have dreamt of. I was on 99 for a while - to get over the line is awesome. I was calm throughout it. I was waiting for a ball to come into my area. ""It was one for the purists - hard work. I enjoy that. Getting in the battle and doing what you can is enough for me."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on BBC Test Match Special:""Rory Burns has arrived here at Edgbaston. Mentally, he showed he is made of strong stuff. ""Alastair Cook would have been proud of that innings. There is no greater compliment for an England opening batsman. ""He was all over the shop against Ireland last week. His technique was not with him. He has gone away and worked with his coaches. He has got his hands tighter to his body and had a great game plan. To bat all day was fantastic. ""That was the best day of Test match batting I have seen from England in a long, long time."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""England really should be looking to establish a sizable first-innings lead tomorrow - and they will need it."" Burns is the first England opener to bat through a day in a Test since Alastair Cook against Australia at Melbourne in 2017 Burns spent 54 minutes in the nineties He is the first opener to score a hundred in England other than Alastair Cook since Adam Lyth in 2015 England and Wales Cricket Board Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Is Potter the right fit for West Ham?
