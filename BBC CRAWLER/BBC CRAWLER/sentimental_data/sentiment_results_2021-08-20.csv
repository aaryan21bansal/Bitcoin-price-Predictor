"House prices have continued their upward surge despite the economic impact of lockdowns. The current house prices boom was not caused by the stamp duty holiday, a new report has argued. The Resolution Foundation says prices will keep rising because of pandemic-related factors like low interest rates and changing home preferences. In fact, the think tank says the tax holiday was ""wasteful"" and HMRC lost out on about Â£4.4bn of taxes in England and Northern Ireland as a result. The Treasury said the policy saved jobs by stimulating the housing market. Between June 2020 and June 2021, the average value of a UK home increased 13.2%. And in summer 2020, several different transaction tax holidays were introduced across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. When the stamp duty holiday was introduced in England and Northern Ireland in July 2020, it was designed to boost the property market by helping buyers whose finances were affected by Covid, with savings of up to Â£15,000 per home. According to property website Rightmove,Wales has seen the biggest increase in house prices in the UK. AnHM Revenue & Customs evaluation of the stamp duty cut,externalintroduced for first-time buyers in wake of the financial crisis estimated that between 50-70% of the value fed through into higher house prices. The Resolution Foundation's Housing Outlook report has investigated whether there is a link between the recent house price boom and these tax holidays, including the stamp duty cut for first-time buyers. ""It is reasonable to expect at least part of the savings from any transaction tax holiday to be capitalised into house prices,"" the report's authors Lindsay Judge, Krishan Shah and Felicia Odamtten wrote. ""But logically, if the cuts to transaction taxes have been the overwhelming driver of the house price trends observed over the past 12 months, we would expect to see higher growth in areas where the savings from the change in policy have been most significant as a share of the house price."" The think tank says the assertion that housing prices have risen mainly because of tax holidays is ""somewhat wide off the mark"". The organisation says similar house price rises occurred in the US, France, Germany, Canada and Australia without the tax holiday. ""There appear to have been stronger forces at play within the housing market over the past year such as enforced savings during lockdowns, changing housing preferences and super-low interest rates,"" the authors wrote. ""We conclude that the transaction tax holidays have been problematic less because they were inflationary and more because they have been wasteful."" A HM Treasury Spokesperson said: ""The temporary stamp duty cut is helping to protect hundreds of thousands of jobs which rely on the property market by stimulating house moves."" ""Its time-limited nature is what has encouraged people to take advantage of the scheme.""

"Ambulance services in South Central, the South West, the North East and East of England have all needed help from military staff. Nearly 100 members of the Army have been brought in to help four ambulance trusts in England look after patients. High demand and staffing shortages mean they are being used to work alongside NHS staff. Ambulance services in the South Central, South West, North East and East areas of England are being supported by the military. The union, Unison, said it was a ""sign things are not right"" within the ambulance service. The pressures on the ambulance service are not just down to the pandemic. There have beenunprecedented numbers of 999 calls,external- increasing demand on ambulances combining with sickness, staff isolating because of Covid and annual leave. The Ministry of Defence says it received a request from the Department for Health and Social Care to ""provide support to a number of ambulance services in England"". In total, 97 military personnel have been deployed. They are helping take patients to and from appointments, maintaining ambulances, aiding with hospital discharges and working alongside paramedics. Vicky Court, assistant chief operating officer at North East Ambulance Services, describes the staffing as a ""boost to our resources"". She added: ""It will ensure everyone continues to get the care they need by freeing up paramedics to be more available to attend potentially life-threatening incidents."" Tom Abell, chief executive of the East of England Ambulance Service, says military personnel are being used as ""a stopgap measure"" - freeing up staff for front-line ambulances. Ambulance teams are often busy during the summer months as more of the public are out and about. But some services are saying call volumes are even higher than during the summer before the pandemic. As society has opened up, people's fears about going into hospital have receded. Patients with conditions which might not have been reported earlier in the year are coming forward. Added to that there is staff sickness and summer leave. With COVID pressures to handle as well ambulance services are under great strain. It was understandable that military personnel were called in to help the NHS during the first and second waves of the pandemic. The worry is that they are needed to back up frontline staff in August even after the predicted surge in Covid infections did not happen. This does not bode well for the months ahead when a difficult flu season and the usual winter pressures as well as Covid will stretch a tired workforce even further. Only four out of the 10 ambulance trusts that cover England need military support. The Scottish Ambulance Service says it is under ""significant pressure"" because of the pandemic, but is not receiving military support. Wales is not receiving military support. Northern Ireland is being supported by private contractors, St John Ambulance, and the fire service. Some ambulance crews from the Republic of Ireland have also been helping out in the border area. However, the ambulance service has not had help from the Army. The military has supported the NHS during the pandemic by setting up the Nightingale hospitals, working at testing centres, helping open additional Covid wards in areas with high case numbers and by driving ambulances. The Ministry of Defence says 754 military personnel - a mixture of medics and drivers -  have given support since the start of the pandemic. An NHS spokesperson said: ""The NHS has tried and tested measures in place for dealing with periods of exceptionally high demand, including working with partners - such as the military - to help with logistical tasks such as restocking ambulances and routine patient transfers."" A soldier from 2 Scots Royal Regiment of Scotland working at a Covid-19 testing centre at Glasgow Airport in April 2020 The Department of Health and Social Care in England said: ""[We're] committed to supporting ambulance crews who work tirelessly responding to emergencies every day."" Unison's head of health, Sara Gorton, said: ""Ambulance services were under immense pressure way before the pandemic. But Covid has made a bad situation significantly worse with high call-out rates and sickness. It's little wonder some trusts have had to bring in extra help.""

"Around 300,000 carbon dioxide monitors are to be made available to schools in England next term to help improve ventilation and lessen Covid outbreaks. The Department for Education said the portable monitors could be used to identify areas where more air-flow is needed. Teaching unions have been calling for urgent extra ventilation measures. They welcomed the pledge, but added any ventilation needs picked up by the monitors must be acted upon. Most Covid safety restrictions have been relaxed in England's schools. Neither masks, bubble groups nor socially distancing rules are required this coming term. Urgent call for Covid-safe ventilation in schools Air purifier pilot to combat school Covid spread Many schools have been opening windows and doors to keep air moving around classrooms to lessen the likelihood of Covid outbreaks, but this is easier in warmer weather. Pupils will be offered twice weekly Covid testing and two tests at school when the autumn term starts to lessen the amount of infection coming into school. However, those who have come into contact with a confirmed case will no longer have to isolate. The removal of restrictions has left teachers and some parents concerned that the mass-mixing of pupils may lead to a spike in Covid cases. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""Providing all schools with CO2 monitors will help them make sure they have the right balance of measures in place, minimising any potential disruption to education and allowing them to focus on world class lessons and catch up for the children who need it. ""By keeping up simple measures such as ventilation and testing, young people can now enjoy more freedom at school and college,"" he added. The DfE says it is prioritising special schools and alternative provision for the delivery of CO2 monitors, as they are likely to have higher rates of vulnerable pupils. But a statement on Friday made clear that this Â£25m batch of CO2 monitors has yet to be fully procured, less than two weeks before many schools return. However, it said: ""All schools and colleges are expected to receive at least partial allocations during the autumn term, enabling all settings to monitor areas where they believe airflow may be weakest."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said:  ""In truth, this equipment should have been in place ready for the start of the autumn term, and arguably a lot earlier in the crisis, but it is a case of better late than never. ""Government guidance to schools and colleges on reducing the risk of coronavirus transmission highlights the importance of keeping spaces well ventilated, but doesn't go much further than recommending that windows should be opened to improve natural ventilation. ""This is challenging in the depths of a British winter and does not make for an environment which is conducive to learning. Our understanding is that carbon dioxide monitors will indicate when spaces need ventilating thereby reducing the need to keep windows open all the time."" Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""This is a really welcome first step in accepting our argument that funding is needed for good ventilation. ""It follows examples set by administrations in New York City, Scotland and Ireland. ""Sadly, Gavin Williamson failed to get on the front-foot over the summer but the initial investment of Â£25m in CO2 monitors is welcome now and will start to make a difference. It is vital, though, that government must also commit to supporting schools to address any ventilation problems identified by these monitors.""

"The Ever Given, part of the Evergreen fleet, was impounded for three months after its release The huge container ship that blocked the Suez Canal in March - disrupting global trade - has passed back through the waterway without incident. The Ever Given was among a convoy of vessels sailing from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said. It had been offloading its cargo in Europe and is now en route to Asia. The ship was refloated after a major six-day salvage operation that led to the death of one person. It was then impounded for three months near the canal city of Ismailia while a compensation deal was agreed between Egypt and the Ever Given's owners. Allow Twitter content?

The SCA, in a series of tweets, said the Ever Given was escorted through the 193km (120-mile) canal by two tugboats and senior SCA guides. It was one of 26 ships that travelled from north to south through the canal on Friday, while 36 ships sailed in the opposite direction, the SCA added, hailing the waterway as the ""shortest and fastest navigational route linking the east with the west"". The Ever Given, one of the world's largest container ships, had been delivering its 18,300 containers to Rotterdam, Felixstowe and Hamburg and is now travelling to China. A satellite photograph reveals how the Ever Given was wedged across the canal The 400m-long (1,312ft) ship became wedged across the canal after running aground amid high winds on 23 March, blocking it for hundreds of ships and disrupting global trade. 'I was blamed for blocking the Suez Canal' How was the Suez Canal ship freed? Following its release, the SCA sought compensation for the Ever Given's Japanese owner Shoei Kisen for the cost of the salvage operation, damage to the canal's banks and other losses. The terms of the deal were not disclosed but Egypt had eventually settled on a $550m (Â£397m) demand. Stuck Suez ship finally on the move again.

"The government is coming under further pressure to help alleviate the UK's lorry driver shortage. Lobby groups for the retail and transport industries have jointly written to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng warning the impact on supply chains is getting worse. They want a review of plans not to grant temporary work visas to drivers from the EU, and better training. Ministers have said employers should invest in British workers. Logistics UK, which represents freight firms, and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) say that while Brexit and Covid-19 caused lorry drivers to leave the UK, a temporary visa could lure them back. The two groups said in their letter a shortfall of about 90,000 HGV drivers ""is placing increasingly unsustainable pressure on retailers and their supply chains"". ""While there was a shortage of HGV drivers prior to the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit, these two events have exacerbated situation. ""The pandemic halted driver training and testing for over 12 months, while an estimated 25,000 EU drivers returned home during the pandemic and following the end of the transition period."" The situation is likely to worsen over the coming weeks, the groups warn. The start of the school year and return of workers to offices is likely to increase the number of deliveries and locations, and the industry is fast approaching its busiest period - the build up to Christmas. The two groups call for three specific measures: Review the decision not to grant temporary work visas to HGV drivers from the European Union. It would help in the short term while a driver testing backlog is cleared and new drivers trained Reform the National Skills Fund to enable HGV driver training to be funded and injecting flexibility into Apprenticeship Levy, such as enabling ""front-loading"" of training to get trainees driving as soon as possible into the 12-month programme. Improve testing Covid facilities so that HGV drivers can be tested daily. The Road Haulage Association has already said that there was shortfall of about 60,000 lorry drivers in the UK over the summer. Supermarkets such as Tesco and Aldi have been offering bonuses and other incentives to boost recruitment, but the labour squeeze continues. Analysis of the latest ONS Labour Force Survey for the second quarter suggests that 14,000 EU lorry drivers left jobs in the UK in the year toâ¯June 2020, and only 600 had returned by July 2021. A government spokesperson said on Friday: ""The British people repeatedly voted to end free movement and take back control of our immigration system and employers should invest in our domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad. ""We recently announced a package of measures to help tackle the HGV driver shortage, including plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of tests able to be conducted. ""We have also temporarily relaxed drivers' hours rules to allow HGV drivers to make slightly longer journeys, but these must only be used where necessary and must not compromise driver safety.""

"Alexei Navalny collapsed on a flight in August 2020 The UK is imposing asset freezes and travel bans on seven Russian nationals linked to the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Mr Navalny - a staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin -almost died from a nerve agent attacklast year. He accused Mr Putin of ordering the attack, something the Kremlin denies. The UK Foreign Office said the sanctions, taken with the US, targeted those ""directly responsible for planning or carrying out the attack"". All seven of the individuals targeted are members of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), it added. Kremlin critic Navalny recalls near-death torment Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""We are sending a clear message that any use of chemical weapons by the Russian state violates international law, and a transparent criminal investigation must be held. ""We urge Russia to declare its full stock of Novichok nerve agents."" The term Novichok - ""newcomer"" in Russian - applies to a group of nerve agents developed in a lab by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. They paralyse muscles and can lead to death by asphyxiation. Mr Navalny, 45, was exposed to one such nerve agent on a flight from Tomsk, Siberia, to Moscow on 20 August 2020. By the time the plane landed, he could not speak and was taken directly to hospital. He was later transferred to a hospital in Berlin, Germany, where he spent a further 32 days recovering, including 24 days in intensive care. In January, he returned to Russia and was arrested on arrival. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny: what you need to know Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny has long been the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin. The 45-year-old blogger has millions of Russian followers on social media - many in their early 20s or younger - and managed to get some of his supporters elected to local councils in Siberia in 2020. So far he has been unable to challenge the president at the ballot box. Mr Navalny was immediately arrested as he flew back into Moscow on 17 January, after months spent recovering in Berlin from the near-fatal nerve agent attack. His supporters staged mass protests across Russia and police responded with force, detaining thousands for attending the unauthorised rallies. President Putin's foremost critic is now at a Russian penal colony, serving a jail term for failing to stick to the terms of a suspended sentence while he was in Berlin. But his voice of opposition has not gone away, even though his supporters fear for his life. The UK previously imposed sanctions on six Russians, including the director of the FSB, who the government holds responsible for the poisoning. Imprisoned Mr Navalny marked the anniversary of the poisoning attack against him by urging global leaders to put more attention on combating corruption and to target tycoons close to Mr Putin. The UK and US also issued a joint statement in which they reaffirmed their condemnation of the ""assassination attempt"" on Mr Navalny. Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life The statement added: ""We welcome sanctions actions made by international partners and will continue to co-ordinate with international partners on further measures. ""Today the UK and the US join in taking further action against the individuals directly responsible for carrying out the poisoning of Mr Navalny. ""As we did after Russia's use of a chemical weapon against the Skripals in the United Kingdom in March 2018, we continue to underline that there must be accountability and no impunity for those that use chemical weapons."" Also on Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that, in a meeting with Mr Putin, she had ""demanded"" he free his political opponent. Mr Putin denies Mr Navalny's imprisonment is politically motivated. Speaking at the Kremlin, Ms Merkel said: ""It's a depressing situation from our point of view.

"This video can not be played SNP and Greens seal power-sharing deal The SNP and Scottish Greens havepublished details,externalof their new power sharing arrangement. The deal will take the Greens into government for the first time anywhere in the UK. It includes a commitment to hold a referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years, and preferably by the end of 2023. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave details at a briefing alongside the two Scottish Greens co-leaders. Opposition parties have described the arrangement as a ""nationalist coalition of chaos"" that will be a ""disaster"" for Scotland. What could the SNP-Green deal mean for Scotland? The agreement will see two Green MSPs appointed as junior ministers in Ms Sturgeon's government. These ministers could be invited to attend cabinet meetings when their portfolios are being discussed, with the Green co-leaders attending cabinet at least twice a year. BBC Scotland's political editor, Glenn Campbell, said the arrangement will ""look like a coalition but fall short of a coalition"". The pro-independence Greens have signed up to the bulk of the government's policy - but there will also be areas where they are in disagreement with the SNP, and they will be able to criticise it on those points. These excluded areas include aviation policy, international relations, policy on fee-paying schools, fox hunting and Nato membership if Scotland becomes independent. Scottish Greens co-leaders Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie arrived at the first minister's Bute House residence on Friday The co-operation agreement says the two parties will work together to provide ""effective and responsible  leadership for Scotland for this session of the Scottish Parliament, in the interests of Scotland, of the people who live in Scotland, and of future generations"". It says they will secure a referendum on Scottish independence ""within the current parliamentary session on a specific date to be determined by the Scottish Parliament"". If the Covid crisis has passed, their intention would be for the referendum to be within the first half of the five-year parliamentary session. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is adamant that another referendum should not happen any time soon - with BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley saying that stance is unlikely to change. The partnership agreement also includes commitments to: Increase investment in active travel and public transport, with the aim of providing a ""realistic and affordable"" alternative to car use More support for the marine renewables and offshore wind sectors A 10-year Â£500m Just Transition Fund for the north east and Moray Increasing the level of the Scottish Child Payment to the full Â£20 within this parliamentary term Investing at least Â£1.8bn over this parliamentary session in energy efficiency and renewable heating Enhancing tenants rights and delivering 110,000 affordable homes by 2032 It is a new form of government at Holyrood and a first in the UK, and is based on the arrangements the New Zealand Greens have with Jacinda Ardern's government. The Greens are the fourth largest party in the Scottish Parliament after winning eight seats in the election in May, while the SNP won 64 seats - leaving them one short of an overall majority. The SNP had formed a minority government for the previous five years, and had relied on the support of the Greens to pass its annual budget. This video can not be played Scottish Conservative leader: SNP-Green deal 'all about independence vote' Ms Sturgeon said the agreement was about ""doing politics and governance better to find the solutions needed to solve the problems confronting the world today"". She added: ""The spirit of co-operation and consensus-building is very much in keeping with the founding principles of our Scottish Parliament. ""We do not agree on everything but we are coming out of our comfort zones to focus on what we do agree on."" Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the ""historic"" arrangement could not have come at a more important time. He said: ""We must build a fairer and compassionate country and we must do everything in our power to tackle the escalating climate and nature emergencies to deliver a just transition for all. That is what this deal will do"". Jacinda Ardern signed a co-operation agreement with the Green Party in November 2020 The deal has been struck with less than three months to go until the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. The Greens have been pressing the Scottish government to go further in tackling global warming in exchange for their support, and wants it to oppose any new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea. But the agreement does not do this, and instead offers support for a ""pre-production oil and gas licence climate checkpoint review"". The UK government isexpected to announce soonwhether extraction of oil and gas at the Cambo site near Shetland will be given approval. The GMB union said workers across the energy sector were ""looking on with real concern"" and would be seeking assurances that the SNP-Green deal will not be a ""one-way ticket to the dole queue"". The Greens are also opposed to the government's road building programme, and some businesses including fish farming have warned that Green policies could damage the economy if they are adopted by the government. This new power-sharing partnership will take Greens into government for the first time anywhere in the UK. That may have particular resonance in the months before the UN climate summit - COP26 - is held in Glasgow. For Greens, it is about maximising policy influence, especially when it comes to tackling global warming. For the SNP, it is about creating a more stable administration, able to see off opposition ambush. Whatever else is agreed, this tie-up will give the Scottish government a majority at Holyrood to pass budgets, win confidence votes and make legislation - including for another independence referendum. It looks a lot like a coalition but crucially the Greens have opt-outs from policies they don't like - retaining the ability to criticise the government of which they would become part The Scottish Conservatives described the tie up between the two parties as a ""nationalist coalition of chaos focused on splitting up the country and dividing Scotland with another bitter referendum"". Leader Douglas Ross said the agreement was ""anti-jobs and anti-business"" and would punish hardworking families, motorists, and the oil and gas industry. The Conservatives have formally requested that the Greens no longer receive an opposition leader's spot at First Minister's Questions, which the party says would be in line with the precedent set by the Labour-Liberal Democrat government at Holyrood between 1999 and 2007. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar challenged the Greens to show they are not simply the SNP's ""lackeys"", and said the party needed to ""rediscover their principles and fight for a greener Scotland rather than roll over to the SNP every time the going gets tough."" He added: ""Months have been wasted negotiating this rubber-stamp for SNP policy - meanwhile, A&E is in crisis, we are facing a growing cancer emergency, and we are still waiting for the NHS Recovery Plan. ""Scotland needs a real alternative, which puts recovery before the old constitutional arguments."" Meanwhile Alex Cole-Hamilton, thenew leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""I think it looks like pretty thin gruel for the Green party, they'll soon realise that they will have to carry the can for all of the SNP's inadequacies on public policy."" The deal was approved by the Scottish cabinet on Friday morning, but still requires the approval of the decision-making bodies of both parties before it can take effect. The SNP's national executive committee is due to meet on Saturday and the Greens have scheduled a meeting of their membership for Saturday 28 August. Both sides want the deal to take effect before Holyrood returns with a statement on the programme for government on Tuesday 31 August. Their deal follows two months of negotiations led by the Deputy First Minister John Swinney for the government and MSPs Ross Greer and Maggie Chapman for the Greens.

"This video can not be played ""You've seen my British passport, these are my children"" ""Get back, get back,"" screamed the British soldier at a crowd gathered in front of the secure compound where those being evacuated by the UK embassy are taken before flying out. In front of him, many frantically waved their British passports in the air, hoping to be allowed through but a group of Afghan security guards wielding rubber hoses tried to push them back. Many in the crowd had not received any indication they would be evacuated, but had pitched up in any case, desperate for a route out of Afghanistan. Others, however, had received emails from the embassy telling them arrive here, and wait to be processed for a flight. They include Helmand Khan, an Uber driver from west London, who had arrived with his young children in Afghanistan a few months back to visit relatives. He thrusts a handful of British passports towards me. ""For the last three days I'm trying to go inside,"" he tells me in despair, with his two young sons by his side. Also here is Khalid, a former interpreter for the British army. His wife gave birth to a child just two weeks ago, and he's terrified the baby could die in such scenes. ""I've been here since the morning,"" he says, ""the Taliban lashed me on the back on my way."" A short walk away is the main entrance to the compound. Thousands have turned up, the vast majority with no realistic prospect of being evacuated. British soldiers at times fired into the air to control the crowd. The only way to get inside is to somehow push your way through the crowd, and wave your documents in their faces, hoping they will allow you past. The situation seems even more chaotic at the airport gates manned by US soldiers, while in front of the main civilian entrance to the airport the Taliban have been regularly firing into the air and beating back crowds who try and surge inside. I'm constantly bombarded with questions by the Afghans who are trying to enter the British controlled compound, and who are at a total loss as to what to do. ""Can you help me?"" ""Will they let me in?"" Many try to show me documents they've brought with them, proving they spent time working with international forces or foreign embassies. 'If they find me, they will kill me' Afghanistan: Danger lies on Kabul road to freedom One young woman tells me she was an international basketball player. She has not had any contact with the British embassy, but says she's in fear for her life. She chokes up trying to describe her terror. Thousands are attempting to escape The Taliban insist all those linked to the government have been granted an amnesty. The group says it intends to establish an ""inclusive"" government, but many here are deeply anxious about the future. Elsewhere in the city, things are far calmer. It feels like a different world. Shops and restaurants are opening up, though at a fruit and vegetable market stallholders tell me there are still significantly fewer people out and about. One man, selling cosmetic products, says there are far fewer women in particular, though it's not uncommon to see them on the streets. The Taliban meanwhile are everywhere, patrolling in vehicles seized from the Afghan security forces. They say they're maintaining a presence to prevent looting and unrest, and some residents tell us they do feel more secure, not least because the militants are no longer carrying out targeted killings or bomb blasts. Many are still trying to establish what life under Taliban rule will look like. One taxi driver tells me he ferried a group of fighters across the city whilst playing music from the car stereo. ""They didn't say anything,"" he tells me whilst grinning, ""they're not strict like they were before."" Khalid, a former interpreter for the British army, waits outside with his family But other reports are emerging of the Taliban turning up at the homes of journalists or former government figures and questioning them. Many fear it's only a matter of time before they're targeted violently. Back close to the airport, and Khalid, the former interpreter with a young baby finally manages to make it into the holding compound. Others are still struggling though and one British Afghan pleads with me to help. ""How can I take my children through this crowd,"" he asks? Many others, not eligible for evacuation but desperate to leave, will be left behind to face a deeply uncertain future.

"A campaigner outside Bute House as the agreement was announced The SNP and the Scottish Greens have revealeddetails of the co-operation agreementwhich will see the parties work together at Holyrood. What could the deal mean for Scotland over the next five years? The most obvious reason for the SNP to bring the Greens into government is to present a united front against the climate emergency, in the year Glasgow hosts the COP26 conference. However, as a flagship issue for the Greens - the clue is in the name - this is a topic the parties have clashed on frequently. The Greens did not vote in favour of the Scottish government'sclimate billin the last term of parliament, saying the targets it set - for a 75% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 - were not ambitious enough. However, their 2021 election campaign was more about hitting these goals than stretching them, with the 80% figure they pledged in the 2019 general election absent and co-leader Patrick Harvie saying the most important thing is now to deliver on the promises made. On that front, the Greens want to see ""a fundamental transformation of our economy and society"", saying that ""every industry, every part of our economy and every individual will need to rise to the challenge"". So not only would there be more pressure on ministers to hit their emissions targets - havingfallen short of many of them so far- there would be calls for change across more or less every portfolio area. Specific policies championed by the Greens include phasing out single-use and non-essential plastics by 2025; the introduction of more Low Emission Zones in cities; and banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2026 and boilers which run on fossil fuels by 2028. Striking a deal would give the SNP and Greens a comfortable majority in the Holyrood chamber The other key motivation for the SNP in doing a deal is security - essentially making the coming parliamentary term an easier ride. Nicola Sturgeon herselffaced a confidence votein the final days of the last session, although her position was never truly in danger. But her deputy John Swinney was in real trouble on several occasions, with the Greens joining other opposition parties in calling for his head if he didn't back down in rows over school exams and the publication of government legal advice. With the Greens signed up to a formal deal, the prospect of any minister being forced out by opposition pressure recedes. Not only that, the SNP no longer need to worry about getting their budgets through parliament - or at least, they only have to worry about doing a deal with their Green partners. This would make Kate Forbes' job as finance secretary slightly easier each February, in that she wouldn't need to sit down with rivals like Murdo Fraser and Jackie Baillie, or have to make concessions to the Lib Dems. However, the Greens may still be looking for a decent return in exchange for passing up the annual opportunity to put the government over a barrel. The SNP and the Greens have both called for major investment in infrastructure - particularly in green energy and renewables It is unclear as yet how the monumental relief programmes of the pandemic era will be paid for, and what that means for future budgets. The decisions on how to recover from the economic crisis which accompanied the health one were already going to be tricky, before they involved two parties with subtly different ideologies. Take for example the principle of economic growth. The SNP manifesto - while stressing that growth should be sustainable - talks about increasing Scottish GDP by more than Â£4bn. The Greens meanwhile are suspicious of the whole concept of ""endless economic growth"", with their election platform decrying ""the deep shortcomings of conventional economics"". So what might actually happen, in practice? The manifestos of each party pledged massive investment in infrastructure in an attempt to build a more sustainable economy post-pandemic, so this is something they will likely be able to work together on - so long as it doesn't involve big road-building projects. Both parties have talked about moving to a four-day working week and back some form of universal basic income, so their pact might move these ambitious policies up the priority list. The two are also largely aligned on income tax, with the SNP targeting ""stability"" across the next five years and the Greens agreeing that ""now is not the time for increases"" for most. Both have promised a Citizens Assembly on taxation to study wider reforms, so that should be another easy box to tick. The Greens want to scrap the council tax, something the SNP have pledged to do on various occasions - but never quite delivered. Could a deal here finally push reforms to local government funding over the line? And the Greens also want to push for more fiscal powers to be devolved from Westminster so that they can set up things like an annual wealth tax on anyone worth more than Â£1m (including property, pensions and other assets) and a tax on carbon emissions from corporations. Green MSPs will be free to disagree with the SNP over the future of the oil industry - but will they also try to win them round? One sector we are likely to hear a lot about is the oil and gas industry. There will doubtless be a clause in any SNP-Green deal allowing the parties to disagree amicably on things like how quickly to move on from fossil fuels, but it doesn't mean there wouldn't be friction behind the scenes - and indeed some lobbying. Take for example the issue of new licences for drilling in the waters around Scotland, like theproposed new Cambo oil field. The Greens have already said they are putting ""maximum pressure"" on the Scottish government to oppose such plans. The SNP insists this is solely a matter for the UK government, with offshore oil and gas contracts being in Westminster's remit. But of course that hasn't stopped them taking a view on various other reserved matters, from Trident to Universal Credit and indeed the Acts of Union. Ministers have thus far refused to come off the fence about Cambo, perhaps anxious about alienating oil industry workers - but might having Green voices closer to the heart of government tip the scales somewhat? Co-leader Lorna Slater recently attended a protest against the development. Would she really never bring it up if she happened to be in the next office over from the energy minister? Green MSPs have joined trans rights campaigners in rallying ouside Holyrood The issue of trans rights and reform to the Gender Recognition Act has been a sticky one for the SNP, and society more generally. The government wants to change the law to make it easier for people to change their legally recognised gender, and reduce the ""trauma"" associated with the process. However, it has run into a row over whether allowing people to self-identify their gender could undermine the legal protections given to women under the Equality Act. Prominent SNP figures have voiced concerns about the plans, and even post-election - with a new group of MSPs lined up behind the leadership and more critical voices like Joan McAlpine no longer in parliament - there could have been a backbench rebellion over elements of the legislation. The Greens, though, are all-in on the policy - to the extent that theysplit with former MSP Andy Wightman over it. Seven extra votes would make it much easier for the SNP to fulfil their manifesto pledge to make changes ""at the earliest opportunity"". Theagreement between the parties,externalpromises that a bill to reform the Gender Recognition Act will be introduced in the first year of the parliamentary session. This may be one of the most talked about elements of the deal, but may actually be the part where an accord is needed the least. During the election campaign, the Greens pledged that every one of their MSPs would back a new independence referendum - much like those of the SNP. The two manifestos were closely aligned in a bid to cement the mandate of any pro-independence majority - so the votes for indyref2 are essentially in the bag regardless. The real question is whether a formalising of the pro-independence bloc at Holyrood could have any impact in swaying the UK government when it comes to backing a new referendum. There remains little sign that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has had a change of heart, but the SNP and Greens may hope that in the longer term a formal arrangement might help make the case seem all the more undeniable.

"Mark Frerichs, left, was taken by the Taliban in 2020 Charlene Cakora, 57, spent a frantic week in Washington DC trying to convey a message to President Joe Biden: rescue her brother from Taliban captivity. Mrs Cakora's brother, Mark Frerichs, was kidnapped by the group over a year ago. He is one of two remaining Americans thought to have been kidnapped by the Taliban during the US war in Afghanistan who is still unaccounted for. Amid the Afghan government's collapse, the fall of Kabul and chaotic scenes of thousands scrambling to flee the country being broadcast around the globe, his family said they were increasingly desperate for his return, and frustrated by the lack of progress from the government. ""We have been at war with the Taliban for 20 years. President Biden declared the war over on 31 August,"" Mrs Cakora told the BBC. ""When a war ends, each side get to have their prisoners come home. That is all we are asking for Mark."" The family had ""waited patiently"" through both the Trump and Biden administrations, she said. ""[We] were told that efforts were underway to get my brother home,"" she added. ""Well, they were not."" At least seven US civilians have been taken captive or gone missing during the war in Afghanistan. Of the total, one was reportedly killed, one escaped, and three were rescued or released. An eighth captive, Bowe Bergdahl, was a US soldier captured after deserting his post in 2009. He was released in 2014. Mr Frerichs, 59, had been living and working in Kabul as a civil engineer for 10 years when he was kidnapped. A ""journeyman contractor"" who went from project to project, motivated by a desire to help people in need, he had found ""a good fit for himself in Afghanistan,"" Mrs Cakora said. ""Three days before he was kidnapped, he told me that he had just finished a municipal water project. He was so proud of it."" The US Navy veteran was lured to a meeting to discuss a potential project and taken against his will to Khost Province, a former national security official told the BBC. Mr Frerichs and an Afghan colleague examine a project they worked on together In Khost, the official said, he was handed over to the Haqqani Network, one of the region's most powerful and feared militant groups. The network's leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is one of the Taliban's top deputy leaders. Advocates working to secure Mr Frerichs' release say that the ""only"" thing that the Taliban have mentioned when US officials have pressed for his return is the release of Bashir Noorzai, a Taliban-affiliated drug lord who has been imprisoned in the US for the last 16 years. Noorzai, who was arrested in 2005, was sentenced to life in prison in 2009 on charges that he imported over $50m (Â£36m) worth of heroin from Afghanistan and Pakistan into the US and other countries.  He fought alongside the now-deceased Taliban founder Mullah Mohammed Omar against Soviet occupation in the 1980s, and is believed to have supplied the group with financial backing, weapons, ammunition and as many as 400 fighters. Responding to BBC queries, a state department spokesperson said that the US Special Representative for Afghanistan has pressed the Taliban for Mr Frerichs' release and raised the issue with Taliban representatives in Qatar and Pakistan. ""We place a high priority on Marks Frerichs' safety and will not stop working until he is safely returned to his family,"" the spokesperson said. Spokespeople at the Taliban's representative office in Qatar did not respond to BBC requests for comment. Mrs Cakora said that while the family understands that an exchange of Noorzai for Mr Frerichs is a ""hard trade"" and that it would mean making concessions to kidnappers, they believe it is the only viable option. When asked what she would tell the White House about her case, Mrs Cakora directed a plea at President Biden. ""Please treat my brother like he was your son and act to bring him home quickly,"" she said. She also had a message for Taliban political leader Abdul Ghani Baradar. ""We know that this war is ending, and you want your prisoners back as much as we want my brother,"" she said. ""Please treat him well and work with US officials to arrange a prisoner swap that gets you Bashir Noorzai and returns Mark home safely to us. Let that be the one thing that both sides can see as a win."" Besides Mr Frerichs, only one other American suspected to have been abducted in Afghanistan, author Paul Overby Jr, remains unaccounted for. Mr Overby was last heard from in May 2014, when he vanished in Khost while traveling to interview Sirajuddin Haqqani. The Taliban have denied any involvement. With the situation in Afghanistan growing more dangerous by the day, Mrs Cakora expressed hope that her brother's release may provide a small positive outcome. ""President Biden has the power to make it happen,"" she said. ""The story on our exit from Afghanistan is horrible. Can't we get one glimmer of good news by having my brother come home?""

"Ambulance services in South Central, the South West, the North East and East of England have all needed help from military staff. Nearly 100 members of the Army have been brought in to help four ambulance trusts in England look after patients. High demand and staffing shortages mean they are being used to work alongside NHS staff. Ambulance services in the South Central, South West, North East and East areas of England are being supported by the military. The union, Unison, said it was a ""sign things are not right"" within the ambulance service. The pressures on the ambulance service are not just down to the pandemic. There have beenunprecedented numbers of 999 calls,external- increasing demand on ambulances combining with sickness, staff isolating because of Covid and annual leave. The Ministry of Defence says it received a request from the Department for Health and Social Care to ""provide support to a number of ambulance services in England"". In total, 97 military personnel have been deployed. They are helping take patients to and from appointments, maintaining ambulances, aiding with hospital discharges and working alongside paramedics. Vicky Court, assistant chief operating officer at North East Ambulance Services, describes the staffing as a ""boost to our resources"". She added: ""It will ensure everyone continues to get the care they need by freeing up paramedics to be more available to attend potentially life-threatening incidents."" Tom Abell, chief executive of the East of England Ambulance Service, says military personnel are being used as ""a stopgap measure"" - freeing up staff for front-line ambulances. Ambulance teams are often busy during the summer months as more of the public are out and about. But some services are saying call volumes are even higher than during the summer before the pandemic. As society has opened up, people's fears about going into hospital have receded. Patients with conditions which might not have been reported earlier in the year are coming forward. Added to that there is staff sickness and summer leave. With COVID pressures to handle as well ambulance services are under great strain. It was understandable that military personnel were called in to help the NHS during the first and second waves of the pandemic. The worry is that they are needed to back up frontline staff in August even after the predicted surge in Covid infections did not happen. This does not bode well for the months ahead when a difficult flu season and the usual winter pressures as well as Covid will stretch a tired workforce even further. Only four out of the 10 ambulance trusts that cover England need military support. The Scottish Ambulance Service says it is under ""significant pressure"" because of the pandemic, but is not receiving military support. Wales is not receiving military support. Northern Ireland is being supported by private contractors, St John Ambulance, and the fire service. Some ambulance crews from the Republic of Ireland have also been helping out in the border area. However, the ambulance service has not had help from the Army. The military has supported the NHS during the pandemic by setting up the Nightingale hospitals, working at testing centres, helping open additional Covid wards in areas with high case numbers and by driving ambulances. The Ministry of Defence says 754 military personnel - a mixture of medics and drivers -  have given support since the start of the pandemic. An NHS spokesperson said: ""The NHS has tried and tested measures in place for dealing with periods of exceptionally high demand, including working with partners - such as the military - to help with logistical tasks such as restocking ambulances and routine patient transfers."" A soldier from 2 Scots Royal Regiment of Scotland working at a Covid-19 testing centre at Glasgow Airport in April 2020 The Department of Health and Social Care in England said: ""[We're] committed to supporting ambulance crews who work tirelessly responding to emergencies every day."" Unison's head of health, Sara Gorton, said: ""Ambulance services were under immense pressure way before the pandemic. But Covid has made a bad situation significantly worse with high call-out rates and sickness. It's little wonder some trusts have had to bring in extra help.""

"Mark Frerichs, left, was taken by the Taliban in 2020 Charlene Cakora, 57, spent a frantic week in Washington DC trying to convey a message to President Joe Biden: rescue her brother from Taliban captivity. Mrs Cakora's brother, Mark Frerichs, was kidnapped by the group over a year ago. He is one of two remaining Americans thought to have been kidnapped by the Taliban during the US war in Afghanistan who is still unaccounted for. Amid the Afghan government's collapse, the fall of Kabul and chaotic scenes of thousands scrambling to flee the country being broadcast around the globe, his family said they were increasingly desperate for his return, and frustrated by the lack of progress from the government. ""We have been at war with the Taliban for 20 years. President Biden declared the war over on 31 August,"" Mrs Cakora told the BBC. ""When a war ends, each side get to have their prisoners come home. That is all we are asking for Mark."" The family had ""waited patiently"" through both the Trump and Biden administrations, she said. ""[We] were told that efforts were underway to get my brother home,"" she added. ""Well, they were not."" At least seven US civilians have been taken captive or gone missing during the war in Afghanistan. Of the total, one was reportedly killed, one escaped, and three were rescued or released. An eighth captive, Bowe Bergdahl, was a US soldier captured after deserting his post in 2009. He was released in 2014. Mr Frerichs, 59, had been living and working in Kabul as a civil engineer for 10 years when he was kidnapped. A ""journeyman contractor"" who went from project to project, motivated by a desire to help people in need, he had found ""a good fit for himself in Afghanistan,"" Mrs Cakora said. ""Three days before he was kidnapped, he told me that he had just finished a municipal water project. He was so proud of it."" The US Navy veteran was lured to a meeting to discuss a potential project and taken against his will to Khost Province, a former national security official told the BBC. Mr Frerichs and an Afghan colleague examine a project they worked on together In Khost, the official said, he was handed over to the Haqqani Network, one of the region's most powerful and feared militant groups. The network's leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is one of the Taliban's top deputy leaders. Advocates working to secure Mr Frerichs' release say that the ""only"" thing that the Taliban have mentioned when US officials have pressed for his return is the release of Bashir Noorzai, a Taliban-affiliated drug lord who has been imprisoned in the US for the last 16 years. Noorzai, who was arrested in 2005, was sentenced to life in prison in 2009 on charges that he imported over $50m (Â£36m) worth of heroin from Afghanistan and Pakistan into the US and other countries.  He fought alongside the now-deceased Taliban founder Mullah Mohammed Omar against Soviet occupation in the 1980s, and is believed to have supplied the group with financial backing, weapons, ammunition and as many as 400 fighters. Responding to BBC queries, a state department spokesperson said that the US Special Representative for Afghanistan has pressed the Taliban for Mr Frerichs' release and raised the issue with Taliban representatives in Qatar and Pakistan. ""We place a high priority on Marks Frerichs' safety and will not stop working until he is safely returned to his family,"" the spokesperson said. Spokespeople at the Taliban's representative office in Qatar did not respond to BBC requests for comment. Mrs Cakora said that while the family understands that an exchange of Noorzai for Mr Frerichs is a ""hard trade"" and that it would mean making concessions to kidnappers, they believe it is the only viable option. When asked what she would tell the White House about her case, Mrs Cakora directed a plea at President Biden. ""Please treat my brother like he was your son and act to bring him home quickly,"" she said. She also had a message for Taliban political leader Abdul Ghani Baradar. ""We know that this war is ending, and you want your prisoners back as much as we want my brother,"" she said. ""Please treat him well and work with US officials to arrange a prisoner swap that gets you Bashir Noorzai and returns Mark home safely to us. Let that be the one thing that both sides can see as a win."" Besides Mr Frerichs, only one other American suspected to have been abducted in Afghanistan, author Paul Overby Jr, remains unaccounted for. Mr Overby was last heard from in May 2014, when he vanished in Khost while traveling to interview Sirajuddin Haqqani. The Taliban have denied any involvement. With the situation in Afghanistan growing more dangerous by the day, Mrs Cakora expressed hope that her brother's release may provide a small positive outcome. ""President Biden has the power to make it happen,"" she said. ""The story on our exit from Afghanistan is horrible. Can't we get one glimmer of good news by having my brother come home?""

"Alexei Navalny collapsed on a flight in August 2020 The UK is imposing asset freezes and travel bans on seven Russian nationals linked to the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Mr Navalny - a staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin -almost died from a nerve agent attacklast year. He accused Mr Putin of ordering the attack, something the Kremlin denies. The UK Foreign Office said the sanctions, taken with the US, targeted those ""directly responsible for planning or carrying out the attack"". All seven of the individuals targeted are members of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), it added. Kremlin critic Navalny recalls near-death torment Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""We are sending a clear message that any use of chemical weapons by the Russian state violates international law, and a transparent criminal investigation must be held. ""We urge Russia to declare its full stock of Novichok nerve agents."" The term Novichok - ""newcomer"" in Russian - applies to a group of nerve agents developed in a lab by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. They paralyse muscles and can lead to death by asphyxiation. Mr Navalny, 45, was exposed to one such nerve agent on a flight from Tomsk, Siberia, to Moscow on 20 August 2020. By the time the plane landed, he could not speak and was taken directly to hospital. He was later transferred to a hospital in Berlin, Germany, where he spent a further 32 days recovering, including 24 days in intensive care. In January, he returned to Russia and was arrested on arrival. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny: what you need to know Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny has long been the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin. The 45-year-old blogger has millions of Russian followers on social media - many in their early 20s or younger - and managed to get some of his supporters elected to local councils in Siberia in 2020. So far he has been unable to challenge the president at the ballot box. Mr Navalny was immediately arrested as he flew back into Moscow on 17 January, after months spent recovering in Berlin from the near-fatal nerve agent attack. His supporters staged mass protests across Russia and police responded with force, detaining thousands for attending the unauthorised rallies. President Putin's foremost critic is now at a Russian penal colony, serving a jail term for failing to stick to the terms of a suspended sentence while he was in Berlin. But his voice of opposition has not gone away, even though his supporters fear for his life. The UK previously imposed sanctions on six Russians, including the director of the FSB, who the government holds responsible for the poisoning. Imprisoned Mr Navalny marked the anniversary of the poisoning attack against him by urging global leaders to put more attention on combating corruption and to target tycoons close to Mr Putin. The UK and US also issued a joint statement in which they reaffirmed their condemnation of the ""assassination attempt"" on Mr Navalny. Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life The statement added: ""We welcome sanctions actions made by international partners and will continue to co-ordinate with international partners on further measures. ""Today the UK and the US join in taking further action against the individuals directly responsible for carrying out the poisoning of Mr Navalny. ""As we did after Russia's use of a chemical weapon against the Skripals in the United Kingdom in March 2018, we continue to underline that there must be accountability and no impunity for those that use chemical weapons."" Also on Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that, in a meeting with Mr Putin, she had ""demanded"" he free his political opponent. Mr Putin denies Mr Navalny's imprisonment is politically motivated. Speaking at the Kremlin, Ms Merkel said: ""It's a depressing situation from our point of view. ""His conviction was on the basis of an earlier court decision that was considered disproportionate by the European Court of Human Rights, so his stay in a penitentiary is not acceptable and I have once again demanded Navalny's release.""

"There are fears Taliban opponents in Afghanistan could be tracked down via social media platforms Facebook has brought in new safety measures for users worried for their safety in Afghanistan, as the Taliban continue to cement their grip on power. The firm says it ""removed the ability to view and search the 'Friends' list for Facebook accounts in Afghanistan"" to protect people from being targeted. Professional networking site LinkedIn has also taken steps by hiding the connections of anyone in the country. There are concerns the Taliban are using social media to track opponents. The additional safety measures were announced on Thursday by Facebook's head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher. ""We've launched a one-click tool for people in Afghanistan to quickly lock down their account. When their profile is locked, people who aren't their friends can't download or share their profile photo or see posts on their timeline,""Mr Gleicher tweeted.,external He said that on Facebook-owned Instagram ""we're rolling out pop-up alerts in Afghanistan with specific steps on how to protect your account"". Mr Gleicher added that Facebook was ""working closely with our counterparts in industry, civil society and government to provide whatever support we can to help protect people"". Earlier,the tech giant confirmed it would continue to ban Taliban content from its platformsas it considers the group to be a terrorist organisation. Meanwhile, Twitter said in a statement this week that its ""top priority is keeping people safe, and we remain vigilant"". ""The situation in Afghanistan is rapidly evolving. We're also witnessing people in the country using Twitter to seek help and assistance."" Twitter has come under scrutiny for its handling of Taliban-related content. Taliban spokesmen used the platform to update their hundreds of thousands of followers, as the militant group retook control of Afghanistan. In response to BBC questions earlier this week about the Taliban's use of Twitter, a company spokesperson highlighted policies against violent organisations and hateful conduct. According to its rules, Twitter does not allow groups that promote terrorism or violence against civilians. In a statement emailed to the BBC, a LinkedIn company spokesperson said: ""Our team is closely monitoring conversations about developments in Afghanistan and taking action on any content that doesn't follow our professional community policies.

"As thousands of citizens and foreign nationals attempt to flee Afghanistan, scenes outside Kabul airport have become increasingly desperate. Since the Taliban took control of the country at the weekend and closed land border crossings, the capital's airport has become the only way out of the country for many. But the militants have said they don't want Afghans to leave the country. They have set up checkpoints on Airport Road - shown in yellow, below - the main route to Hamid Karzai International Airport, and have attacked people. The violence has left 12 people in the area, dead - killed by gunshots or in stampedes - since Sunday, an anonymous Taliban official told Reuters news agency, meaning the journey to the airport is an increasingly treacherous one. Inside the walls of the airport compound, more than 4,000 US troops are in temporary control. Outside, heavily-armed Taliban fighters now ring the perimeter, generating an atmosphere of fear. Taliban fighters have control of the exterior of the airport The militants are reportedly preventing Afghans - including some of those with visas - from getting to the tarmac. But even before people fleeing reach the edge of the airport, they are being attacked en route, witnesses say. A correspondent for the LA Times newspaper saw dozens of Taliban firing into the air, aiming weapons at crowds and using sticks and rope to lash civilians as they tried to make their escape.Graphic images,externalcaptured by Marcus Yam show at least one woman hurt and a young child left bloodied with what appears to be a head injury. A woman was injured on her way to the airport Photos published by SBS showed an Afghan interpreter, who appeared to have been attacked, being treated for a gunshot wound. Crowds have also been gathering along the airport's perimeter to the north of the city - seen in the map above - over the past few days, with reports of a stampede injuring 17 people on Wednesday. Many have been trying to climb over barbed wire fences and there are reports of shots being fired. People have been scaling the boundary wall of Hamid Karzai International Airport Among the crowds are families with children, many of whom have not had access to food and drink for days, reporters on the ground say. Footage shared on social media showed children being passed over a wall to foreign soldiers in the hope they might be able to escape. This video can not be played A child is handed over the wall at Kabul airport, as the chaos continues One girl in a pink jacket was hoisted aloft to a soldier on a ladder. A number of children have been seen being helped over walls at Kabul airport The chaotic conditions emerged as European governments rushed to bring home their citizens - as well as Afghan colleagues. Afghan families have been seeking sanctuary with foreign troops Although the Taliban have said Afghans should stay in the country they have also claimed they are facilitating a safe exit for both foreigners and locals. ""We are preventing any form of violent, verbal clash at the airport among Afghans, foreigners and Taliban members,"" an official said. The latest reports of Taliban violence and harassment come asa confidential UN document, seen by the BBC, says the militants are intensifying their hunt for people who worked for and collaborated with Nato and US forces. The crush of people heading for the airport can be seen in satellite images of the area, with thousands converging in vehicles as they desperately tried to escape.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control.

Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"".

A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"".

""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business.

Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare.

For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't.

As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control.

Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments.

Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province.

While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Alexei Navalny collapsed on a flight in August 2020 The UK is imposing asset freezes and travel bans on seven Russian nationals linked to the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Mr Navalny - a staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin -almost died from a nerve agent attacklast year. He accused Mr Putin of ordering the attack, something the Kremlin denies. The UK Foreign Office said the sanctions, taken with the US, targeted those ""directly responsible for planning or carrying out the attack"". All seven of the individuals targeted are members of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), it added. Kremlin critic Navalny recalls near-death torment Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""We are sending a clear message that any use of chemical weapons by the Russian state violates international law, and a transparent criminal investigation must be held. ""We urge Russia to declare its full stock of Novichok nerve agents."" The term Novichok - ""newcomer"" in Russian - applies to a group of nerve agents developed in a lab by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. They paralyse muscles and can lead to death by asphyxiation. Mr Navalny, 45, was exposed to one such nerve agent on a flight from Tomsk, Siberia, to Moscow on 20 August 2020. By the time the plane landed, he could not speak and was taken directly to hospital. He was later transferred to a hospital in Berlin, Germany, where he spent a further 32 days recovering, including 24 days in intensive care. In January, he returned to Russia and was arrested on arrival. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny: what you need to know Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny has long been the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin. The 45-year-old blogger has millions of Russian followers on social media - many in their early 20s or younger - and managed to get some of his supporters elected to local councils in Siberia in 2020. So far he has been unable to challenge the president at the ballot box. Mr Navalny was immediately arrested as he flew back into Moscow on 17 January, after months spent recovering in Berlin from the near-fatal nerve agent attack. His supporters staged mass protests across Russia and police responded with force, detaining thousands for attending the unauthorised rallies. President Putin's foremost critic is now at a Russian penal colony, serving a jail term for failing to stick to the terms of a suspended sentence while he was in Berlin. But his voice of opposition has not gone away, even though his supporters fear for his life. The UK previously imposed sanctions on six Russians, including the director of the FSB, who the government holds responsible for the poisoning. Imprisoned Mr Navalny marked the anniversary of the poisoning attack against him by urging global leaders to put more attention on combating corruption and to target tycoons close to Mr Putin. The UK and US also issued a joint statement in which they reaffirmed their condemnation of the ""assassination attempt"" on Mr Navalny. Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life The statement added: ""We welcome sanctions actions made by international partners and will continue to co-ordinate with international partners on further measures. ""Today the UK and the US join in taking further action against the individuals directly responsible for carrying out the poisoning of Mr Navalny. ""As we did after Russia's use of a chemical weapon against the Skripals in the United Kingdom in March 2018, we continue to underline that there must be accountability and no impunity for those that use chemical weapons."" Also on Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that, in a meeting with Mr Putin, she had ""demanded"" he free his political opponent. Mr Putin denies Mr Navalny's imprisonment is politically motivated. Speaking at the Kremlin, Ms Merkel said: ""It's a depressing situation from our point of view. ""His conviction was on the basis of an earlier court decision that was considered disproportionate by the European Court of Human Rights, so his stay in a penitentiary is not acceptable and I have once again demanded Navalny's release.""

"The Refugee Council says hotels are being used to accommodate people due to a shortage of suitable housing An urgent independent investigation must be carried out into the safety of accommodation provided to Afghan refugees, a group of MPs has said. The call for an inquiry comes after Mohammed Munib Majeedi, who had only recently arrived in the UK, fell to his death from a hotel window in Sheffield. The city's Labour MPs said the five-year-old's death was an ""unimaginable tragedy"" and ""lessons must be learnt"". The Home Office said it was committed to ensuring ""safe and secure"" housing. Mohammed is believed to have fallen from a ninth-floor room at the OYO Metropolitan Hotel in Blonk Street at about 14:30 BST on Wednesday. Louise Haigh, Labour MP for Sheffield Heeley, said: ""We know that the Home Office placed some refugees there last August and then moved them following concerns about the suitability of that accommodation. ""So why vulnerable families from Afghanistan, involving children, were placed in this accommodation again this year is a very serious question that they have to urgently answer."" The Home Office did not deny the claims when approached for comment, but said it was ""absolutely committed to ensuring that Afghan refugees are appropriately accommodated"". South Yorkshire Police is investigating the circumstances and said officers were providing support to the boy's family. Raab defends Afghan interpreter phone call decision Boy who died in in hotel fall was Afghan refugee More stories from Yorkshire Meanwhile, a woman was arrested on Friday morning over comments posted online following the death. The 42-year-old from Sheffield was being questioned on suspicion of malicious communications and racially-aggravated public order offences, police said. The boy's family is understood to have arrived in the UK in early August as part of the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP) scheme. Ten other Afghan families staying at the hotel have been moved to alternative accommodation. The five MPs - Paul Blomfield, Clive Betts, Olivia Blake, Gill Furniss and Ms Haigh - said in a joint statement: ""The death of Mohammed Munib Majeedi is an unimaginable tragedy. ""Our hearts go out to his family and friends; and supporting them at this terrible time must be everyone's priority."" South Yorkshire Police said it was not treating the boy's death as suspicious They said the Home Office had a duty of care for people resettled under its programmes and added: ""Lessons must be learnt from this tragedy so it is never repeated."" Any review must be independently conducted to ""establish what was known by the Home Office about the suitability and safety of this accommodation, and what procedures were followed before commissioning its use for vulnerable families"". ""The UK must be a safe haven for those fleeing the appalling horrors in Afghanistan, and we must see a clear commitment from the government to ensure this is the case,"" they added. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the speed of the situation in Afghanistan had meant the usual arrangements for refugees had not been possible. ""What normally would happen is a family would arrive and they would be taken by an agency like ours to a house that had been set up and organised by a local council,"" he said. Flowers and cards have been left at the hotel, including one message which reads: ""Sleep tight darling, this community are watching over your mum, dad and family"" Due to a shortage of suitable accommodation the Home Office had to use hotels, Mr Solomon said, and it was not clear if the necessary health checks had been done. ""We don't know the details and there needs to be a rapid investigation to find out whether anything was overlooked or steps weren't taken to ensure all the potential risks were minimised for the families put in that hotel."" Mr Solomon said the Refugee Council had published a report in April looking at the situation in hotels. ""We found some really disturbing stories, for example people with mobility problems being put on higher floors in hotels where there are no lifts, it has certainly been very challenging in hotels."" However, he said they had not found any specific examples of concerns related to safety issues. The government said all the families staying at the hotel had been moved, adding: ""The Home Office is committed to ensuring that accommodation is safe, secure and individuals are provided with meals and support."" A spokesman for the Afghan Community Association in Sheffield said: ""Whether it was a mistake or something, I don't know but what happened is not acceptable at all. ""It is very, very sad for the whole community - everybody has been devastated for this poor family who had just arrived from Afghanistan to have a life here.""

"Hundreds of newly qualified teachers may not be registered to teach in Northern Ireland before the start of the new school term. If a teacher wants to be employed in a school they have to be registered with the General Teaching Council (GTCNI). BBC News NI understands as many as 500 new teachers have not yet had their registrations fully processed by GTCNI. Education Minister Michelle McIlveen had ""instructed GTCNI to fix this as a matter of urgency"". The Department of Education called the situation ""deeply regrettable"". The GTCNI said it was facing challenges outside its control which created a backlog in processing applications. ""We are very conscious that there are some applicants awaiting confirmation of registration in order to take up employment at the start of the school year,"" it said. GTCNI also said it was working to address the problem. ""Invoices for payment of registration fees are being issued this week (to new qualified teachers who graduated from Northern Ireland higher education institutions) who will receive confirmation of registration once payment is made online,"" the GTCNI said. Teachers pay an annual fee of Â£44 to GTCNI to be registered to enable them to work in a school in Northern Ireland. Teachers need to be registered with the General Teaching Council before they can begin to work The GTCNI is an arm's-length body of the Department of Education. The problems with registration affect teachers who graduated in 2021 and are seeking work in Northern Ireland. Hannah Gordon is a Spanish and French teacher who graduated from Queen's University, Belfast, in July. She still does not know if she can seek work in a school as she has not yet been able to register as a teacher. ""I'm one of 16 who qualified in languages this year at Queen's and none of us so far have received any correspondence about the payment of the fee in order to get our teacher number,"" she told BBC News NI. ""For us that means, whether we have a job secured, or if we don't have a job secured but want to get onto the substitute teacher register, none of us can work as paid teachers yet. ""It's frustrating to say the least and I know that my fellow teachers feel the same way. ""All of us now, we want a fresh start, we want to get going with our careers but it's stopping us from doing that."" The NASUWT national official for Northern Ireland Justin McCamphill said that GTCNI and the Department of Education ""have serious questions to answer"" over the situation. He said he had written to the education minister in late June about the potential problems. ""The minister rejected a request for a meeting to discuss the issue and told me that her officials would keep me informed of progress on this matter and would confirm when it had been successfully resolved,"" he said. ""On Wednesday 18 August I hosted an event for about 40 newly qualified teachers. ""I was astounded to find out that none of the participants had received a registration number. ""Some should be working in school right now, while others are due to start jobs in the coming days. ""Many more need their registration number to gain employment as a substitute teacher. ""It is now incumbent on the minister to personally intervene. ""A guarantee needs to be made to these newly qualified teachers that either they will have their registration details on time or will be financially compensated for any loss."" Education Minister Michelle McIlveen said GTCNI needed to remedy the situation as a ""matter of urgency"" A spokesperson for the Department of Education said the delays were due to ""the recent upgrade of a major IT system within GTCNI"". They said that ""all of this year's cohort of newly qualified teachers"" was affected. ""This has led to delays for newly qualified teachers in receiving confirmation of their teacher registration,"" they said. ""We realise that this will be a source of concern for all of those who have worked so hard to qualify as teachers; and who will understandably be anxious to complete their registration and begin their careers within the profession. ""This situation is deeply regrettable and the minister has instructed GTCNI to fix this as a matter of urgency and to review the recent changes in their IT systems to ensure that no other unforeseen problems have been introduced.""

Those applying include Cornwall in England, Stirling in Scotland, Conwy County in Wales and a joint application from Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon in Northern Ireland. The 20 applicants are bidding to host a year of cultural festivities in 2025. The culture secretary said the number of applicants was ""testament to the huge success of City of Culture"". This is the first time groups of towns have been able to join together and apply for the title to be awarded to their local area - enabling bids from places such asGreat Yarmouth and East Suffolk in East AngliaandThe Borderlands, which straddles the border between England and Scotland. The 20 bidders will be reduced to an initial long list in the coming weeks and then cut down further to a final shortlist in early 2022. The winner will be announced by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in May 2022. Those long-listed will be awarded grants of Â£40,000 for the first time to support the next stage of their applications. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""This record number of applications from all four corners of the country is testament to the huge success of City of Culture in generating investment, creating jobs and boosting local pride. ""This prestigious prize creates a fantastic opportunity for towns and cities to build back better from the pandemic and I wish all bidders the very best of luck."" Entrants have been told to prove they can put culture at the heart of their plans to recover from the impact of the pandemic. Sir Phil Redmond, UK City of Culture chairperson, said the competition was an ""excuse for people to talk to each other, rather than at each other"". The successful area will take on the baton from Coventry,the 2021 UK City of Culture, which followed Hull in 2017 and Derry-Londonderry in 2013. Made in Hull opened the 2017 events in Queen Victoria Square Hull's tenure as City of Culture attracted a total audience of more than five million people for events, Â£220m of investment and 800 new jobs,according to a reportfrom the University of Hull.

"This video can not be played SNP and Greens seal power-sharing deal The SNP and Scottish Greens havepublished details,externalof their new power sharing arrangement. The deal will take the Greens into government for the first time anywhere in the UK. It includes a commitment to hold a referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years, and preferably by the end of 2023. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave details at a briefing alongside the two Scottish Greens co-leaders. Opposition parties have described the arrangement as a ""nationalist coalition of chaos"" that will be a ""disaster"" for Scotland. What could the SNP-Green deal mean for Scotland? The agreement will see two Green MSPs appointed as junior ministers in Ms Sturgeon's government. These ministers could be invited to attend cabinet meetings when their portfolios are being discussed, with the Green co-leaders attending cabinet at least twice a year. BBC Scotland's political editor, Glenn Campbell, said the arrangement will ""look like a coalition but fall short of a coalition"". The pro-independence Greens have signed up to the bulk of the government's policy - but there will also be areas where they are in disagreement with the SNP, and they will be able to criticise it on those points. These excluded areas include aviation policy, international relations, policy on fee-paying schools, fox hunting and Nato membership if Scotland becomes independent. Scottish Greens co-leaders Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie arrived at the first minister's Bute House residence on Friday The co-operation agreement says the two parties will work together to provide ""effective and responsible  leadership for Scotland for this session of the Scottish Parliament, in the interests of Scotland, of the people who live in Scotland, and of future generations"". It says they will secure a referendum on Scottish independence ""within the current parliamentary session on a specific date to be determined by the Scottish Parliament"". If the Covid crisis has passed, their intention would be for the referendum to be within the first half of the five-year parliamentary session. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is adamant that another referendum should not happen any time soon - with BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley saying that stance is unlikely to change.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"This video can not be played SNP and Greens seal power-sharing deal The SNP and Scottish Greens havepublished details,externalof their new power sharing arrangement. The deal will take the Greens into government for the first time anywhere in the UK. It includes a commitment to hold a referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years, and preferably by the end of 2023. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave details at a briefing alongside the two Scottish Greens co-leaders. Opposition parties have described the arrangement as a ""nationalist coalition of chaos"" that will be a ""disaster"" for Scotland. What could the SNP-Green deal mean for Scotland? The agreement will see two Green MSPs appointed as junior ministers in Ms Sturgeon's government. These ministers could be invited to attend cabinet meetings when their portfolios are being discussed, with the Green co-leaders attending cabinet at least twice a year. BBC Scotland's political editor, Glenn Campbell, said the arrangement will ""look like a coalition but fall short of a coalition"". The pro-independence Greens have signed up to the bulk of the government's policy - but there will also be areas where they are in disagreement with the SNP, and they will be able to criticise it on those points. These excluded areas include aviation policy, international relations, policy on fee-paying schools, fox hunting and Nato membership if Scotland becomes independent. Scottish Greens co-leaders Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie arrived at the first minister's Bute House residence on Friday The co-operation agreement says the two parties will work together to provide ""effective and responsible  leadership for Scotland for this session of the Scottish Parliament, in the interests of Scotland, of the people who live in Scotland, and of future generations"".

"Hundreds of newly qualified teachers may not be registered to teach in Northern Ireland before the start of the new school term. If a teacher wants to be employed in a school they have to be registered with the General Teaching Council (GTCNI). BBC News NI understands as many as 500 new teachers have not yet had their registrations fully processed by GTCNI. Education Minister Michelle McIlveen had ""instructed GTCNI to fix this as a matter of urgency"". The Department of Education called the situation ""deeply regrettable"". The GTCNI said it was facing challenges outside its control which created a backlog in processing applications. ""We are very conscious that there are some applicants awaiting confirmation of registration in order to take up employment at the start of the school year,"" it said. GTCNI also said it was working to address the problem. ""Invoices for payment of registration fees are being issued this week (to new qualified teachers who graduated from Northern Ireland higher education institutions) who will receive confirmation of registration once payment is made online,"" the GTCNI said. Teachers pay an annual fee of Â£44 to GTCNI to be registered to enable them to work in a school in Northern Ireland. Teachers need to be registered with the General Teaching Council before they can begin to work The GTCNI is an arm's-length body of the Department of Education. The problems with registration affect teachers who graduated in 2021 and are seeking work in Northern Ireland. Hannah Gordon is a Spanish and French teacher who graduated from Queen's University, Belfast, in July. She still does not know if she can seek work in a school as she has not yet been able to register as a teacher. ""I'm one of 16 who qualified in languages this year at Queen's and none of us so far have received any correspondence about the payment of the fee in order to get our teacher number,"" she told BBC News NI. ""For us that means, whether we have a job secured, or if we don't have a job secured but want to get onto the substitute teacher register, none of us can work as paid teachers yet. ""It's frustrating to say the least and I know that my fellow teachers feel the same way. ""All of us now, we want a fresh start, we want to get going with our careers but it's stopping us from doing that."" The NASUWT national official for Northern Ireland Justin McCamphill said that GTCNI and the Department of Education ""have serious questions to answer"" over the situation. He said he had written to the education minister in late June about the potential problems. ""The minister rejected a request for a meeting to discuss the issue and told me that her officials would keep me informed of progress on this matter and would confirm when it had been successfully resolved,"" he said. ""On Wednesday 18 August I hosted an event for about 40 newly qualified teachers. ""I was astounded to find out that none of the participants had received a registration number. ""Some should be working in school right now, while others are due to start jobs in the coming days. ""Many more need their registration number to gain employment as a substitute teacher. ""It is now incumbent on the minister to personally intervene. ""A guarantee needs to be made to these newly qualified teachers that either they will have their registration details on time or will be financially compensated for any loss."" Education Minister Michelle McIlveen said GTCNI needed to remedy the situation as a ""matter of urgency"" A spokesperson for the Department of Education said the delays were due to ""the recent upgrade of a major IT system within GTCNI"". They said that ""all of this year's cohort of newly qualified teachers"" was affected. ""This has led to delays for newly qualified teachers in receiving confirmation of their teacher registration,"" they said. ""We realise that this will be a source of concern for all of those who have worked so hard to qualify as teachers; and who will understandably be anxious to complete their registration and begin their careers within the profession. ""This situation is deeply regrettable and the minister has instructed GTCNI to fix this as a matter of urgency and to review the recent changes in their IT systems to ensure that no other unforeseen problems have been introduced.""

"This video can not be played Optometrists across the country say they are diagnosing higher numbers of children with short-sightedness (myopia) since the start of the pandemic. They put this down to less time spent outside due to Covid restrictions, more time spent on screens, and a drop-off in numbers of eye tests carried out during the pandemic. The College of Optometrists is calling for parents to get kids playing outside for two hours a day, this is proven to prevent or stop the development of myopia; and to take their children for eye tests.

"Emergency services were called to the OYO Sheffield Metropolitan Hotel on Wednesday afternoon A five-year-old Afghan refugee who fell to his death from a Sheffield hotel window has been identified by police. It is reported Mohammed Munib Majeedi fell from a ninth-floor room where he was staying with his mother. Emergency services were called to the OYO Metropolitan Hotel in Blonk Street, Sheffield, at about 14:30 BST on Wednesday. A fellow Afghan staying in the hotel said Mohammed's family arrived in the UK 15 days ago. It is understood they were relocated to the UK as part of the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP) scheme. The man, who worked as an interpreter for the British Army in Afghanistan, said one of his children alerted him to the boy falling and he went outside to help. More stories from Yorkshire He was later asked to accompany Mohammed's mother to hospital to translate. He said everyone in the hotel had been left shocked by the incident. ""They are so upset, they are so unhappy,"" he said. ""Everybody, if you want to talk to them, they have no time because they are so bad, in a bad condition."" South Yorkshire Police said it was not treating the death as suspicious Another Afghan resident said he was in his room when he heard the boy fall. ""His mother was in the room with him,"" he said. ""She was screaming, 'my son, my son'. When I came here [outside] I saw the ambulance and police here."" He added: ""They came here to save their lives, they came for a new life here, but unfortunately..."" The man said the eight to 10 Afghan families staying at the hotel were being moved to another hotel on Thursday afternoon. This is a tragic case. A five-year-old boy, only just been evacuated from Afghanistan with his four siblings and parents, has died after falling from a hotel window. We understand Mohammed's father worked for the British Embassy in Afghanistan and had travelled to the UK under the government's scheme to resettle interpreters and support staff whose lives may be at risk from the Taliban. Once in the UK however, the Home Office is struggling to find accommodation for refugees - many of whom are large families. It's understood the Home Office was directly managing the now empty hotel at the time of the incident. There had been concerns raised about the safety of the windows. I'm told some people had been moved out, but the Home Office denies this. The housing group Mears was looking after the hotel until a few months ago, but safety concerns saw it withdraw to another nearby hotel. What has happened here, therefore, raises some serious questions about what steps were taken to ensure the hotel was safe for vulnerable families and young children and about the state of accommodation being provided to asylum seekers. The Home Office said: ""We are extremely saddened by the tragic death of a child at a hotel in Sheffield. ""The police are providing support to the family while the investigation continues and we cannot comment further at this time."" South Yorkshire Police said: ""We can confirm that the five-year-old boy who sadly lost his life is from Afghanistan."" It said Mohammed's death was not being treated as suspicious and his family was being supported by officers. The force has appealed for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""This a terrible tragedy and our thoughts are with the family who have gone through so much trauma and suffering to reach the UK. ""It is vital the Home Office carry out an urgent investigation into what has happened so steps can be taken to quickly learn lessons. ""We don't know the details of the incident but it is imperative that families who come from Afghanistan are given all the support they need and housed in appropriate accommodation. They are vulnerable and often very traumatised."" Sheffield City Council leader Terry Fox said: ""This is absolutely devastating, just so incredibly sad.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Supermarket group Morrisons has accepted an improved Â£7bn takeover bid from US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R). Morrisons had previously recommended investors accept a Â£6.7bn offer from a consortium led by another US-based investment group, Fortress. Fortress said it was ""considering its options"", amid signs shareholders think the battle is not over. Morrisons shares opened up on Friday, a signal investors expect another bid. The retailer, which has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff, has been at the centre of a takeover battle for weeks. Fortress has urged Morrisons' shareholders to ""take no action"" on CD&R's agreed bid, which will require their approval at a meeting in October. In July Morrisons turned down an offer worth Â£5.5bn from CD&R, saying it significantly undervalued the business. Morrisons bid rival to make property sale pledge Morrisons to give workers Boxing Day off But the grocer's board unanimously accepted the new offer, which represents a 60% premium to Morrisons' share price before takeover interest emerged in mid June. Morrison shares rose 4.4% following the announcement to 291.4p per share. Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that although the new offer has the backing of Morrisions' management, ""this might not be the end of the story"". He said: Rival bidder Fortress has urged investors to hold fire on accepting the deal and are expected to make a further statement in due course. With the shares currently trading above the new and improved offer price, the market clearly thinks a better offer is a distinct possibility."" Morrisons was founded in Bradford in 1899 - where it still has its headquarters. The founder William Morrison's son, the late Sir Ken Morrison, ran the business for fifty years. CD&R said it recognises the ""legacy of Sir Ken Morrison, Morrisons' history and culture, and considers that this strong heritage is core to Morrisons and its approach to grocery retailing"". The private equity firm said it would help Morrisons to build on its strengths, including its close relationships with suppliers and property portfolio. Morrisons chairman Andrew Higginson said the offer ""represents good value for shareholders while at the same time protecting the fundamental character of Morrisons for all stakeholders"". Over the last 10 years, CD&R has been advised by Sir Terry Leahy, who was the boss of Tesco at the time when Mr Higginson worked for him as chief financial officer. Morrisons' chief operating officer, Trevor Strain, also previously worked with Sir Terry at Tesco. Sir Terry also advised CD&R on its acquisition of discount retailer B&M, which netted the private equity firm an estimated profit of Â£1bn when it sold it on. The future of the UK's fourth largest supermarket has taken a new twist. Morrisons is one of a slew of UK companies that have been targeted by overseas investors. Defence contractors Meggit and Ultra are also the subject of bidding wars. The numbers are startling. Even before you count Morrisons, Meggit and Ultra - foreign, private buyers have spent more buying UK listed companies in the last eight months than they have in the last five years combined. UK companies look cheap to foreign buyers. The UK economy was one of the hardest hit by the pandemic - and the value of the pound has never quite recovered its pre-Brexit value which reduces the price of UK businesses for non-UK investors. Some say that these bids highlight the value of - and confidence in - UK plc. But others are concerned that private buyouts increase debt levels, reduce transparency and mean that key decisions about the future of UK companies like Morrisons could be taken in New York rather than Bradford. The UK government has already asked the Competition and Markets Authority to review the bid for submarine technology specialist Ultra on grounds of National Security andit may yet intervene in the takeover bid for aerospace specialist Meggitt. There is also legislation planned to expand its powers to intervene and increase the scrutiny of privately held companies but for now there is a rush to the checkout for important chunks of UK PLC.

Those applying include Cornwall in England, Stirling in Scotland, Conwy County in Wales and a joint application from Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon in Northern Ireland. The 20 applicants are bidding to host a year of cultural festivities in 2025. The culture secretary said the number of applicants was ""testament to the huge success of City of Culture"". This is the first time groups of towns have been able to join together and apply for the title to be awarded to their local area - enabling bids from places such asGreat Yarmouth and East Suffolk in East AngliaandThe Borderlands, which straddles the border between England and Scotland. The 20 bidders will be reduced to an initial long list in the coming weeks and then cut down further to a final shortlist in early 2022. The winner will be announced by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in May 2022. Those long-listed will be awarded grants of Â£40,000 for the first time to support the next stage of their applications. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""This record number of applications from all four corners of the country is testament to the huge success of City of Culture in generating investment, creating jobs and boosting local pride. ""This prestigious prize creates a fantastic opportunity for towns and cities to build back better from the pandemic and I wish all bidders the very best of luck."" Entrants have been told to prove they can put culture at the heart of their plans to recover from the impact of the pandemic. Sir Phil Redmond, UK City of Culture chairperson, said the competition was an ""excuse for people to talk to each other, rather than at each other"". The successful area will take on the baton from Coventry,the 2021 UK City of Culture, which followed Hull in 2017 and Derry-Londonderry in 2013. Made in Hull opened the 2017 events in Queen Victoria Square Hull's tenure as City of Culture attracted a total audience of more than five million people for events, Â£220m of investment and 800 new jobs,according to a reportfrom the University of Hull.

"Government borrowing fell in July compared with a year earlier as the removal of most Covid restrictions in England gave the economy a boost. Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was Â£10.4bn,official figures show,external, which was Â£10.1bn lower than July last year. However, the figure was the second-highest for July since records began. Borrowing has been hitting record levels, with billions being spent on measures such as furlough payments. The huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed government debt up to more than Â£2.2 trillion, or about 98.8% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s. Where does the government borrow billions from? The Office for National Statistics (ONS) now estimates that the government borrowed a total of Â£298bn in the financial year to March. That amounted to 14.2% of GDP, the highest level since the end of World War Two. The ONS said the cost of measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic meant that day-to-day spending by the government rose by Â£204.3bn to Â£942.7bn last year. Interest payments on central government debt were Â£3.4bn in July. That was Â£1.1bn more than in July 2020, but far lower than the monthly record of Â£8.7bn in June 2021. ""Our recovery from the pandemic is well under way, boosted by the huge amount of support government has provided,"" said Chancellor Rishi Sunak. ""But the last 18 months have had a huge impact on our economy and public finances, and many risks remain. ""We're committed to keeping the public finances on a sustainable footing, which is why at the Budget in March I set out the steps we are taking to keep debt under control in the years to come."" Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, pointed out that July's borrowing figure was ""once again comfortably lower"" than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. ""Total tax receipts of Â£70bn in July were above June's Â£62.1bn and last July's total of Â£60.6bn, another encouraging sign that the economic recovery is feeding through to the public coffers. And government spending dropped from Â£77.2bn in June to just Â£73.1bn in July,"" she added. How does the government borrow money?

"A campaigner outside Bute House as the agreement was announced The SNP and the Scottish Greens have revealeddetails of the co-operation agreementwhich will see the parties work together at Holyrood. What could the deal mean for Scotland over the next five years? The most obvious reason for the SNP to bring the Greens into government is to present a united front against the climate emergency, in the year Glasgow hosts the COP26 conference. However, as a flagship issue for the Greens - the clue is in the name - this is a topic the parties have clashed on frequently. The Greens did not vote in favour of the Scottish government'sclimate billin the last term of parliament, saying the targets it set - for a 75% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 - were not ambitious enough. However, their 2021 election campaign was more about hitting these goals than stretching them, with the 80% figure they pledged in the 2019 general election absent and co-leader Patrick Harvie saying the most important thing is now to deliver on the promises made. On that front, the Greens want to see ""a fundamental transformation of our economy and society"", saying that ""every industry, every part of our economy and every individual will need to rise to the challenge"". So not only would there be more pressure on ministers to hit their emissions targets - havingfallen short of many of them so far- there would be calls for change across more or less every portfolio area. Specific policies championed by the Greens include phasing out single-use and non-essential plastics by 2025; the introduction of more Low Emission Zones in cities; and banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2026 and boilers which run on fossil fuels by 2028. Striking a deal would give the SNP and Greens a comfortable majority in the Holyrood chamber The other key motivation for the SNP in doing a deal is security - essentially making the coming parliamentary term an easier ride. Nicola Sturgeon herselffaced a confidence votein the final days of the last session, although her position was never truly in danger. But her deputy John Swinney was in real trouble on several occasions, with the Greens joining other opposition parties in calling for his head if he didn't back down in rows over school exams and the publication of government legal advice. With the Greens signed up to a formal deal, the prospect of any minister being forced out by opposition pressure recedes. Not only that, the SNP no longer need to worry about getting their budgets through parliament - or at least, they only have to worry about doing a deal with their Green partners. This would make Kate Forbes' job as finance secretary slightly easier each February, in that she wouldn't need to sit down with rivals like Murdo Fraser and Jackie Baillie, or have to make concessions to the Lib Dems. However, the Greens may still be looking for a decent return in exchange for passing up the annual opportunity to put the government over a barrel. The SNP and the Greens have both called for major investment in infrastructure - particularly in green energy and renewables It is unclear as yet how the monumental relief programmes of the pandemic era will be paid for, and what that means for future budgets. The decisions on how to recover from the economic crisis which accompanied the health one were already going to be tricky, before they involved two parties with subtly different ideologies. Take for example the principle of economic growth. The SNP manifesto - while stressing that growth should be sustainable - talks about increasing Scottish GDP by more than Â£4bn. The Greens meanwhile are suspicious of the whole concept of ""endless economic growth"", with their election platform decrying ""the deep shortcomings of conventional economics"". So what might actually happen, in practice? The manifestos of each party pledged massive investment in infrastructure in an attempt to build a more sustainable economy post-pandemic, so this is something they will likely be able to work together on - so long as it doesn't involve big road-building projects. Both parties have talked about moving to a four-day working week and back some form of universal basic income, so their pact might move these ambitious policies up the priority list. The two are also largely aligned on income tax, with the SNP targeting ""stability"" across the next five years and the Greens agreeing that ""now is not the time for increases"" for most. Both have promised a Citizens Assembly on taxation to study wider reforms, so that should be another easy box to tick. The Greens want to scrap the council tax, something the SNP have pledged to do on various occasions - but never quite delivered. Could a deal here finally push reforms to local government funding over the line? And the Greens also want to push for more fiscal powers to be devolved from Westminster so that they can set up things like an annual wealth tax on anyone worth more than Â£1m (including property, pensions and other assets) and a tax on carbon emissions from corporations. Green MSPs will be free to disagree with the SNP over the future of the oil industry - but will they also try to win them round? One sector we are likely to hear a lot about is the oil and gas industry. There will doubtless be a clause in any SNP-Green deal allowing the parties to disagree amicably on things like how quickly to move on from fossil fuels, but it doesn't mean there wouldn't be friction behind the scenes - and indeed some lobbying. Take for example the issue of new licences for drilling in the waters around Scotland, like theproposed new Cambo oil field. The Greens have already said they are putting ""maximum pressure"" on the Scottish government to oppose such plans. The SNP insists this is solely a matter for the UK government, with offshore oil and gas contracts being in Westminster's remit. But of course that hasn't stopped them taking a view on various other reserved matters, from Trident to Universal Credit and indeed the Acts of Union. Ministers have thus far refused to come off the fence about Cambo, perhaps anxious about alienating oil industry workers - but might having Green voices closer to the heart of government tip the scales somewhat? Co-leader Lorna Slater recently attended a protest against the development. Would she really never bring it up if she happened to be in the next office over from the energy minister? Green MSPs have joined trans rights campaigners in rallying ouside Holyrood The issue of trans rights and reform to the Gender Recognition Act has been a sticky one for the SNP, and society more generally. The government wants to change the law to make it easier for people to change their legally recognised gender, and reduce the ""trauma"" associated with the process. However, it has run into a row over whether allowing people to self-identify their gender could undermine the legal protections given to women under the Equality Act. Prominent SNP figures have voiced concerns about the plans, and even post-election - with a new group of MSPs lined up behind the leadership and more critical voices like Joan McAlpine no longer in parliament - there could have been a backbench rebellion over elements of the legislation. The Greens, though, are all-in on the policy - to the extent that theysplit with former MSP Andy Wightman over it. Seven extra votes would make it much easier for the SNP to fulfil their manifesto pledge to make changes ""at the earliest opportunity"". Theagreement between the parties,externalpromises that a bill to reform the Gender Recognition Act will be introduced in the first year of the parliamentary session. This may be one of the most talked about elements of the deal, but may actually be the part where an accord is needed the least. During the election campaign, the Greens pledged that every one of their MSPs would back a new independence referendum - much like those of the SNP. The two manifestos were closely aligned in a bid to cement the mandate of any pro-independence majority - so the votes for indyref2 are essentially in the bag regardless. The real question is whether a formalising of the pro-independence bloc at Holyrood could have any impact in swaying the UK government when it comes to backing a new referendum. There remains little sign that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has had a change of heart, but the SNP and Greens may hope that in the longer term a formal arrangement might help make the case seem all the more undeniable.

"This video can not be played SNP and Greens seal power-sharing deal The SNP and Scottish Greens havepublished details,externalof their new power sharing arrangement. The deal will take the Greens into government for the first time anywhere in the UK. It includes a commitment to hold a referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years, and preferably by the end of 2023. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave details at a briefing alongside the two Scottish Greens co-leaders. Opposition parties have described the arrangement as a ""nationalist coalition of chaos"" that will be a ""disaster"" for Scotland. What could the SNP-Green deal mean for Scotland? The agreement will see two Green MSPs appointed as junior ministers in Ms Sturgeon's government. These ministers could be invited to attend cabinet meetings when their portfolios are being discussed, with the Green co-leaders attending cabinet at least twice a year. BBC Scotland's political editor, Glenn Campbell, said the arrangement will ""look like a coalition but fall short of a coalition"". The pro-independence Greens have signed up to the bulk of the government's policy - but there will also be areas where they are in disagreement with the SNP, and they will be able to criticise it on those points. These excluded areas include aviation policy, international relations, policy on fee-paying schools, fox hunting and Nato membership if Scotland becomes independent. Scottish Greens co-leaders Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie arrived at the first minister's Bute House residence on Friday The co-operation agreement says the two parties will work together to provide ""effective and responsible  leadership for Scotland for this session of the Scottish Parliament, in the interests of Scotland, of the people who live in Scotland, and of future generations"". It says they will secure a referendum on Scottish independence ""within the current parliamentary session on a specific date to be determined by the Scottish Parliament"". If the Covid crisis has passed, their intention would be for the referendum to be within the first half of the five-year parliamentary session. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is adamant that another referendum should not happen any time soon - with BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley saying that stance is unlikely to change. The partnership agreement also includes commitments to: Increase investment in active travel and public transport, with the aim of providing a ""realistic and affordable"" alternative to car use More support for the marine renewables and offshore wind sectors A 10-year Â£500m Just Transition Fund for the north east and Moray Increasing the level of the Scottish Child Payment to the full Â£20 within this parliamentary term Investing at least Â£1.8bn over this parliamentary session in energy efficiency and renewable heating Enhancing tenants rights and delivering 110,000 affordable homes by 2032 It is a new form of government at Holyrood and a first in the UK, and is based on the arrangements the New Zealand Greens have with Jacinda Ardern's government. The Greens are the fourth largest party in the Scottish Parliament after winning eight seats in the election in May, while the SNP won 64 seats - leaving them one short of an overall majority. The SNP had formed a minority government for the previous five years, and had relied on the support of the Greens to pass its annual budget. This video can not be played Scottish Conservative leader: SNP-Green deal 'all about independence vote' Ms Sturgeon said the agreement was about ""doing politics and governance better to find the solutions needed to solve the problems confronting the world today"". She added: ""The spirit of co-operation and consensus-building is very much in keeping with the founding principles of our Scottish Parliament. ""We do not agree on everything but we are coming out of our comfort zones to focus on what we do agree on."" Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the ""historic"" arrangement could not have come at a more important time. He said: ""We must build a fairer and compassionate country and we must do everything in our power to tackle the escalating climate and nature emergencies to deliver a just transition for all. That is what this deal will do"". Jacinda Ardern signed a co-operation agreement with the Green Party in November 2020 The deal has been struck with less than three months to go until the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. The Greens have been pressing the Scottish government to go further in tackling global warming in exchange for their support, and wants it to oppose any new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea. But the agreement does not do this, and instead offers support for a ""pre-production oil and gas licence climate checkpoint review"". The UK government isexpected to announce soonwhether extraction of oil and gas at the Cambo site near Shetland will be given approval. The GMB union said workers across the energy sector were ""looking on with real concern"" and would be seeking assurances that the SNP-Green deal will not be a ""one-way ticket to the dole queue"". The Greens are also opposed to the government's road building programme, and some businesses including fish farming have warned that Green policies could damage the economy if they are adopted by the government. This new power-sharing partnership will take Greens into government for the first time anywhere in the UK. That may have particular resonance in the months before the UN climate summit - COP26 - is held in Glasgow. For Greens, it is about maximising policy influence, especially when it comes to tackling global warming. For the SNP, it is about creating a more stable administration, able to see off opposition ambush. Whatever else is agreed, this tie-up will give the Scottish government a majority at Holyrood to pass budgets, win confidence votes and make legislation - including for another independence referendum. It looks a lot like a coalition but crucially the Greens have opt-outs from policies they don't like - retaining the ability to criticise the government of which they would become part The Scottish Conservatives described the tie up between the two parties as a ""nationalist coalition of chaos focused on splitting up the country and dividing Scotland with another bitter referendum"". Leader Douglas Ross said the agreement was ""anti-jobs and anti-business"" and would punish hardworking families, motorists, and the oil and gas industry. The Conservatives have formally requested that the Greens no longer receive an opposition leader's spot at First Minister's Questions, which the party says would be in line with the precedent set by the Labour-Liberal Democrat government at Holyrood between 1999 and 2007. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar challenged the Greens to show they are not simply the SNP's ""lackeys"", and said the party needed to ""rediscover their principles and fight for a greener Scotland rather than roll over to the SNP every time the going gets tough."" He added: ""Months have been wasted negotiating this rubber-stamp for SNP policy - meanwhile, A&E is in crisis, we are facing a growing cancer emergency, and we are still waiting for the NHS Recovery Plan. ""Scotland needs a real alternative, which puts recovery before the old constitutional arguments."" Meanwhile Alex Cole-Hamilton, thenew leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""I think it looks like pretty thin gruel for the Green party, they'll soon realise that they will have to carry the can for all of the SNP's inadequacies on public policy."" The deal was approved by the Scottish cabinet on Friday morning, but still requires the approval of the decision-making bodies of both parties before it can take effect. The SNP's national executive committee is due to meet on Saturday and the Greens have scheduled a meeting of their membership for Saturday 28 August. Both sides want the deal to take effect before Holyrood returns with a statement on the programme for government on Tuesday 31 August. Their deal follows two months of negotiations led by the Deputy First Minister John Swinney for the government and MSPs Ross Greer and Maggie Chapman for the Greens.

"As thousands of citizens and foreign nationals attempt to flee Afghanistan, scenes outside Kabul airport have become increasingly desperate. Since the Taliban took control of the country at the weekend and closed land border crossings, the capital's airport has become the only way out of the country for many. But the militants have said they don't want Afghans to leave the country. They have set up checkpoints on Airport Road - shown in yellow, below - the main route to Hamid Karzai International Airport, and have attacked people. The violence has left 12 people in the area, dead - killed by gunshots or in stampedes - since Sunday, an anonymous Taliban official told Reuters news agency, meaning the journey to the airport is an increasingly treacherous one. Inside the walls of the airport compound, more than 4,000 US troops are in temporary control. Outside, heavily-armed Taliban fighters now ring the perimeter, generating an atmosphere of fear. Taliban fighters have control of the exterior of the airport The militants are reportedly preventing Afghans - including some of those with visas - from getting to the tarmac. But even before people fleeing reach the edge of the airport, they are being attacked en route, witnesses say. A correspondent for the LA Times newspaper saw dozens of Taliban firing into the air, aiming weapons at crowds and using sticks and rope to lash civilians as they tried to make their escape.Graphic images,externalcaptured by Marcus Yam show at least one woman hurt and a young child left bloodied with what appears to be a head injury. A woman was injured on her way to the airport Photos published by SBS showed an Afghan interpreter, who appeared to have been attacked, being treated for a gunshot wound. Crowds have also been gathering along the airport's perimeter to the north of the city - seen in the map above - over the past few days, with reports of a stampede injuring 17 people on Wednesday. Many have been trying to climb over barbed wire fences and there are reports of shots being fired. People have been scaling the boundary wall of Hamid Karzai International Airport Among the crowds are families with children, many of whom have not had access to food and drink for days, reporters on the ground say. Footage shared on social media showed children being passed over a wall to foreign soldiers in the hope they might be able to escape. This video can not be played A child is handed over the wall at Kabul airport, as the chaos continues One girl in a pink jacket was hoisted aloft to a soldier on a ladder. A number of children have been seen being helped over walls at Kabul airport The chaotic conditions emerged as European governments rushed to bring home their citizens - as well as Afghan colleagues. Afghan families have been seeking sanctuary with foreign troops Although the Taliban have said Afghans should stay in the country they have also claimed they are facilitating a safe exit for both foreigners and locals. ""We are preventing any form of violent, verbal clash at the airport among Afghans, foreigners and Taliban members,"" an official said. The latest reports of Taliban violence and harassment come asa confidential UN document, seen by the BBC, says the militants are intensifying their hunt for people who worked for and collaborated with Nato and US forces. The crush of people heading for the airport can be seen in satellite images of the area, with thousands converging in vehicles as they desperately tried to escape.
