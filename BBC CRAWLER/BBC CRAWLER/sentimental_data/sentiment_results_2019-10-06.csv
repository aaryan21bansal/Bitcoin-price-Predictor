Eddie Hitchens moves himself centre-stage as the men arc around him for their introduction to bootcamp. “Hi, I’m Eddie. I’m a heterosexual sex addict… I’ve been doing Game since 2005, been coaching since 2011.”   “Game” is a multi-million pound business where men teach other men how to pick up women. There's nothing new about men trying to pick up women. But in this digital age seduction coaches are selling courses online on how to bed as many women as possible, as quickly as possible. They are part of a growing global industry linked through a network of internet video channels with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. In these videos and bootcamps, only the men are taught the rules. The women aren’t even aware they are part of a game. A game that can lead to persistent harassment on the street and dangerously blur the lines of consent. Hitchens signals to the rest of the group to introduce themselves, including me: an undercover journalist posing as a new recruit. It’s an international mix. There’s a chef from Amsterdam, a former US navy officer, a software engineer from Brazil, a computer programmer  from Dublin, and a doctor from Manchester. Then it’s my turn. “Hi. I am Michael Gibson,” I say, while fighting the psychological battle to remember my undercover name, “I am a ‘day game’ beginner who has recently broken up with my girlfriend of six years.” And, just like that, I’m deep into the weirdest experience of my life: a journey into the so-called seduction industry.   “Game” is a multi-million pound business where men teach other men how to pick up women.

This man is now in prison waiting to be sentenced for threatening and abusive behaviour towards young women. His name is Adnan Ahmed. Update: Adnan Ahmed’s conviction wasquashed on appeal after three judges ruled the verdict was a miscarriage of justice. But just a year ago, he was styling himself as a “pick-up artist” called Addy A-Game. Ahmed hung around Glasgow city centre with his fellow “wing men”, secretly filming his interactions with unsuspecting women on the street. One of his university classmates tipped me off that Ahmed had uploaded over 250 videos, including some of those he secretly filmed, on to his YouTube channel, boasting of his sexual conquests. Behind a list of controversial and provocative titles - such as “closing girls with boyfriends” and “fat girls should blame themselves” - lay long misogynistic monologues, with Ahmed giving out advice for anyone who wanted to watch. “The reason you’re doing it is to get laid,” he said in one video. “Only the brave get laid.”   This was much more than just one man’s misogyny. This was professional, complete with a sales pitch, lifestyle coaching, and what seemed a bewildering array of jargon: “infield footage”, “LMR”, “number close”, “sarging”. This is the language of what “pick-up artists” like Ahmed call “Game”. In one video, Ahmed boasted of what he called a “same night lay”. Later in the clip, he filmed a woman sleeping with an unused condom next to her. Ahmed was even posting audio recordings online of him having sex. It didn’t appear that the women knew they were being recorded. Their consent for these recordings did not seem to be much of a concern. “She’s like why are you putting a condom on?” he told viewers of one video. “Plausible deniability. They want you to take the lead. Remember this is not rape... Listen to her actions, her body… not her words.”   I tracked down two women who had been approached by Ahmed. Both said that their encounters with him had stuck with them. Beth (pictured) was walking home alone through the main shopping street in Glasgow city centre after finishing her shift. It was a dark November night and Ahmed stepped into her path. She was 17 at the time. Ahmed was 37. ""He was like, ‘oh are you Russian?’ Beth recalled. “He was mentioning when he was in Ukraine or something and he had hired prostitutes. He was saying that I’d be like ‘better than prostitutes’. [He had] just a horrible manner.” He said his name was “Addy”. He kept on asking for her phone number. He kept trying to touch her. “I’d said no countless times,” Beth said. “I gave excuses and he was like: ‘Oh it’s fine, like, just give me your number, whatever’.” Beth was shaken and thought that he would leave her alone if she agreed to give him her number. “He knew I was going to the bus stop, and he knew I’d be alone for around an hour waiting for my bus. ""So I stayed on the phone to my mum for around 30 minutes beforehand talking her through the situation, and her just trying to give me peace of mind."" Beth knew this was not just a chat-up. It felt wrong. “It’s not harmless,” she said. “I spent like the whole night kind of terrified.”   I tracked down two women who had been approached by Ahmed.

It felt wrong. “It’s not harmless,” she said. “I spent like the whole night kind of terrified.”   A friend of Ahmed secretly filmed him as he approached 20-year-old Emily, a Glasgow-based student. Ahmed then uploaded the video to his YouTube channel. Emily (pictured) only found out their  conversation was available online when I told her. Her experience is something I’ve heard from many women who have experienced street harassment. “The ridiculous thing is, in that entire conversation I’m sitting there trying to figure out a way to let him down gently,” she explained. “We don’t want to be called ‘a bitch’ for rejecting someone. We don’t want to be called ‘rude’ for just closing the interaction down.” In the video, which has since been deleted, Ahmed boasted that if he had met Emily on holiday, he would definitely have had sex with her. Or, as he put it, it would have been a “same day lay”. “That infuriates me… for him to so painfully mis-read that is frustrating,” Emily said. “Men assuming that women want to have sex with them is part of a considerably larger problem in our society. He probably didn’t think much by it, just saying this person’s a ‘same day lay’. That interaction was completely misreading my signals.”  Emily and Beth were not alone.  I made a video for BBC Scotland’s digital platform The Social on what I’d found out about Ahmed. It went viral with about two million plays online in the first few days. There was a demonstration on the streets of Glasgow led by a group of concerned women. At the Scottish Parliament,  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she had been “shocked and appalled” by what she had seen in my report. And women kept coming forward. “This man stalked me for months waiting outside my work”... “This guy asked if he could ‘walk me home’... then got so aggressive with me”, “I told him my age and he kept talking to me. He was such a freak”. Nearly all the stories were about uncomfortable encounters. Many seemed to cross the line from persistence to harassment. Some - it later turned out - were criminal. More than a dozen women gave details to the police following the publication of my report. Within two days of the video being published, Ahmed had been arrested and charged with a string of incidents of threatening and abusive behaviour.

Within two days of the video being published, Ahmed had been arrested and charged with a string of incidents of threatening and abusive behaviour.    When I first began investigating Ahmed, I did not know that he was part of a wider seduction industry. I’ve since discovered that he is just one of dozens of pick-up artists online. They share seduction techniques and cross-promote each other’s YouTube channels. When it came to promising quick results, one group stood out from the crowd: Street Attraction. This company offered what they describe as bootcamps that would have men “attracting beautiful women within two days”. Students were promised online tutorials, follow-up guidance and one-to-one lessons on how to master their masculinity. Street Attraction had more than 110,000 YouTube subscribers. Its founder Eddie Hitchens even charged for viewing one of his secretly recorded sexual exploits. “Recording such intimate stuff in general isn’t easy,” Hitchens explained in one video. “If a girl knows that she is being filmed she obviously won’t act in a natural way and most certainly won’t allow herself to be seduced for fear of her reputation being ruined. ""Because we [Hitchens and his accomplice] wanted to capture real reactions it had to be filmed covertly. Guerilla-style.” What’s more, Street Attraction had trained Adnan “A-Game” Ahmed. The bootcamp he attended was filmed and uploaded on his YouTube channel. That is why I ended up outside the Savoy hotel in central London at a training course for aspiring pick-up artists. It was a sweltering day and I was wearing a thick quilted-coat to hide a camera and microphone. There were six students at the bootcamp and my coach was Street Attraction’s founder Hitchens. The first task was to approach a woman within 30 seconds. I, like the rest of the students, dispersed across London Bridge which was awash with uniformed police and colourful protesters taking part in an Extinction Rebellion event. Eventually, I bumped into a couple of women who were standing watching one of the spray-painted bandstands where musicians were doing a sound check. I had no idea what to say. It was the first test of the day and I was already struggling. I asked a couple of women whether this was some sort of gig. “No,” one smiled, “this is a protest.” My question was so naive that it actually worked. I was chatting away and eventually the other woman offered me a flyer. The conversation ended politely. I said my goodbyes and returned to the pack.

I was chatting away and eventually the other woman offered me a flyer. The conversation ended politely. I said my goodbyes and returned to the pack.  This is what pick-up coaches call a “cold approach”. I was told it does not matter if I fancied the woman or not. Hitchens pointed out a “target” and we were sent to approach by blocking their path.   The bootcamp students were now mic'd up so that Hitchens could listen in and critique our performance. Not that the women knew that. The irony was not lost on me. I was using covert filming to expose a group who were secretly recording women. I had to ingratiate myself without implicating myself to maintain my cover. And the approaches made me feel uncomfortable. All the time, I kept on thinking about my sister and cousins and what they would think if they were on the receiving end of the students’ advances.  Dr Rachel O’Neill, an academic at the London School of Economics, has studied the seduction industry for 10 years. “There’s an idea that seduction essentially provides a blueprint that men can follow as a way of interacting with women,” Dr O’Neill later told me. “So you’ll be given a more or less scripted set of lines, routines that you can follow. “Most training camps now will spend the majority of their time out on the streets, in bars, cafés, museums, any public space, actually practising these techniques, putting them into action. ""And that means often unwillingly drawing women into these interactions.” Some of the women we were told to “approach” looked like teenagers and I told Hitchens I thought they were too young. I am 31, and I did not want to approach someone who looked half my age. Hitchens, who was 34 at the time, took me aside to explain why I needed to be less selective. “Doesn’t matter,” he told me. “Even if she’s underage, it’s not illegal to stop someone...That was a good target.”    Dr Rachel O’Neill, an academic at the London School of Economics, has studied the seduction industry for 10 years. “There’s an idea that seduction essentially provides a blueprint that men can follow as a way of interacting with women,” Dr O’Neill later told me. “So you’ll be given a more or less scripted set of lines, routines that you can follow. “Most training camps now will spend the majority of their time out on the streets, in bars, cafés, museums, any public space, actually practising these techniques, putting them into action.

We sat on the steps of Nelson’s column in Trafalgar Square and listened to coach George Massey (pictured) tell us about the day’s lesson on “LMR”. LMR stands for “last minute resistance” to sex. It is regarded by the pick-up artists as a women’s token attempt to reject sex - an obstacle to be overcome. “You have to be the one to lead,” Massey explained. “The whole vibe is you take responsibility for it. ‘Yeah, I know, I am just an animal I couldn’t resist’” In one of his videos, Hitchens stated that you should “carry on escalating” if a girl says that you are “going too fast”. Hitchens then goes on to say: “If she says, we’ll definitely have sex next time, you can reply with: Why waste time? It’s arrogant to assume that there will be a next time.” “There’s an idea with LMR that women put up a certain amount of supposedly token resistance prior to having sex,” explained Dr Rachel O’Neill. “And this is something, again, under seduction logic that women do as a way of trying to safeguard their reputation. And the thing that’s really worrying about this is that it creates a situation in which a woman’s ‘no’ can never be legitimately heard as a no.” Massey introduced us to the next coach Richard Hood. Massey called him the “King of LMR”. Hood sounded more like a high-pressure salesman than someone genuinely interested in what a woman might want. “When you get to the apartment tell her to take her shoes off – as soon as you walk through the front door – you start taking your shoes off, it’s basically the first part of escalation,” he told us. “Some girls can be annoying. If they are already in their shoes and their jacket they’ll be like ‘okay, okay, that’s enough for tonight… we will leave the rest for next time’...Obviously that’s frustrating” He told us that men can be too preoccupied with consent. “Sometimes guys are a bit too shy or a bit too scared to keep pushing forward [be]cause they [men] want like… they want so much consent. I mean that they want lots of like… a written permission slip from her like, you know, ‘it’s okay that we go all the way’. ‘Cause it’s a nuance, obviously, you have to… you have to feel out the right moment, and sometimes it is your job to push things forward and lead.” I asked criminal barrister Kate Parker for her professional opinion on teaching men how to overcome last minute resistance to sex and showed her some of the coaches’ videos. “I think it’s really troubling, because it’s encouraging these young men to bypass any red flags that are put up by these women and that they should be sensitive to and alert to, and responding to,” she told me. “From what I’ve seen, there doesn’t seem to be any sexual offences there, yet. But the more they teach last minute resistance, and the more they teach these young men to ignore any signs of lack of consent, the closer we’re getting to sexual offence territory.” The head of Rape Crisis Scotland, Sandy Brindley, told me: “I think pick-up artists are really doing men no favours at all recommending these techniques... And my advice would be this, this is not the approach to take because you could end up facing very, very serious consequences.”     Day two of the bootcamp.

And my advice would be this, this is not the approach to take because you could end up facing very, very serious consequences.”   Five months after the bootcamp and I was back in London - this time as a BBC journalist to challenge the pick-up coaches I had met. After weeks of refusing to engage with me, I found Eddie Hitchens coaching another group of men. I asked why he pressurised women into having sex. He was outraged. “That’s completely wrong,” he said. “That’s completely wrong. You have twisted it completely out of  context… Bro. It’s an art. It’s an art... It’s completely consensual. ""We actually help men…so if anything we help prevent rape culture to help prevent them get involved in anything illegal or non-consensual.” Richard Hood denied teaching men how to pressurise women into having sex and said all the women were recorded with their consent.    “We never film girls. We’ve had actresses,” he told me. So you’ve done nothing wrong? “Correct” And you don’t think you’re breaking the law? “Of course not.” After I spoke to Richard Hood, Street Attraction deleted the secretly filmed video I questioned him about. Then, shortly before my documentary film was to be broadcast, YouTube removed more than a hundred videos posted by Street Attraction. A YouTube spokesperson told me the platform had “terminated the channels Addy A Game and Street Attraction. ""YouTube strictly prohibits explicit sexual, graphic or harassing content. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the safety of our community, and we will continue to review and refine our policies  in this area.” Another Street Attraction coach called George Massey later told me he saw his role as “helping people in the dating field”. If he has ever said anything inappropriate to a man seeking support, he said, no-one has ever told him. He said he gets letters of thanks from men who are now in healthy relationships. He added: “I don't claim to be impervious to error”. Hitchens denied telling his students that they should approach teenagers. “Not true,” he said. “The thing that I teach is exactly this.  Find out how old the girl is before you do anything sexual, anything flirtatious… You guys are basically misrepresenting what we’re doing.  It’s absolutely disgusting and we’ll see you in court.”  Five months after the bootcamp and I was back in London - this time as a BBC journalist to challenge the pick-up coaches I had met.

One 18-year-old victim who gave evidence described being stopped in a shopping centre by Ahmed, who is now 38. “He put his hand on my back, at my waist. He put his hand on my cheek and tried to kiss me. I threw my hands up and asked him what he was doing. There was no conversation at all. Then I asked a member of the public if I could stand next to them because I felt vulnerable and isolated. He was bigger than me so I was scared to cause a scene.” Giving evidence, Ahmed said his approaches to women were harmless and said that he stopped as soon as he found out if they were 17 or younger. The jury disagreed. Ahmed was convicted of five charges of threatening and abusive behaviour and was remanded in custody for sentence. He had already spent nine months on remand in jail. While the case was going on, Rita was at court to support the women. She was one of the women who had blown the whistle on Ahmed’s activities, and it was her call to the BBC that set me off investigating A-Game. Rita had thought she knew “Addy”. They were both students at college in Glasgow where they were studying towards a degree in social work. They both lived in the Glasgow area, they shared a car pool to class. That was until Ahmed missed a day of college, giving one of Rita’s classmates the opportunity to show the rest of the car pool exactly what Addy got up to in his spare time. Rita was shown a series of images of Ahmed with half-naked women from his Instagram account and YouTube channel. “I was kind of in floods of tears and thinking, what is this, is he like a pimp or is this a prostitution ring?” she said. “I started looking at the videos and I just felt sick. I felt physically sick. It wasn’t about how to chat up a girl, it was much darker, much darker. They [the women in his videos] don’t know they’re being filmed. They don’t know they’re being recorded. So, right from the off it’s seedy, it’s underhand.” This is the era of #MeToo. Women are fighting back against male harassment. Women like Rita, Beth and Emily are finally being listened to. “I’ve realised, you know, it’s a universal problem” said Rita. “I just want women and young girls to be aware that there are these predatory men, in our colleges and in our workplaces.""

So, right from the off it’s seedy, it’s underhand.” This is the era of #MeToo. Women are fighting back against male harassment. Women like Rita, Beth and Emily are finally being listened to. “I’ve realised, you know, it’s a universal problem” said Rita. “I just want women and young girls to be aware that there are these predatory men, in our colleges and in our workplaces.""

Female reporters were sexually harassed, propositioned and put under pressure by senior lecturers at the institutions â all the while wearing secret cameras. Reporter Kiki Mordi, who knows first-hand how devastating sexual harassment can be, reveals what happens behind closed doors at some of the regionâs most prestigious universities.

"This video can not be played Endometriosis: The condition that can take more than seven years to diagnose More than 13,500 women have taken part in BBC research revealing the devastating effect of endometriosis. Half said they had had suicidal thoughts, and many said they rely on highly addictive painkillers. Most also said endometriosis - involving painful periods - had badly affected their education, career and relationships. MPs are to launch an inquiry into women's experiences of endometriosis following the research. Women with the condition answered questions on how the condition has affected them. The charity Endometriosis UK helped gather the responses. The condition affects one in 10 women and, as well as extremely heavy periods, can cause debilitating pain and sometimes infertility. Bethany Willis, who lives in Essex, was one of those who took part in the research. She began having endometriosis symptoms aged just nine. She knew what it was because her mum and grandmother also have the condition. This video can not be played Delays in diagnosis left Tamara in excruciating pain Now 19, Bethany says: ""The pain is like barbed wire wrapped around your insides and someone's pulling it while at the same time an animal is trying to eat its way through you."" At one point she was in so much pain that she took an overdose. ""I texted my boyfriend and said goodbye. I was ready to end my life there and then because of the pain."" She was finally diagnosed this summer following surgery and - though still in daily pain - she is managing to cope. Endometriosis: 'Don't give up on getting help' Endometriosis: Early diagnosis 'would make huge difference' Running from endometriosis: 'I feel in control again' Endometriosis: Women in NI 'not getting good deal' ""My mind is clearer and I have more energy, but the years of not being treated mean I've had to drop out of veterinary school and my dream career,"" she said. Anna Turley MP, a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Endometriosis which will carry out the inquiry, said: ""It wasn't until I was hospitalised and had the diagnosis that I realised how little attention endometriosis receives, how limited research funding is, and how many women are misdiagnosed."" She said the data gave ""millions of affected women a voice"" and the APPG would be calling on the government to act. Tayla Marshall is addicted to strong opioid medication Tayla Marshall, 24, from Northamptonshire, is one of those who relies on pain relief to cope with her symptoms. She has been through multiple operations and two chemically-induced menopauses and she is now addicted to strong opioid medication. ""I worry every day about my opioid intake. I take 50ml of morphine sulfate, Fentanyl patches, Naproxen and 30mg of amitriptyline and although I'm not addicted in my mind, my body is physically dependant on this now. ""If I went a day without it, I would start to experience nasty withdrawal symptoms."" Because her condition is so severe, Tayla is considering having a hysterectomy when she's 30. ""I have six years to try for a family,"" she said. ""But my last relationship ended due to the impact of endometriosis. I wasn't able to be intimate with my partner very often, unless I was dosed up on medication. ""I am also in a position where I have reduced chances of falling pregnant naturally and carrying a baby. ""I have sort of managed to get my head around the idea of not having children but it breaks my heart every day."" What is endometriosis? It is where tissue like that in the lining of the womb grows elsewhere in the body - often around the reproductive organs, bowel and bladder. Like the womb lining, the tissue builds up and bleeds every month, but with no way to escape the body, the blood is trapped, leading to inflammation, pain and formation of scar tissue For some women there are no symptoms, but for others it is debilitating and can causeâ¢  chronic pelvic pain, painful sex, painful bowel and bladder movements, fatigue and difficulties getting pregnant,external There is no cure, but treatments can reduce symptoms They include hormone treatment, pain relief and surgery - including hysterectomy In the UK it takes an average of 7.5 years to be diagnosed Emma Cox, CEO of the charity Endometriosis UK, which helped gather the women's testimonies, said: ""It cannot be overstated the devastating impact this condition is clearly having on people's physical and mental health. ""Without investment in research, a reduction in diagnosis time - which averages at a shocking 7.5 years - and better access to pain management, women will continue to face huge barriers in accessing the right treatment at the right time."" Some women choose to undergo a hysterectomy and early menopause in a bid to stop their symptoms. Michelle recently underwent surgery in a bid to end her symptoms Michelle Middleton, 42, from West Yorkshire, recently underwent the operation to remove her ovaries, womb, fallopian tubes and cervix. She says it is her last hope: ""I just want rid of everything,"" she said. But she added: ""The risk is that I'm no better and that there's damage and it gets worse but you have to have hope."" Minister for women's health, Caroline Dinenage said: ""I urge clinicians to play their part in breaking down the ongoing stigma around endometriosis by ensuring they follow NICE guidelines and encourage employers to rise to the challenge by creating supportive and flexible ways to help those living with these conditions.""

"Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Costa has won re-election, however he has no outright majority in parliament. With over half of the votes counted so far, his Socialist party led with 36.7% and will have to form a minority government. Mr Costa said he was delighted with the result and added that voters had shown they wanted stability. The party's rival, the centre-right Social Democratic Party, has come in second place. Portugal country profile Mr Costa said Portuguese voters had shown they wanted his party to continue its pact with two far-left parties - the Left Bloc and the Communists. He said he would govern with determination and responsibility. He also mentioned negotiations with the People-Animals-Nature party (PAN) party, Reuters reported. While the far left has been calling for more investment in public services, Mr. Costa is expected to renew his commitment to stick to euro-zone budget rules. Nearly 11 million people are registered to vote in the race for control of Portugal's 230-seat parliament. The Socialists' popularity had been hit by a string of scandals, including accusations of nepotism and a suspected cover-up of weapons theft at a military base. In 2015 the Social Democrats (PSD) won the most votes, but the Socialist Party came to power after reaching formal agreements with smaller left-wing parties. Since then the country's economy has grown above the EU average. Cuts to public sector wages and pensions have been reversed.

"Joshua Molnar was referred to as Boy A during the trial at Manchester Crown Court A teenager who stabbed his friend in the heart can be named after an order protecting his anonymity was lifted. Joshua Molnar wascleared of murder and manslaughterfollowing the death of 17-year-old Yousef Makki but was detained after he admitted possessing a knife. The ruling to name him was made after a legal challenge by The Times newspaper. His mother said the teenager, who turns 18 on Tuesday, ""accepts responsibility for Yousef's death in the act of self-defence"". But Yousef's family said they had ""never seen a shred of true remorse"" from Molnar or a second defendant - a 17-year-old known in court as Boy B, who also admitted possessing a knife. This video can not be played Deborah Makki says her family is devastated Manchester Grammar School pupil Yousef died in the attack in Hale Barns, Greater Manchester, in March. Molnar was detained for eight months and Boy B for four months - sentences which Yousef's family described as disappointing. The trial heard Molnar acted in self-defence when Yousef pulled out a knife in a row over an attempt to rob a drug dealer. Mr Justice Bryan said that with the agreement of his family, the restriction preventing Molnar being named was ""dispensed with in its entirety"". In a statement following the judge's ruling, Yousef's sister Jade Akoum and mother Deborah Makki said: ""The utter devastation on our lives is indescribable. Yousef Makki, 17, was stabbed in the heart with a flick knife ""Yousef was a bright and caring boy who had only just started to associate himself with these boys, who were not in any sense his 'best friends'. ""We do not accept for one moment that Yousef's death was merely an accident. ""Together with our legal, campaign and investigation teams, we are exploring all avenues for ensuring that we achieve justice for Yousef. ""We have never seen a shred of true remorse from Joshua Molnar, or the person known for the time being as Boy B."" His mother Deborah Makki said the family was ""broken"" by his death. She told the BBC: ""Every single one of us is broken from my son, my daughters and even grandchildren. Everybody is devastated. ""There is never a normal day when we don't think about Yousef."" Joshua Molnar and his mother Stephanie Molnar's mother, Stephanie, said: ""Circumstances on the night of 2 March led to our son Joshua accidentally killing his friend Yousef with a knife whilst defending himself against a knife. ""The events of that night were a tragedy. ""I cannot imagine what Yousef's parents and family must be going through as they try to come to terms with this. ""Joshua fully accepts responsibility for Yousef's death in the act of self-defence, and the impact of this acceptance is massive.

"The drummer was known for his hair-trigger temper as much as his music Ginger Baker, one of the most innovative and influential drummers in rock music, has died at the age of 80. A co-founder of Cream, he also played with Blind Faith, Hawkwind and Fela Kuti in a long and varied career. His style combined the lyricism of jazz with the crude power of rock. One critic said watching him was like witnessing ""a human combine harvester,external"". But he was also a temperamental and argumentative figure, whose behaviour frequently led to on-stage punch-ups. Baker continued to play around the world despite his failing health Nicknamed Ginger for his flaming red hair, the musician was born Peter Edward Baker in Lewisham, south London, shortly before World War Two. His bricklayer father was killed in action in 1943, and he was brought up in near poverty by his mother, step-father and aunt. A troubled student, he joined a local gang in his teens and became involved in petty theft. When he tried to quit, gang-members attacked him with a razor. His early ambition was to ride in the Tour de France but he was forced to quit the sport when, aged 16, his bicycle got ""caught up"" with a taxi. Instead, he took up drumming. ""I was always banging on the desks at school,"" he recalled. ""So all the kids kept saying, 'Go on, go and play the drums', and I just sat down and I could play. ""It's a gift from God. You've either got it or you haven't. And I've got it: time. Natural time."" He honed his craft in London's pubs and clubs The strong legs he'd developed on long bike rides helped him play the double bass drum set-up he favoured and Baker soon talked his way into his first gig. He played with jazz acts like Terry Lightfoot and Acker Bilk but his style - fragmented and aggressive, but articulate and insistent - was often an odd fit. Instead, he gravitated towards London's burgeoning blues scene and, in 1962, joined Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated on the recommendation of Charlie Watts  - who was leaving to join the Rolling Stones.

He gained early fame as a member of the Graham Bond Organisation alongside bassist Jack Bruce - but it was their partnership with Eric Clapton in Cream that made all three superstars. One of rock's first ""supergroups"", they fused blues and psychedelia to dazzling effect on songs like Strange Brew, Sunshine of Your Love, Badge and I Feel Free. They sold more than 35 million albums and were awarded the world's first ever platinum disc for their LP Wheels of Fire. Along with the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the band expanded the vocabulary of heavy rock, especially during their incendiary live shows, where the three musicians would stretch simple riffs into long, exploratory improvisations. ""It was as if something else had taken over,"" Baker once said of playing with Cream. ""You're not conscious of playing. You're listening to this fantastic sound that you're a part of. And your part is justâ¦ happening. It was a gift, and we three had it in abundance."" But the volatility that fuelled their performances was rooted in animosity. Baker and Bruce's arguments were frequent and violent, even driving Clapton to tears on one occasion. Once, Baker attempted to end one of Bruce's solos by bouncing a stick off his snare drum, and into Bruce's head. ""So I grabbed my double bass,"" Bruce later recalled, ""and demolished him and his kit."" The band eventually split after two years and four albums, with a farewell concert at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1968. ""Cream came and went almost in the blink of an eye, but left an indelible mark on rock music,"" wrote Colin Larkin in the Encyclopaedia of Popular Music. Bands who built on their template included Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin - not that Baker was impressed. ""I don't think Led Zeppelin filled the void that Cream left, but they made a lot of money,""he told Forbes,external. Cream in Central Park, shortly before their farewell concert (L-R): Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce Following the band's demise, he teamed up with Clapton and Steve Winwood to form Blind Faith, followed by the ambitious 10-piece Air Force, which combined his interests in jazz and Afro-fusion. While the musicianship was of a high standard, the eclectic mix of jazz, blues, African music and a surfeit of drums - there were three percussionists - was never going to inspire a mass following. After one studio album and a live concert at the Royal Albert Hall, Air Force, undermined by personnel changes, finally crashed and burned. The drug-related death of his friend, Jimi Hendrix, persuaded Baker it was time to leave the London music scene and get clean. He left Britain to live in Nigeria, where he recorded with Fela Kuti and built his own recording studio. He helped Paul McCartney record the classic Wings' album Band On The Run, although their relationship soured over claims that he was never paid. Financial problems of one sort or another dogged him throughout this period and he eventually lost control of his studio. He became a proficient polo player Away from music, he took up rally driving and, somewhat incongruously, developed a love of polo, building up a sizeable collection of ponies, despite his tendency to get injured. ""I've had a lot of falls which have wrecked my body,""he told the Telegraph in 2013,external. ""They had to take a piece of my hip bone out and screw it into my neck."" In the 1980s, he played with John Lydon's Public Image Ltd, while continuing to form and discard new bands that combined his African and Western musical influences, like African Force and Middle Passage. While commercial success eluded him, his reputation, particularly with a new generation of drummers, remained high. ""His playing was revolutionary,"" said Neil Peart, drummer with the Canadian band Rush. ""He set the bar for what rock drumming could be."" Cream were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, briefly reuniting to play three songs, then teamed up again in 2005 for a series of concerts in London and New York. Almost inevitably, the performances ended with Baker and Bruce fighting on stage. ""It's a knife-edge thing for me and Ginger,"" Bruce said afterward. ""Nowadays, we're happily co-existing in different continents... although I was thinking of asking him to move. He's still a bit too close."" Baker had, in fact, headed to South Africa, where he spent the reunion money buying polo ponies and funding a veterinary hospital. In 2012, he became the subject of a hugely enjoyable documentary - Beware of Mr Baker - which illustrated how his jaw-dropping drumming was neither as wild nor as extraordinary as his personal life. In the opening scene, the musician was seen attacking director Jay Bulger with a metal cane, declaring: ""I'm going to put you in hospital."" He later settled down to reflect, cantankerously, on the trail of broken bands, ex-wives and neglected children he'd left in his wake. Allow YouTube content?

Contributors marvelled at his talent, but little else. ""He influenced me as a drummer, but not as a person,"" recalled Free's Simon Kirke, who toured with Cream. In later years, he was beset by ill health, breaking most of his ribs and subsequently being diagnosed with a degenerative spine condition and the onset of emphysema. ""God is punishing me for my past wickedness by keeping me alive and in as much pain as He can,""he told Rolling Stone at the time,external. The musician fought osteoarthritis to record his final album, Why?, in 2014. Two years later, he underwent open heart surgery and announced his retirement from touring. ""Just seen doctorâ¦ big shockâ¦ no more gigs for this old drummer... everything is off,"" he wroteon his official blog,external. ""Of all things I never thought it would be my heart."" Baker's death will see him feted as one of rock's most influential musicians, but he scoffed at such accolades, insisting: ""Drummers are really nothing more than time-keepers."" He told Rhythm magazine: ""It's the drummer's job to make the other guys sound good."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"This video can not be played Harry's mother, Charlotte Charles, and father, Tim Dunn plea for the return of fatal crash suspect A chief constable has written to the US Embassy in London demanding the return of an American diplomat's wife who is a suspect in a fatal crash inquiry. Harry Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike collided with a car near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. The diplomat's wife, named as Anne Sacoolas, left the UK despite telling police she did not plan to. Nick Adderley, of Northamptonshire Police, has urged the embassy to waive her diplomatic immunity. He said he had appealed to US authorities ""in the strongest terms"". Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, said leaving the country was ""such a dishonourable thing to do"" and urged Ms Sacoolas to ""come back"". His father, Tim Dunn, said they needed to get the truth. Ms Charles added: ""We are not out to get her put behind bars. If that's what the justice system ends up doing then we can't stop that but we're not out to do that, we're out to try and get some peace for ourselves."" The US Embassy previously said ""security and privacy considerations"" precluded it from naming the suspect. The teenager, from Charlton, Banbury, died in hospital after his motorbike crashed with a Volvo On Saturday the US State Department said diplomatic immunity was ""rarely waived"" but Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged the US Embassy to reconsider. Underthe 1961 Vienna Convention,external, diplomats and their family members are immune from prosecution in their host country, so long as they are not nationals of that country. However, their immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them. Mr Adderleywas asked on Twitter,externalwhether Ms Sacoolas was lawfully entitled to claim diplomatic immunity. He replied: ""The short answer is yes,"" adding that both he and Northamptonshire Police and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold had written to the US Embassy, urging that the waiver be applied ""in order to allow the justice process to take place"". The crash happened on the B4031 near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire The US State Department said on Saturday that the incident involved ""a vehicle driven by the spouse of a US diplomat assigned to the United Kingdom"". Police said the suspect had ""engaged fully"" following the crash near RAF Croughton, a US Air Force communications station, and said ""she had no plans to leave the country in the near future"". The US State Department has said it is in ""close consultation"" with British officials and has offered its ""deepest sympathies"" to the family of Mr Dunn. ""Any questions regarding a waiver of immunity with regard to our diplomats and their family members overseas in a case like this receive intense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry; immunity is rarely waived,"" it added.

"The EU will decide at the end of the week whether a Brexit deal is going to be possible, French President Emmanuel Macron has told Boris Johnson. President Macron said talks should now proceed swiftly to see if an agreement could ""respect"" EU principles. Mr Johnson said the EU should not be ""lured"" into thinking there would be a delay to Brexit beyond 31 October. The PM will hold further calls with EU leaders on Monday to discuss his latest proposals for the Irish border. Downing Street said Mr Johnson was expected to hold phone calls with the leaders of Sweden, Denmark and Poland, after speaking to Mr Macron on Sunday. The prime minister told the French president over the phone he believed a deal could be achieved, but that the EU must match compromises made by the UK. A French government official said President Macron told Mr Johnson ""that the negotiations should continue swiftly with Michel Barnier's team in coming days, in order to evaluate at the end of the week whether a deal is possible that respects European Union principles"". UK could 'clarify' its Brexit offer to EU What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit The comments come ahead of a key few days of negotiations as both parties try to find a new agreement in time for a summit of European leaders on 17 and 18 October. On Monday, Mr Johnson's Europe adviser, David Frost, will hold further discussions with the European Commission, while Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will visit EU capitals. This video can not be played Last week in Brexit: The PM revealed his plan to attempt to ""get Brexit done"" Arrangements for preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland continue to be a sticking point, with the EU calling for ""fundamental changes"" to the UK's latest proposals. A senior Number 10 source said: ""The UK has made a big, important offer but it's time for the Commission to show a willingness to compromise too. If not the UK will leave with no deal."" It's good to talk. But was there a meeting of minds between the prime minister and the French president? Boris Johnson's aim was to disabuse President Macron of any suspicion that parliament simply wouldn't allow the UK to leave the EU at the end of the month without a deal. So this really could be the 'final opportunity' to seal one. The prime minister will deliver a similar message to other EU leaders. So far, though, Mr Johnson's proposals are yet to open the door to more intensive negotiations. From the Elysee Palace's account of the call, Macron's message to the PM seemed to be: First, work through the EU negotiator, Michel Barnier - don't work on individual leaders. And second, if you don't move a bit more towards the EU's position  by the end of the week, then it's no deal. So far, then, any talks seem to resemble the denouement of Reservoir Dogs - more stand-off than mutual understanding. Under the Benn Act, passed last month, the prime minister must write to the EU requesting a Brexit extension if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October, unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. Government papers submitted to a Scottish court said thatMr Johnson will comply, despite his assertion that there will be ""no more dither or delay"". The Number 10 source called the legislation a ""surrender act"" and said its authors were ""undermining negotiations"". ""If EU leaders are betting that it will prevent no deal, that would be a historic misunderstanding,"" they said. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" Mr Johnson has claimed his plans will be supported by Parliament. At the weekend he said his untested plan to use technology to eliminate customs border checks would take the UK out of EU trade rules while respecting the Northern Ireland peace process. He claimed MPs from ""every wing of the Conservative Party"", Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party and from Labour have said ""our proposed deal looks like one they can get behind"". This video can not be played Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is asked about the government's strategy for a law that could force it to ask for a Brexit delay Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said talks were under way with Labour and other opposition MPs aimed at securing their support for a new deal. He said ministers were ""considering"" the idea of putting the PM's proposals to a vote in Parliament to test support for them ahead of the EU summit. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is set to meet the leaders of other opposition parties to scrutinise the government's new Brexit proposals. The cross-party meeting between Labour, the SNP, Lib Dems, Greens and others on Monday will decide the next steps to ""hold the government to account"". Monday 7 October- Opposition leaders meet to discuss the PM's border proposals. In Edinburgh, the Court of Session could rule on the sanctions Boris Johnson would face if he contravened the law compelling him to seek a Brexit delay. Tuesday 8 October- Last working day in the House of Commons before it is due to be prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session. Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will be then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal.

"Boris Johnson has claimed his Brexit proposals have picked up support in Parliament, as he urged the EU to compromise. Ahead of a crucial summit in 11 days' time, he insisted a revised agreement was possible ""if the EU is willing."" Latvian PM Krisjanis Karins said a new deal ""may be a little bit of a long-shot"" but was ""certainly possible"". Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay urged the EU to intensify negotiations on the UK's plans. Talks are due to resume on Mondayas both parties try to find a new agreement in time for the summit of European leaders on 17 and 18 October. But arrangements for preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland continue to be a sticking point, with the EU calling for ""fundamental changes"" to the UK's latest proposals. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Barclay said more advanced negotiations would need to begin ""in the coming days"" for a deal to be reached before the current Brexit deadline of 31 October. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he believed a deal was possible but saidcurrent proposals did not go far enough. French officials said that in a telephone conversation with Mr Johnson on Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron urged him to swiftly continue talks on the UK's new plans for the Irish border with European Commission officials. UK could 'clarify' its Brexit offer to EU What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit PM will send Brexit extension letter, court told Mr Barclay said talks were under way with Labour and other opposition MPs aimed at securing their support for a new deal. He said ministers were ""considering"" the idea of putting the PM's new proposals to a vote in Parliament to test support for them ahead of the EU summit in mid-October. But speaking on the same programme, Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti said the government would have to ""compromise"" to get Labour's support for a new agreement, and a deal would be ""more likely"" to meet the party's tests if it won the support of Ireland. ""The deal that he's currently proposing - that is not going down very well in Brussels, or in Dublin or with us - is a deregulatory deal that business in this country doesn't want,"" she said. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK has said there is ""no path"" to a deal without a replacement for the Irish borderbackstop plan, which is opposed by many MPs. The backstop is the controversial insurance policy that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but which critics - including the PM - fear could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. Writing in theSun on Sunday,externaland theSunday Express,external, Mr Johnson said his untested plan to use technology to eliminate customs border checks would take the UK out of EU trade rules while respecting the Northern Ireland peace process. ""I say to our European friends: grasp the opportunity our new proposal provides. Join us at the negotiating table in a spirit of compromise and co-operation,"" he said. This video can not be played Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is asked about the government's strategy for a law that could force it to ask for a Brexit delay He claimed MPs from ""every wing of the Conservative Party"", Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party and from Labour have said ""our proposed deal looks like one they can get behind"". But he said ""there will be no more dither and delay"" and the UK would leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal. Mr Johnson did not explain how the government would comply with a law passed by MPs which forces the prime minister to seek an extension to the Brexit deadline if no agreement has been made by 19 October. In court documents, the government has saidthe prime minister will request a delay as the law requires, despite his public and Parliamentary statements. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" Baroness Chakrabarti said the prime minister ""speaks with forked tongue"" on the possibility of asking for an extension, adding he ""seems to think he is above the law"". She insisted there were no loopholes in the legislation, adding that the conditions under which the PM must ask for another Brexit delay were ""explicit and specific"". Mr Barclay confirmed he would be travelling to the Netherlands on Sunday evening as part of an effort to secure support for the PM's plan in Europe, and urged the EU to show ""creativity and flexibility"". He indicated the UK was open to some flexibility on how authorisation from Northern Irish politicians would have to be secured for parts of the PM's plan to come into effect. ""The key issue is the principle of consent, that's why the backstop was rejected three times,"" he said. ""So the key is the principle of consent, now of course in the mechanism, as part of the intensive negotiations we could look at that and discuss that."" What is 'no-deal Brexit'? Brexit jargon explained Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins told the Andrew Marr Show the UK's border ideas were a ""basis for negotiations"", although he noted the EU ""doesn't have a whole lot of wriggle room"". But he said: ""It depends on one crucial element: that also Mr Johnson as well as the EU are willing and ready to move in a compromise manner. If the offer from the UK turns out to be 'take it or leave it', it's going to be very difficult."" Mr Varadkar said on Saturday a deal was ""still possible"" but the EU did not believe the current proposals from Mr Johnson ""form the basis for deeper negotiations"".

"The final Thomas Cook holidaymakers to be brought home by the emergency repatriation will arrive in Manchester on a flight from Orlando on Monday. The flight is one of the 700 organised by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as part of ""Operation Matterhorn"". The two-week operation returned 150,000 passengers to the UK after the package tour company collapsed last month. The flight was one of 24 leaving on Sunday, and brings to an end the biggest-ever peacetime repatriation. The CAA said that for the first 13 days of the operation, 94% of holidaymakers arrived home on the day of their original departure. ""Operation Matterhorn will shortly be complete. The largest peacetime repatriation ever required an extraordinary effort from all involved,"" said Richard Moriarty, the CAA's chief executive. The few remaining passengers who did not return on an Operation Matterhorn flight will have to make their own plans, although those covered by theAir Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol),externalwill be refunded.

The CAA said it would now turn its attention to refunding the 360,000 bookings cancelled when Britain's oldest travel group went under. About 9,000 staff in the UK were left jobless when the business failed to secure a last-ditch rescue deal. The travel firm collapsed in the early hours of 23 September, after failing to obtain rescue funds from its banks. An inquiry has been launched by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, with MPs focussing on the directors' stewardship of the company.

"The drummer was known for his hair-trigger temper as much as his music Ginger Baker, one of the most innovative and influential drummers in rock music, has died at the age of 80. A co-founder of Cream, he also played with Blind Faith, Hawkwind and Fela Kuti in a long and varied career. His style combined the lyricism of jazz with the crude power of rock. One critic said watching him was like witnessing ""a human combine harvester,external"". But he was also a temperamental and argumentative figure, whose behaviour frequently led to on-stage punch-ups. Baker continued to play around the world despite his failing health Nicknamed Ginger for his flaming red hair, the musician was born Peter Edward Baker in Lewisham, south London, shortly before World War Two. His bricklayer father was killed in action in 1943, and he was brought up in near poverty by his mother, step-father and aunt. A troubled student, he joined a local gang in his teens and became involved in petty theft. When he tried to quit, gang-members attacked him with a razor. His early ambition was to ride in the Tour de France but he was forced to quit the sport when, aged 16, his bicycle got ""caught up"" with a taxi. Instead, he took up drumming. ""I was always banging on the desks at school,"" he recalled. ""So all the kids kept saying, 'Go on, go and play the drums', and I just sat down and I could play. ""It's a gift from God. You've either got it or you haven't. And I've got it: time. Natural time."" He honed his craft in London's pubs and clubs The strong legs he'd developed on long bike rides helped him play the double bass drum set-up he favoured and Baker soon talked his way into his first gig. He played with jazz acts like Terry Lightfoot and Acker Bilk but his style - fragmented and aggressive, but articulate and insistent - was often an odd fit. Instead, he gravitated towards London's burgeoning blues scene and, in 1962, joined Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated on the recommendation of Charlie Watts  - who was leaving to join the Rolling Stones.

He gained early fame as a member of the Graham Bond Organisation alongside bassist Jack Bruce - but it was their partnership with Eric Clapton in Cream that made all three superstars. One of rock's first ""supergroups"", they fused blues and psychedelia to dazzling effect on songs like Strange Brew, Sunshine of Your Love, Badge and I Feel Free. They sold more than 35 million albums and were awarded the world's first ever platinum disc for their LP Wheels of Fire. Along with the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the band expanded the vocabulary of heavy rock, especially during their incendiary live shows, where the three musicians would stretch simple riffs into long, exploratory improvisations. ""It was as if something else had taken over,"" Baker once said of playing with Cream. ""You're not conscious of playing. You're listening to this fantastic sound that you're a part of. And your part is justâ¦ happening. It was a gift, and we three had it in abundance."" But the volatility that fuelled their performances was rooted in animosity. Baker and Bruce's arguments were frequent and violent, even driving Clapton to tears on one occasion. Once, Baker attempted to end one of Bruce's solos by bouncing a stick off his snare drum, and into Bruce's head. ""So I grabbed my double bass,"" Bruce later recalled, ""and demolished him and his kit."" The band eventually split after two years and four albums, with a farewell concert at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1968. ""Cream came and went almost in the blink of an eye, but left an indelible mark on rock music,"" wrote Colin Larkin in the Encyclopaedia of Popular Music. Bands who built on their template included Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin - not that Baker was impressed. ""I don't think Led Zeppelin filled the void that Cream left, but they made a lot of money,""he told Forbes,external. Cream in Central Park, shortly before their farewell concert (L-R): Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce Following the band's demise, he teamed up with Clapton and Steve Winwood to form Blind Faith, followed by the ambitious 10-piece Air Force, which combined his interests in jazz and Afro-fusion. While the musicianship was of a high standard, the eclectic mix of jazz, blues, African music and a surfeit of drums - there were three percussionists - was never going to inspire a mass following. After one studio album and a live concert at the Royal Albert Hall, Air Force, undermined by personnel changes, finally crashed and burned. The drug-related death of his friend, Jimi Hendrix, persuaded Baker it was time to leave the London music scene and get clean. He left Britain to live in Nigeria, where he recorded with Fela Kuti and built his own recording studio. He helped Paul McCartney record the classic Wings' album Band On The Run, although their relationship soured over claims that he was never paid. Financial problems of one sort or another dogged him throughout this period and he eventually lost control of his studio. He became a proficient polo player Away from music, he took up rally driving and, somewhat incongruously, developed a love of polo, building up a sizeable collection of ponies, despite his tendency to get injured. ""I've had a lot of falls which have wrecked my body,""he told the Telegraph in 2013,external. ""They had to take a piece of my hip bone out and screw it into my neck."" In the 1980s, he played with John Lydon's Public Image Ltd, while continuing to form and discard new bands that combined his African and Western musical influences, like African Force and Middle Passage. While commercial success eluded him, his reputation, particularly with a new generation of drummers, remained high. ""His playing was revolutionary,"" said Neil Peart, drummer with the Canadian band Rush. ""He set the bar for what rock drumming could be."" Cream were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, briefly reuniting to play three songs, then teamed up again in 2005 for a series of concerts in London and New York. Almost inevitably, the performances ended with Baker and Bruce fighting on stage. ""It's a knife-edge thing for me and Ginger,"" Bruce said afterward. ""Nowadays, we're happily co-existing in different continents... although I was thinking of asking him to move. He's still a bit too close."" Baker had, in fact, headed to South Africa, where he spent the reunion money buying polo ponies and funding a veterinary hospital. In 2012, he became the subject of a hugely enjoyable documentary - Beware of Mr Baker - which illustrated how his jaw-dropping drumming was neither as wild nor as extraordinary as his personal life. In the opening scene, the musician was seen attacking director Jay Bulger with a metal cane, declaring: ""I'm going to put you in hospital."" He later settled down to reflect, cantankerously, on the trail of broken bands, ex-wives and neglected children he'd left in his wake. Allow YouTube content?

Contributors marvelled at his talent, but little else. ""He influenced me as a drummer, but not as a person,"" recalled Free's Simon Kirke, who toured with Cream. In later years, he was beset by ill health, breaking most of his ribs and subsequently being diagnosed with a degenerative spine condition and the onset of emphysema. ""God is punishing me for my past wickedness by keeping me alive and in as much pain as He can,""he told Rolling Stone at the time,external. The musician fought osteoarthritis to record his final album, Why?, in 2014. Two years later, he underwent open heart surgery and announced his retirement from touring. ""Just seen doctorâ¦ big shockâ¦ no more gigs for this old drummer... everything is off,"" he wroteon his official blog,external. ""Of all things I never thought it would be my heart."" Baker's death will see him feted as one of rock's most influential musicians, but he scoffed at such accolades, insisting: ""Drummers are really nothing more than time-keepers.""

"Ewan Ireland is due to be sentenced in December A teenager who stabbed a lawyer to death with a screwdriver can be named after reporting restrictions expired. Ewan Ireland was 17 when he killed Peter Duncan at the Eldon Square shopping centre in Newcastle in August. Ireland, of Newcastle,admitted murder, stealing screwdrivers and carrying an offensive weapon, but could not be identified until his 18th birthday. He remains in police custody and will be sentenced in December after psychiatric reports have been prepared. At a previous hearing, prosecutors said Ireland had 17 convictions for 31 offences between 2017 and 2019. Newcastle Crown Court was told 52-year-old Mr Duncan was ""simply in the wrong place at the wrong time"" when he crossed paths with the teenager outside a Greggs. He died after being stabbed once in the heart on 14 August. Peter Duncan's family described him as a ""devoted father and husband"" Mr Duncan was working as legal counsel in the Newcastle office of Royal IHC Limited when he was killed, and previously worked as a solicitor and legal advisor with other companies in Darlington and Newcastle. He had trained as an electrical engineer before graduating from Northumbria University with a law degree in 2003. In a statement released following his death, Mr Duncan's family said he was a ""kind and caring man who was always first to help others"". ""His death will leave such a huge hole in our lives and he'll be deeply missed by us all,"" they added.

"Saudi Arabia is looking to soften its image in the eyes of tourists Unmarried foreign couples will now be allowed to rent hotel rooms together in Saudi Arabia as part of a new visa regime announced by the religiously conservative kingdom. Women will also be allowed to stay in hotel rooms alone. Couples previously had to prove they were married before getting a hotel room. The government move comes amid efforts by Saudi Arabia to grow its tourism industry. In the past, couples had to provide documents proving marriage, but now these rules have been relaxed for foreigners. ""All Saudi nationals are asked to show family ID or proof of relationship on checking into hotels,"" the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage said in a statement. ""This is not required of foreign tourists. All women, including Saudis, can book and stay in hotels alone, providing ID on check-in."" The new visa regulations state that female tourists are not required to fully cover up but are still expected to dress modestly. Alcohol remains banned. Long seen as one of the strictest places on earth, Saudi Arabia is trying to soften its image in the eyes of foreign tourists and investors. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has recently made some substantial changes in the ultra-conservative kingdom. Saudi Arabia allows women to travel independently These include ending a ban on female drivers and allowing women to travel abroad without a male guardian's permission. This video can not be played (June 2018) Saudi women hit the road But these changes have been overshadowed by highly controversial issues including themurder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

"The story centred around a call between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump You may have heard this one before: a controversy involving a foreign power that threatened the future of the Trump presidency. Donald Trump was impeached over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. In the end, he was cleared on two charges by a majority of senators at this trial. How did we get here? Let's break it down. President Trump was accused of breaking the law by pressuring Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival. In July 2019, he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate one of the frontrunners to take him on in the 2020 presidential election. This mattered, opposition Democrats said, because it is illegal to ask foreign entities for help in winning a US election. He says he has done nothing wrong. After Mr Trump was impeached in December, a trial took place that could have led to the president being removed. In the end, he was cleared. At the heart of this story was a complaint from an unknown whistleblower. In August 2019, an anonymous intelligence official wrote a letter expressing concern over President Trump's 25 July phone conversation with Ukraine's president. The official spoke of an ""urgent concern"" that Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 election. Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means A rough transcript of the call,externallater revealed Mr Trump had urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden, the frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine. A senior official later testified the president had made clear the release of this aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated. The White House denies this. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Trump and his supporters alleged Mr Biden abused his power to pressure Ukraine to back away from a criminal investigation that could implicate his son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company. But these allegations were widely discredited. There is no evidence that Mr Biden took any action to intentionally benefit his son, nor is there any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Congressional Democrats said the phone call was proof Mr Trump broke the law by seeking foreign help to try to smear Mr Biden. But there was debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constituted an impeachable offence. President Trump says it's a ""witch hunt"". The Democrat-held House of Representatives impeached him on two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. But to remove Mr Trump, senators from his own Republican Party would have needed to turn against him at his trial, which didn't happen. President Trump says he called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July 2019 to congratulate him on his election victory. Mr Zelensky, a former TV star with no political experience, had been elected president three months earlier. But an anonymous whistleblower, reported to be a CIA official, felt there was something more serious in their exchange, and explained why in a formal complaint on 12 August. The whistleblower admitted having not directly heard the call but said accounts shared by other officials had painted a consistent picture. For context, about a dozen people are reported to have listened in on the conversation, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The call occurred days after Mr Trump blocked $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. Critics argued this was used as a bargaining chip, but Mr Trump denied this. This video can not be played Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower"" The whistleblower alleged the president used ""the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 presidential election, adding that White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the call and had acted to ""lock down"" all details of it. As the controversy grew, Mr Trump promised to release a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" he said would prove the call had been ""totally appropriate"". But details disclosed by the White House were notes of the conversation and not a full, verbatim account. It did little to quell the spiralling controversy. The notes showed Mr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky to investigate discredited corruption allegations against former Vice-President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. Mr Trump and his allies suggested that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2015 because he had been investigating an energy company which employed Hunter Biden. At the time, by working closely with foreign-owned entities while his father was in the White House, Hunter Biden was criticised for leaving his father exposed to suggestions of a possible conflict of interest. But no evidence emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. Hunter Biden denied wrongdoing and officials in Kiev said there was no evidence to support the allegations. Then-President Barack Obama sits with then Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a basketball game in 2010 Mr Trump pressing a foreign leader to investigate discredited allegations against Mr Biden was significant. If he wins the Democratic nomination, Mr Biden would be the man facing Mr Trump for the presidency in November 2020. As Mr Biden is a leading rival for the presidency, it opened Mr Trump up to claims he was working with a foreign power to influence the election. This - crucially - is against the law. This was not the first time Mr Trump has been scrutinised over his foreign connections. His 2016 election campaign was investigated over its alleged ties to Russia. The inquiry didn't establish a criminal conspiracy to influence the election, but it also didn't exonerate the president of obstructing justice. The Democrats launched a formal inquiry into the Ukraine affair and a number of officials were called to testify. They included the US government's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. Who listens in on a president's phone call? Ukraine has 'no jurisdiction' to investigate Bidens How easy is it to impeach a president? The acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told the inquiry that Mr Trump had made the release of the military aid conditional on Ukraine opening an investigation into the Bidens' dealings. He also said there was ""an irregular, informal channel of US policymaking"" in the country more generally. The White House denied this was the case. The president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was subpoenaed for documents relating to Ukraine. He has been central in pushing the allegations against the Bidens. Mr Pompeo has also been served with a subpoena. But the most dramatic testimony came from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. He told Congress that he was working at the ""express direction"" of the president when pressure was put on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Mr Sondland added that an offer of a White House visit for Ukraine's president was conditional on the country publicly announcing a probe. He also implicated Mr Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton in the Ukraine dealings. In December, Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives unveiled two impeachment charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. Then, a week before Christmas, the House voted to impeach Mr Trump, ensuring he became only the third US president to suffer the same fate (after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton). Over two weeks in January and February 2020, the Senate held a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict, so a guilty verdict was always unlikely given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. And this is how it came to pass. Mr Trump was cleared - by 52 votes to 48 on one count, and 53 votes to 47 on the other.

"This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Hong Kong has seen several months of pro-democracy protests - and China appears to be tightening its grip. The protests began in June 2019 over plans - later put on ice, and finally withdrawn in September - that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China. They then spread to reflect wider demands for democratic reform, and an inquiry into alleged police brutality. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law, which critics believe could be used to crack down on rights and political activists. This is not all happening in a vacuum. There's a lot of important context - some of it stretching back decades - that helps explain what is going on. It's important to remember that Hong Kong is significantly different from other Chinese cities. To understand this, you need to look at its history. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests It was a British colony for more than 150 years - part of it, Hong Kong island, was ceded to the UK after a war in 1842. Later, China also leased the rest of Hong Kong - the New Territories - to the British for 99 years. It became a busy trading port, and its economy took off in the 1950s as it became a manufacturing hub. The territory was also popular with migrants and dissidents fleeing instability, poverty or persecution in mainland China. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions Young, radical and ready for tear gas Read more about Hong Kong's history Then, in the early 1980s, as the deadline for the 99-year-lease approached, Britain and China began talks on the future of Hong Kong - with the communist government in China arguing that all of Hong Kong should be returned to Chinese rule. The two sides signed a treaty in 1984 that would see Hong Kong return to China in 1997, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". This meant that while becoming part of one country with China, Hong Kong would enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. As a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly, free speech and freedom of the press are protected. For example, it is one of the few places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, where the military opened fire on unarmed protesters in Beijing. Hong Kong still enjoys freedoms not seen in mainland China - but they are widely thought to be on the decline. Rights groups have accused China of meddling in Hong Kong, citing examples such as legal rulings that have disqualified pro-democracy legislators, and the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers, and a tycoon - who all eventually re-emerged in custody in China. There are also accusations that press and academic freedoms have been deteriorating. In March, China effectively expelled several US journalists - but also prohibited them from working in Hong Kong. The public broadcaster RTHK has come under pressure from Hong Kong's government, first for broadcasting an interview with the World Health Organization about Taiwan, and then for targeting police in its satirical news show ""Headliner"". The local examinations body also came under fire for a world history question about relations between Japan and China, with the government demanding the exam question be invalidated. The government said it was a professional, rather than political, decision, but many academics expressed concern. This video can not be played Police use tear gas on protesters Another sticking point has been democratic reform. Hong Kong's leader, the chief executive, is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee - a mostly pro-Beijing body chosen by just 6% of eligible voters. Not all the 70 members of the territory's lawmaking body, the Legislative Council, are directly chosen by Hong Kong's voters. Most seats not directly elected are occupied by pro-Beijing lawmakers. Some elected members have even been disbarredafter Beijing issued a controversial legal ruling that effectively disqualified them. Hope and defiance on the streets of Hong Kong Were triads involved in Hong Kong attacks? Hong Kong'smini-constitution, the Basic Law,external, says that ultimately both the leader, and the Legislative Council, should be elected in a more democratic way - but there's been disagreement over what this should look like. The Chinese government said in 2014 it would allow voters to choose their leaders from a list approved by a pro-Beijing committee, but critics called this a ""sham democracy"" and it was voted down in Hong Kong's legislature. In 28 years' time in 2047, the Basic Law expires - and what happens to Hong Kong's autonomy after that is unclear. While most people in Hong Kong are ethnic Chinese, and although Hong Kong is part of China, a majority of people there don't identify as Chinese. Surveys from the University of Hong Kong show thatmost people identify themselves as ""Hong Kongers"",external-only 11% would call themselves ""Chinese"",external- and 71% of people saythey do not feel proud about being Chinese citizens,external. The difference is particularly pronounced amongst the young. ""The younger the respondents, the less likely they feel proud of becoming a national citizen of China, and also the more negative they are toward the Central Government's policies on Hong Kong,"" the university's public opinion programme says. Hong Kongers have described legal, social and cultural differences - and the fact Hong Kong was a separate colony for 150 years - as reasons why they don't identify with their compatriots in mainland China. There has also been a rise in anti-mainland Chinese sentiment in Hong Kong in recent years, with people complaining about rude tourists disregarding local norms or driving up the cost of living. Some young activists have even called for Hong Kong's independence from China, something that alarms the Beijing government. Demonstrations in 2014 went on for several weeks There's a rich history of dissent in Hong Kong, stretching back further even than the past few years. In 1966, demonstrations broke out after the Star Ferry Company decided to increase its fares. The protests escalated into riots, a full curfew was declared and hundreds of troops took to the streets. Do protests ever work in China? Young and unhappy in HK Protests have continued since 1997, but now the biggest ones tend to be of a political nature - and bring demonstrators into conflict with mainland China's position. This video can not be played The BBC's Nick Beake inside the Legislative Council after protests in 2019 While Hong Kongers have a degree of autonomy, they have little liberty in the polls, meaning protests are one of the few ways they can make their opinions heard. As a result, many see taking to the streets as their only way of forcing change. And, in the past, some protests have been successful. In 2003,up to 500,000 people took to the streets,externalto protest against a controversial security bill the Hong Kong government was trying to pass. The local government also backed down over""patriotic education"" classesfollowing rallies against the move. However, the Chinese government has adopted a harder stance in recent years, particularly with any movements it views as a direct challenge to its own authority. In 2014, demonstrators took to the streets peacefully for several weeks, demanding Hong Kongers be given the right to elect their own leader. But the so-called Umbrella movement eventually fizzled out with no concessions from Beijing. In June 2019, protesters took to the streets again, demonstrating against plans to allow extraditions to mainland China. This time, clashes between police and activists became increasingly violent. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 The bill was halted, and later fully withdrawn, but demonstrations continued for months, with demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions. In April this year, Hong Kong police arrested 15 of the city's most high-profile pro-democracy activists for taking part in unauthorised assemblies. In May, Hong Kong's police watchdog said it found no significant wrongdoing on the police's part during the 2019 protests - in a report that was criticised by many rights groups and external experts. The street protests have mostly died down during the coronavirus pandemic, although some small demonstrations, including singing protesters in shopping malls, have started again as restrictions are gradually eased. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law in Hong Kong, which could be similar to the one withdrawn in 2003. It says the legislation is ""highly necessary"" and would ""safeguard national security in Hong Kong"". However, the new proposal is also controversial because it is expected to circumvent Hong Kong's own law-making processes - leading to accusations that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.

"Harry Dunn pictured with his mother Charlotte Charles The mother of a teenager killed in a car crash involving the wife of a US diplomat has urged her ""as a mum"" to return to the UK for questioning. Harry Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike collided with a car near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. The diplomat's wife, who has diplomatic immunity, left the UK despite telling police that she had no plans to. Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, told the BBC the family had been left ""utterly devastated"" by his death. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he has urged the US embassy to reconsider after the State Department said that diplomatic immunity is ""rarely waived"". ""I have called the US ambassador to express the UK's disappointment with their decision,"" he said. The teenager died in hospital after his motorbike crashed with a Volvo Mrs Charles told the BBC's PM programme: ""We're really hoping to try to get her back; from me, as a mum, to her, as a mum, you just hope that he [Mr Raab] can try to get through to her. ""We don't wish her any ill harm, but we don't understand how she can just get on a plane and leave our family just utterly devastated. ""If we don't get any luck over here, then we will go over there."" Should diplomats still have immunity? Underthe 1961 Vienna Convention,external, diplomats and their family members are immune from prosecution in their host country, so long as they are not nationals of that country. However, their immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them - in this case, the US. Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale There are more than 22,500 people in the UK who hold diplomatic immunity and most do not break the law. But if a diplomat is guilty of an egregious breach, there are some things that a host country can do. In a written Parliamentary answer in October 2017, then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""The FCO does not tolerate foreign diplomats breaking the law. ""When instances of alleged criminal conduct are brought to our attention by the police, we ask the relevant foreign government to waive diplomatic immunity where appropriate. ""For the most serious offences, and when a relevant waiver has not been granted, we seek the immediate withdrawal of the diplomat."" The problem here is that the US do not appear to have granted a waiver for this particular diplomatic spouse. Instead, they have removed her from the UK before the British government could threaten to remove her itself if she did not submit to questioning. As such, the US appears to have calculated that protecting the woman from identification, questioning and possible prosecution was more important than the potential risk to UK-US relations. This is further evidence the adjective ""special"" should rarely be used to describe the alliance between both countries. Supt Sarah Johnson said that the suspect ""engaged fully"" following the incident near RAF Croughton, a US Air Force communications station, and that she ""had previously confirmed... that she had no plans to leave the country in the near future"". ""The force is now exploring all opportunities through diplomatic channels to ensure that the investigation continues to progress,"" she said. The crash happened on the B4031 near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire The US Embassy in London confirmed the diplomat's family had left the UK, but it could not confirm the identity of the people involved in the incident ""due to security and privacy considerations"". The US State Department said it was in ""close consultation"" with British officials, but could not comment on ""private diplomatic conversation"" with the British government. ""We express our deepest sympathies and offer condolences to the family of the deceased in the tragic August 27 traffic accident involving a vehicle driven by the spouse of a U.S. diplomat assigned to the United Kingdom,"" a spokesperson said. ""Any questions regarding a waiver of immunity with regard to our diplomats and their family members overseas in a case like this receive intense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry; immunity is rarely waived."" Andrea Leadsom MP, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, tweeted that she had met Mr Dunn's family, who she described as ""heartbroken"". Allow Twitter content?

"Joshua Molnar was referred to as Boy A during the trial at Manchester Crown Court A teenager who stabbed his friend in the heart can be named after an order protecting his anonymity was lifted. Joshua Molnar wascleared of murder and manslaughterfollowing the death of 17-year-old Yousef Makki but was detained after he admitted possessing a knife. The ruling to name him was made after a legal challenge by The Times newspaper. His mother said the teenager, who turns 18 on Tuesday, ""accepts responsibility for Yousef's death in the act of self-defence"". But Yousef's family said they had ""never seen a shred of true remorse"" from Molnar or a second defendant - a 17-year-old known in court as Boy B, who also admitted possessing a knife. This video can not be played Deborah Makki says her family is devastated Manchester Grammar School pupil Yousef died in the attack in Hale Barns, Greater Manchester, in March. Molnar was detained for eight months and Boy B for four months - sentences which Yousef's family described as disappointing. The trial heard Molnar acted in self-defence when Yousef pulled out a knife in a row over an attempt to rob a drug dealer. Mr Justice Bryan said that with the agreement of his family, the restriction preventing Molnar being named was ""dispensed with in its entirety"". In a statement following the judge's ruling, Yousef's sister Jade Akoum and mother Deborah Makki said: ""The utter devastation on our lives is indescribable. Yousef Makki, 17, was stabbed in the heart with a flick knife ""Yousef was a bright and caring boy who had only just started to associate himself with these boys, who were not in any sense his 'best friends'. ""We do not accept for one moment that Yousef's death was merely an accident. ""Together with our legal, campaign and investigation teams, we are exploring all avenues for ensuring that we achieve justice for Yousef. ""We have never seen a shred of true remorse from Joshua Molnar, or the person known for the time being as Boy B."" His mother Deborah Makki said the family was ""broken"" by his death. She told the BBC: ""Every single one of us is broken from my son, my daughters and even grandchildren. Everybody is devastated. ""There is never a normal day when we don't think about Yousef."" Joshua Molnar and his mother Stephanie Molnar's mother, Stephanie, said: ""Circumstances on the night of 2 March led to our son Joshua accidentally killing his friend Yousef with a knife whilst defending himself against a knife. ""The events of that night were a tragedy. ""I cannot imagine what Yousef's parents and family must be going through as they try to come to terms with this. ""Joshua fully accepts responsibility for Yousef's death in the act of self-defence, and the impact of this acceptance is massive. ""He will have to live with the responsibility of his role in this for the rest of his life.""

"Leo Varadkar was speaking at a Fine Gael event in Dublin on Saturday Leo Varadkar has said he believes a Brexit deal is still possible, but that the PM's current proposals do not ""form the basis for deeper negotiations"". The taoiseach (Irish PM) said a deal must be agreed ahead of the European Council summit in two weeks. Speaking on Saturday, he also said he hoped to meet Boris Johnson next week. Mr Johnson'sproposalswould see NI stay in the European single market for goods, subject to approval every four years by the Northern Ireland Assembly. Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union along with the rest of the UK - resulting in new customs checks. Julian Smith defends government's Brexit plan 'It will be no-deal if Brexit plan is final offer' What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Mr Varadkar told the Irish national broadcaster RTÃ News there was still time for the UK government to put forward further proposals. ""I think a deal is still possible,"" he said. ""It is possible at the European Council summit in two weeks' time but the current position as of today is the European Union, including Ireland, doesn't feel that the proposals put forward by Prime Minister Johnson yet form the basis for deeper negotiations."" The taoiseach said that Friday would be a reasonable deadline for new proposals, but that it was not his job to set one and he did not want to set a false deadline. Prime Minister Johnson has said there will be no delay to Brexit beyond the 31 October deadline On Friday his deputy Simon Coveneydescribed Mr Johnson's latest Brexit proposals as a ""step forward""but insisted that further change is needed to avoid customs checks. Talks will resume on Mondayafter the EU said the UK's proposed alternative to the Irish backstop could not be the ""basis"" for a legally-binding treaty. The UK has said it would work on the details before then but there was ""no path"" to a deal without alternative arrangements in Northern Ireland. The PM's Brexit plan set out details of a replacement for the Irish border ""backstop"" in the current Brexit agreement. The backstop is the controversial ""insurance policy"" that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but which critics - including the PM - fear could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would, with the consent of politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly, continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products - what he calls an ""all-island regulatory zone"" This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" The government is also promising a ""New Deal for Northern Ireland"", with financial commitments to help manage the changes.
