"DaBaby, Lady Gaga and The Weeknd had some of the summer's biggest-selling songs DaBaby's Rockstar was the UK's biggest-selling song of the summer, says the Official Charts Company. Notching up 654,000 combined sales and streams over the summer, the brooding, guitar-driven rap song outsold hits by Lady Gaga and Harry Styles. It was one of several best-sellers this summer to be boosted by TikTok, where it triggered a viral dance challenge. The UK's second-biggest summer song, Jason Derulo's Savage Love, also started life on the video sharing app. Originally an instrumental by New Zealand teenager Joshua Stylah (aka Jawsh 685), it was spotted by Derulo after it took off on TikTok. The US star added vocals to the track, initially without crediting Stylah or obtaining permission for the sample. After Stylah signed a record deal with Columbia records, the song was released as a collaboration and climbed to the top of the charts. Allow YouTube content?

Savage Love achieved 566,000 chart sales over the summer, closely followed by Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande's Rain On Me, which had 515,000 sales. The pop divas were closely followed by The Weeknd, whose hit single Blinding Lights continued to sell over the summer after reaching number one earlier in the year. An even longer-standing hit was Harry Styles' mouth-watering Watermelon Sugar, which was the seventh most popular song of the summer, despite making its chart debut last November. The Official Charts combined sales and downloads with video and audio streams to compile its list. DaBaby's Rockstar had previously been named the most-streamed song of the summer by Spotify, while on YouTube, the top performers were Korean pop band Blackpink, whose single How You Like That was played more than 450 million times in June, July and August. DaBaby, who comes from North Carolina, has proved to be a master of meme-based marketing, achieving early attention by walking around the South by Southwest festival in Texas wearing only jewels and an adult-sized nappy. Initially, his ""internet presence was definitely bigger than the music,""he told the New York Times last year,external, boasting, ""I'm so good at marketing"". ""Once I knew I had them looking, I turned up with the music,"" he added. ""I knew what I was doing - it was premeditated."" Allow YouTube content?

Rockstar was his first UK hit, propelled by adance craze focusing on the song's hook,externalon TikTok. The platform, which allows users to make 15-second videos set to music, has become an increasingly powerful tool for marketing music. Hits like Doja Cat's Say So, Megan Thee Stallion's Savage, and Lil Nas X's Grammy-winning Old Town Road all gained early attention on the app. Tik Tok's music team actively promotes trending songs, scouring submissions for undiscovered talent, and facilitating collaborations among musicians and prominent creators. Pop music is getting faster (and happier) Five ways music changed in the 2010s Fourteen of the UK's top 20 best-selling songs this summer were popular on TikTok before hitting the charts, boosting the profile of lesser-known artists like Gracey, Powfu and Beabadoobee alongside more established acts such as Drake. However, while record companies increasingly look to the app to seed new hits, the Chinese-owned firm has been accused of being a threat to US national security by the Trump administration. TikTok was given 90 days to be sold to an American firm or face a ban in the US, leading to theresignation of chief executive Kevin Mayer.

"Current scientific techniques are not yet safe or effective enough to be used to create gene-edited babies, an international committee says. The technology could one day prevent parents from passing on heritable diseases to children, butthe committee says much more research is needed,external. Theworld's first gene-edited babieswere born in China in November 2018.  The scientist responsible was jailed, amid a fierce global backlash. The committee was set up in response. Most countries have regulations in place preventing babies being born after gene-editing, but the incident led to calls for strong international consensus. Gene-editing could potentially help avoid a range of heritable diseases by deleting or changing troublesome coding in embryos. But experts worry that modifying the genome of an embryo could cause unintended harm, not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit these same changes. One example of current technology is CRISPR, a biological system for altering DNA discovered in 2012. CRISPR scans the genome looking for the right location, and then uses ""molecular scissors"" to snip through the faulty DNA. While effective in the lab, the process is less than perfect and can cut out too much DNA. These unwanted edits could alter other important genes - inadvertently triggering cancer, for example. But arguably, the most controversial aspect of gene-editing concerns the potential to introduce changes to the germline - DNA alterations that would pass down the generations. Crispr: Human embryos and ethical concerns The commission involves experts from 10 different countries, including members of the UK's Royal Society and the US National Academy of Medicine. It made several recommendations, including: Extensive conversations in society before a country decides whether to permit this type of gene-editing If proven to be safe and effective, initial uses should be limited to serious, life-shortening diseases which result from the mutation of one or both copies of a single gene, such as cystic fibrosis Rigorous checks at every stage of the process to make sure there are no unintended consequences, including biopsies and regular screening of embryos Pregnancies and any resulting children to be followed up closely An international scientific advisory panel should be established to constantly assess evidence on safety and effectiveness, allowing people to report concerns about any research that deviates from guidelines Sarah Norcross, at Progress Educational Trust, said while important lessons needed to be learnt from the world's first genome-edited babies, the report went too far in the other direction. She said: ""The criteria the report sets out, for the first acceptable clinical use of germline genome editing in humans, are far too narrow. ""Furthermore, the report strays beyond its scientific remit. Much of the report - including a third of its recommendations - concerns governance, which is the focus of a separate genome editing project by the World Health Organization."" Meanwhile, Prof Dame Anne Johnson at the Academy of Medical Sciences welcomed the report's ""cautious"" approach. She said: ""This area of science could help a group of patients with no other options, but it is not one to be fast-tracked behind closed doors. ""It must be based on strong clinical data showing safety and efficacy, alongside thoughtful public debate that is clearly informed by the best possible scientific evidence.""

"Earlier this week Apple's value reached $2.3tn (Â£1.7tn), more than the combined worth of the FTSE 100 US and Asian stock markets have gone into reverse after shares in America's biggest technology firms tumbled. Companies that have powered US markets to record highs - Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook - fell between 4% and 8%. Analysts said fears about the economic shock of coronavirus and a possible second wave prompted the sell-off. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 5%, the Dow Jones fell almost 3%, and the broad-based S&P 500 lost 3.5%. In Asian trading Tokyo's Nikkei index was 1% lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down by 1.4%. Apple more valuable than the entire FTSE 100 Zoom profits double as revenues skyrocket Trump or Biden? China expects no favours either way Carmaker Tesla, whose shares have soared this year, tumbled 9% on Thursday after falling sharply in the previous two sessions. Another tech heavyweight, Nvidia, ended 9.3% down. Apple's 8% fall meant $150bn (Â£113bn) was wiped off the value of the iPhone maker. The sell-off came after mixed US economic data on Thursday that included a report showing slower services sector growth in August, bigger-than-expected drop in new jobless claims, record job cuts this year and an unexpectedly big trade deficit for July. While the latest weekly initial jobless claims fell more than anticipated, they remain high amid growing worries that employment growth could stall without further economic stimulus. Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans said on Thursday that Congress would need to deliver more fiscal aid. And he indicated that US monetary policy would be eased further and interest rates kept at ultra-low levels for years to help the economy recover its pre-pandemic strength. Growing worries about US economic health were underlined by the Vix index, also known as the ""fear gauge"". This reached its highest since mid-July. Sentiment wasn't helped by a warning from US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci who said there is doubt a Covid-19 vaccine will be developed by the end of October. The downturn in the US hit European markets. London's FTSE 100 ended down 1.5% at 5,850 points, and Germany's Dax fell 1.4%. Wall Street had reached fresh highs this week on what Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, called ""a combination of relatively unfounded vaccine and stimulus speculation"". Markets were now seeing a ""sharp turnaround"", he said. This video can not be played Despite the economy shrinking, US stocks had rallied On Wednesday, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at record levels, and the Dow came within 1.5% of its February peak. Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, said markets were due a reality check. ""Think about the mounting number of risks the market has been shrugging off over the last couple of months. We're 60 days away from the election. That may be an area where investors are getting a bit spooked,"" she said. Apple more valuable than the entire FTSE 100 Zoom profits double as revenues skyrocket Trump or Biden?

"Henriett Szucs (left) and Mihrican Mustafa were subjected to ""very significant violence"", the trial heard A convicted sex offender has been found guilty of murdering two women whose bodies were found in his freezer. The remains of Henriett Szucs and Mihrican Mustafa were discovered at Zahid Younis's flat in Canning Town, east London, in April 2019. Prosecutors at Southwark Crown Court said Younis preyed on the vulnerable women, subjecting them to ""very significant violence"". He received a life sentence, with a minimum jail term of 38 years. How warnings about Heni and Jan's killer were missed The four-week trial heard police made the ""grim discovery"" when looking for the defendant at his home following a call about his welfare. He was not in but officers gained entry and noticed the lockable freezer, around which flies were gathering. This video can not be played After Younis refused to return from the cells for sentencing, Ms Mustafa's family spoke outside the court Ms Szucs, 32, originally from Hungary, was last seen alive in 2016 and was killed shortly before the defendant bought the freezer in November that year, the court heard. Younis's second victim, 38-year-old Ms Mustafa, was last heard from in May 2018. Ms Szucs and Ms Mustafa were ""vulnerable women living somewhat chaotic lives"", including periods of homelessness and drug addiction, the court heard. Jurors were told Younis purchased the freezer shortly after killing Ms Szucs ""for the sole purpose"" of concealing her body. Zahid Younis was in an abusive relationship with Henriett Szucs, the court heard The nature of the crime scene meant a cause of death could not be established, but the scientific evidence showed that the women had been subjected to serious violence before their deaths. They had both suffered numerous rib fractures while Ms Szucs had sustained ""dreadful"" head injuries and Ms Mustafa's sternum and larynx had been fractured. Det Ch Insp Simon Harding said the freezer had been forced open by one of the officers on ""an old-fashioned police hunch"" about what was inside it. He said: ""He broke open the freezer and discovered what could only be seen, at the time, as only one body. ""It actually took the freezer being taken away and X-rayed for it to be seen there was another body underneath that. It was a gruesome discovery for the officers."" The Met's missing person inquiry into Mihrican Mustafa - which started in 2018 - did not examine vital phone evidence, which would have shown contact with Younis around the time she vanished Det Ch Insp Harding described Ms Szucs as someone who had been in abusive relationships before and was preyed upon by Younis. She moved in with him - although Younis denied having a long-term relationship with her - and ""we have shown that she was really in love with him in her own way"", the detective said. ""She wrote him letters that we found. Unfortunately to him, she did not mean anything."" The court heard that Younis has several previous convictions for assaulting partners. A BBC investigation has identified a series of issues relating to the case: In 2002, a teenage girl told police that Younis had attacked her with a hammer and crowbar, after falsely imprisoning her. No further action was taken. In 2007, 26 charges against Younis relating to two young teenage girls were discontinued after a judge directed that a jury should clear him of many of the offences following evidence from one of the victims. In 2008, a plea agreement resulted in several charges against Younis being discontinued, including rape and sexual assault. In 2016, Ms Szucs was placed in a safe house for victims of trafficking after she was thrown from a block of flats by a man - not Younis - who was on bail for allegedly raping her. The CPS had declined to authorise a rape charge after it was first reported in February 2015. The Met Police lost contact with her as she fell under the control of Younis. The Met's missing person inquiry into Ms Mustafa - which started in 2018 - did not examine vital phone evidence, which would have shown contact with Younis around the time she vanished. It is now the subject of an internal Scotland Yard inquiry after her family made a series of complaints. Younis, known as ""Boxer"", denied murder but did admit putting the women in the freezer, pleading guilty to two counts of preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body. He claimed he was out when Ms Szucs died at his flat and did not tell police because he was ""panicking"". The jury was told he paid a man to help him get Ms Szucs' body into the freezer and that his accomplice later blackmailed him into putting Ms Mustafa's corpse in the same place. Jurors deliberated for over 16 hours before returning majority verdicts. Younis showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out while members of Ms Mustafa's large family, who attended every day of the three-week trial, said ""yes"" in the public gallery. Her older sister, Mel Mustafa, said: ""Thank you God, thank you."" The defendant refused to return to court from the cells for sentencing, during which Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described him as an ""arch deceiver"" who had ""spent a lifetime destroying lives"". She added he had shown no remorse about killing ""two beautiful and creative women"" and he might never be released from prison.

"The Prime Minister visited an HS2 construction site on Friday Construction work on HS2 officially begins on Friday, with companies behind the controversial high-speed rail project expecting to create 22,000 jobs in the next few years. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said HS2 would ""fire up economic growth and help to rebalance opportunity"". He endorsed the rail link in February, withformal government approval granted in Aprildespite lockdown. But critics said HS2 will also cost jobs, and vowed to continue protesting. HS2 is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. It is hoped the 20-year project will reduce passenger overcrowding and help rebalance the UK's economy through investment in transport links outside London. HS2 Ltd chief executive Mark Thurston said the reality of high-speed journeys between Britain's biggest cities had moved a step closer. When the project was mooted in 2009, it was expected to cost an estimated Â£37.5bn and when the official price tag was set out in the 2015 Budget it came in at just under Â£56bn. Butan official government report has since warnedthat it could cost more than Â£100bn and be up to five years behind schedule. Some critics of HS2 describe it as a ""vanity project"" and say the money would be better spent on better connections between different parts of northern England. Others, such asthe Stop HS2 pressure group,external, say it will cause considerable environmental damage. When will HS2 open and how much will it cost? The prime minister said HS2 was at the heart of government plans to ""build back better"" and would form ""the spine of our country's transport network"". ""But HS2's transformational potential goes even further,"" he added. ""By creating hundreds of apprenticeships and thousands of skilled jobs, HS2 will fire up economic growth and help to rebalance opportunity across this country for years to come."" HS2's main works contractor for the West Midlands, the Balfour Beatty Vinci Joint Venture, has said it expects to be one of the biggest recruiters in the West Midlands over the next two years. Up to 7,000 skilled jobs would be required to complete its section of the HS2 route, it said, with women and under-25s the core focus for recruitment and skills investment. Other firms hiring include: Another joint venture partner, EKFB, said it would recruit more than 4,000 people over the next two years for its section from Long Itchington Wood site in Warwickshire south to the Chiltern tunnel portals Skanska Costain Strabag, Balfour Beatty Vinci Systra, Align JV and Mace Dragados JV, based in Greater London, will collectively recruit more than 10,000 HS2 Ltd itself is already directly recruiting for 500 new roles over the next three months, with the majority based in Birmingham. HS2 Ltd's Mr Thurston said the railway would be ""transformative"" for the UK. ""With the start of construction, the reality of high speed journeys joining up Britain's biggest cities in the North and Midlands and using that connectivity to help level up the country has just moved a step closer,"" he added. Special tunnelling machines will be needed for sections of the line Campaign group Stop HS2 said Boris Johnson and others who hail the creation of 22,000 jobs are ""rather less keen to mention that HS2 is projected to permanently displace almost that many jobs"". Stop HS2 campaign manager Joe Rukin said: ""Trying to spin HS2 as a job creation scheme is beyond desperate. Creating 22,000 jobs works out at almost Â£2m just to create a single job."" But speaking on the BBC's Breakfast programme, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps disputed those figures. ""I can't see how there's an argument that making it easier to get about this country is somehow going to destroy jobs, quite the opposite in fact.  It's clearly going to make the economy level up"", he said. ""Find those left behind areas, that have found themselves too disconnected before and join it together."" Stop HS2 chairwoman Penny Gaines called the project ""environmentally destructive"" to wildlife: ""This is why there are currently hundreds of activists camped out along the HS2 route. We don't expect them to go away any time soon."" However, the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP), which fights for investment in the regional economy, said such major infrastructure projects are transformative and called for the planned extensions of HS2 to be started as soon as possible. ""Increasing capacity on the North's rail network and better connecting our towns and cities will be vital in the economic regeneration of the Northern Powerhouse - both now and long in the future,"" said Henri Murison, director of the NPP. This is an important symbolic move for HS2, but in the real world it changes very little. Work preparing for the new line - demolishing buildings and clearing sites for example - has already been going on for the past three years. And in some areas, construction work has also begun. But the arguments over whether or not the railway should actually be built are continuing to rage. The government has long insisted that it will help re-balance the country's economy, by promoting investment outside London. It now says the jobs created by the scheme will support the post-Covid recovery. But opponents claim that lockdown has undermined the case for HS2 - by showing how easily people can work remotely, and how little business travel is really needed. Same dispute, new arguments. But now shovels are - officially - in the ground. The government has also defended itself against criticism that the new line will no longer be needed, as people travel less as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Shapps acknowledged more people are working at home, but said the government was looking at the country's long term transport needs: ""We're not building this for what happens over the next couple of years or even the next 10 years, whilst we're building it.  We're building this, as with the west coast and the east coast main lines, for 150 years and still going strong. ""I think it actually shows a lot of faith in the future of this country,"" he added. Packham loses bid for legal challenge over HS2 HS2 construction gets green light despite lockdown HS2 should proceed, says government review What is HS2 and why scrap the Manchester link?

"Bosses in charge of the coronavirus testing system have apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand. Some people are being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England, said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted the ""vast majority"" of people could still get appointments nearby. How do I get a coronavirus test? Testing and tracing 'key to schools returning' Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again The booking website is now prioritising high-risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted numbers of home testing kits and fewer booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said they were working hard to rectify the problem and a new lab facility would be opened in the coming weeks. By Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. But Prof Paul Hunter, a public health expert at the University of East Anglia, said these issues could act as a ""big disincentive to being tested"" and result in local increases being missed. David was offered a test in Blackburn when he lives in Suffolk David Llewellyntried to book a test on Sunday and was directed to a test centre near Blackburn - 250 miles and the other side of England from his home in Stowmarket, Suffolk. ""I thought I'd entered my home location incorrectly so went through the booking process again, only to get the same location for testing. Needless to say I have subsequently ordered a home testing kit, which despite three automated email reminders to take the test has yet to arrive. I'd do the test if I had it. I think it's ridiculous."" Lucy Evans lives in Pooleon the south coast. She was offered a test 220 miles away in Oldham and Blackburn. She tried again and was offered the Isle of Wight. ""I tried 14 times to get a test nearer and in the end had to get a home test as I ran out of time to get this done within five days. By the time I was tested my symptoms had disappeared."" Lucy tested negative for Covid on Tuesday. Lisa lives in Plymouthand tried to get a test for her 14-year-old son. She was offered a test 688 miles away in Inverness. ""People aren't going to travel all that way for a test are they? You'd just have to make stops along the way and could be spreading it around if you had the virus."" She eventually got a test locally and her son was negative. The government says the network of labs used to process tests has capacity to process 250,000 tests a day at the moment. Currently around 175,000 tests a day are being processed, which the government has said is more per head of population than many countries. But the government said it has faced problems because demand is not smooth - at weekends it drops and on weekdays there can be surges. Over the past month it has meant a backlog has developed, meaning the time taken to turnaround tests has been increasing. To curb demand, the availability of slots at testing centres have been reduced. The government said it has done this to ensure high risk areas, including care homes and towns with high rates of infections, can be prioritised for testing. The most recent data shows test results are now being provided more quickly, with the average turnaround time 24 hours or less for mobile testing units and local testing centres. It also said booking slots open up throughout the day so if people keep trying they should be able to get a more convenient location for a test, or order a home test. A new lab is also being opened near Loughborough at the end of the month that will be able to process 50,000 tests a day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there were some ""operational challenges"", but said the ""vast majority"" of people could get a test close to home. Mr Hancock also set out plans to pilot more rapid, easy-to-use tests. A Â£500m programme is under way to trial a range of different tests, including ones that use saliva (instead of nose and throat swabs) and tests that can be processed quickly, and sometimes on the spot - at the moment swab tests are sent off to labs to be processed. Repeat testing of members of the public will be tried out in Salford in Greater Manchester. Meanwhile, students and school pupils in Southampton will also be tested weekly in another study. The technologies open up the prospect of mass population testing which, if successful, could reduce the need for social distancing. Mr Hancock said: ""Short of a vaccine, this is the best chance we have of reducing social distancing whilst controlling the virus, especially with winter coming and all the challenges that brings."" But he refused to be drawn on a timescale for when this might become available, saying it was essential to see if they worked first. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances for virus tests, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient testing capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June - and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country. There's been an apology to those who were told to go 100 miles or more for a test. Officials acknowledge that resources are stretched and have to be targeted at areas with local outbreaks. But they point out that a new ""mega lab"" is set to come on stream in the east Midlands soon. They also argue that trials of new rapid testing techniques will be expanded, which could prove to be game-changers. For now though, the system is stretched, even though the official numbers suggest capacity is running ahead of demand. Questions will continue to be asked about whether the system can cope with challenges ahead, with schools returning and winter approaching.

"The children, aged between one and eight, were found in a family home The bodies of five children have been found in a flat in a large housing block in the western German city of Solingen, police say. Police say they suspect the 27-year-old mother of killing the children before attempting to take her own life at a train station in nearby DÃ¼sseldorf. Few details have been provided, with no information about the cause of death. Emergency services were called to the residential block in the Hasseldelle area of the city on Thursday afternoon. Responding to call at about 13:45 local time (11:45 GMT), police said they arrived at the building in Solingen, in North Rhine-Westphalia state, to discover the bodies of five children - three girls and two boys - aged from one to eight. A sixth child, reportedly an 11-year-old boy, was said to have survived. The children's grandmother, who lives 60km (37 miles) away in the city of MÃ¶nchengladbach, had alerted the emergency services, the German news website Bild reported. The entrance to the block of flats has been sealed off and forensic officers are at the scene Police spokesman Stefan Weiand said the children's mother had been ""seriously injured"" after throwing herself in front of a train in DÃ¼sseldorf and was being treated in hospital under police guard. ""Background and further details are not known at this point and that is what we are trying to find out,"" Mr Weiand told journalists, adding that police investigators were at the scene ""in full force"". Police said they were hoping to learn more about the ""incredibly tragic occurrence"" after speaking with the mother. The entrance to the block of flats in Solingen has been sealed off and images show police cars and ambulances lining the streets, with forensic officers also at the scene. A woman places a candle alongside a teddy at the residential building in Solingen, Germany The mayor of Solingen, Tim Kurzbach, wrote on Facebook that he had visited the housing block where ""this terrible act took place"" after hearing the news. ""For me it is still incomprehensible,"" he wrote in the post, adding: ""Today is a day of mourning for all of Solingen."" Later on Thursday, residents began leaving flowers and candles at the entrance to the building as a tribute.

"This video can not be played Rescuers remove rubble in the hope of finding someone alive Rescuers in Beirut are continuing to search through the rubble of a building amid reports a person could be alive, one month after a massive blast devastated the Lebanese capital. Specialist sensor equipment was sent to the Mar Mikhael area after unconfirmed reports that a heartbeat was detected. The search was initially suspended overnight, but volunteers continued to work by hand, reports say. At least 190 people died when 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate detonated. Some 300,000 people were left homeless by the blast on 4 August. How long can survivors last under rubble? There has been outrage that so much hazardous material was stored unsafely in a warehouse in the city's port, which lies close to many residential areas. The Lebanese government's resignation shortly afterwards failed to pacify protesters, who clashed with police in the city for several nights. In a separate development, four containers with 4.3 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were found on Thursday outside Beirut's seaport, the army said. It said its specialists examined the containers, but gave no further details. There are frequent calls for silence so that rescuers can listen for signs that someone is still alive Hopes were high on Thursday that a rescue team from Chile would find someone alive under the rubble before efforts were paused due to fears the building could collapse. On Friday Chilean and Lebanese workers continued removing rubble from the building where crowds have again gathered but the signs of life are diminishing. ""We have excavated rubble but we haven't reached a conclusion yet,"" George Abou Moussa of Lebanon's civil defence told AFP news agency. The pulse, first detected on Thursday, had slowed significantly on Friday, rescue coordinator Nicholas Saade told AFP. ""After removing the big chunks we scanned again for heartbeats or respiration, it showed low beat/respiration levels of seven per minute. The reading before was about 16 to 18,"" he said. Rescue workers said there may also be a dead body under the rubble of the building, reports Reuters news agency. One volunteer told CNN thatrescuers had detected a heartbeat signal at another location,externalunder the rubble. Mansour Al Asmat said that workers are certain a body was under the collapsed building, but that person may not be alive. The rescuers were passing the building on Wednesday night when their dog gave a sign there was a person alive inside. On returning on Thursday the dog went to the same place and gave the same sign. The group then used a scanner to search for a heartbeat or a breath from within, and came with equipment to dig down into the rubble. People at the scene are hoping for a miraculous story of survival The rescuers split into teams of seven to move the debris piece by piece, due to the risk of further damage. Every so often there were calls for silence so the rescue team could listen intently,the BBC's Orla Guerin reported from the scene,external. Red Cross staff set up a tent with floodlights and supplies, and army, fire service and volunteer rescuers are also on the scene. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Jacob Blake: Comparing Trump and Biden's Kenosha visits US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has spoken over the phone with Jacob Blake, the black man who was shot in the back by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, sparking big protests. Mr Blake, who remains in hospital paralysed, said ""he was not going to give up"" whether he walked again or not, Mr Biden said. He was speaking at a church meeting in  the city where the shooting took place. President Donald Trump visited Kenosha on Tuesday. The US leader surveyed areas damaged by the often violent protests that followed the shooting with messages of support for the police. Mr Biden departs Wilmington, Delaware, en route to Kenosha He did not meet Mr Blake's family, saying it was because they wanted lawyers present. Wisconsin is an important state in the upcoming presidential election. Mr Trump narrowly won it in 2016, and for decades the state has backed the eventual winner of the presidency whether Republican or Democrat. The president has been pushing a campaign message of ""law and order"". However, Mr Biden has accused Mr Trump of stoking racial division. Wisconsin's Governor, Tony Evers, said he would ""prefer that no-one be here, be it candidate Trump or candidate Biden"". By Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, Kenosha This was an important visit for Joe Biden. Some Black Lives Matter protesters in Kenosha had told us in recent days they had been disappointed that a senior Democrat had not come sooner and that the president got here first. Local Democrats had already been frustrated that after the party's national convention in neighbouring Milwaukee had been cancelled because of the pandemic, no socially distant events were planned there as a replacement. The backdrop is the tight margin by which Donald Trump won this state in 2016. Biden supporters came out in small groups to gather outside events he held at a church and a school chanting ""Let's go Joe!"" and ""Dump Trump!"" His appearances were low key, even sombre. It was not what he said but who he met that made the headlines. Praise from the family of Jacob Blake about the compassion he showed in speaking with them would have been exactly what his campaign team would have hoped for. And at a community event representatives of law enforcement agencies were present alongside activists and business owners who had feared looting and damage, illustrating the message of unity and healing that Joe Biden has been trying to send. But in a telling statement at that event, one Black Lives Matter organiser asked when all those words would turn into actions. Joe Biden and his wife met Mr Blake's relatives at Milwaukee airport, with Mr Blake on the phone. The meeting was private but Mr Biden and the Blake family lawyer later gave details. Mr Biden said he was struck by the family's ""overwhelming sense of resilience and optimism"". What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting Two incidents, two different police responses Mr Blake ""talked about how nothing was going to defeat him, how whether he walked again or not, he was not going to give up,"" Mr Biden said. Confirming the meeting, the family's lawyer Ben Crump said it was ""engaging"" and that the family ""was very impressed that the Bidens were so engaged and willing to really listen"". At the community meeting in Kenosha, Mr Biden attacked President Trump's leadership, and argued that the US was at an ""inflection point"" in its history. He also quipped ""they'll shoot me"" if he explained a policy at length, a comment quickly picked up on by conservative media, given Mr Biden's record for making gaffes. The US president toured rubble from burned buildingsand met police representatives when he visited on Tuesday. ""These are not acts of peaceful protest but, really, domestic terror,"" Mr Trump said, later adding: ""We have to condemn the dangerous anti-police rhetoric."" He expressed sympathy for those hurt in confrontations with police, saying he felt ""terribly for anybody who goes through that"". But he said he did not believe there was systemic racism in law enforcement. This video can not be played Trump on police: 'They choke sometimes' Mr Trump's campaign manager Bill Stepien told Fox News that Mr Biden's visit was inappropriate. ""The president was there earlier in the week as the president of the United States. Vice-President Biden is there today as a candidate, as a political candidate,"" he said. Anthony Davis, the president of the local chapter of the NAACP civil rights group, told NBC that he opposed both men's visit. ""I said that Kenosha would welcome them any other time,"" he said. ""But things here are fragile. And we, in this community, really need to put our energy into healing ourselves, sitting down and speaking in detail only the way that locals can."" A police officer shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back during an arrest as the 29-year-old tried to get into a car where his three children were seated. Mr Biden has called for the officer who shot him in the back to be arrested. ""He believes that, based on everything he has seen, charges appear warranted, but that there should be a full investigation to ensure all the facts are known first,"" his campaign said ahead of the trip. In an interview on Wednesday, Attorney General Bill Barr said the situation was different to that of George Floyd, whose death in March triggered global protests. ""Floyd was already subdued, incapacitated in handcuffs and was not armed,"" Mr Barr said. ""In the Jacob case, he was in the midst of committing a felony and he was armed."" Mr Blake was not armed when he was shot, but a knife was later found in his car by investigators. Two people protesting against the shooting of Mr Blake were killed in Kenosha amid widespread looting and vandalism.A 17-year-old has been charged over the deaths.

"Alexei Navalny is Russia's best-known anti-corruption campaigner A top ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that the EU risks becoming irrelevant if it fails to act against Russia over the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny. Norbert RÃ¶ttgen said a major gas deal with Russia must now be reconsidered. The Russian government has been widely condemned after Germany confirmed on Wednesday that Mr Navalny had been poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He is gravely ill in intensive care in Berlin's CharitÃ© hospital. Mr Navalny was flown to the German capital after collapsing in pain on a flight in Siberia on 20 August. His supporters believe poison was put in his tea at Tomsk airport. Mr RÃ¶ttgen, chair of the German parliament's foreign affairs committee, demanded a tough EU response in the Navalny case. Novichok is an extremely toxic, military-grade weapon that experts say must have come from a state facility. ""Now, again, we are brutally confronted with the reality of the Putin regime, which treats people with contempt,"" Mr RÃ¶ttgen told German public broadcaster ARD. He noted that President Vladimir Putin had projected Russian power in Syria, Libya and Belarus, and said: ""The question is, are the Europeans always going to end up doing nothing? If so, then we'll become irrelevant, we won't be taken seriously."" 'Novichok poisoning' is a test for the West What are Novichok agents and what do they do? Navalny and Russiaâs arsenal of exotic poisons Members of the Nato defence alliance will discuss the poisoning at a special meeting on Friday. Mrs Merkel earlier said Mr Navalny was a victim of attempted murder and the world would look to Russia for answers. She said there would be an ""appropriate joint response"" by the EU and Nato, describing the poisoning of Mr Navalny as ""an attack on the fundamental values and basic rights to which we are committed"". The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said poisoning someone with a nerve agent ""is considered a use of chemical weapons"". It called the alleged attack ""a matter of grave concern"" and pledged to help any state that asks for its help. The Kremlin has not accepted the diagnosis in Germany, saying it has not seen German data on Mr Navalny's condition. ""There are no grounds to accuse the Russian state,"" Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for President Putin, told reporters, adding that Germany and other EU nations should not ""hurry with their assessments"". Mr RÃ¶ttgen warned that Germany would risk becoming dependent on Russia by completing Nord Stream 2, a controversial 1,225km (760-mile) gas pipeline owned by Russia's Gazprom. He also warned that doing so would encourage Mr Putin to ignore Western protestations over the Navalny case and other attacks on his political opponents. Mr RÃ¶ttgen is a candidate to succeed Mrs Merkel as chancellor next year. On Tuesday Mrs Merkel reiterated her wish to see Nord Stream 2 completed. This video can not be played Gas wars: The problem with Nord Stream 2 President Donald Trump has imposed sanctions on any firm that helps Gazprom to complete the project. However, his critics are asking why he has not commented on the targeting of Mr Navalny. His rival in the presidential race,Joe Biden, accused the Kremlin,externalof ""an outrageous and brazen attempt on Mr Navalny's life"". ""Donald Trump has refused to confront Putin, calling him a 'terrific person',"" Mr Biden said. Mr Navalny was flown to Berlin on an emergency flight from Omsk in Siberia Mr Navalny was put into a medically induced coma after falling ill. His team says he was poisoned on President Putin's orders. The Kremlin has dismissed the allegation. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Navalnyâs team sees Kremlin behind attack A team of German specialists has found ""unequivocal proof"" that a Novichok nerve agent was used. The CharitÃ© hospital says it expects Mr Navalny's recovery to take a long time and cannot rule out long-term after-effects, but the agent's blockage of his cholinesterase enzyme is declining. On Wednesday the Kremlin spokesman called on Germany for a full exchange of information and foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova complained the Novichok allegations were not backed up by evidence. Novichok has been in the news before. It was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in 2018. While they survived, a British woman later died in hospital. The UK accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack. In a co-ordinated move, 20 countries expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats and spies. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the latest attack,externalas ""outrageous"". ""The Russian government must now explain what happened to Mr Navalny - we will work with international partners to ensure justice is done,"" he tweeted. The EU has demanded a ""transparent"" investigation by the Russian government. ""Those responsible must be brought to justice,""a statement read,external. The US National Security Council (NSC) said the suspected poisoning was ""completely reprehensible"". ""We will work with allies and the international community to hold those in Russia accountable, wherever the evidence leads, and restrict funds for their malign activities,""an NSC spokesman said,external. Alexei Navalny is a name President Putin refuses to say out loud. It's an attempt to diminish his political significance, but the endless prosecutions, police detentions and giant fines Mr Navalny has faced over the years tell a different story about his impact. He's certainly annoyed a lot of people, from those targeted by his anti-corruption investigations to Vladimir Putin himself. So it is possible someone wanted to resolve the ""Navalny problem"" for good. The timing is largely irrelevant. Why now? Well, why not. But if whoever did this hoped to contain the fallout - a mysterious collapse, never explained by Russian doctors - the fact Navalny's team got him to Germany has blown that calculation. The ""collapse"" is now a deliberate attack, and a major international scandal. The Kremlin response so far is familiar: deny, obfuscate, demand proof. Mr Putin's spokesman has even hinted that if Mr Navalny had been poisoned, then it must have happened in Germany because doctors here detected nothing suspicious. Expect to hear a lot more along those lines in the days to come.

"Eyewitnesses say the paddle steamer struck the pier A total of 24 people have been injured after the paddle steamer Waverley collided with Brodick Pier in Arran. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said ""a number have been taken to hospital"" following the incident. People stranded in Arran were later due to be returned to the mainland by an emergency sailing of a CalMac ferry. Police, paramedics, coastguards and rescue helicopters were scrambled to the scene after the alarm was raised at about 17:15 on Thursday. MCA said 213 passengers and 26 crew were on board the vessel when it struck the pier. Waverley finally sets sail after two years 'Save the Waverley' appeal launched Cruises cancelled after Waverley crash One passenger, Graham McWilliams, told BBC Scotland'sThe Nineabout the moment of collision. He said: ""As we came into the pier, everything seemed quite normal. ""Then there was a sudden crash, a loud bang, and the boat stopped very quickly. I saw people falling and it was quite distressing."" This video can not be played Waverley crash: 'I saw one lady fly past the window' He added: ""There was a lady that I saw who literally flew past the window."" Mr McWilliams said that, several hours after the accident, passengers were still milling about the ferry terminal at Brodick. He said it was unclear if they would be able to leave the island or whether accommodation could be found for them. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson later tweeted to sayarrangements had been made for CalMac to operate an emergency sailing,externalto take the Waverley passengers back to the mainland. Rita McLeod, who was waiting to board the Waverley, said she saw people being taken away in ambulances. ""We were actually queued up waiting to get in when it crashed,"" she said. ""It came in bow first. It came in far too fast."" ""We saw a lot of people falling, a few people fell over. There were people taken away in ambulances. ""We saw a lot of people, pretty badly shaken, coming off."" The ship was due to into Brodick at about 17.00 after leaving Greenock in the morning. A fire engine and other emergency services were visible from the terminal building Another eyewitness saw the crash from the departure terminal as she waited to board. Anne Cochrane from Bishopbriggs near Glasgow, said: ""It just crashed into the pier when it was coming back from the Holy Isle. We're just stuck in the departure terminal. We've had no information."" The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has been informed of the incident. The Waverley has just returned to service after undergoing repairs The Waverleyset sail for the first time in two years less than two weeks ago, an event which was itself delayed due to an ""unexpected technical and administration issue"". The ship, described as the world's last seagoing paddle steamer, missed the 2019 season as it waited for urgent repairs. A funding appeal was launched in June 2019 and it hit its target in December after receiving a Â£1m grant from the Scottish government to help with the restoration. This paddle steamer, built by A & J Inglis of Glasgow and first launched in October 1946, has been involved in accidents before. It struck the breakwater at Dunoon with 700 passengers on board, 12 of whom suffered minor injuries, in June 2009 In July 1977 it was badly damaged when it struck rocks near Dunoon. In 2017, it was involved in another incidentwhen it crashed into the pier at Rothesay.

"The Mansion House is available to rent online Police have launched an investigation after more than 300 people attended a party at a house in Midlothian. Officers were called to The Mansion House of Kirkhill in Gorebridge at 00:20 on Sunday.

Organisers have been accused of showing ""blatant disregard"" for rules aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the incident as ""utterly irresponsible"" and urged people not to attend house parties. The 12-bedroom property is said to be able to sleep up to 34 guests and is advertised on Airbnb for Â£1,600 a night - although the company said it had not been booked through them. In a statementpublished on Facebook,external, the owners of the property said the man who made the booking for the entire weekend ""seemed very pleasant"". ""We were then sadly as owners contacted at 1.30am Sunday morning by our old neighbours to say there was a huge rave and police were in attendance,"" they added.

The Midlothian party was one of about 300 reported to police across the country last weekend, with officers issuing about ten fixed penalties in total. Five of those were issued after officers were called to a house party in Kirkintilloch, East Dunbartonshire, at about 20:00 on Saturday. Two men were also arrested in connection with a fight at the property. Alison McCallum, director of public health at NHS Lothian said: ""We must continue to help prevent the spread of coronavirus which is why it is critical we don't socialise in the same way we did in pre-Covid times.

"A County Fermanagh man has been fined Â£1,000 for breaching Covid-19 travel rules - the first person in NI to be sanctioned in this way. It is understood he went out socialising in Enniskillen on Sunday after returning from holiday in Spain, before later testing positive. Police confirmed the fine was issued on Tuesday. It comes as it emerged 23 prohibition notices have been issued to bars since they were allowed to reopen on 3 July. The notices are issued if a premises breaks coronavirus regulations, and mean the business must rectify the breaches identified by police. It does not necessarily mean a premises has to close. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said the notices were served at premises across all counties in Northern Ireland, and had been issued between 8 July and 2 September. Bars with outside areas are able to serve alcohol on a table-service basis, while inside alcohol has to be served along with a meal, also on a table-service basis. FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:What tests are available? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? At the end of August Health Minister Robin Swann said there had been a ""blatant disregard"" for the regulations by somein the hospitality sector. The reopening date for indoor pubs which only serve alcohol, theatres and private members' clubs has been pushed back dueto the rise in cases of the virus. Anyone travelling to Northern Ireland from countries not onthe so-called green list of exemptions,externalis required to self-isolate for two weeks on arrival. Countries exempt from self-isolation requirements,external It is understood the man who was fined had recently returned from the Balearic Islands, as first reported by the Belfast Telegraph. ACC Alan Todd said the management of Covid-19 travel rules was a matter for UK Border Force, and police acted on its recommendation about potential breaches. He said police would also ""act on any significant concerns raised by members of the public"". ""As always, our approach remains to engage, explain and encourage and, only where necessary, enforce,"" he said. ""Everyone needs to continue to follow the government's guidance to help suppress the transmission of the virus and support our NHS."" He added it was ""encouraging to see"" that there had been a high level of compliance with the mandatory quarantine on travellers to Northern Ireland. Could police fine me for exercising?

"This video can not be played Tony Blair: âPeople give a lot more information probably to their supermarkets than they will to the government.â Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has said it is ""common sense to move in the direction of digital IDs"" as part of efforts to fight coronavirus. Mr Blair said there should be a record kept by the government of those vaccinated against the virus. The government recently set out plans to change laws to enable the use of digital identity across the UK. As prime minister, Mr Blair launched a compulsory ID card scheme, but it was scrapped by the coalition government. We need to learn to live with virus, says Blair Drug firms GSK and Sanofi in Covid vaccine trial NHS app paves the way for 'immunity passports' Speaking to theBBC's Newscast podcast,he said that once a coronavirus vaccine is in use ""you're going to want a record of the fact you've been vaccinated"". ""You'll want a record kept by the government of who's been vaccinated - this will be essential, again, to restoring confidence,"" he added. The former PM argued that improvements in technology meant privacy issues ""can be dealt with"". ""You don't need a large amount of information,"" he said adding: ""People give a lot more information to their supermarkets than they do to the government."" Tony Blair faced protests against ID cards Responding to Mr Blair's comments, Silkie Carlo, Director of Big Brother Watch - a civil liberties campaign group - said: ""The idea of digital ID and vaccination checks could easily lead to a health apartheid that few would expect of a democratic country. ""Digital IDs would lead to sensitive records spanning medical, work, travel, and biometric data about each and every one of us being held at the fingertips of authorities and state bureaucrats. ""This dangerous plan would normalise identity checks, increase state control over law abiding citizens and create a honey pot for cybercriminals."" Mr Blair's comments come after the government announced plans to update existing laws on identity checking to allow digital identity ""to be used as widely as possible"". It is does not propose resurrecting the ID card scheme, but is ""exploring how secure checks could be made against government data,""according to the government announcement,external. Digital Infrastructure Minister Matt Warman said: ""Digital technology is helping us through the pandemic and continues to improve the way we live, work and access vital services. ""We want to make it easier for people to prove their identity securely online so transactions can become even quicker - it has the potential to add billions to our economy."" Mr Blair was a keen advocate of ID cards for all UK citizens, as a way of combating terrorism after 9/11, but it was later billed as an ""entitlement card"" to combat benefit fraud and illegal workers. The former PM hasargued since leaving officethat ID cards are the only way to combat illegal immigration. The ID card scheme began its rollout in November 2009, under Gordon Brown's premiership, but was scrapped in 2010 by the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition government which saw it as an infringement of civil liberties. During his interview with Newscast, Mr Blair also argued that coronavirus quarantine policies were ""killing"" international travel. He said he didn't think the 14 day quarantine period for those returning from certain countries abroad was ""necessary"". ""The question is not how you eliminate the risk, it is how you contain it,"" he added. Mr Blair also said it was a ""mystery"" to him why there hadn't been a more coordinated international effort to tackle the virus. ""I honestly don't understand the reason for that not happening,"" he said. Speaking of poorer countries in Africa, he said: ""They can't do lockdown, it's just not possible, but as a result of the global crisis they're facing real food security problems, real supply problems."" On vaccines, he said he hoped we ""do not end up in a situation where wealthy countries get the vaccines and poor countries are scrabbling for them. This wouldn't just be morally wrong, it would be totally against our own interests"".

"Two-year-old Grace tested negative for coronavirus after attending a centre in Cardiff A father says he was asked to travel more than 200 miles to get a Covid-19 test for his unwell toddler. TV presenter Will Millard used theUK government website,externalon 27 August after his daughter Grace, two, developed a high temperature. Mr Millard, from Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, was offered a test in Blackburn, Lancashire, before his health board booked a test in Cardiff. The UK government has said areas with outbreaks are being made a priority. The 37-year-old said: ""I didn't think she had coronavirus but the rules are dead clear - if someone has a temperature then you get a test."" He added he was keen for her to be tested as his father, who had been shielding, was due to visit and health visitors were also due to visit his new baby son. People sent long distances for Covid tests 'Add upset stomach in children to symptoms' Schools in Wales return to a 'new normal' He was surprised when told the closest available test was so far away: ""I thought it was a mistake,"" he said. ""I assumed there was something wrong with the website so I rang 111, who directed me to 119 but they said they were getting the same. ""I said 'can you post me one' and they said there were no postal tests available."" Will Millard says he found the experience had ""frustrating"" He decided totweet Public Health Wales,externalabout his predicament. ""I noticed on Twitter there were people from Bristol complaining they had been sent to Cardiff for their test,"" he said. He continued searching and at 17:00 was offered a test in Nottingham, and at about 20:00 he found a test in Weston-Super-Mare in Somerset, which he booked. Then Fiona Kinghorn, executive director of Cardiff and Vale health board, contacted him on Twitter and arranged for him to go to one of the community testing centres in Cardiff the next day. ""We turned up at 09:05 and had test result by 16:50 that night. It couldn't have been easier."" His daughter's test came back negative. Testing in priority areas has led to shortages elsewhere ""The government are putting a lot of pressure on people to follow the rules,"" he said. ""People can go to do the right thing but if the government aren't keeping up their end of the bargain - you can't expect people to get in the car with a sick child and drive to Manchester."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""The UK government experienced a spike in demand for testing through their lighthouse labs over the weekend, which led to reduced capacity for processing tests across the UK. ""The UK government has assured us they are working on increasing capacity and expect these issues to be resolved shortly."" The UK government has said prioritising coronavirus testing in high-risk areas hasled to shortages in other places, leading to some people with symptoms being asked to drive more than 100 miles for a swab. It said areas with fewer Covid-19 cases have had their testing capacity reduced to cope with outbreaks elsewhere. But Paul Hunter, a public health expert at the University of East Anglia, said these issues could act as ""big disincentive to being tested"" and result in missing local increases ""early enough to maybe stop more widespread infection"". People in Wales, like the rest of the UK, can make a booking for a coronavirus test at a drive-through centre or a mobile unit.

"This video can not be played ""When it comes to the law I feel let down"" A dentist who was secretly stalked by a disgruntled patient for nearly four years says he feels ""let down by the law"" after learning the man will be released from prison within weeks. Thomas Baddeley, 42, was arrested within a mile of Ian Hutchinson's home in Monmouthshire. He had what prosecutors called a ""murder kit"", including a crossbow. He got an indefinite restraining order but faced a lesser charge because his victim was unaware he had been stalked. Baddeley was spotted in November 2019 by a concerned passer-by in his car, wearing a balaclava. Police found a large knife, a crossbow with bolts, black ski mask, bleach and a hammer in his Citroen. His car seats were covered in plastic sheeting. Tom Baddeley started stalking Ian Hutchinson before his treatment ended Baddeley, 42, had been treated by Dr Hutchinson at his former Bristol dental practice from 2012 to 2016. He had some teeth removed and was fitted with braces. But he was unhappy and claimed the treatment was poisoning him. When the treatment ended in early 2016, Dr Hutchinson expected a complaint but it never came and he heard nothing further from Baddeley. But documents found by police in Baddeley's home in Montpelier, Bristol, and in his car revealed he had been following Dr Hutchinson since a few months before his treatment ended, including detailed plans leading up to something he described as ""the event"". Police searching Baddeley's car last November This is what police found: ""Surveillance logs"" detailing Dr Hutchinson's personal and professional movements over the ensuing years They showed Baddeley had followed him to his Chepstow practice, to dental conferences and courses around the UK Baddeley purchased then abandoned about 30 different cars in a bid to evade detection as he conducted ""systematic surveillance"" of his victim Notes planning for ""the event"" included the location of CCTV cameras, how not to leave fingerprints and how to answer police questions Baddeley was jailed for 16 months at Cardiff Crown Court in August after admitting stalking without fear, alarm or distress, and two offences of possessing offensive weapons. An indefinite restraining order was imposed, including a ban on entering parts of Monmouthshire, with Baddeley facing up to five years' imprisonment if he breaches it. Judge Jeremy Jenkins told him: ""I am in no doubt you intended to cause some harm to Dr Hutchinson. ""It is difficult to envisage a more serious case than this of its kind."" But Baddeley avoided a longer jail term because the law stipulates a victim must be aware they are being stalked. As Dr Hutchinson was unaware, prosecutors had no option but to impose a lesser charge. Dr Hutchinson, 52, has been told Baddeley is likely to be released from prison on licence in the coming weeks, due to time served on remand. In his victim impact statement to the court, Dr Hutchinson said: ""I believe I will be looking over my shoulder expecting Baddeley to be nearby for the rest of my life."" In an exclusive interview, he told BBC Wales he had been ""to hell and back"" as a result of the case and felt in a state of ""constant threat"". The severity of the situation came home to him when undercover police arrived unexpectedly at his surgery, warning he would be taken to a ""safe house"" if Baddeley was released on bail pending the court case. ""When he gets released, I'll get a warning,"" said Dr Hutchinson, a former chairman of the British Lingual Orthodontic Society, who teaches dentistry throughout the UK. ""They've reassured me that the restraining order is very thorough, but at the end of the day it's simply a piece of paper."" Dr Hutchinson has implemented security measures at his home and dental practice since the case. ""I've got my team to look after my patients,"" he said. ""The police just turn around and say 'we really recommend you change your name, move, and change jobs'. ""I've spent over 20 years refining, learning, now I'm passing it on to others by teaching and I can't just simply disappear - I can't just change everything."" Dr Hutchinson said he now fears after Baddeley's ""slap on the wrists"" that something more will happen. ""I'm constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel as though he knows everything about me and my family and there's nothing we can do about it,"" he said. ""It's altered both my personal life and professional life, and it won't be the same again."" Prosecuting barrister Nigel Fryer told the court that, while there was no specific reference to murder in the notebooks found in his home and car, there was ""strong circumstantial evidence"" that this was what ""the event"" was referring to. When asked about this during police interviews, Baddeley replied ""no comment"". Mr Fryer told BBC Wales that Baddeley's true motive ""remains a mystery"". ""I've been in practice for 21 years now and I have never come across a case like this,"" he said. ""It was extremely unusual, because ordinarily the perpetrator of an offence like this will derive satisfaction from making the victim's life hell - they will be very visible - but this is almost a unique case where someone is the complete opposite, who doesn't wish to be seen and went to such detailed and meticulous ways to cover his tracks. ""In interview, he said the satisfaction he got was from knowing he was watching Dr Hutchinson, but he didn't knowâ¦ that was the kick that he got out of it."" The fact that his victim was unaware meant Baddeley could not be charged with a more serious stalking offence, which would carry a maximum jail term of 10 years. Dr Hutchinson said: ""When it comes to the law, I do feel let downâ¦ it's the shoulder shrug, 'sorry, there's a loophole, nothing more we can do'. ""I'm just left there hung out to dry thinking, 'how am I going to manage this?' ""The charges, I feel, are a complete mockery. This was a blatant attempt at kidnap or murder and it was purely by good luck that I was late home and it didn't happen. ""I think the law needs to be changedâ¦ we need more protection from people like this."" 'Police commissioners must fund stalking victim support' New order for stalker investigations has 'teeth' 'When he's not in prison, I'm a wreck' Mr Fryer said while he had ""the utmost sympathy"" for Dr Hutchinson, it had proved ""impossible"" to charge Baddeley with a more serious offence, based on the facts of the case and the available evidence. ""The various charges were looked atâ¦ and the conclusion was reached that this was the correct charge within the law as it currently stands,"" he added. Dr Jane Monckton-Smith, a forensic criminologist and stalking expert at the University of Gloucester, said the damage to Dr Hutchinson was ""inestimable"" and the case highlighted gaps in current legislation. ""I think our stalking legislation has been problematic from the beginning because there is no real strict legal definition of what stalking isâ¦ and when you get a case like this you really come up against some of those problems,"" she said. ""One thing the legislation tells us is that to get the highest sentence, which reflects the most dangerous stalking, the victim has to have been frightened or alarmed, or at the very least harassed, by the behaviour, they have to have been frightened of violence. ""And of course in this case, the threat to the victim was really off the scale, but because he didn't know, it's almost treated in the criminal justice system as if it was a lesser offence. ""Once he'd been told (about the stalking) his whole relationship with safety changed in that second, because he then realised he'd been in danger, potentially, all this time."" Dr Monckton-Smith called for a system of multi-agency monitoring for stalking offenders on their release from prison. ""We need to have processes in place thatâ¦ stalk the stalker,"" she said. ""If we're not going to give them long jail sentences where they can get the treatment some of them need, then we need to be monitoring them and tracking them and making sure they don't continue to stalk and harass their victims."" In a statement, the Home Office said: ""Stalking is a distressing crime and we're determined to tackle it. ""We introduced Stalking Protection Orders in January, which protect victims and address the perpetrator's behaviour at the earliest opportunity. We've also doubled the maximum sentences for stalking and harassment to 10 years. ""Stalkers are closely monitored by the probation service and police and if there is concern about their risk to the public they can be recalled to prison. Victims are also informed about the stalker's licence conditions in advance of their release.""

"Tim Davie took over as director general on Tuesday The BBC's new director general has said he doesn't support any switch from the licence fee to a subscription service. In his first speech since taking over, Tim Davie said such a change ""would make us just another media company""  that serves only ""the few"". But he told staff there must be ""a radical shift in our focus"" so everyone gets value from the licence fee. He warned that the BBC currently faces a ""significant risk"" and has ""no inalienable right to exist"". He said: ""If current trends continue, we will not feel indispensable enough to all our audience. We must evolve to protect what we cherish."" The licence fee is currently guaranteed until 2027, but there is a debate about the BBC's funding beyond that. Do I need a TV licence and what does it pay for? The Gavin and Stacey Christmas special was the most-watched programme of 2019 ""For the avoidance of doubt, I do not want a subscription BBC that serves the few,"" Davie said during the speech in Cardiff. ""We could make a decent business out of it, and I suspect it could do quite well in certain postcodes, but it would make us just another media company serving a specific group."" Describing the BBC as ""a brilliant national success"", he said: ""We all recognise when someone says, 'I would pay my licence fee for Radio 4, for Strictly, or for the website'. ""But this kind of connection is under pressure and cannot be taken for granted. Across the UK, across all political views, across all of society, and across all age groups, people must feel their BBC is here for them, not for us."" That would not be achieved by beating rivals at their own game, but by being ""more rather than less BBC, more distinctive, and committed to our unique public service mission"", he explained. The top priority would be to ""renew our commitment to impartiality"", he said. Impartiality is ""the very essence of who we are"" and is possible to achieve even in polarised times. ""It is not simply about left or right. This is more about whether people feel we see the world from their point of view. Our research shows that too many perceive us to be shaped by a particular perspective."" He added: ""If you want to be an opinionated columnist or a partisan campaigner on social media then that is a valid choice, but you should not be working at the BBC."" New social media guidelines for presenters and staff will be ""rigorously enforced"", he said. Davie also said: The BBC has tried to compete with rivals ""by making more and spreading ourselves too thinly"". It should focus on ""unique, high-impact work that is loved, including by those who feel more distant from us"" and make ""more impact by making less"". He ruled out shutting TV channels or radio networks in the short term - but said he would ""not hesitate to close channels if they do not offer value to our audiences"". There will be staff cuts to make ""a simpler, leaner organisation"". He said there is ""still too much bureaucracy"", so he will ""remove unnecessary committees and meetings"" and ""keep a focus on cost reduction"". He said he regretted that the BBC had ""not gone further to create a more diverse and inclusive"" organisation. He pledged to make sure it ""reflects more accurately the society we serve"" in terms of gender, race, disability, socioeconomic status and sexuality. Other priorities are to extract more value from online services and increase commercial income. ""Value for all"", the phrase Tim Davie says will define his tenure as DG, is clever. ""Value"" is a commercial idea, and therefore alludes to his background in the private sector and the ferocious competition the BBC faces globally today. And ""all"" connotes the idea of a universal public service. In three words, that phrase captures both Davie's heritage and challenge, and the ""enlightened blend"", to borrow his phrase, of free market and public service sensibilities he embodies. Print headlines will likely focus on his warning shot, especially but not exclusively to those on air, about impartiality. He thinks social media activism and column-writing don't mix with working for the BBC. The big, as yet unanswered, question is whether he will clamp down on the tweeting of BBC contributors who don't work for BBC News, such as Gary Lineker. Davie is undoubtedly energetic and decisive, and of the two dozen staff I've spoken to in the past 24 hours, there was unanimous excitement and positive feeling. But as he himself acknowledged, talking about change is easy. Actually delivering it in a post-pandemic world is very hard. He'll be judged on the latter. After his speech, Davie was interviewed by BBC head of creative diversity June Sarpong, who later described his vision for ""a truly inclusive BBC"" as ""a daunting and difficult task but one he is committed to achieving"".

He also appeared to suggest that MSPs who have spoken out against him could be replaced by some ""new blood"". Four Scottish Labour MSPs haveopenly calledon Mr Leonard to resign, with shadow cabinet minister Rachel Reeves saying he should ""consider his position"". Fourth MSP calls for Scottish Labour leader to quit In an interview with Sky News, Ms Reeves said opinion polls in Scotland were ""dire"" for Labour despite the party appearing to be neck-and-neck with the Conservatives across the UK as a whole. The shadow Cabinet Secretary urged Mr Leonard to ""consider his position and do what he thinks is right for Scotland and for Scottish Labour"". A group of Labour peers and grandees - Helen Liddell, Meta Ramsay, George Robertson and George Foulkes - have also issued a statement urging him to ""do what is best for the party, and for the country"". Labour leader Keir Starmer has said the issue was one for Scottish Labour, and insisted that he and Mr Leonard had a ""very good working relationship"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says he had a âvery good working relationshipâ with Richard Leonard In the latest in a series of BBC Scotland interviews with party leaders, Mr Leonard said he ""of course"" took some responsibility for the position Scottish Labour found itself in. But he said the party was much wider than the group of MSPs who have called on him to quit and insisted he still had the support of the party as a whole. He said: ""Anybody who comes under criticism has a period of reflection, but I am absolutely convinced that I am the best person to lead the Scottish Labour Party into those elections. ""I cannot see anybody, at the moment, who I think would make a better leader of the Scottish Labour Party."" Mr Leonard went on to say that he did not believe his critics could trigger a leadership contest - but insisted he would stand against anyone who did challenge him. And with the party having five leaders in the six years before he was elected to replace Kezia Dugdale in 2017, he said that ditching the leader when things were not going well ""does not work"" for Scottish Labour. Labour MP Rachel Reeves said Scottish opinion polls were ""dire"" for the party Mr Leonard also said party members would have a choice about which candidates they wanted to see at the top of its regional lists for the election. He added: ""I am keen to see some fresh blood in, and to be honest with you the last 36 hours have really persuaded me that we need some new voices, we need greater diversity, we need some new blood and new energy in that parliamentary group. ""I think that could only benefit the long term future of Scottish Labour."" Me Leonard is seen as a close ally of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Mr Leonard said he was ""absolutely committed"" to ensuring the party achieved gender balance after the election, and was ""seriously considering"" whether to have female candidates at the top of every regional list. He also said he was confident that the pandemic meant people ""re-evaluate their priorities"" ahead of the election, and would turn to Scottish Labour because of its focus on ""recovering the economy, tackling the jobs crisis and investing in public services like our National Health Service"". There have been concerns about Mr Leonard's leadership from some senior party figures ever since he was elected to the role. Opinion polls suggest Scottish Labour is trailing a distant third behind the SNP and Scottish Conservatives ahead of the election next May. The partyslumped to fifthin last year's European elections after winning just 9.3% of the votes - down from 26% in the previous election in 2014 - and lost all but one of its seats in last year's general election.

There are fears from pro-UK campaigners that another poor performance by Labour in next year's Holyrood election would increase the chances of the SNP winning a majority - and potentially lead to a second independence referendum. Those concerns led to James Kelly resigning as Scottish Labour's justice spokesman earlier this week, saying he had no confidence in Mr Leonard's leadership. Social security spokesman Mark Griffin also quit, with backbenchers Jenny Marra and Daniel Johnson adding their voices to calls for Mr Leonard to go. Mr Leonard says he has received messages of support from across the party, with Scottish Labour MSP Neil Findlay tweeting that the colleagues who were calling for his head were ""pathetic"" and guilty of ""treachery with a snarl"". In his BBC Scotland interview, Mr Leonard said the question of whether indyref2 should happen if the SNP wins a majority was ""hypothetical"" and he did not accept that ""we are going to lose the election and the SNP will romp to victory"". But he said the priority for the next Scottish government should be about ""turning around the economy and creating jobs"" after the pandemic rather than ""constitutional bickering"". He added: ""There are hundreds of thousands of people across Scotland who will be losing their jobs because the job retention scheme is coming to an end at the end of October. ""There are people who are losing sleep at night, anxious about what their future is and what the future for their families is. ""These are big concerns that people have got and that is what I want to focus our attention on."" Mr Leonard predicted that the mood of the country would change before May, and the Scottish government would face a ""reckoning"" over how it had handled the pandemic. He described the high number of coronavirus deaths in the country's care homes as a ""scandal"". And he said the government had questions to answer over the guidance it had issued and ""whether or not they violated the human rights of people simply by dint of the fact that they were old and they were in residential care"". Mr Leonard also called for an independent judge-led inquiry which would be based in Scotland and would examine the Scottish government's response to the pandemic. He said this could examine questions such as why Scotland did not go into lockdown sooner than it did, which he said could have saved many lives.

"Eyewitnesses say the paddle steamer struck the pier A total of 24 people have been injured after the paddle steamer Waverley collided with Brodick Pier in Arran. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said ""a number have been taken to hospital"" following the incident. People stranded in Arran were later due to be returned to the mainland by an emergency sailing of a CalMac ferry. Police, paramedics, coastguards and rescue helicopters were scrambled to the scene after the alarm was raised at about 17:15 on Thursday. MCA said 213 passengers and 26 crew were on board the vessel when it struck the pier. Waverley finally sets sail after two years 'Save the Waverley' appeal launched Cruises cancelled after Waverley crash One passenger, Graham McWilliams, told BBC Scotland'sThe Nineabout the moment of collision. He said: ""As we came into the pier, everything seemed quite normal. ""Then there was a sudden crash, a loud bang, and the boat stopped very quickly. I saw people falling and it was quite distressing."" This video can not be played Waverley crash: 'I saw one lady fly past the window' He added: ""There was a lady that I saw who literally flew past the window."" Mr McWilliams said that, several hours after the accident, passengers were still milling about the ferry terminal at Brodick. He said it was unclear if they would be able to leave the island or whether accommodation could be found for them. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson later tweeted to sayarrangements had been made for CalMac to operate an emergency sailing,externalto take the Waverley passengers back to the mainland. Rita McLeod, who was waiting to board the Waverley, said she saw people being taken away in ambulances. ""We were actually queued up waiting to get in when it crashed,"" she said. ""It came in bow first. It came in far too fast."" ""We saw a lot of people falling, a few people fell over. There were people taken away in ambulances. ""We saw a lot of people, pretty badly shaken, coming off."" The ship was due to into Brodick at about 17.00 after leaving Greenock in the morning. A fire engine and other emergency services were visible from the terminal building Another eyewitness saw the crash from the departure terminal as she waited to board. Anne Cochrane from Bishopbriggs near Glasgow, said: ""It just crashed into the pier when it was coming back from the Holy Isle. We're just stuck in the departure terminal. We've had no information."" The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has been informed of the incident. The Waverley has just returned to service after undergoing repairs The Waverleyset sail for the first time in two years less than two weeks ago, an event which was itself delayed due to an ""unexpected technical and administration issue"". The ship, described as the world's last seagoing paddle steamer, missed the 2019 season as it waited for urgent repairs. A funding appeal was launched in June 2019 and it hit its target in December after receiving a Â£1m grant from the Scottish government to help with the restoration. This paddle steamer, built by A & J Inglis of Glasgow and first launched in October 1946, has been involved in accidents before. It struck the breakwater at Dunoon with 700 passengers on board, 12 of whom suffered minor injuries, in June 2009 In July 1977 it was badly damaged when it struck rocks near Dunoon. In 2017, it was involved in another incidentwhen it crashed into the pier at Rothesay.

"Portugal has been added to Scotland's quarantine list Passengers arriving in Scotland from Portugal after 04:00 on Saturday will have to self-isolate for 14 days, the Scottish government has confirmed. French Polynesia has also been added to Scotland's quarantine list. And travellers from Gibraltar have been warned that the territory was""high up our watch list"" by Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf,external. Earlier this week Scotland announcedsimilar quarantine restrictions for travellers from Greece. Ministers said they considered targeting regions of Portugal with the quarantine rule but ultimately decided a ""whole country approach"" was necessary. Click here for Scotland's full quarantine list,external Differences in UK quarantine rules 'confusing' Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Mr Yousaf said people should ""think very hard"" before embarking on non-essential travel during the pandemic. ""With Scotland's relatively low infection rate, importation of new cases is a significant risk to public health,"" he added. ""I would also encourage people who have returned to Scotland from Portugal or French Polynesia in the last few days to be particularly careful in their social contacts and to ensure they stick to theFACTS,external. ""I am also concerned by the level of infections in Gibraltar and we will be monitoring the situation there very carefully."" He said they were in regular discussions with the other three governments in the UK. ""We continue to closely monitor the situation in all parts of the world and base the decisions we make on the scientific evidence available,"" he said. ""The requirement for travellers to quarantine for 14 days on arrival from a non-exempt country is vital to help prevent transmission of the virus and to suppress it - not doing so poses a significant risk to wider public health across Scotland."" When Derek Burt's mother was diagnosed with MND six weeks ago, she asked for ""one more trip"" - a holiday with her family. With trips to Florida and Croatia already cancelled, when quarantine restrictions were lifted two weeks ago they settled on Portugal. Although the virus rates seemed on the high-side, he ""assumed the government knew what they were doing"" and would not return the country to the quarantine list. ""How stupid was I to show any faith in our countries' decision-makers?"" he said. They have had an amazing week, and his mother was able to fulfil her wish to watch her grandchildren playing in the pool of their villa. But now the family from Dunfermline in Fife is racing to get home to beat the new restrictions that come into force at 04:00 on Saturday. Mr Burt said he is ""incredibly frustrated"" by the decision of the Scottish and Welsh governments, describing it as a ""complete shambles"". The Scottish government will monitor the situation in Gibraltar carefully The decision follows the Welsh government's announcement thattravellers to Wales from six Greek islands and mainland Portugalwould have to isolate from 04:00 on Friday. However, arrivals to England and Northern Ireland from Portugal and Greece will not be subject to the same restrictions. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shappstold BBC Breakfastthat the different rules across the UK were confusing for travellers, and said it was similar to the way lockdown had been applied across the four nations. He added: ""We look at the data and then we do speak - but I'm afraid quite often come to slightly different outcomes which I appreciate is confusing for people"". He described Portugal as being on a ""borderline"", adding that ""the opinion of England and Northern Ireland is that it did not justify quarantine this week"". Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? The seven-day infection rate in Portugal has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. A seven-day rate of 20 per 100,000 is the threshold above which the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Holidaymakers have only been able to travel from Scotland to Portugal without quarantine restrictions since 22 August, when it was added to thegovernment ""exemptions"" list.,external. It follows the addition of Greece to Scotland's quarantine list, which came into force on Thursday; Ministers blamed the decision on a ""significant rise"" in coronavirus cases being brought into Scotland from people who had been to Greece. The moves have been criticised by leading figures in the aviation industry, who have comparedjob losses in the industry to the demise of the coal industry in the 1980s.

"The children, aged between one and eight, were found in a family home The bodies of five children have been found in a flat in a large housing block in the western German city of Solingen, police say. Police say they suspect the 27-year-old mother of killing the children before attempting to take her own life at a train station in nearby DÃ¼sseldorf. Few details have been provided, with no information about the cause of death. Emergency services were called to the residential block in the Hasseldelle area of the city on Thursday afternoon. Responding to call at about 13:45 local time (11:45 GMT), police said they arrived at the building in Solingen, in North Rhine-Westphalia state, to discover the bodies of five children - three girls and two boys - aged from one to eight. A sixth child, reportedly an 11-year-old boy, was said to have survived. The children's grandmother, who lives 60km (37 miles) away in the city of MÃ¶nchengladbach, had alerted the emergency services, the German news website Bild reported. The entrance to the block of flats has been sealed off and forensic officers are at the scene Police spokesman Stefan Weiand said the children's mother had been ""seriously injured"" after throwing herself in front of a train in DÃ¼sseldorf and was being treated in hospital under police guard. ""Background and further details are not known at this point and that is what we are trying to find out,"" Mr Weiand told journalists, adding that police investigators were at the scene ""in full force"". Police said they were hoping to learn more about the ""incredibly tragic occurrence"" after speaking with the mother. The entrance to the block of flats in Solingen has been sealed off and images show police cars and ambulances lining the streets, with forensic officers also at the scene. A woman places a candle alongside a teddy at the residential building in Solingen, Germany The mayor of Solingen, Tim Kurzbach, wrote on Facebook that he had visited the housing block where ""this terrible act took place"" after hearing the news. ""For me it is still incomprehensible,"" he wrote in the post, adding: ""Today is a day of mourning for all of Solingen."" Later on Thursday, residents began leaving flowers and candles at the entrance to the building as a tribute.

"The Mansion House is available to rent online Police have launched an investigation after more than 300 people attended a party at a house in Midlothian. Officers were called to The Mansion House of Kirkhill in Gorebridge at 00:20 on Sunday. The party was being run as a commercial event, with those attending ordered to leave and a 29-year-old man being issued with a fixed penalty. Organisers have been accused of showing ""blatant disregard"" for rules aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the incident as ""utterly irresponsible"" and urged people not to attend house parties. The 12-bedroom property is said to be able to sleep up to 34 guests and is advertised on Airbnb for Â£1,600 a night - although the company said it had not been booked through them. In a statementpublished on Facebook,external, the owners of the property said the man who made the booking for the entire weekend ""seemed very pleasant"". ""We were then sadly as owners contacted at 1.30am Sunday morning by our old neighbours to say there was a huge rave and police were in attendance,"" they added. ""We are seeking legal action against the organisers of this event and are devastated as a family that our trust was broken."" The statement added: ""It is after all our family home and we did not feel safe being there after so many people had been.""

Two men were also arrested in connection with a fight at the property. Alison McCallum, director of public health at NHS Lothian said: ""We must continue to help prevent the spread of coronavirus which is why it is critical we don't socialise in the same way we did in pre-Covid times.

"This video can not be played Jacob Blake: Comparing Trump and Biden's Kenosha visits US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has spoken over the phone with Jacob Blake, the black man who was shot in the back by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, sparking big protests. Mr Blake, who remains in hospital paralysed, said ""he was not going to give up"" whether he walked again or not, Mr Biden said. He was speaking at a church meeting in  the city where the shooting took place. President Donald Trump visited Kenosha on Tuesday. The US leader surveyed areas damaged by the often violent protests that followed the shooting with messages of support for the police. Mr Biden departs Wilmington, Delaware, en route to Kenosha He did not meet Mr Blake's family, saying it was because they wanted lawyers present. Wisconsin is an important state in the upcoming presidential election. Mr Trump narrowly won it in 2016, and for decades the state has backed the eventual winner of the presidency whether Republican or Democrat. The president has been pushing a campaign message of ""law and order"". However, Mr Biden has accused Mr Trump of stoking racial division. Wisconsin's Governor, Tony Evers, said he would ""prefer that no-one be here, be it candidate Trump or candidate Biden"". By Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, Kenosha This was an important visit for Joe Biden. Some Black Lives Matter protesters in Kenosha had told us in recent days they had been disappointed that a senior Democrat had not come sooner and that the president got here first. Local Democrats had already been frustrated that after the party's national convention in neighbouring Milwaukee had been cancelled because of the pandemic, no socially distant events were planned there as a replacement. The backdrop is the tight margin by which Donald Trump won this state in 2016. Biden supporters came out in small groups to gather outside events he held at a church and a school chanting ""Let's go Joe!"" and ""Dump Trump!"" His appearances were low key, even sombre. It was not what he said but who he met that made the headlines. Praise from the family of Jacob Blake about the compassion he showed in speaking with them would have been exactly what his campaign team would have hoped for. And at a community event representatives of law enforcement agencies were present alongside activists and business owners who had feared looting and damage, illustrating the message of unity and healing that Joe Biden has been trying to send. But in a telling statement at that event, one Black Lives Matter organiser asked when all those words would turn into actions. Joe Biden and his wife met Mr Blake's relatives at Milwaukee airport, with Mr Blake on the phone. The meeting was private but Mr Biden and the Blake family lawyer later gave details. Mr Biden said he was struck by the family's ""overwhelming sense of resilience and optimism"". What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting Two incidents, two different police responses Mr Blake ""talked about how nothing was going to defeat him, how whether he walked again or not, he was not going to give up,"" Mr Biden said. Confirming the meeting, the family's lawyer Ben Crump said it was ""engaging"" and that the family ""was very impressed that the Bidens were so engaged and willing to really listen"". At the community meeting in Kenosha, Mr Biden attacked President Trump's leadership, and argued that the US was at an ""inflection point"" in its history. He also quipped ""they'll shoot me"" if he explained a policy at length, a comment quickly picked up on by conservative media, given Mr Biden's record for making gaffes. The US president toured rubble from burned buildingsand met police representatives when he visited on Tuesday. ""These are not acts of peaceful protest but, really, domestic terror,"" Mr Trump said, later adding: ""We have to condemn the dangerous anti-police rhetoric."" He expressed sympathy for those hurt in confrontations with police, saying he felt ""terribly for anybody who goes through that"". But he said he did not believe there was systemic racism in law enforcement. This video can not be played Trump on police: 'They choke sometimes' Mr Trump's campaign manager Bill Stepien told Fox News that Mr Biden's visit was inappropriate. ""The president was there earlier in the week as the president of the United States. Vice-President Biden is there today as a candidate, as a political candidate,"" he said. Anthony Davis, the president of the local chapter of the NAACP civil rights group, told NBC that he opposed both men's visit. ""I said that Kenosha would welcome them any other time,"" he said. ""But things here are fragile. And we, in this community, really need to put our energy into healing ourselves, sitting down and speaking in detail only the way that locals can."" A police officer shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back during an arrest as the 29-year-old tried to get into a car where his three children were seated. Mr Biden has called for the officer who shot him in the back to be arrested. ""He believes that, based on everything he has seen, charges appear warranted, but that there should be a full investigation to ensure all the facts are known first,"" his campaign said ahead of the trip. In an interview on Wednesday, Attorney General Bill Barr said the situation was different to that of George Floyd, whose death in March triggered global protests. ""Floyd was already subdued, incapacitated in handcuffs and was not armed,"" Mr Barr said. ""In the Jacob case, he was in the midst of committing a felony and he was armed."" Mr Blake was not armed when he was shot, but a knife was later found in his car by investigators. Two people protesting against the shooting of Mr Blake were killed in Kenosha amid widespread looting and vandalism.A 17-year-old has been charged over the deaths.

"Prime Minister Jean Castex, flanked by education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer (L) and economy minister Bruno Le Maire (R) France has unveiled a 100bn-euro (Â£89bn) economic stimulus package to help repair the economic damage caused by coronavirus. President Emmanuel Macron's government said the investment would include big spending on green energy and transport. Dubbed ""France re-launch"", it is aimed at reversing rising unemployment, and includes tax cuts for business. The economy shrank by 13.8% between April and June, the biggest quarterly fall since the Second World War. Unveiling the plan, whose â¬100bn price tag is the equivalent of 4% of France's annual economic output, Prime Minister Jean Castex said it was almost four times bigger than the rescue strategy implemented after the financial crisis of 2008. Its goal is to move away from the emergency funding of the coronavirus crisis and to make long-term investments in employment and training, as well as in France's transformation to a green economy. About â¬40bn of the funding will come from the new European Union recovery fund. About â¬35bn has been earmarked for projects to make the economy more competitive, and â¬30bn will be used on greener energy policies. About â¬6bn is slated for making public buildings and homes better insulated. The hydrogen industry, a sector which is receiving huge investment in Germany, will get â¬2bn. The rest of the investment package will go on supporting jobs, training and broader social initiatives with the aim of creating at least 160,000 jobs next year. EU reaches 'pivotal' coronavirus recovery deal Eurozone recession 'will be deeper than forecast' Mr Castex said the money would be spent over the next two years, and he hoped the investment would return the economy to its pre-pandemic levels by 2022. The next French presidential election is due to get under way in April 2022. ""Economically and socially it is infinitely better to temporarily worsen the pubic finances to invest, re-arm the economy and move forward than to sink into austerity and let unemployment and human drama explode,"" Mr Castex told a media briefing. Mathieu Orphelin, who left Mr Macron's party last year to set up a more environmentally-focused party, told Reuters.""It [the plan] is good, but this can't be limited to two years, we need to keep it up for 10 years."" Thierry Drilhon, president of the Franco-British Chamber of Commerce, told the BBC he thought the stimulus package would help those industries that had suffered ""significantly"" in the coronavirus crisis, as long as the investment was properly implemented. ""Obviously execution will be key to make sure that investment will be well utilised,"" he said. ""We all know that you can have the right vision, but vision without execution is just hallucination."" France is on course for one of Europe's worst recessions, with an 11% drop in economic output forecast for 2020 as a whole.

"There is UK division, as travellers to Wales from Portugal and six Greek islands must self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Friday Scotland will introduce quarantine for travellers from Portugal and French Polynesia on Saturday But no countries are added to England, or Northern Ireland's, travel quarantine list today The US Centers for Disease Control is asking states to get rid of red tape to allow distribution of a potential vaccine by 1 November Under the scenario being planned for, a vaccine would be rolled out for certain groups days before the US election Globally, there have been more than 26m confirmed cases since the outbreak began and 863,000 deaths Claire Heald That's all for our live coverage today. Thanks for joining us. Here's a recap of the main stories from the UK and around the world related to the pandemic:  Today's coverage has been brought to you by Claire Heald, Flora Drury, Penny Spiller, Paul Kirby, Alex Therrien, Georgina Rannard, Vanessa Buschschluter, Krutika Pathi, Max Matza, David Walker and Doug Faulkner. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Ministerial decisions around adding or removing countries from the list take into account a range of factors, including virus incidence rates, information on a country's testing capacity, an assessment of the quality of data available, the effectiveness of the measures being deployed by a country to tackle the virus, and an estimate of the proportion of the population that is currently infectious in each country. The Department for Transport says the reason for not putting Portugal on the list of countries from which returning travellers to England must quarantine is that: ""Portugal has drastically increased its testing capacity, as well as taking measures to control the spread of the virus. ""We will closely monitor this situation, and as the Secretary of State for Transport has made clear, we are prepared to act at pace to remove a country from our Travel Corridor list in order to protect public health."" So from that you could read that Portugal increasing testing and taking strong steps to tackle  coronavirus cancels out the case rate being slightly above 20. If you are just joining us, you might be confused about which countries you can travel from without having to quarantine in your home UK country on your return. Here is what has changed today: The Scottish government has confirmed that travellers from Portugal and French Polynesia will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Saturday. Scotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf also said Gibraltar is ""high up on our watch list"" and would be monitored closely. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor We've been hearing about the long journeys people have been asked to take to access a coronavirus test in the UK. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country. There has been an apology to those who were told to go a hundred miles or more for a test. Officials acknowledge that resources are stretched and have to be targeted at areas with local outbreaks. But they point out that a new mega lab is set to come on stream in the East Midlands soon. They argue that trials of new rapid testing techniques will be expanded, which could prove to be game-changers. For now though, the system is stretched, even though the official numbers suggest capacity is running ahead of demand. Questions will continue to be asked about whether the system can cope with the challenges ahead as schools return and winter approaches. The cancellation of much-loved festivals and events have been frustrating for many around the world during the pandemic. But in one Nepalese city it resulted in clashes with the police and tear gas. Hundreds of residents in Lalitpur, near Kathmandu, defied a ban on mass gatherings to hold their time-honoured tradition of a chariot procession to the rain god Rato Machhindranath. As more and more people gathered in the streets, police said they were unable to control the numbers. ""We charged (with) water cannon and tear gas to stop the
rally,"" police official Tek Prasad Rai told Reuters news agency. Rocks were thrown in retaliation and a police motorcycle was set on fire. It is not known how many people were injured but at least one wounded person was carried away by police, witnesses told Reuters. BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Lynn hasn't seen her husband for five weeks because of local coronavirus lockdowns. BBC Radio 5 Live has been focusing today on the restrictions around visiting family in care homes, after a woman whose husband has dementia said she'd not seen him for five weeks, because of local lockdown changes. Lynn lives in Trafford which was subject to extra lockdown rules at the end of July. Yesterday those restrictions were due to lift, but the decision was reversed after a rise in cases. Dementia charity John's Campaign is seeking a judicial review of the government guidance on care home visits.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We know limiting visits in care homes has been difficult for many families."" Click here to listen to a special 5 Live Your Call about care homes on BBC Sounds. France has registered more than 7,000 new coronavirus cases for the second day in a row. The health ministry said on Thursday there were 7,157 new infections, a slight increase on the previous day's figure of 7,017 but shy of the
7,578 record set on 31 March. The ministry said the cumulative number of
confirmed cases was now 300,181.

There were 20 more virus-linked deaths, taking the total to 30,706. France is one of several European countries battling a resurgence of infections.

The head of the European Union's public health agency says numbers of cases are back to levels seen in March, when the virus first gripped the continent. Residents will be asked to pay Â£50 to be tested after seven days In contrast to Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, residents returning to the Isle of Man - a crown dependency - can now self-isolate for seven days if they pay for a Covid-19 test and the result is negative, the chief minister there has said. Currently, anyone arriving on the Isle of Man must self-isolate for 14 days. From Monday, returning residents can pay Â£50 to be tested for coronavirus after a week and will be allowed to leave their home, under certain restrictions, if it is negative. Residents who pay for a Covid-19 test, which comes back negative, will be allowed to leave isolation early. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Earlier, surprisingly, the UK government said it was not
adding Portugal to the list of countries requiring returning travellers to quarantine for 14 days. Itâs surprising because Portugal is above the benchmark the
UK government has set and said publicly it is following - of 20 cases per 100,000 people, at 23. So it is a bit confusing why the UK government hasnât, but the Welsh and possibly the
Scottish government have, made the change. And then there is Greece. The Scottish government said
earlier in the week all of Greece would be added to its quarantine list whereas
Wales has listed six Greek islands including Zakynthos. Some British holiday
makers returning from there recently have come back with the
virus. So the Welsh government is going for a regional approach in terms of
Greece. From a public health perspective all the nations' governments are
saying this is necessary right now. If you look at it from the travel industry
perspective it canât go on like this much longer. Portugal will be added to Scotland's quarantine list from this weekend, senior Scottish government sources have told BBC Scotland. Read morehere. A bit more now on the Welsh government's move to put Portugal and six Greek islands on its list of places that come under quarantine regulations from early Friday morning. Although travellers returning from Portugal face self-isolation if they come back after 0400 BST on Friday, the Azores and Madeira will remain exempt, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said. The Greek islands of Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos and Crete have also been added to the quarantine list, along with Gibraltar and French Polynesia.  Ebbsfleet and Ashford stations, in Kent, are to be mothballed
after an ""unprecedented fall in demand"". It means passengers in Kent will need to start their journeys at St Pancras, in London. In a statement Eurostar said: ""Covid-19 has had a severe impact on the travel industry and on our business and we continue to operate in very challenging conditions. ""We have experienced an unprecedented fall in demand, with bookings down by 90% compared to last year. ""The environment remains very unpredictable and has been exacerbated by quarantine restrictions which are now across all of our markets."" The rail operator said it had not taken the decision not to reopen Ebbsfleet and Ashford before 2022 lightly, but said because of the ""severity of the situation"" it had to take action.  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has said quarantine restrictions are ""killing"" international travel and would not be necessary with a better thought-through testing regime. Speaking to the BBC's Newscast podcast, the ex-Labour leader welcomed new testing trials announced by the government but said they could have come several months ago - as he predicted we could be dealing with restrictions for another two years. Mr Blair said: ""I donât think itâs necessary to do 14 day quarantine when you come back into the country. That is if you want literally zero risk."" He added ""for international travel, [the quarantine is] killing it"". Newscast is on BBC One at 23.45 BST and on BBC Sounds.. BBC reporters have been at two primary schools in England today, asking pupils and parents how it feels to be back after the unprecedented break caused by the pandemic lockdown. Eight-year-old Aarizuddin Halim said he was excited about meeting his friends again while Alicja Golinczak said she wondered what her new teacher was going to be like. Mickel Baptiste, who was back on the school run with his seven-year-old daughter, Alyssa, said it was good to return to some sense of normality. Read our full report here. Travellers to Wales from Portugal and six Greek islands will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Friday,the Welsh government has announced. Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros, Antiparos and Crete are among the islands affected. Gibraltar and French Polynesia will also be removed from the list of countries exempt from the quarantine restrictions. It is the first time that Wales has applied its own quarantine rules. The head of England's NHS Test and Trace system has apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand - with some being asked to travel hundreds of miles for a test. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England,said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted that the ""vast majority"" of people could still secure appointments nearby. The booking website is now prioritising high risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted home testing kits and few booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said by Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. There will be no changes to England's quarantine list on Thursday, the transport secretary has said, amid speculation Portugal and Greece were about to be added. Grant Shapps tweeted that the list was always under review and the government wouldn't hesitate to make changes if needed. The decision covers England and other parts of the UK may make individual decisions. Peoplearriving from Greece to Scotland have to quarantine for 14 days as of 04:00 BST on Thursday, while arrivals into Wales from the Greek island of Zakynthoswere asked to self-isolate after a cluster of cases.

A controversial French professor, who had defended the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus, faces an ethics complaint that could see him sanctioned or barred from practising. Didier Raoult, head of the infectious diseases department of La Timone hospital in Marseille, is accused by medical peers of spreading false information about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine. The drug has been promoted by some, including US President Donald Trump and his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro, but there is currently no proof it works against coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against misuse of the drug because of serious side-effects. In March, Prof Raoult said his study of 80 patients showed ""favourable"" outcomes for four in five of those who received hydroxychloroquine.

But in the complaint, seen by French newspaper Le Figaro, his critics say he promoted the drug ""without any real scientific evidence on the subject, and against the health authorities' recommendations"". According to Le Figaro, a group representing 500 specialists of France's Infectious Diseases Society filed the complaint against Prof Raoult. They accuse him of breaking nine rules of the doctors' code of ethics. Read more about hydroxychloroquine: The latest figures from the UK government show there were 1,735

"This video can not be played Rescuers remove rubble in the hope of finding someone alive Rescuers in Beirut are continuing to search through the rubble of a building amid reports a person could be alive, one month after a massive blast devastated the Lebanese capital. Specialist sensor equipment was sent to the Mar Mikhael area after unconfirmed reports that a heartbeat was detected. The search was initially suspended overnight, but volunteers continued to work by hand, reports say. At least 190 people died when 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate detonated. Some 300,000 people were left homeless by the blast on 4 August. How long can survivors last under rubble? There has been outrage that so much hazardous material was stored unsafely in a warehouse in the city's port, which lies close to many residential areas. The Lebanese government's resignation shortly afterwards failed to pacify protesters, who clashed with police in the city for several nights. In a separate development, four containers with 4.3 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were found on Thursday outside Beirut's seaport, the army said. It said its specialists examined the containers, but gave no further details. There are frequent calls for silence so that rescuers can listen for signs that someone is still alive Hopes were high on Thursday that a rescue team from Chile would find someone alive under the rubble before efforts were paused due to fears the building could collapse. On Friday Chilean and Lebanese workers continued removing rubble from the building where crowds have again gathered but the signs of life are diminishing. ""We have excavated rubble but we haven't reached a conclusion yet,"" George Abou Moussa of Lebanon's civil defence told AFP news agency. The pulse, first detected on Thursday, had slowed significantly on Friday, rescue coordinator Nicholas Saade told AFP. ""After removing the big chunks we scanned again for heartbeats or respiration, it showed low beat/respiration levels of seven per minute. The reading before was about 16 to 18,"" he said. Rescue workers said there may also be a dead body under the rubble of the building, reports Reuters news agency. One volunteer told CNN thatrescuers had detected a heartbeat signal at another location,externalunder the rubble. Mansour Al Asmat said that workers are certain a body was under the collapsed building, but that person may not be alive. The rescuers were passing the building on Wednesday night when their dog gave a sign there was a person alive inside. On returning on Thursday the dog went to the same place and gave the same sign. The group then used a scanner to search for a heartbeat or a breath from within, and came with equipment to dig down into the rubble. People at the scene are hoping for a miraculous story of survival The rescuers split into teams of seven to move the debris piece by piece, due to the risk of further damage. Every so often there were calls for silence so the rescue team could listen intently,the BBC's Orla Guerin reported from the scene,external. Red Cross staff set up a tent with floodlights and supplies, and army, fire service and volunteer rescuers are also on the scene. Allow Twitter content?

"Daniel Prude died a week after he was restrained by police An African American man died in New York state after being hooded by police and held face down to the road for two minutes, body camera footage shows. Daniel Prude, 41, who had mental health issues and who was unarmed, was restrained in March by police who put a ""spit hood"" - used to stop detainees spitting or biting - on his head. He later died of asphyxiation but his story has only now been made public. His death was two months before the killing of George Floyd. Don't shoot, I'm disabled The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life The other names we're hearing after George Floyd's death Mr Floyd died after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly eight minutes in Minnesota. Anti-racism protests broke out in the US and globally in the wake of his killing. In a news conference on Wednesday, Mr Prude's brother, Joe, said he called police in Rochester on 23 March as his sibling was showing acute mental health problems. ""I placed a phone call for my brother to get help, not for my brother to get lynched,"" he said. A warehouse worker from Chicago and father of five, Daniel Prude was visiting his brother at the time of his death. Police body camera footage obtained by the family through a public records request shows Mr Prude, who had been running naked through the streets in a light snow before police arrived, lying unarmed as officers restrain him on the ground. The video shows that Mr Prude complied immediately when officers arrived on the scene and ordered him to lie on the ground and put his hands behind his back. He can be heard saying: ""Sure thing, sure thing."" He becomes agitated, at times swearing at the officers who surround him and spitting, but he does not appear to offer any physical resistance, according to the footage. 'They push black people out and replace us with BLM signs' They filmed police brutality - then faced a backlash Mr Prude told officers he was infected with coronavirus, and they placed a white ""spit hood"" over his head. One officer is seen pressing down with both hands on Mr Prude's head and saying: ""Stop spitting."" This video can not be played George Floyd death: Whatâs changed, 100 days later? After he stops writhing and goes quiet, one officer notes: ""He feels pretty cold."" Medics try to revive him before he is carried into an ambulance. He was taken off life support a week later on 30 March. The family's lawyer said the reason the case was not made public earlier was that it had taken ""months"" for police footage to be released. According to a post-mortem examination report seen by the Rochester-based Democrat and Chronicle newspaper, Mr Prude's death was a homicide caused by ""complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint"". The report also listed PCP, a strong hallucinogenic drug, as a complication. In a statement, New York state's attorney general called the death a ""tragedy"" and said an investigation was under way. Mr Prude's brother called his death ""cold-blooded murder"". ""How many more brothers gotta die for society to understand this needs to stop?"" he added at the news conference. Lawyers for the family are in the process of filing a wrongful death suit. The family have also called for the firing and arrest of the officers, US media report. The officers involved have not been suspended. Protesters gathered in the city of Rochester, New York, on Wednesday over Mr Prude's death. Rochester police used pepper spray and pepper balls against some demonstrators outside the Public Safety Building, according to the Democrat and Chronicle newspaper. Several people were briefly taken into custody after entering the building, which serves as police headquarters, the local media reports say. ""Spit hoods"" are mesh fabric hoods placed over the heads of suspects. They are intended to protect officers from a detainee's saliva. Critics who oppose their use say they are distressing and humiliating, can cause panic in the detained person, and make it harder to notice if a prisoner is having difficulty breathing. In recent years, they have been scrutinised as a factor in the deaths of several detainees in the US and other countries. Some police forces in the UK use ""spit hoods"" In the UK, campaign group Liberty said that, as of February 2019, ""spit hoods"" werebeing used by at least 30 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales.,external Back in 2016, UK police forces told the BBC they only used them when ""proportionate, appropriate and justifiable"" to protect officers. The Metropolitan Police says its medically supervised tests have found ""spit hoods"" present no risk to a suspect's breathing. The death of George Floyd sparked huge protests in the US, some violent, against police brutality and racism in both the police force and society in general. Demonstrations were held in many other countries. News of Mr Prude's death came amid heightened tensions in the US after black man Jacob Blake was shot multiple times in the back during an arrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on 23 August, sparking days of protests in the city. Mr Blake's father has saidhis son is now paralysedfrom the waist down - though doctors do not know if it is permanent. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Bidenon Wednesday called for charges against policeinvolved in Mr Blake's shooting and that of Breonna Taylor, an African-American womanwho was shot eight times by police who entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky on 13 March. Joe Biden has called for officers involved in the shootings of Jacob Blake and Breonna Taylor to be charged ""I think we should let the judicial system work its way,"" he told a news conference in Delaware. ""I do think, at a minimum, they need to be charged, the officers."" US Attorney General William Barr dismissed accusations that black and white Americans were treated differently due to police racism. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, he said it was very rare for an unarmed black person to be shot by white officers. ""I think the narrative that the police are in some epidemic of shooting unarmed black men is simply a false narrative,"" he said.

"The Home Office confirmed a record 416 migrants arrived on Wednesday French authorities are ""just as committed"" as the UK to stopping migrants crossing the Channel in small boats, MPs have been told. The Home Affairs Select Committee heard evidence from Dan O'Mahoney, the Home Office's clandestine Channel threat commander, who said France had stopped 3,000 people crossing in 2020. On Wednesday,a record 416 migrants crossed the Channelfrom France. Mr O'Mahoney said almost 200 were stopped by the French on the same day. Citing one example from Wednesday, he told the committee: ""[They] stopped a very large Rib [rigid inflatable boat] with unbelievably 63 people on it from leaving the beach. ""There is a lot of joint working and it is delivering results."" However, the former Royal Marine who reports directly to the Home Secretary, conceded: ""It's nowhere near the level we'd like it to be and that is frustrating."" Dan O'Mahoney said Border Force officers treated migrants ""with humanity"" Mr O'Mahoney praised Border Force for ""doing a fantastic job"". ""Their professionalism and skill is notable and the humanity with which they treat migrants is genuinely impressive,"" he said. The committee was also told many migrants are forced on to small boats and some who arrive in England ""don't even want to come to the UK"". Mr O'Mahoney said: ""We hear a lot of stories about migrants who are literally forced on to boats, have no idea where they are when they get to the UK, because the facilitators don't get paid until they've done that last leg of the journey."" Travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, better security at the Channel Tunnel and recent good weather ""has had a significant impact in the increase in crossings [in small boats],"" he added. More than 7,400 migrants have crossed the Channel in small boats since January 2019. Abi Tierney, director general of UK visas and immigration at the Home Office, said the numbers of those seeking asylum had dropped from more than 10,000 in the first three months of the year to 5,789 in the second three months. ""France, Germany, Italy and Greece accept a much larger proportion of asylum seekers - they stay there, and a small number come to us,"" she said. She said of the 5,000 migrants arriving so far this year, 98% had claimed asylum. About half of those applications have been considered so far, she said, with 71% rejected because the UK was not the responsible country - the migrants had travelled through a safe country before arriving in the UK.

"Henriett Szucs (left) and Mihrican Mustafa were subjected to ""very significant violence"", the trial heard A convicted sex offender has been found guilty of murdering two women whose bodies were found in his freezer. The remains of Henriett Szucs and Mihrican Mustafa were discovered at Zahid Younis's flat in Canning Town, east London, in April 2019. Prosecutors at Southwark Crown Court said Younis preyed on the vulnerable women, subjecting them to ""very significant violence"". He received a life sentence, with a minimum jail term of 38 years. How warnings about Heni and Jan's killer were missed The four-week trial heard police made the ""grim discovery"" when looking for the defendant at his home following a call about his welfare. He was not in but officers gained entry and noticed the lockable freezer, around which flies were gathering. This video can not be played After Younis refused to return from the cells for sentencing, Ms Mustafa's family spoke outside the court Ms Szucs, 32, originally from Hungary, was last seen alive in 2016 and was killed shortly before the defendant bought the freezer in November that year, the court heard. Younis's second victim, 38-year-old Ms Mustafa, was last heard from in May 2018. Ms Szucs and Ms Mustafa were ""vulnerable women living somewhat chaotic lives"", including periods of homelessness and drug addiction, the court heard. Jurors were told Younis purchased the freezer shortly after killing Ms Szucs ""for the sole purpose"" of concealing her body. Zahid Younis was in an abusive relationship with Henriett Szucs, the court heard The nature of the crime scene meant a cause of death could not be established, but the scientific evidence showed that the women had been subjected to serious violence before their deaths. They had both suffered numerous rib fractures while Ms Szucs had sustained ""dreadful"" head injuries and Ms Mustafa's sternum and larynx had been fractured. Det Ch Insp Simon Harding said the freezer had been forced open by one of the officers on ""an old-fashioned police hunch"" about what was inside it. He said: ""He broke open the freezer and discovered what could only be seen, at the time, as only one body. ""It actually took the freezer being taken away and X-rayed for it to be seen there was another body underneath that. It was a gruesome discovery for the officers."" The Met's missing person inquiry into Mihrican Mustafa - which started in 2018 - did not examine vital phone evidence, which would have shown contact with Younis around the time she vanished Det Ch Insp Harding described Ms Szucs as someone who had been in abusive relationships before and was preyed upon by Younis. She moved in with him - although Younis denied having a long-term relationship with her - and ""we have shown that she was really in love with him in her own way"", the detective said. ""She wrote him letters that we found. Unfortunately to him, she did not mean anything."" The court heard that Younis has several previous convictions for assaulting partners. A BBC investigation has identified a series of issues relating to the case: In 2002, a teenage girl told police that Younis had attacked her with a hammer and crowbar, after falsely imprisoning her. No further action was taken. In 2007, 26 charges against Younis relating to two young teenage girls were discontinued after a judge directed that a jury should clear him of many of the offences following evidence from one of the victims. In 2008, a plea agreement resulted in several charges against Younis being discontinued, including rape and sexual assault. In 2016, Ms Szucs was placed in a safe house for victims of trafficking after she was thrown from a block of flats by a man - not Younis - who was on bail for allegedly raping her. The CPS had declined to authorise a rape charge after it was first reported in February 2015. The Met Police lost contact with her as she fell under the control of Younis. The Met's missing person inquiry into Ms Mustafa - which started in 2018 - did not examine vital phone evidence, which would have shown contact with Younis around the time she vanished. It is now the subject of an internal Scotland Yard inquiry after her family made a series of complaints. Younis, known as ""Boxer"", denied murder but did admit putting the women in the freezer, pleading guilty to two counts of preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body. He claimed he was out when Ms Szucs died at his flat and did not tell police because he was ""panicking"". The jury was told he paid a man to help him get Ms Szucs' body into the freezer and that his accomplice later blackmailed him into putting Ms Mustafa's corpse in the same place. Jurors deliberated for over 16 hours before returning majority verdicts. Younis showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out while members of Ms Mustafa's large family, who attended every day of the three-week trial, said ""yes"" in the public gallery. Her older sister, Mel Mustafa, said: ""Thank you God, thank you."" The defendant refused to return to court from the cells for sentencing, during which Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described him as an ""arch deceiver"" who had ""spent a lifetime destroying lives"". She added he had shown no remorse about killing ""two beautiful and creative women"" and he might never be released from prison.

"Portugal has been added to Wales' quarantine list but not England's People arriving in Wales from mainland Portugal and six Greek islands must self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST Friday. It is the first time the Welsh Governmenthas set different quarantine rules from the UK government. People returning from Gibraltar and French Polynesia will also be required to self-isolate. Crete, Zakynthos, Mykonos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos are among the Greek islands affected. Portugal will also be added to the Scottish quarantine listfrom Saturday, but advice for travellers in England, issued by the UK government, and in Northern Ireland remains unchanged. Portugal was only removed from the quarantine rules less than two weeks ago. The Portuguese islands of the Azores and Madeira were not included in Thursday's announcement. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was acting on public health advice, and had sought a meeting with the UK government but was not able to get one. The decision follows a number of coronavirus cases in Wales linked to flights from Zakynthos, anda rise in cases in Portugal. Travellers to Wales from the Greek island were asked toself-isolateearlier in the week, but Thursday's changes mean those who do not self-isolate now face potential fines of Â£1,000. Greece? Portugal? Spain? What are the quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? UK split over Portugal quarantine rules There had been 20 cases connected to one flight from Zante to Cardiff Airport. The quarantine rules apply to travellers arriving home in Wales regardless of what part of the UK they return through - including English airports. Mr Gething said he took the decision because of a large number of coronavirus cases ""imported into Wales from tourists returning from the Greek islands"". He said there were more than 20 cases confirmed in passengers on one flight from Zakynthos to Cardiff. But UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday there were no changes in England. Mr Gething said he had hoped to discuss the situation with the UK government and counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but a meeting on Thursday was not possible. ""My responsibility is to make the right choices to keep Wales safe. My preference is to do that on a four-nation basis where possible,"" he said. ""If it isn't possible, I still have to make the right choice for Wales."" Although he said it was possible people could be fined, he added: ""That is the very last step that I want us to take."" Damian Martin arrived in Portugal on Wednesday Damian Martin, from Swansea, arrived in Lagos, Portugal, on Wednesday after having already switched his holiday from Spain. He said he would not be able to return early. The supermarket employee said he believed he would be able to self-isolate: ""My work said they would deal with it if it came to it."" ""I thought I'd be fine going to the Algarve, that most cases would be in the north,"" he said. ""Work had been full on and I really really needed a break, so I decided to go. I'm supposed to be here eight nights. I might as well try to enjoy it."" Jon Lake and his wife Nicole were due to celebrate their 10-year wedding anniversary by returning to Lake Garda, Italy, where they tied the knot. But the family, who are currently on holiday in Crete, will now have to mark the special day in their home in Cardiff, as they will be in self-isolating. ""It's all down the pan, we had wanted to do something special, now it will likely be pasta and a glass of wine back home,"" he said. Jon, who works in pharmaceuticals, said he had tracked the cases every day before going on the two-week Greek break. ""I wanted to give my family a little bit of normality, and now it is ruined,"" he said. ""We are now going back into a worse situation, it's a mess."" His oldest son, aged six, was due to start back at school, but will now have to quarantine. Mr Lake said he was angry with the Welsh Government for changing the rules, which he said ""made no logical sense"". ""They've literally given people eight hours to get home, what is Vaughan Gething expecting us to do - get a private plane? It's a joke,"" he said. For some the different rules among the nations have caused confusion and anger. Martin, lives in Gladestry, Powys, and while his village is in Wales, he has an English postcode. Having arrived home from Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, he said he was halfway through the two-week self-isolation period, but had not had any contact from the government. ""My friend who lives a few miles away in a Welsh postcode has had an email from the government about isolation,"" he said ""I live inside the border of Wales - we pay our council tax to a Welsh council, the schools are Welsh but the postcode is English. ""It's mixed messaging. Why can't the country stick together?"" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? Because it is a public health measure, the quarantine system in Wales is set by the Welsh Government. Up until now, Wales has followed the UK government in deciding which countries travellers could return from and not need to self-isolate. It has also followed any changes made, including the recent decision to order travellers from Switzerland to quarantine. Travellers abroad are expected tofill in a form online,externalwith their contact details 48 hours before they arrive back in the UK. Not providing accurate details could alsoresult in fines of Â£1,920,external. Crete is among the places included in the announcement Wales, for the first time, has now announced significantly different quarantine rules to those across the border. The Welsh health minister says this action came after ""clear advice"" from the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) that travel from these countries poses a public health risk. But the UK government's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also cited the JBC when announcing there was no need for additions or removals to the travel corridor list for England today. These differences come with complications. With only one major airport in Wales - Cardiff - many passengers flying into places like Bristol or Birmingham will land into one set of rules but face another when they get home. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said it would be ""better if, when travel measures are announced, they are done on a joint basis"" across the four nations. ""This would help keep everyone informed and safe,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the experience ""with Zakynthos tells us that the quicker a Welsh Government can act, the better"". Are you affected by the new quarantine rules?

"Portugal has been added to Scotland's quarantine list Passengers arriving in Scotland from Portugal after 04:00 on Saturday will have to self-isolate for 14 days, the Scottish government has confirmed. French Polynesia has also been added to Scotland's quarantine list. And travellers from Gibraltar have been warned that the territory was""high up our watch list"" by Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf,external. Earlier this week Scotland announcedsimilar quarantine restrictions for travellers from Greece. Ministers said they considered targeting regions of Portugal with the quarantine rule but ultimately decided a ""whole country approach"" was necessary. Click here for Scotland's full quarantine list,external Differences in UK quarantine rules 'confusing' Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Mr Yousaf said people should ""think very hard"" before embarking on non-essential travel during the pandemic. ""With Scotland's relatively low infection rate, importation of new cases is a significant risk to public health,"" he added. ""I would also encourage people who have returned to Scotland from Portugal or French Polynesia in the last few days to be particularly careful in their social contacts and to ensure they stick to theFACTS,external. ""I am also concerned by the level of infections in Gibraltar and we will be monitoring the situation there very carefully."" He said they were in regular discussions with the other three governments in the UK. ""We continue to closely monitor the situation in all parts of the world and base the decisions we make on the scientific evidence available,"" he said. ""The requirement for travellers to quarantine for 14 days on arrival from a non-exempt country is vital to help prevent transmission of the virus and to suppress it - not doing so poses a significant risk to wider public health across Scotland."" When Derek Burt's mother was diagnosed with MND six weeks ago, she asked for ""one more trip"" - a holiday with her family. With trips to Florida and Croatia already cancelled, when quarantine restrictions were lifted two weeks ago they settled on Portugal. Although the virus rates seemed on the high-side, he ""assumed the government knew what they were doing"" and would not return the country to the quarantine list. ""How stupid was I to show any faith in our countries' decision-makers?"" he said. They have had an amazing week, and his mother was able to fulfil her wish to watch her grandchildren playing in the pool of their villa. But now the family from Dunfermline in Fife is racing to get home to beat the new restrictions that come into force at 04:00 on Saturday. Mr Burt said he is ""incredibly frustrated"" by the decision of the Scottish and Welsh governments, describing it as a ""complete shambles"". The Scottish government will monitor the situation in Gibraltar carefully The decision follows the Welsh government's announcement thattravellers to Wales from six Greek islands and mainland Portugalwould have to isolate from 04:00 on Friday. However, arrivals to England and Northern Ireland from Portugal and Greece will not be subject to the same restrictions. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shappstold BBC Breakfastthat the different rules across the UK were confusing for travellers, and said it was similar to the way lockdown had been applied across the four nations. He added: ""We look at the data and then we do speak - but I'm afraid quite often come to slightly different outcomes which I appreciate is confusing for people"". He described Portugal as being on a ""borderline"", adding that ""the opinion of England and Northern Ireland is that it did not justify quarantine this week"". Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? The seven-day infection rate in Portugal has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. A seven-day rate of 20 per 100,000 is the threshold above which the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Holidaymakers have only been able to travel from Scotland to Portugal without quarantine restrictions since 22 August, when it was added to thegovernment ""exemptions"" list.,external. It follows the addition of Greece to Scotland's quarantine list, which came into force on Thursday; Ministers blamed the decision on a ""significant rise"" in coronavirus cases being brought into Scotland from people who had been to Greece. The moves have been criticised by leading figures in the aviation industry, who have comparedjob losses in the industry to the demise of the coal industry in the 1980s.

"Daisy Ridley and John Boyega at the Rise of Skywalker premiere last year Actor John Boyega has said non-white characters were ""pushed to the side"" by Disney in the last Star Wars film. The Londoner played Finn in the latest trilogy, which concluded last year. But he said the film-makers didn't know what to do with his and other diverse characters in The Rise of Skywalker. ""What I would say to Disney is do not bring out a black character, market them to be much more important in the franchise than they are and then have them pushed to the side,""he told GQ,external. ""It's not good. I'll say it straight up."" The British actor played runaway Stormtrooper Finn Boyega, who In Star Wars Episodes VII, VIII and IX, played a runaway Stormtrooper at Rey's side as a member of the resistance,  acknowledged an actor is ""not necessarily going to like everything"" in a film. He said Star Wars was an ""amazing opportunity"" and a ""stepping stone"". But he vented his displeasure about the storylines in The Rise of Skywalker. ""You guys knew what to do with Daisy Ridley, you knew what to do with Adam Driver, you knew what to do with these other people,"" he told the magazine. Ridley's character Rey and Driver, as Kylo Ren, were at the heart of the plot about the fate of the Jedi and the Skywalker dynasty. Boyega said the film gave ""all the nuance"" to Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver But the film-makers didn't know what do to with Finn or Kelly Marie Tran's character Rose, Boyega said. He also suggested Naomi Ackie, the black British actress who played Jannah, and Guatemalan-born Oscar Isaac, who played Poe, were similarly marginalised. ""What do you want me to say?"" Boyega continued. ""What they want you to say is, 'I enjoyed being a part of it. It was a great experience...' ""Nah, nah, nah. I'll take that deal when it's a great experience. They gave all the nuance to Adam Driver, all the nuance to Daisy Ridley. Let's be honest. Daisy knows this. Adam knows this. Everybody knows. I'm not exposing anything."" He also spoke about hair stylists who had no experience of working with hair like his but ""still had the guts to pretend"". Disney has not responded, and nor has director JJ Abrams. But Boyega defended Abrams, who took up the director's chair afterColin Trevorrow departed in 2017, saying: ""Everybody needs to leave my boy alone."" There's been no response from any of the main figures in the Star Wars universe - or many others in Hollywood. Those praising Boyega included Rachel Zegler, who will play Maria in Steven Spielberg's new West Side Story; The Good Place star Jameela Jamil; Matthew A Cherry, who won an Oscar for a short film this year; andBritish actor Paterson Joseph,external.

"People arriving in Wales and Scotland from Portugal must now self-isolate for 14 days, but the rules covering England and Northern Ireland are unchanged. The difference between the nations has been criticised as confusing. The rules for Wales apply from 04:00 BST on Friday, while in Scotland they begin 24 hours later on Saturday. Cases in Portugal have risen in the past week beyond the threshold at which ministers generally consider imposing 14-day mandatory self-isolation. The Department for Transport said decisions around adding or removing countries from the quarantine list ""take into account a range of factors"" - including how many people are being tested. ""Portugal has drastically increased its testing capacity, as well as taking measures to control the spread of the virus,"" said a spokesperson, adding it would closely monitor the situation. What are the UK's quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? The latest quarantine rulesintroduced in Walesapply to travellers from Portugal, Gibraltar, six Greek islands and French Polynesia. The six islands are Crete, Mykonos, Zakynthos (or Zante), Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos. Scotland has alreadyreintroduced self-isolation measures for arrivals from Greeceand has now addedPortugal and French Polynesiato its list of countries requiring quarantine. ""This week's data shows an increase in test positivity and cases per 100k in Portugal,"" said Scottish justice minister Humza Yousaf. Changes to the rules for arrivals from Greece coming to England have been considered - but Greece will stay on its safe list for now. In Portugal, the seven-day infection rate has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. This is above the threshold of 20 which is when the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Greece's rate overall is below the threshold at 13.8 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 2 September, down from 14.9 a week earlier. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday: ""There are no English additions or removals today. We continue to keep the travel corridor list under constant review and won't hesitate to remove countries if needed."" ""Nonetheless, holidaymakers are reminded - 14-day quarantine countries can and do change at very short notice."" He said the government takes several factors into account, including the prevalence of the virus as well as the level and rate of change, how many tests the country is doing, the extent of the contained outbreak and the government's actions. Northern Ireland's department of health also confirmed that NI would not make any further changes at present. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? The changes have drawn criticism from industry experts as well as holidaymakers. ""The quarantine policy is in tatters and dividing the United Kingdom,"" said Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy firm The PC Agency. ""Consumers are totally confused by the different approaches and it's impossible to understand the government's own criteria any more on when to add or remove a country. ""The current strategy has to change. The weekly reviews have been causing anxiety and financial pain for so many consumers and travel firms,"" he added. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""Days of speculation around this announcement meant many people rushed to pay extortionate prices for flights back to England to avoid having to quarantine on their return - only to now find out there was no need. ""The government knows this and yet it continues to offer no clarity around how these decisions are made."" One aviation boss described travelling abroad right now as ""quarantine roulette"" because the list of destinations which are affected keeps changing. But the governments in Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardiff are now clearly at odds over which countries pose a clear risk. Portugal's infection rate is above the UK government's benchmark of 20 cases of the virus for every 100,000 people. But the UK government has surprised us all and not added Portugal to the list for England. It's not clear why. Greece is even more complicated as the Welsh government is opting for a policy where only people arriving from certain Greek islands have to self-isolate while Scotland has introduced a quarantine for arrivals from across Greece. For months the travel industry has been lobbying the UK government for an approach where they consider particular regions in a country but ministers in London are not keen on the idea. The quarantine was already hard or impossible to police. But discrepancies between different UK nations makes it even harder as someone could, theoretically, fly into Newcastle from Greece and drive into Scotland. That person should self-isolate for 14 days, but no-one will be checking. Some holidaymakers have told the BBC they havepaid as much as Â£1,000 for flightsto get home from Portugal in anticipation of the rules changing. Kelly, from Birmingham, and her family changed their flights home from the Algarve from Saturday to Friday at a cost of Â£900 to avoid potential quarantine because she did not want her children to miss out on two weeks of school. The 45-year-old said the situation was ""absolutely disgusting"". ""It's cost us a lot more money and it's money we didn't need to spend now. We've lost an extra night in our villa - we won't get that back - we've got a hire car, so we're taking that back a day early."" She added: ""The government just change the goalposts left, right and centre at the moment. It's embarrassing."" Damian Martin from Swansea - who is currently on holiday in Lagos, Portugal - said he only arrived earlier on Thursday. ""Work had been full on so I decided to go,"" said Damian ""I had already switched my holiday from Spain and I won't be able to come back early,"" he said. ""I will be able to self-isolate, I think, but I work for a supermarket so will have to check in with them."" He added: ""I'm supposed to be here eight nights. I might as well try to enjoy it. Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal. Most head to the Algarve in the south, drawn by sunny Atlantic beaches, picturesque fishing villages and golf courses. During May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed.

"The bodies of Henriett Szucs and Mihrican Mustafa were discovered in the east London flat of Zahid Younis in April 2019. The BBC has investigated how the authorities cared for the women and dealt with their killer Younis - a convicted sex offender who has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 38 years. Henriett Szucs believed in love. She spoke about it. Wrote about it. ""Let me tel you something about how I feel for you!!! Really love you and I mean it!!! Bottom of my heart, to the stars and back!!! I didn't wana loose you, and I won't [let] that ever happen!!! This is true!!! Just wana LOVE you!!!"" In return, she received very little. During her life in the UK she was brutalised, forced to work as a prostitute, and became addicted to drugs. The pictures she drew were of a better world - butterflies, angels, a smiling woman in a flowing dress beside a fairy-tale carriage. By the time these letters and drawings were found, Henriett had been dead for more than two years, murdered and locked in a freezer. No-one had reported her missing. Henriett - or Heni - was born in Hungary in 1984. In the late 2000s she left her homeland after the marriage with the father of her children ended. She spent time in Germany and came to the UK in 2012, working as a prostitute in east London. The circumstances of her arrival in the UK meant she would later be regarded as a victim of trafficking. After briefly returning home, where she gave a baby up for adoption, she moved to Birmingham in 2014 with a Hungarian man. But promises of work failed to materialise and he took Henriett's passport and birth certificate before abandoning her. She found her way to London and into an abusive relationship, before she was made homeless and sought support at the Welcome Centre, a charity in Ilford. Manager Sonia Lynch remembers her as ""always smiling, always cheery, despite the circumstances she was in"". She says that Henriett used to draw a lot. ""I think maybe in her drawing that's where her pain may have been,"" she says. ""She didn't really speak much about the difficulties of rough sleeping and being homeless."" Sonia Lynch says that Henriett was ""extremely vulnerable"" and that she may have suffered mental health problems because of the ""trauma in her life"". ""But she didn't speak about it much, preferring to be on the positive side,"" she adds. In early 2015, Henriett was pictured smiling in a local newspaper story about the charity and, as winter turned to spring, her future finally seemed positive. Henriett was enjoying group activities and looking to start a college course. But, within months, she had come under the control of a violent man, who forced her into prostitution. An associate who saw her one day thought she was barely recognisable. She was bruised and thin, seemingly addicted to intravenous drugs, referring to her ""pimp"" and saying she had been beaten up. She had earlier, in February 2015, told the Met Police she had been raped by another man - a former partner called David Dallison, who was also arrested for assaulting her on four separate occasions. The Crown Prosecution Service refused to immediately authorise a rape charge, police say, meaning that Dallison was bailed. He was later charged with rape, but police then lost contact with Henriett and the case was discontinued. In January 2016, Heni was admitted to hospital after falling from the balcony of Dallison's flat on the fifth-floor of an Ilford tower block. She suffered multiple injuries, including broken ribs and a fractured shoulder. She described a violent attack and Dallison was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. At this point, the rape charge was reinstated and Dallison was remanded in custody ahead of a trial scheduled for the summer. It was while Heni was in hospital that she met a fellow patient who she regarded as both kind and affectionate. The man she met was Zahid Younis. Henriett was moved to a safe house outside London for victims of trafficking and modern slavery, but she had become emotionally attached to Younis. Staff heard her declaring love for ""Zahid"" during phone calls, and she made day trips back to the capital to see him. On two occasions, she returned so late that staff reported her missing. The charity was told that her boyfriend - who was said to be talking about marriage - would let her move in with him, but that he did not want to give his address to the police or any other agency. When she left a few weeks later, having insisted to staff at the refuge that her boyfriend did not have abusive personality traits, her destination - Younis's flat in Canning Town - was therefore unknown to them. The drawings and letters found there after her murder chronicle an unfolding catastrophe. Younis, nicknamed ""Boxer"" due to his love of the sport, was actually a convicted sex offender with a long history of violence against women. He was being monitored by the police, who had classed him as a ""medium risk"" sex offender. But the danger he posed should have been clear to anyone aware of his past. Henriett was known by the nickname Heni Since his teens, Younis had been inveigling himself into women's lives by pretending to be charming and kind, before revealing his true nature and eventually taking them prisoner. There is a long list of women and girls, most of them highly vulnerable due to their age or personal circumstances. Henriett's writings between March and September 2016 show her initial feelings of love turn to harsh self-criticism as she is subjected to bullying by Younis. Eventually they would depict her despair and the violence he inflicted on her. ""So the day is today the day when you my love telling me the true about your love 4 me is really so deep. You gone Marry me or not???"" ""Dear Zahid! Hope one day you gone wake up in a good [mood], not the boxing ring side"". ""Will learn more to keep my mouth shut whe I need to listen, and talk up when I need."" ""Boxer dosent want to know what Henriett wants."" ""Keep distance away from Boxer. Follow the things point to point what he says. Give him space, and show him respect."" ""Ma heart is broken...What I done so wrong in this Life?? I didn't make my self... Wasen't my choice to come a life...I did not say to my MUM} MAKE ME!!!"" Excerpts from Henriett Szucs's handwritten notes ""How can love turn into hatred just like that? Everything you promised is no more than a shattered dream. I got disillusioned as a result of some really big slaps in the face!!! When I admitted my sins, you judged and expelled me from the inner circle and planted poison in my broken heart that was anyway stone-cold by then. This poison has been tormenting and burning me. I'm afraid of dying and I don't want to hate you!!!"" ""The last night when I take this beatâ¦"" People who had known Henriett previously in London did not even know she had returned to the city. Younis had isolated her and separated her from any sources of support. In June 2016, David Dallison - the man charged with raping Henriett - was due to face trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court. But police had lost contact with her and the Crown Prosecution Service says that a judge refused an application to delay the case. Dallison, now 44, was released. A few days later - on what was meant to have been day one of the trial - Henriett texted an officer saying she was not well enough to attend. When the officer called back, there was no answer. A document later found in Younis's flat suggests he dictated the excuses she was to tell the officer. By then, he was already abusing Henriett. Despite police losing contact with a vulnerable woman, the last known sighting of her was by officers in east London in August 2016. On that occasion, she was briefly spoken to in the street while in the company of Younis, who received a penalty notice for cannabis possession. No-one reported Henriett missing or went looking for her. Soon afterwards, her writings also ceased. Scientific evidence shows she suffered serious violence over the following weeks. By 11 November 2016, when Younis bought the large chest freezer in which he hid her body, Henriett was already dead, the victim of appalling violence. Her killer had been monitored by police throughout the entire period she had been living with him. On 10 November, while Henriett's body lay hidden in a cupboard, two officers visited the flat to check up on the convicted sex offender. Younis, 36, is a brash and arrogant figure, who would refer to himself as ""Ali"" after the heavyweight great. He promoted himself online as a singer/songwriter - in reality, he was a thief and con artist, who would work occasional shifts helping transport fruit for a market stall. Police regarded Younis as a liar, as he failed to tell officers who were monitoring him about his sexual relationships, which - as a sex offender - they were obliged to ask him about. But Younis was apparently confident that his lies would either be believed or at least help him avoid being held fully accountable. His history explains why. In 2001, a 16-year-old college student from east London met Younis, and later became pregnant by him. At first he seemed ""very attentive and paid me lots of attention"", she told his recent trial, one of three victims to give evidence. However, he soon changed, displaying ""quite extreme paranoia about me looking at other men"". At one point, he locked her in a cupboard, only releasing her when she agreed to have sex with him. Another time, he violently attacked her while they were on an outing. He then phoned her mother, used obscene language to describe her daughter, and shouted that the teenager would be ""lucky to get home"". This was the last time the victim saw Younis, until a couple of years later when he turned up at the flat she was living in with her child. On that occasion, he grabbed her by the throat and threatened to take the child to Pakistan. Police were contacted and the woman was rehoused for her safety. But she didn't hear anything more from officers. Around the same time, 19-year-old Younis started grooming a 12-year-old girl. Within a year, he was sexually abusing her, locking her in his flat away from her parents, controlling her every move, and subjecting her to daily violence. In 2004, when she was 14, they were ""married"" in an Islamic ceremony at an east London mosque. The victim - who is not from a Muslim background - told his recent trial she had no idea what she was being made to do. ""I don't understand Arabic so I didn't know what I was repeating,"" she told the court. Asked why police were not called, she replied: ""Because I thought he would get away with it."" The girl was reported missing by her parents and, that summer Younis was arrested and charged with assault, false imprisonment, and sexual activity with a child. But he was acquitted following a trial. While on remand in prison he made phone calls to his young victim, whom he began sexually abusing again straight after being released. He continued to beat the child, even after she became pregnant. When she made a fresh complaint to police, Younis was charged with a string of offences relating to both the victim and a separate young teenage girl. However, the BBC has established that at his ensuing trial in early 2007, Younis was able to avoid conviction on 26 charges. After the second girl had given evidence, the judge directed that Younis be cleared of several offences relating to her and the prosecution offered no evidence on the others - 20 offences in all. Younis had pleaded guilty to one sexual offence and one assault against the other victim, with four further charges of false imprisonment ordered to lie on file when the trial was stopped, meaning he was released shortly afterwards, when time on remand was taken into account. Younis then agreed a plea deal in relation to his next victim, it can be revealed, despite the girl being subjected to even more extreme levels of violence. Shortly after being released from prison, the convicted sex offender met a 17-year-old and quickly moved himself into her flat. ""At first it was okay and then it was not nice - it was nasty and it was evil and I was trapped,"" she told the recent murder trial. He isolated the teenager, stopped her from leaving the flat and hovered nearby whenever others were present.

The violence and rapes were sadistic, constant and systematic. She was attacked with knives, hammers, and a barbecue fork. She was burnt with a lighter, suffered a catastrophic triple arm fracture, and was rendered unable to walk after being thrown from a window to the street below. The young woman, who was from a Muslim home, had not previously chosen to wear religious clothing. But she began wearing a burka to hide her increasingly damaged body. She refused to take it off even when she was with her mother and sisters. Younis threatened to kill her family and distribute videos of her being sexually abused if she told anyone about his violence. Her mother, increasingly worried about her, went to the flat and managed to get her daughter back to the family home. The police were then called. ""In my heart I kept praying... I felt like God answered my prayers and my mum came to my house,"" the woman recalled at the murder trial. Through tears, her sister told the court that when the burka was removed, it was ""the worst image I've ever seen in my life"". A medical examination at the time recorded more than 70 different injuries. Despite all of this, Younis eventually agreed to admit three offences - grievous bodily harm, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and unlawful wounding - but only on a reduced basis. The rest of the charges were left to lie on file - including rape and sexual assault - although the indictment has since been lost. His victim was only informed after the deal had been agreed. In 2008 Younis was sentenced to less than five years in prison, after the judge accepted the basis of his pleas. In other words, the judge accepted Younis's version of events. Another teenage girl had described remarkably similar violence when she spoke to police six years earlier - false imprisonment and attacks with a hammer and crowbar. No further action had been taken. Mihrican Mustafa, known as Jan or MJ, was a mother of three in her late 30s from east London. Her cousin Ayse Hussein says she had a ""heart of gold"" and would ""do anything for anyone"". She became increasingly vulnerable as a result of her addiction to drugs. Her sister Mel told the court that, as a consequence, Jan just wasn't herself anymore. She ""had no confidence left"". Her addictions meant she came into contact with local criminals. Zahid Younis was one, and he came to be an associate. He lived near Jan and some of her family. Locals who were later questioned by homicide detectives recalled seeing them together, and there was also mobile phone contact between the pair. In early May 2018, her family saw her for the last time at her mother's home. She then vanished. Within days, she was reported missing by her worried family. They were appalled by the missing person inquiry, which is now the subject of an internal Scotland Yard inquiry. The Mustafa family conducted their own investigations and appeals for information, followed up potential sightings themselves, and tried to generate media coverage. Evidence passed to police by the family appears not to have been fully examined, including Jan's old mobile, which would have shown that she had been in contact with Younis in late April - on the last day the phone was used and just before she went missing. Phone data relating to her number, by then using a new handset, would have shown further contact with Younis into early May, and that her phone had last been used in an area that included the killer's flat. When it was eventually searched, the handset was found there. In July 2018, officers responsible for monitoring Younis visited his flat and asked him about Jan, whom he admitted knowing but only through a friend. He was told that if he saw Jan he should report it. Police were not only regulars at the property to monitor Younis, but he also persistently called them himself to complain about a range of issues. He contacted them at least 26 times. He even spent time in jail at the end of 2018 for assaulting an officer. Throughout all these calls, visits and investigations, the bodies of Jan and Heni were in his flat, hidden in a freezer. They were only discovered by accident. Younis had befriended an elderly Christian woman. He lied to her constantly in order to obtain money from her - on one occasion texting her to declare: ""I only have you and the Lord Jesus"". But in April 2019, after he failed to contact her for a few days, she reported him to the police as a missing person. Officers then went to his flat to check on his welfare. They gained entry through a window and, coming across a locked freezer in a cupboard, opened it out of concern for Younis. The ensuing murder investigation ranged across Younis's years of abuse. During his trial, he was very far from an accomplished liar. He was rambling and offered inconsistent explanations, which involved him blaming other people for what had happened. New claims were added to his stories every time evidence was produced to disprove one of his lies. Younis described himself as a ""decent guy"" to jurors, but his aggressive misogyny was on full display. He told the judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grub that she was ""arrogant"" and shouted abuse at one of his victims while she was giving evidence. Police at Younis's flat How could such a man abuse so many women over such a long period of time - going on to murder two of them - and only now be held fully accountable? Yvonne Hall of the Palm Cove Society, which supports victims of domestic abuse and trafficking, says that to help ""prevent such atrocities"" in future, services that work with vulnerable people ""must ensure contact with those individuals are maintained after they leave service"". She says they must ""work collaboratively to maintain contact with vulnerable individuals - especially those designated as hard to reach"". Lisa King, from domestic abuse charity Refuge, describes the case as ""horrific"" and said that Younis engaged in a ""reign of terror"". ""The system failed the victims when it should have protected and supported them. We know that men who perpetrate domestic abuse do so serially, preying on victim after victim, their violence and abuse increasing in frequency and severity over time - tragically culminating on this occasion in the deaths of Henriett and Mihrican."" ""Whilst Zahid Younis is responsible for his violence, we must also look to the agencies and individuals which have a statutory and moral duty to support and safeguard women and uphold our criminal justice system. Vulnerable women should be protected - not dismissed because they have 'complex needs' or are seen as 'hard to reach'. ""Why weren't the agencies and the professionals who have a duty to protect all women trained to spot the signs and support these women - how could they be left as missing and vulnerable to fall through the cracks? Why wasn't Zahid Younis being monitored given his history of violence and abuse?  Why wasn't he identified as high risk? State agencies must ask these questions to learn the lessons to ensure women are protected and justice is done."" In response to questions from the BBC, Scotland Yard said ""extensive enquiries"" were made to try to locate Henriett before the trial of the man charged with raping her. Regarding the missing person inquiry for Jan Mustafa, the force said, ""Various lines of enquiry were conducted"" and that an internal investigation by its professional standards directorate is ongoing. ""No officers are currently subject to restrictions,"" the force added. Asked for comment on its monitoring of Younis, given what he did while being monitored, the Met said he had been managed in accordance with policies, and that all visits and risk assessments were completed ""as per protocol"".

"There is UK division, as travellers to Wales from Portugal and six Greek islands must self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Friday Scotland will introduce quarantine for travellers from Portugal and French Polynesia on Saturday But no countries are added to England, or Northern Ireland's, travel quarantine list today The US Centers for Disease Control is asking states to get rid of red tape to allow distribution of a potential vaccine by 1 November Under the scenario being planned for, a vaccine would be rolled out for certain groups days before the US election Globally, there have been more than 26m confirmed cases since the outbreak began and 863,000 deaths Claire Heald That's all for our live coverage today. Thanks for joining us. Here's a recap of the main stories from the UK and around the world related to the pandemic:  Today's coverage has been brought to you by Claire Heald, Flora Drury, Penny Spiller, Paul Kirby, Alex Therrien, Georgina Rannard, Vanessa Buschschluter, Krutika Pathi, Max Matza, David Walker and Doug Faulkner. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Ministerial decisions around adding or removing countries from the list take into account a range of factors, including virus incidence rates, information on a country's testing capacity, an assessment of the quality of data available, the effectiveness of the measures being deployed by a country to tackle the virus, and an estimate of the proportion of the population that is currently infectious in each country. The Department for Transport says the reason for not putting Portugal on the list of countries from which returning travellers to England must quarantine is that: ""Portugal has drastically increased its testing capacity, as well as taking measures to control the spread of the virus. ""We will closely monitor this situation, and as the Secretary of State for Transport has made clear, we are prepared to act at pace to remove a country from our Travel Corridor list in order to protect public health."" So from that you could read that Portugal increasing testing and taking strong steps to tackle  coronavirus cancels out the case rate being slightly above 20. If you are just joining us, you might be confused about which countries you can travel from without having to quarantine in your home UK country on your return. Here is what has changed today: The Scottish government has confirmed that travellers from Portugal and French Polynesia will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Saturday. Scotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf also said Gibraltar is ""high up on our watch list"" and would be monitored closely. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor We've been hearing about the long journeys people have been asked to take to access a coronavirus test in the UK. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country. There has been an apology to those who were told to go a hundred miles or more for a test. Officials acknowledge that resources are stretched and have to be targeted at areas with local outbreaks. But they point out that a new mega lab is set to come on stream in the East Midlands soon. They argue that trials of new rapid testing techniques will be expanded, which could prove to be game-changers. For now though, the system is stretched, even though the official numbers suggest capacity is running ahead of demand. Questions will continue to be asked about whether the system can cope with the challenges ahead as schools return and winter approaches. The cancellation of much-loved festivals and events have been frustrating for many around the world during the pandemic. But in one Nepalese city it resulted in clashes with the police and tear gas. Hundreds of residents in Lalitpur, near Kathmandu, defied a ban on mass gatherings to hold their time-honoured tradition of a chariot procession to the rain god Rato Machhindranath. As more and more people gathered in the streets, police said they were unable to control the numbers. ""We charged (with) water cannon and tear gas to stop the
rally,"" police official Tek Prasad Rai told Reuters news agency. Rocks were thrown in retaliation and a police motorcycle was set on fire. It is not known how many people were injured but at least one wounded person was carried away by police, witnesses told Reuters. BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Lynn hasn't seen her husband for five weeks because of local coronavirus lockdowns. BBC Radio 5 Live has been focusing today on the restrictions around visiting family in care homes, after a woman whose husband has dementia said she'd not seen him for five weeks, because of local lockdown changes. Lynn lives in Trafford which was subject to extra lockdown rules at the end of July. Yesterday those restrictions were due to lift, but the decision was reversed after a rise in cases. Dementia charity John's Campaign is seeking a judicial review of the government guidance on care home visits.

The health ministry said on Thursday there were 7,157 new infections, a slight increase on the previous day's figure of 7,017 but shy of the
7,578 record set on 31 March. The ministry said the cumulative number of
confirmed cases was now 300,181.

There were 20 more virus-linked deaths, taking the total to 30,706. France is one of several European countries battling a resurgence of infections.

The head of the European Union's public health agency says numbers of cases are back to levels seen in March, when the virus first gripped the continent. Residents will be asked to pay Â£50 to be tested after seven days In contrast to Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, residents returning to the Isle of Man - a crown dependency - can now self-isolate for seven days if they pay for a Covid-19 test and the result is negative, the chief minister there has said. Currently, anyone arriving on the Isle of Man must self-isolate for 14 days. From Monday, returning residents can pay Â£50 to be tested for coronavirus after a week and will be allowed to leave their home, under certain restrictions, if it is negative. Residents who pay for a Covid-19 test, which comes back negative, will be allowed to leave isolation early. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Earlier, surprisingly, the UK government said it was not
adding Portugal to the list of countries requiring returning travellers to quarantine for 14 days. Itâs surprising because Portugal is above the benchmark the
UK government has set and said publicly it is following - of 20 cases per 100,000 people, at 23. So it is a bit confusing why the UK government hasnât, but the Welsh and possibly the
Scottish government have, made the change. And then there is Greece. The Scottish government said
earlier in the week all of Greece would be added to its quarantine list whereas
Wales has listed six Greek islands including Zakynthos. Some British holiday
makers returning from there recently have come back with the
virus. So the Welsh government is going for a regional approach in terms of
Greece. From a public health perspective all the nations' governments are
saying this is necessary right now. If you look at it from the travel industry
perspective it canât go on like this much longer. Portugal will be added to Scotland's quarantine list from this weekend, senior Scottish government sources have told BBC Scotland. Read morehere. A bit more now on the Welsh government's move to put Portugal and six Greek islands on its list of places that come under quarantine regulations from early Friday morning. Although travellers returning from Portugal face self-isolation if they come back after 0400 BST on Friday, the Azores and Madeira will remain exempt, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said. The Greek islands of Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos and Crete have also been added to the quarantine list, along with Gibraltar and French Polynesia.  Ebbsfleet and Ashford stations, in Kent, are to be mothballed
after an ""unprecedented fall in demand"". It means passengers in Kent will need to start their journeys at St Pancras, in London. In a statement Eurostar said: ""Covid-19 has had a severe impact on the travel industry and on our business and we continue to operate in very challenging conditions. ""We have experienced an unprecedented fall in demand, with bookings down by 90% compared to last year. ""The environment remains very unpredictable and has been exacerbated by quarantine restrictions which are now across all of our markets."" The rail operator said it had not taken the decision not to reopen Ebbsfleet and Ashford before 2022 lightly, but said because of the ""severity of the situation"" it had to take action.  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has said quarantine restrictions are ""killing"" international travel and would not be necessary with a better thought-through testing regime. Speaking to the BBC's Newscast podcast, the ex-Labour leader welcomed new testing trials announced by the government but said they could have come several months ago - as he predicted we could be dealing with restrictions for another two years. Mr Blair said: ""I donât think itâs necessary to do 14 day quarantine when you come back into the country. That is if you want literally zero risk."" He added ""for international travel, [the quarantine is] killing it"". Newscast is on BBC One at 23.45 BST and on BBC Sounds.. BBC reporters have been at two primary schools in England today, asking pupils and parents how it feels to be back after the unprecedented break caused by the pandemic lockdown. Eight-year-old Aarizuddin Halim said he was excited about meeting his friends again while Alicja Golinczak said she wondered what her new teacher was going to be like. Mickel Baptiste, who was back on the school run with his seven-year-old daughter, Alyssa, said it was good to return to some sense of normality. Read our full report here. Travellers to Wales from Portugal and six Greek islands will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Friday,the Welsh government has announced. Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros, Antiparos and Crete are among the islands affected. Gibraltar and French Polynesia will also be removed from the list of countries exempt from the quarantine restrictions. It is the first time that Wales has applied its own quarantine rules. The head of England's NHS Test and Trace system has apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand - with some being asked to travel hundreds of miles for a test. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England,said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted that the ""vast majority"" of people could still secure appointments nearby. The booking website is now prioritising high risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted home testing kits and few booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said by Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. There will be no changes to England's quarantine list on Thursday, the transport secretary has said, amid speculation Portugal and Greece were about to be added. Grant Shapps tweeted that the list was always under review and the government wouldn't hesitate to make changes if needed. The decision covers England and other parts of the UK may make individual decisions. Peoplearriving from Greece to Scotland have to quarantine for 14 days as of 04:00 BST on Thursday, while arrivals into Wales from the Greek island of Zakynthoswere asked to self-isolate after a cluster of cases.

A controversial French professor, who had defended the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus, faces an ethics complaint that could see him sanctioned or barred from practising. Didier Raoult, head of the infectious diseases department of La Timone hospital in Marseille, is accused by medical peers of spreading false information about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine. The drug has been promoted by some, including US President Donald Trump and his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro, but there is currently no proof it works against coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against misuse of the drug because of serious side-effects. In March, Prof Raoult said his study of 80 patients showed ""favourable"" outcomes for four in five of those who received hydroxychloroquine.

But in the complaint, seen by French newspaper Le Figaro, his critics say he promoted the drug ""without any real scientific evidence on the subject, and against the health authorities' recommendations"". According to Le Figaro, a group representing 500 specialists of France's Infectious Diseases Society filed the complaint against Prof Raoult. They accuse him of breaking nine rules of the doctors' code of ethics. Read more about hydroxychloroquine: The latest figures from the UK government show there were 1,735

"Portugal has been added to Wales' quarantine list but not England's People arriving in Wales from mainland Portugal and six Greek islands must self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST Friday. It is the first time the Welsh Governmenthas set different quarantine rules from the UK government. People returning from Gibraltar and French Polynesia will also be required to self-isolate. Crete, Zakynthos, Mykonos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos are among the Greek islands affected. Portugal will also be added to the Scottish quarantine listfrom Saturday, but advice for travellers in England, issued by the UK government, and in Northern Ireland remains unchanged. Portugal was only removed from the quarantine rules less than two weeks ago. The Portuguese islands of the Azores and Madeira were not included in Thursday's announcement. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was acting on public health advice, and had sought a meeting with the UK government but was not able to get one. The decision follows a number of coronavirus cases in Wales linked to flights from Zakynthos, anda rise in cases in Portugal. Travellers to Wales from the Greek island were asked toself-isolateearlier in the week, but Thursday's changes mean those who do not self-isolate now face potential fines of Â£1,000. Greece? Portugal? Spain? What are the quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? UK split over Portugal quarantine rules There had been 20 cases connected to one flight from Zante to Cardiff Airport. The quarantine rules apply to travellers arriving home in Wales regardless of what part of the UK they return through - including English airports. Mr Gething said he took the decision because of a large number of coronavirus cases ""imported into Wales from tourists returning from the Greek islands"". He said there were more than 20 cases confirmed in passengers on one flight from Zakynthos to Cardiff. But UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday there were no changes in England. Mr Gething said he had hoped to discuss the situation with the UK government and counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but a meeting on Thursday was not possible. ""My responsibility is to make the right choices to keep Wales safe. My preference is to do that on a four-nation basis where possible,"" he said. ""If it isn't possible, I still have to make the right choice for Wales."" Although he said it was possible people could be fined, he added: ""That is the very last step that I want us to take."" Damian Martin arrived in Portugal on Wednesday Damian Martin, from Swansea, arrived in Lagos, Portugal, on Wednesday after having already switched his holiday from Spain. He said he would not be able to return early. The supermarket employee said he believed he would be able to self-isolate: ""My work said they would deal with it if it came to it."" ""I thought I'd be fine going to the Algarve, that most cases would be in the north,"" he said. ""Work had been full on and I really really needed a break, so I decided to go. I'm supposed to be here eight nights. I might as well try to enjoy it."" Jon Lake and his wife Nicole were due to celebrate their 10-year wedding anniversary by returning to Lake Garda, Italy, where they tied the knot. But the family, who are currently on holiday in Crete, will now have to mark the special day in their home in Cardiff, as they will be in self-isolating. ""It's all down the pan, we had wanted to do something special, now it will likely be pasta and a glass of wine back home,"" he said. Jon, who works in pharmaceuticals, said he had tracked the cases every day before going on the two-week Greek break. ""I wanted to give my family a little bit of normality, and now it is ruined,"" he said. ""We are now going back into a worse situation, it's a mess."" His oldest son, aged six, was due to start back at school, but will now have to quarantine. Mr Lake said he was angry with the Welsh Government for changing the rules, which he said ""made no logical sense"". ""They've literally given people eight hours to get home, what is Vaughan Gething expecting us to do - get a private plane? It's a joke,"" he said. For some the different rules among the nations have caused confusion and anger. Martin, lives in Gladestry, Powys, and while his village is in Wales, he has an English postcode. Having arrived home from Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, he said he was halfway through the two-week self-isolation period, but had not had any contact from the government. ""My friend who lives a few miles away in a Welsh postcode has had an email from the government about isolation,"" he said ""I live inside the border of Wales - we pay our council tax to a Welsh council, the schools are Welsh but the postcode is English. ""It's mixed messaging. Why can't the country stick together?"" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? Because it is a public health measure, the quarantine system in Wales is set by the Welsh Government. Up until now, Wales has followed the UK government in deciding which countries travellers could return from and not need to self-isolate. It has also followed any changes made, including the recent decision to order travellers from Switzerland to quarantine. Travellers abroad are expected tofill in a form online,externalwith their contact details 48 hours before they arrive back in the UK. Not providing accurate details could alsoresult in fines of Â£1,920,external. Crete is among the places included in the announcement Wales, for the first time, has now announced significantly different quarantine rules to those across the border. The Welsh health minister says this action came after ""clear advice"" from the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) that travel from these countries poses a public health risk. But the UK government's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also cited the JBC when announcing there was no need for additions or removals to the travel corridor list for England today. These differences come with complications. With only one major airport in Wales - Cardiff - many passengers flying into places like Bristol or Birmingham will land into one set of rules but face another when they get home. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said it would be ""better if, when travel measures are announced, they are done on a joint basis"" across the four nations. ""This would help keep everyone informed and safe,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the experience ""with Zakynthos tells us that the quicker a Welsh Government can act, the better"". Are you affected by the new quarantine rules?

It means there are restricted home testing kits and few booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said by Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. There will be no changes to England's quarantine list on Thursday, the transport secretary has said, amid speculation Portugal and Greece were about to be added. Grant Shapps tweeted that the list was always under review and the government wouldn't hesitate to make changes if needed. The decision covers England and other parts of the UK may make individual decisions. Peoplearriving from Greece to Scotland have to quarantine for 14 days as of 04:00 BST on Thursday, while arrivals into Wales from the Greek island of Zakynthoswere asked to self-isolate after a cluster of cases.

A controversial French professor, who had defended the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus, faces an ethics complaint that could see him sanctioned or barred from practising. Didier Raoult, head of the infectious diseases department of La Timone hospital in Marseille, is accused by medical peers of spreading false information about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine. The drug has been promoted by some, including US President Donald Trump and his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro, but there is currently no proof it works against coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against misuse of the drug because of serious side-effects. In March, Prof Raoult said his study of 80 patients showed ""favourable"" outcomes for four in five of those who received hydroxychloroquine.

But in the complaint, seen by French newspaper Le Figaro, his critics say he promoted the drug ""without any real scientific evidence on the subject, and against the health authorities' recommendations"". According to Le Figaro, a group representing 500 specialists of France's Infectious Diseases Society filed the complaint against Prof Raoult. They accuse him of breaking nine rules of the doctors' code of ethics. Read more about hydroxychloroquine: The latest figures from the UK government show there were 1,735

"People arriving in Wales and Scotland from Portugal must now self-isolate for 14 days, but the rules covering England and Northern Ireland are unchanged. The difference between the nations has been criticised as confusing. The rules for Wales apply from 04:00 BST on Friday, while in Scotland they begin 24 hours later on Saturday. Cases in Portugal have risen in the past week beyond the threshold at which ministers generally consider imposing 14-day mandatory self-isolation. The Department for Transport said decisions around adding or removing countries from the quarantine list ""take into account a range of factors"" - including how many people are being tested. ""Portugal has drastically increased its testing capacity, as well as taking measures to control the spread of the virus,"" said a spokesperson, adding it would closely monitor the situation. What are the UK's quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? The latest quarantine rulesintroduced in Walesapply to travellers from Portugal, Gibraltar, six Greek islands and French Polynesia. The six islands are Crete, Mykonos, Zakynthos (or Zante), Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos. Scotland has alreadyreintroduced self-isolation measures for arrivals from Greeceand has now addedPortugal and French Polynesiato its list of countries requiring quarantine. ""This week's data shows an increase in test positivity and cases per 100k in Portugal,"" said Scottish justice minister Humza Yousaf. Changes to the rules for arrivals from Greece coming to England have been considered - but Greece will stay on its safe list for now. In Portugal, the seven-day infection rate has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. This is above the threshold of 20 which is when the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Greece's rate overall is below the threshold at 13.8 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 2 September, down from 14.9 a week earlier. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday: ""There are no English additions or removals today. We continue to keep the travel corridor list under constant review and won't hesitate to remove countries if needed."" ""Nonetheless, holidaymakers are reminded - 14-day quarantine countries can and do change at very short notice."" He said the government takes several factors into account, including the prevalence of the virus as well as the level and rate of change, how many tests the country is doing, the extent of the contained outbreak and the government's actions. Northern Ireland's department of health also confirmed that NI would not make any further changes at present. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? The changes have drawn criticism from industry experts as well as holidaymakers. ""The quarantine policy is in tatters and dividing the United Kingdom,"" said Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy firm The PC Agency. ""Consumers are totally confused by the different approaches and it's impossible to understand the government's own criteria any more on when to add or remove a country. ""The current strategy has to change. The weekly reviews have been causing anxiety and financial pain for so many consumers and travel firms,"" he added. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""Days of speculation around this announcement meant many people rushed to pay extortionate prices for flights back to England to avoid having to quarantine on their return - only to now find out there was no need. ""The government knows this and yet it continues to offer no clarity around how these decisions are made."" One aviation boss described travelling abroad right now as ""quarantine roulette"" because the list of destinations which are affected keeps changing. But the governments in Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardiff are now clearly at odds over which countries pose a clear risk. Portugal's infection rate is above the UK government's benchmark of 20 cases of the virus for every 100,000 people. But the UK government has surprised us all and not added Portugal to the list for England. It's not clear why. Greece is even more complicated as the Welsh government is opting for a policy where only people arriving from certain Greek islands have to self-isolate while Scotland has introduced a quarantine for arrivals from across Greece. For months the travel industry has been lobbying the UK government for an approach where they consider particular regions in a country but ministers in London are not keen on the idea. The quarantine was already hard or impossible to police. But discrepancies between different UK nations makes it even harder as someone could, theoretically, fly into Newcastle from Greece and drive into Scotland. That person should self-isolate for 14 days, but no-one will be checking. Some holidaymakers have told the BBC they havepaid as much as Â£1,000 for flightsto get home from Portugal in anticipation of the rules changing. Kelly, from Birmingham, and her family changed their flights home from the Algarve from Saturday to Friday at a cost of Â£900 to avoid potential quarantine because she did not want her children to miss out on two weeks of school. The 45-year-old said the situation was ""absolutely disgusting"". ""It's cost us a lot more money and it's money we didn't need to spend now. We've lost an extra night in our villa - we won't get that back - we've got a hire car, so we're taking that back a day early."" She added: ""The government just change the goalposts left, right and centre at the moment. It's embarrassing."" Damian Martin from Swansea - who is currently on holiday in Lagos, Portugal - said he only arrived earlier on Thursday. ""Work had been full on so I decided to go,"" said Damian ""I had already switched my holiday from Spain and I won't be able to come back early,"" he said. ""I will be able to self-isolate, I think, but I work for a supermarket so will have to check in with them."" He added: ""I'm supposed to be here eight nights. I might as well try to enjoy it. Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal. Most head to the Algarve in the south, drawn by sunny Atlantic beaches, picturesque fishing villages and golf courses.

"Eyewitnesses say the paddle steamer struck the pier A total of 24 people have been injured after the paddle steamer Waverley collided with Brodick Pier in Arran. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said ""a number have been taken to hospital"" following the incident. People stranded in Arran were later due to be returned to the mainland by an emergency sailing of a CalMac ferry. Police, paramedics, coastguards and rescue helicopters were scrambled to the scene after the alarm was raised at about 17:15 on Thursday. MCA said 213 passengers and 26 crew were on board the vessel when it struck the pier. Waverley finally sets sail after two years 'Save the Waverley' appeal launched Cruises cancelled after Waverley crash One passenger, Graham McWilliams, told BBC Scotland'sThe Nineabout the moment of collision. He said: ""As we came into the pier, everything seemed quite normal. ""Then there was a sudden crash, a loud bang, and the boat stopped very quickly. I saw people falling and it was quite distressing."" This video can not be played Waverley crash: 'I saw one lady fly past the window' He added: ""There was a lady that I saw who literally flew past the window."" Mr McWilliams said that, several hours after the accident, passengers were still milling about the ferry terminal at Brodick. He said it was unclear if they would be able to leave the island or whether accommodation could be found for them. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson later tweeted to sayarrangements had been made for CalMac to operate an emergency sailing,externalto take the Waverley passengers back to the mainland. Rita McLeod, who was waiting to board the Waverley, said she saw people being taken away in ambulances. ""We were actually queued up waiting to get in when it crashed,"" she said. ""It came in bow first. It came in far too fast."" ""We saw a lot of people falling, a few people fell over. There were people taken away in ambulances. ""We saw a lot of people, pretty badly shaken, coming off."" The ship was due to into Brodick at about 17.00 after leaving Greenock in the morning. A fire engine and other emergency services were visible from the terminal building Another eyewitness saw the crash from the departure terminal as she waited to board. Anne Cochrane from Bishopbriggs near Glasgow, said: ""It just crashed into the pier when it was coming back from the Holy Isle. We're just stuck in the departure terminal. We've had no information."" The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has been informed of the incident. The Waverley has just returned to service after undergoing repairs The Waverleyset sail for the first time in two years less than two weeks ago, an event which was itself delayed due to an ""unexpected technical and administration issue"". The ship, described as the world's last seagoing paddle steamer, missed the 2019 season as it waited for urgent repairs. A funding appeal was launched in June 2019 and it hit its target in December after receiving a Â£1m grant from the Scottish government to help with the restoration. This paddle steamer, built by A & J Inglis of Glasgow and first launched in October 1946, has been involved in accidents before. It struck the breakwater at Dunoon with 700 passengers on board, 12 of whom suffered minor injuries, in June 2009 In July 1977 it was badly damaged when it struck rocks near Dunoon. In 2017, it was involved in another incidentwhen it crashed into the pier at Rothesay.

"Bosses in charge of the coronavirus testing system have apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand. Some people are being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England, said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted the ""vast majority"" of people could still get appointments nearby. How do I get a coronavirus test? Testing and tracing 'key to schools returning' Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again The booking website is now prioritising high-risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted numbers of home testing kits and fewer booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said they were working hard to rectify the problem and a new lab facility would be opened in the coming weeks. By Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. But Prof Paul Hunter, a public health expert at the University of East Anglia, said these issues could act as a ""big disincentive to being tested"" and result in local increases being missed. David was offered a test in Blackburn when he lives in Suffolk David Llewellyntried to book a test on Sunday and was directed to a test centre near Blackburn - 250 miles and the other side of England from his home in Stowmarket, Suffolk. ""I thought I'd entered my home location incorrectly so went through the booking process again, only to get the same location for testing. Needless to say I have subsequently ordered a home testing kit, which despite three automated email reminders to take the test has yet to arrive. I'd do the test if I had it. I think it's ridiculous."" Lucy Evans lives in Pooleon the south coast. She was offered a test 220 miles away in Oldham and Blackburn. She tried again and was offered the Isle of Wight. ""I tried 14 times to get a test nearer and in the end had to get a home test as I ran out of time to get this done within five days. By the time I was tested my symptoms had disappeared."" Lucy tested negative for Covid on Tuesday. Lisa lives in Plymouthand tried to get a test for her 14-year-old son. She was offered a test 688 miles away in Inverness. ""People aren't going to travel all that way for a test are they? You'd just have to make stops along the way and could be spreading it around if you had the virus."" She eventually got a test locally and her son was negative. The government says the network of labs used to process tests has capacity to process 250,000 tests a day at the moment. Currently around 175,000 tests a day are being processed, which the government has said is more per head of population than many countries. But the government said it has faced problems because demand is not smooth - at weekends it drops and on weekdays there can be surges. Over the past month it has meant a backlog has developed, meaning the time taken to turnaround tests has been increasing. To curb demand, the availability of slots at testing centres have been reduced. The government said it has done this to ensure high risk areas, including care homes and towns with high rates of infections, can be prioritised for testing. The most recent data shows test results are now being provided more quickly, with the average turnaround time 24 hours or less for mobile testing units and local testing centres. It also said booking slots open up throughout the day so if people keep trying they should be able to get a more convenient location for a test, or order a home test. A new lab is also being opened near Loughborough at the end of the month that will be able to process 50,000 tests a day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there were some ""operational challenges"", but said the ""vast majority"" of people could get a test close to home. Mr Hancock also set out plans to pilot more rapid, easy-to-use tests. A Â£500m programme is under way to trial a range of different tests, including ones that use saliva (instead of nose and throat swabs) and tests that can be processed quickly, and sometimes on the spot - at the moment swab tests are sent off to labs to be processed. Repeat testing of members of the public will be tried out in Salford in Greater Manchester. Meanwhile, students and school pupils in Southampton will also be tested weekly in another study. The technologies open up the prospect of mass population testing which, if successful, could reduce the need for social distancing. Mr Hancock said: ""Short of a vaccine, this is the best chance we have of reducing social distancing whilst controlling the virus, especially with winter coming and all the challenges that brings."" But he refused to be drawn on a timescale for when this might become available, saying it was essential to see if they worked first. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances for virus tests, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient testing capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June - and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country. There's been an apology to those who were told to go 100 miles or more for a test. Officials acknowledge that resources are stretched and have to be targeted at areas with local outbreaks. But they point out that a new ""mega lab"" is set to come on stream in the east Midlands soon. They also argue that trials of new rapid testing techniques will be expanded, which could prove to be game-changers. For now though, the system is stretched, even though the official numbers suggest capacity is running ahead of demand. Questions will continue to be asked about whether the system can cope with challenges ahead, with schools returning and winter approaching.

"The children, aged between one and eight, were found in a family home The bodies of five children have been found in a flat in a large housing block in the western German city of Solingen, police say. Police say they suspect the 27-year-old mother of killing the children before attempting to take her own life at a train station in nearby DÃ¼sseldorf. Few details have been provided, with no information about the cause of death. Emergency services were called to the residential block in the Hasseldelle area of the city on Thursday afternoon. Responding to call at about 13:45 local time (11:45 GMT), police said they arrived at the building in Solingen, in North Rhine-Westphalia state, to discover the bodies of five children - three girls and two boys - aged from one to eight. A sixth child, reportedly an 11-year-old boy, was said to have survived. The children's grandmother, who lives 60km (37 miles) away in the city of MÃ¶nchengladbach, had alerted the emergency services, the German news website Bild reported. The entrance to the block of flats has been sealed off and forensic officers are at the scene Police spokesman Stefan Weiand said the children's mother had been ""seriously injured"" after throwing herself in front of a train in DÃ¼sseldorf and was being treated in hospital under police guard. ""Background and further details are not known at this point and that is what we are trying to find out,"" Mr Weiand told journalists, adding that police investigators were at the scene ""in full force"". Police said they were hoping to learn more about the ""incredibly tragic occurrence"" after speaking with the mother. The entrance to the block of flats in Solingen has been sealed off and images show police cars and ambulances lining the streets, with forensic officers also at the scene. A woman places a candle alongside a teddy at the residential building in Solingen, Germany The mayor of Solingen, Tim Kurzbach, wrote on Facebook that he had visited the housing block where ""this terrible act took place"" after hearing the news. ""For me it is still incomprehensible,"" he wrote in the post, adding: ""Today is a day of mourning for all of Solingen."" Later on Thursday, residents began leaving flowers and candles at the entrance to the building as a tribute.

"Portugal has been added to Scotland's quarantine list Passengers arriving in Scotland from Portugal after 04:00 on Saturday will have to self-isolate for 14 days, the Scottish government has confirmed. French Polynesia has also been added to Scotland's quarantine list. And travellers from Gibraltar have been warned that the territory was""high up our watch list"" by Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf,external. Earlier this week Scotland announcedsimilar quarantine restrictions for travellers from Greece. Ministers said they considered targeting regions of Portugal with the quarantine rule but ultimately decided a ""whole country approach"" was necessary. Click here for Scotland's full quarantine list,external Differences in UK quarantine rules 'confusing' Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Mr Yousaf said people should ""think very hard"" before embarking on non-essential travel during the pandemic. ""With Scotland's relatively low infection rate, importation of new cases is a significant risk to public health,"" he added. ""I would also encourage people who have returned to Scotland from Portugal or French Polynesia in the last few days to be particularly careful in their social contacts and to ensure they stick to theFACTS,external. ""I am also concerned by the level of infections in Gibraltar and we will be monitoring the situation there very carefully."" He said they were in regular discussions with the other three governments in the UK. ""We continue to closely monitor the situation in all parts of the world and base the decisions we make on the scientific evidence available,"" he said. ""The requirement for travellers to quarantine for 14 days on arrival from a non-exempt country is vital to help prevent transmission of the virus and to suppress it - not doing so poses a significant risk to wider public health across Scotland."" When Derek Burt's mother was diagnosed with MND six weeks ago, she asked for ""one more trip"" - a holiday with her family. With trips to Florida and Croatia already cancelled, when quarantine restrictions were lifted two weeks ago they settled on Portugal. Although the virus rates seemed on the high-side, he ""assumed the government knew what they were doing"" and would not return the country to the quarantine list. ""How stupid was I to show any faith in our countries' decision-makers?"" he said. They have had an amazing week, and his mother was able to fulfil her wish to watch her grandchildren playing in the pool of their villa. But now the family from Dunfermline in Fife is racing to get home to beat the new restrictions that come into force at 04:00 on Saturday. Mr Burt said he is ""incredibly frustrated"" by the decision of the Scottish and Welsh governments, describing it as a ""complete shambles"". The Scottish government will monitor the situation in Gibraltar carefully The decision follows the Welsh government's announcement thattravellers to Wales from six Greek islands and mainland Portugalwould have to isolate from 04:00 on Friday. However, arrivals to England and Northern Ireland from Portugal and Greece will not be subject to the same restrictions. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shappstold BBC Breakfastthat the different rules across the UK were confusing for travellers, and said it was similar to the way lockdown had been applied across the four nations. He added: ""We look at the data and then we do speak - but I'm afraid quite often come to slightly different outcomes which I appreciate is confusing for people"". He described Portugal as being on a ""borderline"", adding that ""the opinion of England and Northern Ireland is that it did not justify quarantine this week"". Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? The seven-day infection rate in Portugal has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. A seven-day rate of 20 per 100,000 is the threshold above which the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Holidaymakers have only been able to travel from Scotland to Portugal without quarantine restrictions since 22 August, when it was added to thegovernment ""exemptions"" list.,external. It follows the addition of Greece to Scotland's quarantine list, which came into force on Thursday; Ministers blamed the decision on a ""significant rise"" in coronavirus cases being brought into Scotland from people who had been to Greece. The moves have been criticised by leading figures in the aviation industry, who have comparedjob losses in the industry to the demise of the coal industry in the 1980s.

"This video can not be played Trump suggests voters should submit ballot twice US President Donald Trump has told people in the state of North Carolina to vote twice in November's election, despite this being illegal. Mr Trump suggested voters send a postal vote and then vote in person in order to test the system. The president has frequently made false claims that postal votes are vulnerable to significant electoral fraud. ""Let them send it in and let them go vote,"" he told North Carolina broadcaster WECT-TV on Wednesday. ""And if the system is as good as they say it is then obviously they won't be able to vote (in person)."" On Thursday,he tweeted that,externalif people vote by post they should also go to the polling station ""to see whether or not your mail-in vote has been tabulated"" and vote in person if necessary. After President Trump made the initial comments, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein tweeted that he had ""outrageously encouraged"" people in the state to ""break the law in order to help him sow chaos in our election"". President Trump spoke to a local broadcaster in Wilmington, North Carolina ""Make sure you vote, but do not vote twice!"" Mr Stein added. ""I will do everything in my power to make sure the will of the people is upheld in November."" Read more: Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Democrats have also accused President Trump and the Republican party of attempting to suppress the vote in order to help their side in the election. President Trump was in Wilmington, North Carolina, to formally designate the city an American World War Two Heritage City. The electoral process is run by the individual states. Karen Brinson Bell, executive director for the North Carolina State Board of Elections,has reassured voters,externalthat there are numerous measures in place to prevent anyone getting two votes registered. Someone who has already voted by post would show up in an electronic pollbook used at polling stations, and prevented from voting, she said. Only the first vote would be recorded, she added. And audits are carried out after each election to check voter history against ballots cast. Voting twice intentionally is a crime, said Ms Brinson Bell. When Mr Trump's comments were put to Attorney General William Barr, he said it was unclear what the president meant. Several US states have allowed and encouraged postal voting for years. But the number of people voting by post is expected to vastly increase in 2020 due to fears about gathering at polling stations in a pandemic. As a result, dozens of US states have expanded postal voting for this election. There are concerns the large volume of postal ballots may mean it takes days or weeks to count them all, long after Election Day has passed. This isn't the first time President Trump has made controversial comments about postal voting. Speaking at the Republican National Convention (RNC) last month, he claimed ""there's tremendous fraud involved"" with postal voting and that ""we have to be very, very careful"". But these claims have been strongly and repeatedly debunked by experts. Ellen Weintraub, commissioner of the Federal Election Commission, responded at the time that ""there's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud"". A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? How you can be US president without winning most votes In addition, numerous nationwide and state-level studies over the years have not revealed evidence of major, widespread fraud. In the 2016 US presidential election, nearly one quarter of votes were cast by post, and that number is expected to rise this time round due to public health concerns over coronavirus. Individual US states control their own voting rules for federal elections - and many are looking to increase postal voting to prevent large gatherings at polling stations on election day. A number of states are planning to hold ""all-mail"" ballot elections this November. The rate of voting fraud overall in the US is between 0.00004% and 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice. Does US postal voting lead to fraud?

"Nicola Sturgeon has warned that coronavirus is spreading again in Scotland as she defended restrictions that have been imposed in the Glasgow area. A further 101 cases have been confirmed in Scotland - 53 of them in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. Ms Sturgeon said the transmission rate of the virus had increased slightly over the past week. And she said doing nothing to stop the spread was not an option. The first minister warned that the recent increase in cases ""should be a wakeup call for all of us"" in sticking to rules and helping to suppress the spread of Covid-19. Visiting restrictions reintroduced in Glasgow area Pub decision defended as new restrictions kick in Restrictions on visiting other households were reintroduced in Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire earlier this week in response to concerns about a rising number of cases in the area. However, the 53 new cases in Greater Glasgow and Clyde on Thursday was lower than the previous day's figure of 86. At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said the ""R number"" - effectively the reproduction rate of the virus - was now above one, and potentially as high as 1.4. She said this ""is of slightly less concern when the overall prevalence of the virus is low"". But she added: ""Nevertheless, this is a reminder that the virus is spreading again just as it is elsewhere in the UK and Europe and across the world."" Ms Sturgeon said the recent rise in cases should be a wake-up call for the country The first minister said: ""The situation in these parts of Greater Glasgow and Clyde I really think should be a wake up call for all of us. ""Numbers of new cases are high in those areas and that's why we've had to impose some restrictions, but new cases have been increasing in many parts of Scotland in the past fortnight. ""All of us, wherever we live, have to be more careful than ever about sticking to all of the rules and guidance and trying to minimise the chances we're giving the virus to spread."" There has been some criticism of the decision to impose restrictions on household meetings in the Glasgow area while leaving hospitality venues like bars and restaurants open. Pubs across Aberdeen were closed last month and travel restrictions imposed in response to an outbreak in the city - leading to claims of a""west coast bias"". Pubs in Aberdeen were closed in response to a cluster of cases in the city - but have remained open in Glasgow The first minster said she knew it could appear ""counter-intuitive and difficult for people to understand"" why similar measures had not been introduced in Glasgow. But said she was now able to pursue a ""much more targeted and much more proportionate"" response to local clusters. She said: ""What we know from the analysis so far is that there is not - as there was in Aberdeen - an obvious connection between positive cases and pubs and clubs. It appears that it is more household transmission. ""I want to be clear that it is not just house parties. There might be an element of that, but it is also family transmission in smaller gatherings, where the virus spread from one household to another but it might just be an extended family coming in."" Ms Sturgeon said it was this information that led to the decision to impose household restrictions but not close pubs. The first minister added: ""The analysis we now get through test and protect enables us to be much more targeted and proportionate rather than what we were faced with earlier in the year of simply imposing a blanket lockdown everywhere that really meant everybody had to stay at home. ""Because these decisions have been guided by the analysis that has been done, hopefully these measures are effective - but of course we can't know that for sure."" Ms Sturgeon insisted that ""nobody is being punished"" by the measures, and said she has had to cancel a visit to her own parents as a result of the new restrictions. She said: ""I wish we could say we have a cluster here that was caused definitively by one person, and we put them under restrictions, but that's not how a virus operates. ""The risk is that it spreads in all sorts of different ways and unfortunately it is population-based measures we have to use to stop that happening.""

"People arriving in Wales and Scotland from Portugal must now self-isolate for 14 days, but the rules covering England and Northern Ireland are unchanged. The difference between the nations has been criticised as confusing. The rules for Wales apply from 04:00 BST on Friday, while in Scotland they begin 24 hours later on Saturday. Cases in Portugal have risen in the past week beyond the threshold at which ministers generally consider imposing 14-day mandatory self-isolation. The Department for Transport said decisions around adding or removing countries from the quarantine list ""take into account a range of factors"" - including how many people are being tested. ""Portugal has drastically increased its testing capacity, as well as taking measures to control the spread of the virus,"" said a spokesperson, adding it would closely monitor the situation. What are the UK's quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? The latest quarantine rulesintroduced in Walesapply to travellers from Portugal, Gibraltar, six Greek islands and French Polynesia. The six islands are Crete, Mykonos, Zakynthos (or Zante), Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos. Scotland has alreadyreintroduced self-isolation measures for arrivals from Greeceand has now addedPortugal and French Polynesiato its list of countries requiring quarantine. ""This week's data shows an increase in test positivity and cases per 100k in Portugal,"" said Scottish justice minister Humza Yousaf. Changes to the rules for arrivals from Greece coming to England have been considered - but Greece will stay on its safe list for now. In Portugal, the seven-day infection rate has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. This is above the threshold of 20 which is when the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Greece's rate overall is below the threshold at 13.8 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 2 September, down from 14.9 a week earlier. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday: ""There are no English additions or removals today. We continue to keep the travel corridor list under constant review and won't hesitate to remove countries if needed."" ""Nonetheless, holidaymakers are reminded - 14-day quarantine countries can and do change at very short notice."" He said the government takes several factors into account, including the prevalence of the virus as well as the level and rate of change, how many tests the country is doing, the extent of the contained outbreak and the government's actions. Northern Ireland's department of health also confirmed that NI would not make any further changes at present. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? The changes have drawn criticism from industry experts as well as holidaymakers. ""The quarantine policy is in tatters and dividing the United Kingdom,"" said Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy firm The PC Agency. ""Consumers are totally confused by the different approaches and it's impossible to understand the government's own criteria any more on when to add or remove a country. ""The current strategy has to change. The weekly reviews have been causing anxiety and financial pain for so many consumers and travel firms,"" he added. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""Days of speculation around this announcement meant many people rushed to pay extortionate prices for flights back to England to avoid having to quarantine on their return - only to now find out there was no need. ""The government knows this and yet it continues to offer no clarity around how these decisions are made."" One aviation boss described travelling abroad right now as ""quarantine roulette"" because the list of destinations which are affected keeps changing. But the governments in Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardiff are now clearly at odds over which countries pose a clear risk. Portugal's infection rate is above the UK government's benchmark of 20 cases of the virus for every 100,000 people. But the UK government has surprised us all and not added Portugal to the list for England. It's not clear why. Greece is even more complicated as the Welsh government is opting for a policy where only people arriving from certain Greek islands have to self-isolate while Scotland has introduced a quarantine for arrivals from across Greece. For months the travel industry has been lobbying the UK government for an approach where they consider particular regions in a country but ministers in London are not keen on the idea. The quarantine was already hard or impossible to police. But discrepancies between different UK nations makes it even harder as someone could, theoretically, fly into Newcastle from Greece and drive into Scotland. That person should self-isolate for 14 days, but no-one will be checking. Some holidaymakers have told the BBC they havepaid as much as Â£1,000 for flightsto get home from Portugal in anticipation of the rules changing. Kelly, from Birmingham, and her family changed their flights home from the Algarve from Saturday to Friday at a cost of Â£900 to avoid potential quarantine because she did not want her children to miss out on two weeks of school. The 45-year-old said the situation was ""absolutely disgusting"". ""It's cost us a lot more money and it's money we didn't need to spend now. We've lost an extra night in our villa - we won't get that back - we've got a hire car, so we're taking that back a day early."" She added: ""The government just change the goalposts left, right and centre at the moment. It's embarrassing."" Damian Martin from Swansea - who is currently on holiday in Lagos, Portugal - said he only arrived earlier on Thursday. ""Work had been full on so I decided to go,"" said Damian ""I had already switched my holiday from Spain and I won't be able to come back early,"" he said. ""I will be able to self-isolate, I think, but I work for a supermarket so will have to check in with them."" He added: ""I'm supposed to be here eight nights. I might as well try to enjoy it. Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal. Most head to the Algarve in the south, drawn by sunny Atlantic beaches, picturesque fishing villages and golf courses. During May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed.

"This video can not be played Trump suggests voters should submit ballot twice US President Donald Trump has told people in the state of North Carolina to vote twice in November's election, despite this being illegal. Mr Trump suggested voters send a postal vote and then vote in person in order to test the system. The president has frequently made false claims that postal votes are vulnerable to significant electoral fraud. ""Let them send it in and let them go vote,"" he told North Carolina broadcaster WECT-TV on Wednesday. ""And if the system is as good as they say it is then obviously they won't be able to vote (in person)."" On Thursday,he tweeted that,externalif people vote by post they should also go to the polling station ""to see whether or not your mail-in vote has been tabulated"" and vote in person if necessary. After President Trump made the initial comments, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein tweeted that he had ""outrageously encouraged"" people in the state to ""break the law in order to help him sow chaos in our election"". President Trump spoke to a local broadcaster in Wilmington, North Carolina ""Make sure you vote, but do not vote twice!"" Mr Stein added. ""I will do everything in my power to make sure the will of the people is upheld in November."" Read more: Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Democrats have also accused President Trump and the Republican party of attempting to suppress the vote in order to help their side in the election. President Trump was in Wilmington, North Carolina, to formally designate the city an American World War Two Heritage City. The electoral process is run by the individual states. Karen Brinson Bell, executive director for the North Carolina State Board of Elections,has reassured voters,externalthat there are numerous measures in place to prevent anyone getting two votes registered. Someone who has already voted by post would show up in an electronic pollbook used at polling stations, and prevented from voting, she said. Only the first vote would be recorded, she added. And audits are carried out after each election to check voter history against ballots cast. Voting twice intentionally is a crime, said Ms Brinson Bell. When Mr Trump's comments were put to Attorney General William Barr, he said it was unclear what the president meant. Several US states have allowed and encouraged postal voting for years. But the number of people voting by post is expected to vastly increase in 2020 due to fears about gathering at polling stations in a pandemic. As a result, dozens of US states have expanded postal voting for this election. There are concerns the large volume of postal ballots may mean it takes days or weeks to count them all, long after Election Day has passed. This isn't the first time President Trump has made controversial comments about postal voting. Speaking at the Republican National Convention (RNC) last month, he claimed ""there's tremendous fraud involved"" with postal voting and that ""we have to be very, very careful"". But these claims have been strongly and repeatedly debunked by experts. Ellen Weintraub, commissioner of the Federal Election Commission, responded at the time that ""there's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud"". A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? How you can be US president without winning most votes In addition, numerous nationwide and state-level studies over the years have not revealed evidence of major, widespread fraud. In the 2016 US presidential election, nearly one quarter of votes were cast by post, and that number is expected to rise this time round due to public health concerns over coronavirus. Individual US states control their own voting rules for federal elections - and many are looking to increase postal voting to prevent large gatherings at polling stations on election day. A number of states are planning to hold ""all-mail"" ballot elections this November. The rate of voting fraud overall in the US is between 0.00004% and 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice. Does US postal voting lead to fraud?

"The airline said 212 people in total were on the flight from Crete to Luton Eight teenage holidaymakers who travelled to the UK from Crete have tested positive for coronavirus. The boys were on board Wizz Air's flight 8168 from Heraklion to Luton Airport on 25 August. The airline said 212 people were on the flight but it had ""informed the relevant health authorities"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it was aware of the situation and was advising those affected to self-isolate. The teenagers, who are from Winchester, Hampshire, were part of a group of 12 on board the flight and had spent 10 days in Crete. Shortly after returning to the UK they were contacted by friends they had made on holiday from Estonia, who said they had tested positive upon their return home. The teenagers later took tests at a local drive-through centre. Damian Stafford, whose 18-year-old son tested positive, said his family had not been contacted by the NHS test-and-trace system. ""We've simply had to rely on the much vaunted British common sense and do things on our own without any help from the authorities, and what we're doing obviously is self-isolating,"" he said. ""The track-and-trace system doesn't have to be world beating, it just has to work, and it clearly doesn't at the moment."" Are Greece and Portugal next on the quarantine list? England under pressure to impose Greek quarantine Government 'overseeing the demise of UK aviation' The Department of Health and Social Care insisted the system was effective. It said: ""Hundreds of thousands of people are being tested every day and to make sure we stay in control of this virus, we are targeting our testing capacity at the areas that need it most, including those where there is an outbreak as well as prioritising at-risk groups."" Greece insisted it is doing ""everything in our power"" to keep UK holidaymakers safe In a statement, Wizz Air said: ""The airline has now informed the relevant health authorities in England who are responsible for contacting and advising the 204 other passengers who were on board the flight. ""Wizz Air operates all flights in compliance with local travel regulations, and the safety of passengers and staff is the number one priority."" The government has faced growing pressure to decide whether tourists returning to England from Greece should quarantine,after Scotland and Wales introduced their own measures. Leading figures in the aviation industry have also expressed frustration the government has still not given its backing for testing at airports, akin to systems in place in Germany and France, in order to avoid quarantine measures for those returning from countries with higher rates of infection. Meanwhile, Greece has insisted it is doing ""everything in our power"" to keep UK holidaymakers safe.

"Tony Abbott is visiting the UK Ministers have defended former Australian PM Tony Abbott amid reports that he is being lined up for a role in post-Brexit trade talks. Trade Minister Greg Hands told MPs he welcomed Mr Abbott's desire to ""help this country out"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he had ""real concerns"" and ""wouldn't appoint"" Mr Abbott if he were PM. Mr Abbott says he has had talks with UK ministers about a role but it has yet to be officially confirmed. Opposition and some Tory MPs say he is unfit to represent the UK due to his views on climate change and past ""misogynist"" and ""homophobic"" comments. A group of equality activists - including actor Sir Ian McKellen and Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies - have alsowritten an open letter against Mr Abbott's appointment,external, saying: ""This man is not fit to be representing the UK as our trade envoy."" Mr Abbott's position would be as a member of the UK board of trade, a panel of experts that is being put together to advise International Trade Secretary Liz Truss. Who is Tony Abbott? New Zealand 'frustrated' over UK trade talks End tariffs on UK-made ice cream vans - minister Asked about the potential appointment in the Commons, Mr Hands said: ""No appointments have been confirmed, but personally I welcome the fact that a former prime minister of Australia is willing to help this country out."" On Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked on Sky News about concerns surrounding Mr Abbott's attitude towards women and homosexuality. Mr Hancock said he did not believe Mr Abbott is homophobic or misogynistic, and when pushed, he added: ""He is also an expert on trade."" Reports that Mr Abbott, who was Australia's prime minister between 2013 and 2015 is being lined up to work alongside Liz Truss have been met with anger from UK opposition parties and some Conservative MPs. Labour MPs Chris Bryant and Wes Streeting, who are both gay, accused Mr Hancock of hypocrisy after the health secretarytweeted about the ""fantastic"" new LGBT-inclusive relationships,externaland sex education programme introduced in schools. Mr Bryant said: ""So why on earth would you countenance Tony Abbott as a trade envoy?"" Mr Streeting tweeted: ""Matt, we know you're a social liberal with a decent voting record on LGBT equality. That's why your defence of Tony Abbott was even more nauseating."" Sir Keir said: ""I have real concerns about Tony Abbott, I don't think he's the right person for the job. If I was prime minister, I wouldn't appoint him."" Labour MP Marie Rimmer added: ""Surely there's trade experts who aren't homophobic and misogynists? Britain deserves better than Tony Abbott representing us on the world stage."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Abbott's coronavirus views were ""deeply offensive and wrong"" and he was not fit to be a trade envoy. ""But Tony Abbott, before these comments, is a misogynist, he's a sexist, he's a climate change denier,"" she told Sky News. ""Trade, in many respects, should reflect our values - there should be ethics attached to any country's trading profile."" Liz Truss is in charge of negotiating trade deals with other countries International Trade Secretary Liz Truss was later asked in the Commons about the possible appointment. Following criticism from Labour MP Ruth Cadbury, Ms Truss said: ""I think it's absolute hypocrisy to hear this type of argument from the Labour Party. ""This is a party that has never elected a female leader despite having the opportunity time and time again. ""The reality is they'd rather virtue signal and indulge in tokenism rather than take real action to improve the lives of women."" Labour's Christian Matheson said: ""The appointment of the sexist and homophobic Tony Abbott is also the appointment of a climate change denier. ""So does this indicate the government is moving away from any commitment in trade deals to maintain environmental protection? And if not, why have you put him in the job?"" Ms Truss replied: ""The reality is that those on the left of politics are always intolerant of anyone who doesn't agree with them but are prepared to defend anything from their own friends."" Conservative MP and chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat was asked about the criticism of Mr Abbott. Speaking on BBC News, he said: ""I would like to see people from the United Kingdom representing the regions and nations. ""Businessmen, politicians and industry leaders from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and the different regions from Cornwall and Kent and wherever else in between, making the case that isn't simply trade based on a few narrow industries."" Mr Abbott who led Australia's Liberal Party between 2009 and 2015, was challenged about some of his past comments at a hearing of Mr Tugendhat's select committee on Tuesday. Labour MP Claudia Webbe quoted remarks attributed to him in 2012, that men were by physiology or temperament, more adapted than women to exercise authority and issue commands, and asked if, in the light of that opinion, he would have difficulty accepting the authority of Liz Truss. Mr Abbott said he ""wasn't sure"" he had ever used those words, and that it ""doesn't sound like anything I've said"". The former Australian prime minister is said to have struck up a friendship with Boris Johnson when he was foreign secretary.

Despite his injuries, Chalmers said he wanted to be treated like ""any other contestant"" and didn't want any ""special treatment"". ""Whoever I partner with they've got their work cut out,"" he added. Bill Baileyis an comedian, actor and musician is known for appearances on TV shows like QI, Black Books and Never Mind the Buzzcocks. ""In these strange times we're living through, it feels right to do something different and take on a new challenge,"" he said in a statement. ""I haven't been to stage school and learnt to dance. I haven't lived for the dance... I'm not really Lord of the Dance. I'm caretaker of the dance,"" he joked.

She previously worked as a producer and reporter for the BBC for 12 years, and presented BBC North West Tonight. Singh said: ""The initial feeling of being confirmed for Strictly is one of complete terror - feels like embarking on a rollercoaster, where you really want to do it but you are equally scared. ""Hopefully after the first dance I will feel exhilarated rather than sick!""

"Portugal has been added to Wales' quarantine list but not England's People arriving in Wales from mainland Portugal and six Greek islands must self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST Friday. It is the first time the Welsh Governmenthas set different quarantine rules from the UK government. People returning from Gibraltar and French Polynesia will also be required to self-isolate. Crete, Zakynthos, Mykonos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos are among the Greek islands affected. Portugal will also be added to the Scottish quarantine listfrom Saturday, but advice for travellers in England, issued by the UK government, and in Northern Ireland remains unchanged. Portugal was only removed from the quarantine rules less than two weeks ago. The Portuguese islands of the Azores and Madeira were not included in Thursday's announcement. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was acting on public health advice, and had sought a meeting with the UK government but was not able to get one. The decision follows a number of coronavirus cases in Wales linked to flights from Zakynthos, anda rise in cases in Portugal. Travellers to Wales from the Greek island were asked toself-isolateearlier in the week, but Thursday's changes mean those who do not self-isolate now face potential fines of Â£1,000. Greece? Portugal? Spain? What are the quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? UK split over Portugal quarantine rules There had been 20 cases connected to one flight from Zante to Cardiff Airport. The quarantine rules apply to travellers arriving home in Wales regardless of what part of the UK they return through - including English airports. Mr Gething said he took the decision because of a large number of coronavirus cases ""imported into Wales from tourists returning from the Greek islands"". He said there were more than 20 cases confirmed in passengers on one flight from Zakynthos to Cardiff. But UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday there were no changes in England. Mr Gething said he had hoped to discuss the situation with the UK government and counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but a meeting on Thursday was not possible. ""My responsibility is to make the right choices to keep Wales safe. My preference is to do that on a four-nation basis where possible,"" he said. ""If it isn't possible, I still have to make the right choice for Wales."" Although he said it was possible people could be fined, he added: ""That is the very last step that I want us to take."" Damian Martin arrived in Portugal on Wednesday Damian Martin, from Swansea, arrived in Lagos, Portugal, on Wednesday after having already switched his holiday from Spain. He said he would not be able to return early. The supermarket employee said he believed he would be able to self-isolate: ""My work said they would deal with it if it came to it."" ""I thought I'd be fine going to the Algarve, that most cases would be in the north,"" he said. ""Work had been full on and I really really needed a break, so I decided to go. I'm supposed to be here eight nights. I might as well try to enjoy it."" Jon Lake and his wife Nicole were due to celebrate their 10-year wedding anniversary by returning to Lake Garda, Italy, where they tied the knot. But the family, who are currently on holiday in Crete, will now have to mark the special day in their home in Cardiff, as they will be in self-isolating. ""It's all down the pan, we had wanted to do something special, now it will likely be pasta and a glass of wine back home,"" he said. Jon, who works in pharmaceuticals, said he had tracked the cases every day before going on the two-week Greek break. ""I wanted to give my family a little bit of normality, and now it is ruined,"" he said. ""We are now going back into a worse situation, it's a mess."" His oldest son, aged six, was due to start back at school, but will now have to quarantine. Mr Lake said he was angry with the Welsh Government for changing the rules, which he said ""made no logical sense"". ""They've literally given people eight hours to get home, what is Vaughan Gething expecting us to do - get a private plane? It's a joke,"" he said. For some the different rules among the nations have caused confusion and anger. Martin, lives in Gladestry, Powys, and while his village is in Wales, he has an English postcode. Having arrived home from Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, he said he was halfway through the two-week self-isolation period, but had not had any contact from the government. ""My friend who lives a few miles away in a Welsh postcode has had an email from the government about isolation,"" he said ""I live inside the border of Wales - we pay our council tax to a Welsh council, the schools are Welsh but the postcode is English. ""It's mixed messaging. Why can't the country stick together?"" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? Because it is a public health measure, the quarantine system in Wales is set by the Welsh Government. Up until now, Wales has followed the UK government in deciding which countries travellers could return from and not need to self-isolate. It has also followed any changes made, including the recent decision to order travellers from Switzerland to quarantine. Travellers abroad are expected tofill in a form online,externalwith their contact details 48 hours before they arrive back in the UK. Not providing accurate details could alsoresult in fines of Â£1,920,external. Crete is among the places included in the announcement Wales, for the first time, has now announced significantly different quarantine rules to those across the border. The Welsh health minister says this action came after ""clear advice"" from the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) that travel from these countries poses a public health risk. But the UK government's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also cited the JBC when announcing there was no need for additions or removals to the travel corridor list for England today. These differences come with complications. With only one major airport in Wales - Cardiff - many passengers flying into places like Bristol or Birmingham will land into one set of rules but face another when they get home. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said it would be ""better if, when travel measures are announced, they are done on a joint basis"" across the four nations. ""This would help keep everyone informed and safe,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the experience ""with Zakynthos tells us that the quicker a Welsh Government can act, the better"". Are you affected by the new quarantine rules?

"Bosses in charge of the coronavirus testing system have apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand. Some people are being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England, said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted the ""vast majority"" of people could still get appointments nearby. How do I get a coronavirus test? Testing and tracing 'key to schools returning' Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again The booking website is now prioritising high-risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted numbers of home testing kits and fewer booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said they were working hard to rectify the problem and a new lab facility would be opened in the coming weeks. By Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. But Prof Paul Hunter, a public health expert at the University of East Anglia, said these issues could act as a ""big disincentive to being tested"" and result in local increases being missed. David was offered a test in Blackburn when he lives in Suffolk David Llewellyntried to book a test on Sunday and was directed to a test centre near Blackburn - 250 miles and the other side of England from his home in Stowmarket, Suffolk. ""I thought I'd entered my home location incorrectly so went through the booking process again, only to get the same location for testing. Needless to say I have subsequently ordered a home testing kit, which despite three automated email reminders to take the test has yet to arrive. I'd do the test if I had it. I think it's ridiculous."" Lucy Evans lives in Pooleon the south coast. She was offered a test 220 miles away in Oldham and Blackburn. She tried again and was offered the Isle of Wight. ""I tried 14 times to get a test nearer and in the end had to get a home test as I ran out of time to get this done within five days. By the time I was tested my symptoms had disappeared."" Lucy tested negative for Covid on Tuesday. Lisa lives in Plymouthand tried to get a test for her 14-year-old son. She was offered a test 688 miles away in Inverness. ""People aren't going to travel all that way for a test are they? You'd just have to make stops along the way and could be spreading it around if you had the virus."" She eventually got a test locally and her son was negative. The government says the network of labs used to process tests has capacity to process 250,000 tests a day at the moment. Currently around 175,000 tests a day are being processed, which the government has said is more per head of population than many countries. But the government said it has faced problems because demand is not smooth - at weekends it drops and on weekdays there can be surges. Over the past month it has meant a backlog has developed, meaning the time taken to turnaround tests has been increasing. To curb demand, the availability of slots at testing centres have been reduced. The government said it has done this to ensure high risk areas, including care homes and towns with high rates of infections, can be prioritised for testing. The most recent data shows test results are now being provided more quickly, with the average turnaround time 24 hours or less for mobile testing units and local testing centres. It also said booking slots open up throughout the day so if people keep trying they should be able to get a more convenient location for a test, or order a home test. A new lab is also being opened near Loughborough at the end of the month that will be able to process 50,000 tests a day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there were some ""operational challenges"", but said the ""vast majority"" of people could get a test close to home. Mr Hancock also set out plans to pilot more rapid, easy-to-use tests. A Â£500m programme is under way to trial a range of different tests, including ones that use saliva (instead of nose and throat swabs) and tests that can be processed quickly, and sometimes on the spot - at the moment swab tests are sent off to labs to be processed. Repeat testing of members of the public will be tried out in Salford in Greater Manchester. Meanwhile, students and school pupils in Southampton will also be tested weekly in another study. The technologies open up the prospect of mass population testing which, if successful, could reduce the need for social distancing. Mr Hancock said: ""Short of a vaccine, this is the best chance we have of reducing social distancing whilst controlling the virus, especially with winter coming and all the challenges that brings."" But he refused to be drawn on a timescale for when this might become available, saying it was essential to see if they worked first. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances for virus tests, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient testing capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June - and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country. There's been an apology to those who were told to go 100 miles or more for a test. Officials acknowledge that resources are stretched and have to be targeted at areas with local outbreaks. But they point out that a new ""mega lab"" is set to come on stream in the east Midlands soon. They also argue that trials of new rapid testing techniques will be expanded, which could prove to be game-changers. For now though, the system is stretched, even though the official numbers suggest capacity is running ahead of demand. Questions will continue to be asked about whether the system can cope with challenges ahead, with schools returning and winter approaching.

He said he would not be able to return early. The supermarket employee said he believed he would be able to self-isolate: ""My work said they would deal with it if it came to it."" ""I thought I'd be fine going to the Algarve, that most cases would be in the north,"" he said. ""Work had been full on and I really really needed a break, so I decided to go. I'm supposed to be here eight nights. I might as well try to enjoy it."" Jon Lake and his wife Nicole were due to celebrate their 10-year wedding anniversary by returning to Lake Garda, Italy, where they tied the knot. But the family, who are currently on holiday in Crete, will now have to mark the special day in their home in Cardiff, as they will be in self-isolating. ""It's all down the pan, we had wanted to do something special, now it will likely be pasta and a glass of wine back home,"" he said. Jon, who works in pharmaceuticals, said he had tracked the cases every day before going on the two-week Greek break. ""I wanted to give my family a little bit of normality, and now it is ruined,"" he said. ""We are now going back into a worse situation, it's a mess."" His oldest son, aged six, was due to start back at school, but will now have to quarantine. Mr Lake said he was angry with the Welsh Government for changing the rules, which he said ""made no logical sense"". ""They've literally given people eight hours to get home, what is Vaughan Gething expecting us to do - get a private plane? It's a joke,"" he said. For some the different rules among the nations have caused confusion and anger. Martin, lives in Gladestry, Powys, and while his village is in Wales, he has an English postcode. Having arrived home from Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, he said he was halfway through the two-week self-isolation period, but had not had any contact from the government. ""My friend who lives a few miles away in a Welsh postcode has had an email from the government about isolation,"" he said ""I live inside the border of Wales - we pay our council tax to a Welsh council, the schools are Welsh but the postcode is English. ""It's mixed messaging. Why can't the country stick together?"" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? Because it is a public health measure, the quarantine system in Wales is set by the Welsh Government. Up until now, Wales has followed the UK government in deciding which countries travellers could return from and not need to self-isolate. It has also followed any changes made, including the recent decision to order travellers from Switzerland to quarantine. Travellers abroad are expected tofill in a form online,externalwith their contact details 48 hours before they arrive back in the UK. Not providing accurate details could alsoresult in fines of Â£1,920,external. Crete is among the places included in the announcement Wales, for the first time, has now announced significantly different quarantine rules to those across the border. The Welsh health minister says this action came after ""clear advice"" from the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) that travel from these countries poses a public health risk. But the UK government's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also cited the JBC when announcing there was no need for additions or removals to the travel corridor list for England today. These differences come with complications. With only one major airport in Wales - Cardiff - many passengers flying into places like Bristol or Birmingham will land into one set of rules but face another when they get home. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said it would be ""better if, when travel measures are announced, they are done on a joint basis"" across the four nations. ""This would help keep everyone informed and safe,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the experience ""with Zakynthos tells us that the quicker a Welsh Government can act, the better"". Are you affected by the new quarantine rules?

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says there are 101 new positive cases, 53 of them in the Greater Glasgow area One more death, which took place in mid-August, has been recorded following a positive test Ms Sturgeon says the R number is probably now above one, and could be as high as 1.4 Home Farm care home on Skye, where 10 residents died from Covid-19, will be taken into NHS ownership Health officials have found evidence of coronavirus spreading in schools in Glasgow BBC Scotland News If you are just joining us, the key points from the Scottish government briefing are:  That's all from us on the live page, please take care and stay safe. Simon
  Johnson from The
  Telegraph says he spoke to Professor Linda Bauld who said she does not think the elimination strategy is going well, given the rise in cases. He says he asked the professor if Scotland had adopted a Wack-A-Mole tactic and she said absolutely. The first minister says she thinks a great deal of Linda Bauld who she says is an expert who talks a lot of sense. Ms Sturgeon adds that she is advised by experts on how to keep this virus to the lowest possible level and eliminate it if possible. When outbreaks occur the government will try to hit them hard, but ""elimination is my objective"". Professor Leitch adds that the Glasgow area outbreak is not affecting very young children or very elderly people. ""It's families and young adults...in general terms its mixed households by gender and its mixed age groups,"" he says. That's good as the very old are the most vulnerable and one of the reasons for the restrictions is to protect that, he adds. Libby
  Brooks from The
  Guardian asks for more detail on the targeted restrictions brought in for the Glasgow area. The first minister replies that the outbreak is still ongoing and the Test and Protect work continues. The government will try to give people as full a picture as it develops, Ms Sturgeon pledges. One of the issues is that the outbreak is more disparate than we have seen, which requires targeted measures, she says. She points out that the decisions are informed by date, but also involve a lot of judgement. Tom Martin from the Daily Express wonders why the restrictions in the west of Scotland are so broad and cannot be more targeted. He also asks about how to deal with the feeling some might have about being punished for others' behaviours. ""Nobody's being punished,"" replies Ms Sturgeon. She says she wishes she was able to say precisely where a cluster started, but unfortunately population-based measures are necessary. ""We will try to be as targeted as possible. That can often be more difficult in a city,"" she adds. Jason Leitch adds that in some cases in has been more appropriate to go down to postcode level, such as in the Dumfries & Galloway case which was linked to Carlisle hospital employees. Katrine
  Bussey from PA asks if the previous owners of Home Farm, HC One, will make a profit from its sale to NHS Highland. If so, is that not them being rewarded financially for providing a service which the health secretary says ""put at risk life and limb"", asks Ms Bussey. Jeane Freeman says the government must do everything possible to protect citizens. The health secretary says the conclusion of the negotiations with HC One have provided stability and security for the residents and has been the best use of public funds. To have done anything else would have led to a financial arrangement that would have cost a lot more, she explains. Globalâs Mr Knight also queries why
the NHS is still seeking to buy Home Farm care home when the court action has
been dropped by the Care Inspectorate. The health secretary says the Care
Inspectorate assessed at the time the situation at the care home was a risk to
life and limb. NHS Highland then stepped in to
provide support and leadership â which meant the need for the Care Inspectorate
to go to court was reduced, she says. However, this improvement needs to
be sustained and the conclusion was this would not be the case if NHS Highland
stepped away, Ms Freeman explains. Fraser Knight from Global says the
incidence rate in Greece is 14 people per 100,000. This compares with 22 per
100,000 in Glasgow, suggesting it is safer to holiday in Greece right now
than Glasgow. Should people avoid holidaying in
Glasgow for the next two weeks?, he asks. The first minister says the advice
for Glasgow residents is about not going into other peopleâs houses as that is
what seems to be driving transmission. Cases per 100,000 is not the only
measure to look at as getting an accurate measure will depend on the volume of
testing, she adds. She highlights that in Glasgow the rate
of return for positive test results in Scotland yesterday was around 1%, but in
Glasgow it was 2.2%. Alan
  Smith from Bauer returns to the issue of quarantine and the decision to impose it on people arriving from Greece. Mr Smith asks why the policy covers all of Greece, while in Wales the policy only applies to Zante. He also asks if the case numbers keep dropping in Glasgow will the restrictions be lifted earlier? The first minister points out that we have to be cautious about individual days and need to look at the average over seven days. There is a lot of judgement applied to the restrictions, she adds, pointing out the drivers of transmission can produce the same numbers in different areas. On Greece, the Scottish government will come to its decision and other countries will have to come to their own decisions, Ms Sturgeon says. Peter Macmahon from ITV Border quotes
the first minister saying the virus was âfirmly in retreatâ in June. He asks
whether this assessment was too optimistic or are we on track to get back to
our normal lives. Ms Sturgeon highlights there is a
lot more normality back into our lives, but adds it is not a situation where we
can go back to normal fully. An infectious virus is still out
there, she adds. âWe are fighting it in different
ways now than we were when lockdown was much, much more restrictive,â the first
minister says. She also highlights uncertainty
about how the changing seasons will impact the virus. National Clinical Director Jason Leitch adds that it's quite difficult to be sure where the positive cases are among teachers and pupils. Professor Leitch points out he expects transmission in schools and  and Test and Protect will interrupt the chains of transmission. ""It may be that a few kids or few teachers, or maybe a class at a time will have to be isolated,"" he says. ""We hope, it's not impossible that a school will have to close, we hope that will be kept to an absolute minimum."" The first time we have school transmission is not such an important  moment, he points out. Ewan Petrie from STV points out we have nowseen the first cases of transmission in schoolsand
unions have raised concerns about social distancing there. He asks if the first minister is satisfied the current
guidelines are enough to mitigate the risk to staff and pupils. The first minister replies: ""I don't think it is yet the case that we can definitively say that there has been transmission within schools."" She explains: ""We have never tried to claim that we won't have instances of transmission within schools and the guidance that is in place is designed, as effectively as possible, to mitigate against that."" The first minister points out that well under 1% of the tests taken by younger people and children have been positive. Lucy Whyte from BBC Scotland points to warnings about job losses in the aviation industry and asks whether airports could take on a role in testing for Covid-19. The first minister says the government is continuing to look at whether there are ""effective alternatives"" to quarantine, but due to the period of incubation of the virus a test may not pick up all positive cases. ""Quarantine for 14 days is the most effective way to mitigate the risk of positive cases coming into the country,"" she adds. National clinical director Jason Leitch says he hopes science will hopefully help out with this dilemma, but for now quarantine from some countries is the safest thing to do. Allow Twitter content?

Nicola Sturgeon says the cases in the Glasgow area should be a wake-up call for all of us. The first minister stresses again that people must follow the five
pieces of advice in FACTS: They are: The first minister says some people may wonder why Test and Protect is not stopping these outbreaks. Ms Sturgeon explains Test and Protect is a vital part of the approach, however it is not the equivalent of a vaccine. ""It doesn't magically make Covid go away,"" she says. ""What it does is step in on these occasions when the virus gets past us. All of us when we follow all the advice are the first line of defence against it."" Health Secretary Jeane Freeman confirms the Home Farm care home in Portree is to be bought by NHS Highland. The home is currently owned by HC One, but NHS Highland has previously stepped in after concerns were raised by the Care Inspectorate. A number of residents died at the care home earlier this year from coronavirus. All staff will be moved onto NHS contracts, says Ms Freeman, which will provide more security and better conditions. The health secretary also confirms new guidance on communal activities and says visiting at adult care homes has also been published today. From 7 September, care homes that meet the criteria will be able to resume services from medical specialists. Ms Sturgeon says transmission in Glasgow appears to be largely household based. ""That is what led to the decision to impose household restrictions, but not close pubs,"" she says. She points out the government is trying to be much more guided and targeted with the measures it introduces. They will be reviewed in a week, the first minister reminds us. The first minister returns to the new restrictions following the rise in cases in the Glasgow area. Restrictions  on visiting other householdswere reintroduced in Glasgow and two neighbouring areason Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon says Test and Protect has indicated the cases in Glasgow City, West Dunbartonshire and East
Renfrewshire are not linked to any big outbreak. They are instead associated with multiple, smaller, unconnected household-based clusters. ""That then raises a concern about the risks of wider community transmission,"" she says. The first minister adds: ""Doing nothing was not an option."" Ms Sturgeon explains that Test and Protect provides intelligence, informing the actions that need to be taken by the government. The first minister says measures can then be targeted specifically, as they were with the 2 Sisters Coupar Angus outbreak. She points out that Test and Protect also identified in Aberdeen that the outbreak started in pubs and there was a danger of community transmission. The first minster says again that specific measures were brought in to fight that cluster and the Aberdeen outbreak is now effectively over. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Home Office confirmed a record 416 migrants arrived on Wednesday French authorities are ""just as committed"" as the UK to stopping migrants crossing the Channel in small boats, MPs have been told. The Home Affairs Select Committee heard evidence from Dan O'Mahoney, the Home Office's clandestine Channel threat commander, who said France had stopped 3,000 people crossing in 2020. On Wednesday,a record 416 migrants crossed the Channelfrom France. Mr O'Mahoney said almost 200 were stopped by the French on the same day. Citing one example from Wednesday, he told the committee: ""[They] stopped a very large Rib [rigid inflatable boat] with unbelievably 63 people on it from leaving the beach. ""There is a lot of joint working and it is delivering results."" However, the former Royal Marine who reports directly to the Home Secretary, conceded: ""It's nowhere near the level we'd like it to be and that is frustrating."" Dan O'Mahoney said Border Force officers treated migrants ""with humanity"" Mr O'Mahoney praised Border Force for ""doing a fantastic job"". ""Their professionalism and skill is notable and the humanity with which they treat migrants is genuinely impressive,"" he said. The committee was also told many migrants are forced on to small boats and some who arrive in England ""don't even want to come to the UK"". Mr O'Mahoney said: ""We hear a lot of stories about migrants who are literally forced on to boats, have no idea where they are when they get to the UK, because the facilitators don't get paid until they've done that last leg of the journey."" Travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, better security at the Channel Tunnel and recent good weather ""has had a significant impact in the increase in crossings [in small boats],"" he added. More than 7,400 migrants have crossed the Channel in small boats since January 2019. Abi Tierney, director general of UK visas and immigration at the Home Office, said the numbers of those seeking asylum had dropped from more than 10,000 in the first three months of the year to 5,789 in the second three months. ""France, Germany, Italy and Greece accept a much larger proportion of asylum seekers - they stay there, and a small number come to us,"" she said. She said of the 5,000 migrants arriving so far this year, 98% had claimed asylum. About half of those applications have been considered so far, she said, with 71% rejected because the UK was not the responsible country - the migrants had travelled through a safe country before arriving in the UK.

"Tony Abbott is visiting the UK Ministers have defended former Australian PM Tony Abbott amid reports that he is being lined up for a role in post-Brexit trade talks. Trade Minister Greg Hands told MPs he welcomed Mr Abbott's desire to ""help this country out"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he had ""real concerns"" and ""wouldn't appoint"" Mr Abbott if he were PM. Mr Abbott says he has had talks with UK ministers about a role but it has yet to be officially confirmed. Opposition and some Tory MPs say he is unfit to represent the UK due to his views on climate change and past ""misogynist"" and ""homophobic"" comments. A group of equality activists - including actor Sir Ian McKellen and Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies - have alsowritten an open letter against Mr Abbott's appointment,external, saying: ""This man is not fit to be representing the UK as our trade envoy."" Mr Abbott's position would be as a member of the UK board of trade, a panel of experts that is being put together to advise International Trade Secretary Liz Truss. Who is Tony Abbott? New Zealand 'frustrated' over UK trade talks End tariffs on UK-made ice cream vans - minister Asked about the potential appointment in the Commons, Mr Hands said: ""No appointments have been confirmed, but personally I welcome the fact that a former prime minister of Australia is willing to help this country out."" On Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked on Sky News about concerns surrounding Mr Abbott's attitude towards women and homosexuality. Mr Hancock said he did not believe Mr Abbott is homophobic or misogynistic, and when pushed, he added: ""He is also an expert on trade."" Reports that Mr Abbott, who was Australia's prime minister between 2013 and 2015 is being lined up to work alongside Liz Truss have been met with anger from UK opposition parties and some Conservative MPs. Labour MPs Chris Bryant and Wes Streeting, who are both gay, accused Mr Hancock of hypocrisy after the health secretarytweeted about the ""fantastic"" new LGBT-inclusive relationships,externaland sex education programme introduced in schools. Mr Bryant said: ""So why on earth would you countenance Tony Abbott as a trade envoy?"" Mr Streeting tweeted: ""Matt, we know you're a social liberal with a decent voting record on LGBT equality. That's why your defence of Tony Abbott was even more nauseating."" Sir Keir said: ""I have real concerns about Tony Abbott, I don't think he's the right person for the job. If I was prime minister, I wouldn't appoint him."" Labour MP Marie Rimmer added: ""Surely there's trade experts who aren't homophobic and misogynists? Britain deserves better than Tony Abbott representing us on the world stage."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Abbott's coronavirus views were ""deeply offensive and wrong"" and he was not fit to be a trade envoy. ""But Tony Abbott, before these comments, is a misogynist, he's a sexist, he's a climate change denier,"" she told Sky News. ""Trade, in many respects, should reflect our values - there should be ethics attached to any country's trading profile."" Liz Truss is in charge of negotiating trade deals with other countries International Trade Secretary Liz Truss was later asked in the Commons about the possible appointment. Following criticism from Labour MP Ruth Cadbury, Ms Truss said: ""I think it's absolute hypocrisy to hear this type of argument from the Labour Party. ""This is a party that has never elected a female leader despite having the opportunity time and time again. ""The reality is they'd rather virtue signal and indulge in tokenism rather than take real action to improve the lives of women."" Labour's Christian Matheson said: ""The appointment of the sexist and homophobic Tony Abbott is also the appointment of a climate change denier. ""So does this indicate the government is moving away from any commitment in trade deals to maintain environmental protection? And if not, why have you put him in the job?"" Ms Truss replied: ""The reality is that those on the left of politics are always intolerant of anyone who doesn't agree with them but are prepared to defend anything from their own friends."" Conservative MP and chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat was asked about the criticism of Mr Abbott. Speaking on BBC News, he said: ""I would like to see people from the United Kingdom representing the regions and nations. ""Businessmen, politicians and industry leaders from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and the different regions from Cornwall and Kent and wherever else in between, making the case that isn't simply trade based on a few narrow industries."" Mr Abbott who led Australia's Liberal Party between 2009 and 2015, was challenged about some of his past comments at a hearing of Mr Tugendhat's select committee on Tuesday. Labour MP Claudia Webbe quoted remarks attributed to him in 2012, that men were by physiology or temperament, more adapted than women to exercise authority and issue commands, and asked if, in the light of that opinion, he would have difficulty accepting the authority of Liz Truss. Mr Abbott said he ""wasn't sure"" he had ever used those words, and that it ""doesn't sound like anything I've said"". The former Australian prime minister is said to have struck up a friendship with Boris Johnson when he was foreign secretary.

"Tim Davie took over as director general on Tuesday The BBC's new director general has said he doesn't support any switch from the licence fee to a subscription service. In his first speech since taking over, Tim Davie said such a change ""would make us just another media company""  that serves only ""the few"". But he told staff there must be ""a radical shift in our focus"" so everyone gets value from the licence fee. He warned that the BBC currently faces a ""significant risk"" and has ""no inalienable right to exist"". He said: ""If current trends continue, we will not feel indispensable enough to all our audience. We must evolve to protect what we cherish."" The licence fee is currently guaranteed until 2027, but there is a debate about the BBC's funding beyond that. Do I need a TV licence and what does it pay for? The Gavin and Stacey Christmas special was the most-watched programme of 2019 ""For the avoidance of doubt, I do not want a subscription BBC that serves the few,"" Davie said during the speech in Cardiff. ""We could make a decent business out of it, and I suspect it could do quite well in certain postcodes, but it would make us just another media company serving a specific group."" Describing the BBC as ""a brilliant national success"", he said: ""We all recognise when someone says, 'I would pay my licence fee for Radio 4, for Strictly, or for the website'. ""But this kind of connection is under pressure and cannot be taken for granted. Across the UK, across all political views, across all of society, and across all age groups, people must feel their BBC is here for them, not for us."" That would not be achieved by beating rivals at their own game, but by being ""more rather than less BBC, more distinctive, and committed to our unique public service mission"", he explained. The top priority would be to ""renew our commitment to impartiality"", he said. Impartiality is ""the very essence of who we are"" and is possible to achieve even in polarised times. ""It is not simply about left or right. This is more about whether people feel we see the world from their point of view. Our research shows that too many perceive us to be shaped by a particular perspective."" He added: ""If you want to be an opinionated columnist or a partisan campaigner on social media then that is a valid choice, but you should not be working at the BBC."" New social media guidelines for presenters and staff will be ""rigorously enforced"", he said. Davie also said: The BBC has tried to compete with rivals ""by making more and spreading ourselves too thinly"". It should focus on ""unique, high-impact work that is loved, including by those who feel more distant from us"" and make ""more impact by making less"". He ruled out shutting TV channels or radio networks in the short term - but said he would ""not hesitate to close channels if they do not offer value to our audiences"". There will be staff cuts to make ""a simpler, leaner organisation"". He said there is ""still too much bureaucracy"", so he will ""remove unnecessary committees and meetings"" and ""keep a focus on cost reduction"". He said he regretted that the BBC had ""not gone further to create a more diverse and inclusive"" organisation. He pledged to make sure it ""reflects more accurately the society we serve"" in terms of gender, race, disability, socioeconomic status and sexuality. Other priorities are to extract more value from online services and increase commercial income. ""Value for all"", the phrase Tim Davie says will define his tenure as DG, is clever. ""Value"" is a commercial idea, and therefore alludes to his background in the private sector and the ferocious competition the BBC faces globally today. And ""all"" connotes the idea of a universal public service. In three words, that phrase captures both Davie's heritage and challenge, and the ""enlightened blend"", to borrow his phrase, of free market and public service sensibilities he embodies. Print headlines will likely focus on his warning shot, especially but not exclusively to those on air, about impartiality. He thinks social media activism and column-writing don't mix with working for the BBC. The big, as yet unanswered, question is whether he will clamp down on the tweeting of BBC contributors who don't work for BBC News, such as Gary Lineker. Davie is undoubtedly energetic and decisive, and of the two dozen staff I've spoken to in the past 24 hours, there was unanimous excitement and positive feeling. But as he himself acknowledged, talking about change is easy. Actually delivering it in a post-pandemic world is very hard. He'll be judged on the latter. After his speech, Davie was interviewed by BBC head of creative diversity June Sarpong, who later described his vision for ""a truly inclusive BBC"" as ""a daunting and difficult task but one he is committed to achieving"".

"People arriving in Wales and Scotland from Portugal must now self-isolate for 14 days, but the rules covering England and Northern Ireland are unchanged. The difference between the nations has been criticised as confusing. The rules for Wales apply from 04:00 BST on Friday, while in Scotland they begin 24 hours later on Saturday. Cases in Portugal have risen in the past week beyond the threshold at which ministers generally consider imposing 14-day mandatory self-isolation. The Department for Transport said decisions around adding or removing countries from the quarantine list ""take into account a range of factors"" - including how many people are being tested. ""Portugal has drastically increased its testing capacity, as well as taking measures to control the spread of the virus,"" said a spokesperson, adding it would closely monitor the situation. What are the UK's quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? The latest quarantine rulesintroduced in Walesapply to travellers from Portugal, Gibraltar, six Greek islands and French Polynesia. The six islands are Crete, Mykonos, Zakynthos (or Zante), Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos. Scotland has alreadyreintroduced self-isolation measures for arrivals from Greeceand has now addedPortugal and French Polynesiato its list of countries requiring quarantine. ""This week's data shows an increase in test positivity and cases per 100k in Portugal,"" said Scottish justice minister Humza Yousaf. Changes to the rules for arrivals from Greece coming to England have been considered - but Greece will stay on its safe list for now. In Portugal, the seven-day infection rate has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. This is above the threshold of 20 which is when the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Greece's rate overall is below the threshold at 13.8 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 2 September, down from 14.9 a week earlier. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday: ""There are no English additions or removals today. We continue to keep the travel corridor list under constant review and won't hesitate to remove countries if needed."" ""Nonetheless, holidaymakers are reminded - 14-day quarantine countries can and do change at very short notice."" He said the government takes several factors into account, including the prevalence of the virus as well as the level and rate of change, how many tests the country is doing, the extent of the contained outbreak and the government's actions. Northern Ireland's department of health also confirmed that NI would not make any further changes at present. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? The changes have drawn criticism from industry experts as well as holidaymakers. ""The quarantine policy is in tatters and dividing the United Kingdom,"" said Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy firm The PC Agency. ""Consumers are totally confused by the different approaches and it's impossible to understand the government's own criteria any more on when to add or remove a country. ""The current strategy has to change. The weekly reviews have been causing anxiety and financial pain for so many consumers and travel firms,"" he added. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""Days of speculation around this announcement meant many people rushed to pay extortionate prices for flights back to England to avoid having to quarantine on their return - only to now find out there was no need. ""The government knows this and yet it continues to offer no clarity around how these decisions are made."" One aviation boss described travelling abroad right now as ""quarantine roulette"" because the list of destinations which are affected keeps changing. But the governments in Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardiff are now clearly at odds over which countries pose a clear risk. Portugal's infection rate is above the UK government's benchmark of 20 cases of the virus for every 100,000 people. But the UK government has surprised us all and not added Portugal to the list for England. It's not clear why. Greece is even more complicated as the Welsh government is opting for a policy where only people arriving from certain Greek islands have to self-isolate while Scotland has introduced a quarantine for arrivals from across Greece. For months the travel industry has been lobbying the UK government for an approach where they consider particular regions in a country but ministers in London are not keen on the idea. The quarantine was already hard or impossible to police. But discrepancies between different UK nations makes it even harder as someone could, theoretically, fly into Newcastle from Greece and drive into Scotland. That person should self-isolate for 14 days, but no-one will be checking. Some holidaymakers have told the BBC they havepaid as much as Â£1,000 for flightsto get home from Portugal in anticipation of the rules changing. Kelly, from Birmingham, and her family changed their flights home from the Algarve from Saturday to Friday at a cost of Â£900 to avoid potential quarantine because she did not want her children to miss out on two weeks of school. The 45-year-old said the situation was ""absolutely disgusting"". ""It's cost us a lot more money and it's money we didn't need to spend now. We've lost an extra night in our villa - we won't get that back - we've got a hire car, so we're taking that back a day early."" She added: ""The government just change the goalposts left, right and centre at the moment. It's embarrassing."" Damian Martin from Swansea - who is currently on holiday in Lagos, Portugal - said he only arrived earlier on Thursday. ""Work had been full on so I decided to go,"" said Damian ""I had already switched my holiday from Spain and I won't be able to come back early,"" he said. ""I will be able to self-isolate, I think, but I work for a supermarket so will have to check in with them."" He added: ""I'm supposed to be here eight nights. I might as well try to enjoy it. Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal. Most head to the Algarve in the south, drawn by sunny Atlantic beaches, picturesque fishing villages and golf courses. During May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed.

"The Home Office confirmed a record 416 migrants arrived on Wednesday French authorities are ""just as committed"" as the UK to stopping migrants crossing the Channel in small boats, MPs have been told. The Home Affairs Select Committee heard evidence from Dan O'Mahoney, the Home Office's clandestine Channel threat commander, who said France had stopped 3,000 people crossing in 2020. On Wednesday,a record 416 migrants crossed the Channelfrom France. Mr O'Mahoney said almost 200 were stopped by the French on the same day. Citing one example from Wednesday, he told the committee: ""[They] stopped a very large Rib [rigid inflatable boat] with unbelievably 63 people on it from leaving the beach. ""There is a lot of joint working and it is delivering results."" However, the former Royal Marine who reports directly to the Home Secretary, conceded: ""It's nowhere near the level we'd like it to be and that is frustrating."" Dan O'Mahoney said Border Force officers treated migrants ""with humanity"" Mr O'Mahoney praised Border Force for ""doing a fantastic job"". ""Their professionalism and skill is notable and the humanity with which they treat migrants is genuinely impressive,"" he said. The committee was also told many migrants are forced on to small boats and some who arrive in England ""don't even want to come to the UK"". Mr O'Mahoney said: ""We hear a lot of stories about migrants who are literally forced on to boats, have no idea where they are when they get to the UK, because the facilitators don't get paid until they've done that last leg of the journey."" Travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, better security at the Channel Tunnel and recent good weather ""has had a significant impact in the increase in crossings [in small boats],"" he added. More than 7,400 migrants have crossed the Channel in small boats since January 2019. Abi Tierney, director general of UK visas and immigration at the Home Office, said the numbers of those seeking asylum had dropped from more than 10,000 in the first three months of the year to 5,789 in the second three months. ""France, Germany, Italy and Greece accept a much larger proportion of asylum seekers - they stay there, and a small number come to us,"" she said. She said of the 5,000 migrants arriving so far this year, 98% had claimed asylum. About half of those applications have been considered so far, she said, with 71% rejected because the UK was not the responsible country - the migrants had travelled through a safe country before arriving in the UK.

"Bosses in charge of the coronavirus testing system have apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand. Some people are being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England, said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted the ""vast majority"" of people could still get appointments nearby. How do I get a coronavirus test? Testing and tracing 'key to schools returning' Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again The booking website is now prioritising high-risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted numbers of home testing kits and fewer booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said they were working hard to rectify the problem and a new lab facility would be opened in the coming weeks. By Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. But Prof Paul Hunter, a public health expert at the University of East Anglia, said these issues could act as a ""big disincentive to being tested"" and result in local increases being missed. David was offered a test in Blackburn when he lives in Suffolk David Llewellyntried to book a test on Sunday and was directed to a test centre near Blackburn - 250 miles and the other side of England from his home in Stowmarket, Suffolk. ""I thought I'd entered my home location incorrectly so went through the booking process again, only to get the same location for testing. Needless to say I have subsequently ordered a home testing kit, which despite three automated email reminders to take the test has yet to arrive. I'd do the test if I had it. I think it's ridiculous."" Lucy Evans lives in Pooleon the south coast. She was offered a test 220 miles away in Oldham and Blackburn. She tried again and was offered the Isle of Wight. ""I tried 14 times to get a test nearer and in the end had to get a home test as I ran out of time to get this done within five days. By the time I was tested my symptoms had disappeared."" Lucy tested negative for Covid on Tuesday. Lisa lives in Plymouthand tried to get a test for her 14-year-old son. She was offered a test 688 miles away in Inverness. ""People aren't going to travel all that way for a test are they? You'd just have to make stops along the way and could be spreading it around if you had the virus."" She eventually got a test locally and her son was negative. The government says the network of labs used to process tests has capacity to process 250,000 tests a day at the moment. Currently around 175,000 tests a day are being processed, which the government has said is more per head of population than many countries. But the government said it has faced problems because demand is not smooth - at weekends it drops and on weekdays there can be surges. Over the past month it has meant a backlog has developed, meaning the time taken to turnaround tests has been increasing. To curb demand, the availability of slots at testing centres have been reduced. The government said it has done this to ensure high risk areas, including care homes and towns with high rates of infections, can be prioritised for testing. The most recent data shows test results are now being provided more quickly, with the average turnaround time 24 hours or less for mobile testing units and local testing centres. It also said booking slots open up throughout the day so if people keep trying they should be able to get a more convenient location for a test, or order a home test. A new lab is also being opened near Loughborough at the end of the month that will be able to process 50,000 tests a day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there were some ""operational challenges"", but said the ""vast majority"" of people could get a test close to home. Mr Hancock also set out plans to pilot more rapid, easy-to-use tests. A Â£500m programme is under way to trial a range of different tests, including ones that use saliva (instead of nose and throat swabs) and tests that can be processed quickly, and sometimes on the spot - at the moment swab tests are sent off to labs to be processed. Repeat testing of members of the public will be tried out in Salford in Greater Manchester. Meanwhile, students and school pupils in Southampton will also be tested weekly in another study. The technologies open up the prospect of mass population testing which, if successful, could reduce the need for social distancing. Mr Hancock said: ""Short of a vaccine, this is the best chance we have of reducing social distancing whilst controlling the virus, especially with winter coming and all the challenges that brings."" But he refused to be drawn on a timescale for when this might become available, saying it was essential to see if they worked first. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances for virus tests, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient testing capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June - and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country. There's been an apology to those who were told to go 100 miles or more for a test. Officials acknowledge that resources are stretched and have to be targeted at areas with local outbreaks. But they point out that a new ""mega lab"" is set to come on stream in the east Midlands soon. They also argue that trials of new rapid testing techniques will be expanded, which could prove to be game-changers. For now though, the system is stretched, even though the official numbers suggest capacity is running ahead of demand. Questions will continue to be asked about whether the system can cope with challenges ahead, with schools returning and winter approaching.

"Mark Zuckerberg wrote that the election would not ""be business as usual"" Facebook has announced that it will not take on any new political ads in the seven days prior to the US election on 3 November. However, the firm will still allow existing ads to continue to be promoted and targeted at different users. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg revealed themeasure in a Facebook post,external. He said that he was ""worried"" about divisions in the country potentially leading to civil unrest. He added that Facebook would also label posts from candidates attempting to declare victory before the votes had been counted. The social network has faced criticism for allowing political ads to be ""micro-targeted"" on its platform so that they are only seen by small communities rather than debated more widely in the days after they appear. The Mozilla Foundation has claimed thatthis makes it easier for politicians and their supporters,externalto parade fiction as fact and avoid being called out on it until it is too late, particularly as Facebook has previously said ads placed by candidates would not be fact-checked. The new steps could serve as a precedent for how the firm handles elections elsewhere in the future. Facebook also revealed that it would remove videos of President Trump encouraging voters in North Carolina to vote twice, which is illegal. Any videos of Mr Trump's comments without contextualising information would be taken down, the firm said in a statement: ""This video violates our policies prohibiting voter fraud and we will remove it unless it is shared to correct the record."" President Trump has repeatedly claimed the electioncould be ""rigged"" due to voter fraud. However, there isno evidence of widespread voter fraud in previous polls. ""This election is not going to be business as usual,"" Mr Zuckerberg wrote. ""With our nation so divided and election results potentially taking days or even weeks to be finalised, there could be an increased risk of civil unrest across the country,"" he added. In an effort to stymie the spread of rumours and deliberate falsehoods on Facebook,the firm has said it will implement a series of measures,external: no new political ads will be accepted in the week before the election posts claiming people will get Covid-19 if they take part in the vote will be removed information labels will be attached to posts seeking to delegitimise the outcome of the election labels will also be added to posts by candidates that seek to claim victory before the final results are in Mr Zuckerberg also said that Facebook had also ""strengthened"" its enforcement policies against movements known to spread conspiracy theories, such as QAnon. Thousands of Facebook groups associated with these movements had already been removed, he said. The moves have, however, attracted criticism. The chief of Media Matters for America - a liberal media monitoring body - described it as being a pointless PR stunt. ""They will still let political ads be rerun and targeted to new groups during [the last] week so long as the ad was run and had one impression before 27 October,"" tweeted Angelo Carusone. ""So, you can run a bad ad now, pause it and then reuse it that week."" An academic who specialises in how tech and politics interact made a related point. ""Campaigns will produce and run thousands of pieces of creative in the days before the cut off so they can run the final week,"" said Daniel Kreiss, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. By James Clayton, North America technology reporter What Mark Zuckerberg is really concerned about here is system lag. He knows the period before - and after - the US elections are likely to be toxic on Facebook. Paid political adverts usually take time to analyse. Decisions around placing warnings on ads, or even taking them down, can take days. And close to election day that could cause an enormous headache for Facebook, as the heat ratchets up. We already knew of his worries about fake news and voter suppression. But what's also interesting here is the period he's flagged between voting and the declared result. As he acknowledges, it could take days for a winner to be announced. Zuckerberg has identified this potential legitimacy vacuum as a great danger for the US.

"There is UK division, as travellers to Wales from Portugal and six Greek islands must self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Friday Scotland will introduce quarantine for travellers from Portugal and French Polynesia on Saturday But no countries are added to England, or Northern Ireland's, travel quarantine list today The US Centers for Disease Control is asking states to get rid of red tape to allow distribution of a potential vaccine by 1 November Under the scenario being planned for, a vaccine would be rolled out for certain groups days before the US election Globally, there have been more than 26m confirmed cases since the outbreak began and 863,000 deaths Claire Heald That's all for our live coverage today. Thanks for joining us. Here's a recap of the main stories from the UK and around the world related to the pandemic:  Today's coverage has been brought to you by Claire Heald, Flora Drury, Penny Spiller, Paul Kirby, Alex Therrien, Georgina Rannard, Vanessa Buschschluter, Krutika Pathi, Max Matza, David Walker and Doug Faulkner. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Ministerial decisions around adding or removing countries from the list take into account a range of factors, including virus incidence rates, information on a country's testing capacity, an assessment of the quality of data available, the effectiveness of the measures being deployed by a country to tackle the virus, and an estimate of the proportion of the population that is currently infectious in each country. The Department for Transport says the reason for not putting Portugal on the list of countries from which returning travellers to England must quarantine is that: ""Portugal has drastically increased its testing capacity, as well as taking measures to control the spread of the virus. ""We will closely monitor this situation, and as the Secretary of State for Transport has made clear, we are prepared to act at pace to remove a country from our Travel Corridor list in order to protect public health."" So from that you could read that Portugal increasing testing and taking strong steps to tackle  coronavirus cancels out the case rate being slightly above 20. If you are just joining us, you might be confused about which countries you can travel from without having to quarantine in your home UK country on your return. Here is what has changed today: The Scottish government has confirmed that travellers from Portugal and French Polynesia will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Saturday. Scotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf also said Gibraltar is ""high up on our watch list"" and would be monitored closely. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor We've been hearing about the long journeys people have been asked to take to access a coronavirus test in the UK. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country. There has been an apology to those who were told to go a hundred miles or more for a test. Officials acknowledge that resources are stretched and have to be targeted at areas with local outbreaks. But they point out that a new mega lab is set to come on stream in the East Midlands soon. They argue that trials of new rapid testing techniques will be expanded, which could prove to be game-changers. For now though, the system is stretched, even though the official numbers suggest capacity is running ahead of demand. Questions will continue to be asked about whether the system can cope with the challenges ahead as schools return and winter approaches. The cancellation of much-loved festivals and events have been frustrating for many around the world during the pandemic. But in one Nepalese city it resulted in clashes with the police and tear gas. Hundreds of residents in Lalitpur, near Kathmandu, defied a ban on mass gatherings to hold their time-honoured tradition of a chariot procession to the rain god Rato Machhindranath. As more and more people gathered in the streets, police said they were unable to control the numbers. ""We charged (with) water cannon and tear gas to stop the
rally,"" police official Tek Prasad Rai told Reuters news agency. Rocks were thrown in retaliation and a police motorcycle was set on fire. It is not known how many people were injured but at least one wounded person was carried away by police, witnesses told Reuters. BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Lynn hasn't seen her husband for five weeks because of local coronavirus lockdowns. BBC Radio 5 Live has been focusing today on the restrictions around visiting family in care homes, after a woman whose husband has dementia said she'd not seen him for five weeks, because of local lockdown changes. Lynn lives in Trafford which was subject to extra lockdown rules at the end of July. Yesterday those restrictions were due to lift, but the decision was reversed after a rise in cases. Dementia charity John's Campaign is seeking a judicial review of the government guidance on care home visits.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We know limiting visits in care homes has been difficult for many families."" Click here to listen to a special 5 Live Your Call about care homes on BBC Sounds. France has registered more than 7,000 new coronavirus cases for the second day in a row. The health ministry said on Thursday there were 7,157 new infections, a slight increase on the previous day's figure of 7,017 but shy of the
7,578 record set on 31 March. The ministry said the cumulative number of
confirmed cases was now 300,181.

There were 20 more virus-linked deaths, taking the total to 30,706. France is one of several European countries battling a resurgence of infections.

The head of the European Union's public health agency says numbers of cases are back to levels seen in March, when the virus first gripped the continent. Residents will be asked to pay Â£50 to be tested after seven days In contrast to Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, residents returning to the Isle of Man - a crown dependency - can now self-isolate for seven days if they pay for a Covid-19 test and the result is negative, the chief minister there has said. Currently, anyone arriving on the Isle of Man must self-isolate for 14 days. From Monday, returning residents can pay Â£50 to be tested for coronavirus after a week and will be allowed to leave their home, under certain restrictions, if it is negative. Residents who pay for a Covid-19 test, which comes back negative, will be allowed to leave isolation early. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Earlier, surprisingly, the UK government said it was not
adding Portugal to the list of countries requiring returning travellers to quarantine for 14 days. Itâs surprising because Portugal is above the benchmark the
UK government has set and said publicly it is following - of 20 cases per 100,000 people, at 23. So it is a bit confusing why the UK government hasnât, but the Welsh and possibly the
Scottish government have, made the change. And then there is Greece. The Scottish government said
earlier in the week all of Greece would be added to its quarantine list whereas
Wales has listed six Greek islands including Zakynthos. Some British holiday
makers returning from there recently have come back with the
virus. So the Welsh government is going for a regional approach in terms of
Greece. From a public health perspective all the nations' governments are
saying this is necessary right now. If you look at it from the travel industry
perspective it canât go on like this much longer. Portugal will be added to Scotland's quarantine list from this weekend, senior Scottish government sources have told BBC Scotland. Read morehere. A bit more now on the Welsh government's move to put Portugal and six Greek islands on its list of places that come under quarantine regulations from early Friday morning. Although travellers returning from Portugal face self-isolation if they come back after 0400 BST on Friday, the Azores and Madeira will remain exempt, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said. The Greek islands of Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos and Crete have also been added to the quarantine list, along with Gibraltar and French Polynesia.  Ebbsfleet and Ashford stations, in Kent, are to be mothballed
after an ""unprecedented fall in demand"". It means passengers in Kent will need to start their journeys at St Pancras, in London. In a statement Eurostar said: ""Covid-19 has had a severe impact on the travel industry and on our business and we continue to operate in very challenging conditions. ""We have experienced an unprecedented fall in demand, with bookings down by 90% compared to last year. ""The environment remains very unpredictable and has been exacerbated by quarantine restrictions which are now across all of our markets."" The rail operator said it had not taken the decision not to reopen Ebbsfleet and Ashford before 2022 lightly, but said because of the ""severity of the situation"" it had to take action.  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has said quarantine restrictions are ""killing"" international travel and would not be necessary with a better thought-through testing regime. Speaking to the BBC's Newscast podcast, the ex-Labour leader welcomed new testing trials announced by the government but said they could have come several months ago - as he predicted we could be dealing with restrictions for another two years. Mr Blair said: ""I donât think itâs necessary to do 14 day quarantine when you come back into the country. That is if you want literally zero risk."" He added ""for international travel, [the quarantine is] killing it"". Newscast is on BBC One at 23.45 BST and on BBC Sounds.. BBC reporters have been at two primary schools in England today, asking pupils and parents how it feels to be back after the unprecedented break caused by the pandemic lockdown. Eight-year-old Aarizuddin Halim said he was excited about meeting his friends again while Alicja Golinczak said she wondered what her new teacher was going to be like. Mickel Baptiste, who was back on the school run with his seven-year-old daughter, Alyssa, said it was good to return to some sense of normality. Read our full report here. Travellers to Wales from Portugal and six Greek islands will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Friday,the Welsh government has announced. Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros, Antiparos and Crete are among the islands affected. Gibraltar and French Polynesia will also be removed from the list of countries exempt from the quarantine restrictions. It is the first time that Wales has applied its own quarantine rules. The head of England's NHS Test and Trace system has apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand - with some being asked to travel hundreds of miles for a test. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England,said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted that the ""vast majority"" of people could still secure appointments nearby. The booking website is now prioritising high risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted home testing kits and few booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said by Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. There will be no changes to England's quarantine list on Thursday, the transport secretary has said, amid speculation Portugal and Greece were about to be added. Grant Shapps tweeted that the list was always under review and the government wouldn't hesitate to make changes if needed. The decision covers England and other parts of the UK may make individual decisions. Peoplearriving from Greece to Scotland have to quarantine for 14 days as of 04:00 BST on Thursday, while arrivals into Wales from the Greek island of Zakynthoswere asked to self-isolate after a cluster of cases.

A controversial French professor, who had defended the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus, faces an ethics complaint that could see him sanctioned or barred from practising. Didier Raoult, head of the infectious diseases department of La Timone hospital in Marseille, is accused by medical peers of spreading false information about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine. The drug has been promoted by some, including US President Donald Trump and his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro, but there is currently no proof it works against coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against misuse of the drug because of serious side-effects. In March, Prof Raoult said his study of 80 patients showed ""favourable"" outcomes for four in five of those who received hydroxychloroquine.

But in the complaint, seen by French newspaper Le Figaro, his critics say he promoted the drug ""without any real scientific evidence on the subject, and against the health authorities' recommendations"". According to Le Figaro, a group representing 500 specialists of France's Infectious Diseases Society filed the complaint against Prof Raoult. They accuse him of breaking nine rules of the doctors' code of ethics. Read more about hydroxychloroquine: The latest figures from the UK government show there were 1,735

"Bosses in charge of the coronavirus testing system have apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand. Some people are being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England, said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted the ""vast majority"" of people could still get appointments nearby. How do I get a coronavirus test? Testing and tracing 'key to schools returning' Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again The booking website is now prioritising high-risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted numbers of home testing kits and fewer booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said they were working hard to rectify the problem and a new lab facility would be opened in the coming weeks. By Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. But Prof Paul Hunter, a public health expert at the University of East Anglia, said these issues could act as a ""big disincentive to being tested"" and result in local increases being missed. David was offered a test in Blackburn when he lives in Suffolk David Llewellyntried to book a test on Sunday and was directed to a test centre near Blackburn - 250 miles and the other side of England from his home in Stowmarket, Suffolk. ""I thought I'd entered my home location incorrectly so went through the booking process again, only to get the same location for testing. Needless to say I have subsequently ordered a home testing kit, which despite three automated email reminders to take the test has yet to arrive. I'd do the test if I had it. I think it's ridiculous."" Lucy Evans lives in Pooleon the south coast. She was offered a test 220 miles away in Oldham and Blackburn. She tried again and was offered the Isle of Wight. ""I tried 14 times to get a test nearer and in the end had to get a home test as I ran out of time to get this done within five days. By the time I was tested my symptoms had disappeared."" Lucy tested negative for Covid on Tuesday. Lisa lives in Plymouthand tried to get a test for her 14-year-old son. She was offered a test 688 miles away in Inverness. ""People aren't going to travel all that way for a test are they? You'd just have to make stops along the way and could be spreading it around if you had the virus."" She eventually got a test locally and her son was negative. The government says the network of labs used to process tests has capacity to process 250,000 tests a day at the moment. Currently around 175,000 tests a day are being processed, which the government has said is more per head of population than many countries. But the government said it has faced problems because demand is not smooth - at weekends it drops and on weekdays there can be surges. Over the past month it has meant a backlog has developed, meaning the time taken to turnaround tests has been increasing. To curb demand, the availability of slots at testing centres have been reduced. The government said it has done this to ensure high risk areas, including care homes and towns with high rates of infections, can be prioritised for testing. The most recent data shows test results are now being provided more quickly, with the average turnaround time 24 hours or less for mobile testing units and local testing centres. It also said booking slots open up throughout the day so if people keep trying they should be able to get a more convenient location for a test, or order a home test. A new lab is also being opened near Loughborough at the end of the month that will be able to process 50,000 tests a day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there were some ""operational challenges"", but said the ""vast majority"" of people could get a test close to home. Mr Hancock also set out plans to pilot more rapid, easy-to-use tests. A Â£500m programme is under way to trial a range of different tests, including ones that use saliva (instead of nose and throat swabs) and tests that can be processed quickly, and sometimes on the spot - at the moment swab tests are sent off to labs to be processed. Repeat testing of members of the public will be tried out in Salford in Greater Manchester. Meanwhile, students and school pupils in Southampton will also be tested weekly in another study. The technologies open up the prospect of mass population testing which, if successful, could reduce the need for social distancing. Mr Hancock said: ""Short of a vaccine, this is the best chance we have of reducing social distancing whilst controlling the virus, especially with winter coming and all the challenges that brings."" But he refused to be drawn on a timescale for when this might become available, saying it was essential to see if they worked first. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances for virus tests, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient testing capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June - and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country.

A controversial French professor, who had defended the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus, faces an ethics complaint that could see him sanctioned or barred from practising. Didier Raoult, head of the infectious diseases department of La Timone hospital in Marseille, is accused by medical peers of spreading false information about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine. The drug has been promoted by some, including US President Donald Trump and his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro, but there is currently no proof it works against coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against misuse of the drug because of serious side-effects. In March, Prof Raoult said his study of 80 patients showed ""favourable"" outcomes for four in five of those who received hydroxychloroquine.

But in the complaint, seen by French newspaper Le Figaro, his critics say he promoted the drug ""without any real scientific evidence on the subject, and against the health authorities' recommendations"". According to Le Figaro, a group representing 500 specialists of France's Infectious Diseases Society filed the complaint against Prof Raoult. They accuse him of breaking nine rules of the doctors' code of ethics. Read more about hydroxychloroquine: The latest figures from the UK government show there were 1,735

"Shaun Ennis says there has been an increase in demand from newcomers to caravanning Caravan dealers in Wales say they have seen an increase in sales since lockdown was eased. Holidays in self-contained accommodation have been allowed in Wales since 13 July, while shared-facility sites opened two weeks later. With quarantine restrictions imposed on several European countries, one caravan park owner said staycations were ""certainly"" up. Dealers said lots of customers were first-time buyers. Caravan and camp sites 'inundated' with calls Campsites reopen - but not as you remember them Shaun Ennis, who runs Ennis Caravans in Cross Hands, Carmarthenshire, said he would normally have 100 unsold caravans in his depot at this time of year, but only has 20 left. ""Sales have trebled in the short time we've been open since the end of June,"" he said. ""We've made back the lost four months that we had, and the majority of that is from newcomers into the industry, which is lovely to see. It's been terrific, but also hard work and quite stressful."" Angharad Rees, who runs the 3As dealership in Carmarthen, said: ""There's just so much demand."" A recent survey by the National Caravan Council,,externalthe trade association, said caravan registrations in July were up 20% on the previous year across the UK. Angharad Rees says there has been ""so much demand"" for caravans A caravan park owner has also reported an increase in bookings. Hywel Davies, who runs Llwynifan Farm South Wales Touring Park in Llangennech, Carmarthenshire, said he was much busier than usual in September. He said: ""Bookings are certainly up on previous years. More people are renting motor homes and caravans now as well to try them out. ""We've had quite a few people who originally booked to go abroad but that's been cancelled due to the current situation, and many of them are then looking for places so they come to somebody like us instead.

"Bosses in charge of the coronavirus testing system have apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand. Some people are being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England, said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted the ""vast majority"" of people could still get appointments nearby. How do I get a coronavirus test? Testing and tracing 'key to schools returning' Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again The booking website is now prioritising high-risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted numbers of home testing kits and fewer booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said they were working hard to rectify the problem and a new lab facility would be opened in the coming weeks. By Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. But Prof Paul Hunter, a public health expert at the University of East Anglia, said these issues could act as a ""big disincentive to being tested"" and result in local increases being missed. David was offered a test in Blackburn when he lives in Suffolk David Llewellyntried to book a test on Sunday and was directed to a test centre near Blackburn - 250 miles and the other side of England from his home in Stowmarket, Suffolk. ""I thought I'd entered my home location incorrectly so went through the booking process again, only to get the same location for testing. Needless to say I have subsequently ordered a home testing kit, which despite three automated email reminders to take the test has yet to arrive. I'd do the test if I had it. I think it's ridiculous."" Lucy Evans lives in Pooleon the south coast. She was offered a test 220 miles away in Oldham and Blackburn. She tried again and was offered the Isle of Wight. ""I tried 14 times to get a test nearer and in the end had to get a home test as I ran out of time to get this done within five days. By the time I was tested my symptoms had disappeared."" Lucy tested negative for Covid on Tuesday. Lisa lives in Plymouthand tried to get a test for her 14-year-old son. She was offered a test 688 miles away in Inverness. ""People aren't going to travel all that way for a test are they? You'd just have to make stops along the way and could be spreading it around if you had the virus."" She eventually got a test locally and her son was negative. The government says the network of labs used to process tests has capacity to process 250,000 tests a day at the moment. Currently around 175,000 tests a day are being processed, which the government has said is more per head of population than many countries. But the government said it has faced problems because demand is not smooth - at weekends it drops and on weekdays there can be surges. Over the past month it has meant a backlog has developed, meaning the time taken to turnaround tests has been increasing. To curb demand, the availability of slots at testing centres have been reduced. The government said it has done this to ensure high risk areas, including care homes and towns with high rates of infections, can be prioritised for testing. The most recent data shows test results are now being provided more quickly, with the average turnaround time 24 hours or less for mobile testing units and local testing centres. It also said booking slots open up throughout the day so if people keep trying they should be able to get a more convenient location for a test, or order a home test. A new lab is also being opened near Loughborough at the end of the month that will be able to process 50,000 tests a day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there were some ""operational challenges"", but said the ""vast majority"" of people could get a test close to home. Mr Hancock also set out plans to pilot more rapid, easy-to-use tests. A Â£500m programme is under way to trial a range of different tests, including ones that use saliva (instead of nose and throat swabs) and tests that can be processed quickly, and sometimes on the spot - at the moment swab tests are sent off to labs to be processed. Repeat testing of members of the public will be tried out in Salford in Greater Manchester. Meanwhile, students and school pupils in Southampton will also be tested weekly in another study. The technologies open up the prospect of mass population testing which, if successful, could reduce the need for social distancing. Mr Hancock said: ""Short of a vaccine, this is the best chance we have of reducing social distancing whilst controlling the virus, especially with winter coming and all the challenges that brings."" But he refused to be drawn on a timescale for when this might become available, saying it was essential to see if they worked first. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances for virus tests, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient testing capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June - and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country. There's been an apology to those who were told to go 100 miles or more for a test. Officials acknowledge that resources are stretched and have to be targeted at areas with local outbreaks. But they point out that a new ""mega lab"" is set to come on stream in the east Midlands soon. They also argue that trials of new rapid testing techniques will be expanded, which could prove to be game-changers. For now though, the system is stretched, even though the official numbers suggest capacity is running ahead of demand. Questions will continue to be asked about whether the system can cope with challenges ahead, with schools returning and winter approaching.

"Henriett Szucs (left) and Mihrican Mustafa were subjected to ""very significant violence"", the trial heard A convicted sex offender has been found guilty of murdering two women whose bodies were found in his freezer. The remains of Henriett Szucs and Mihrican Mustafa were discovered at Zahid Younis's flat in Canning Town, east London, in April 2019. Prosecutors at Southwark Crown Court said Younis preyed on the vulnerable women, subjecting them to ""very significant violence"". He received a life sentence, with a minimum jail term of 38 years. How warnings about Heni and Jan's killer were missed The four-week trial heard police made the ""grim discovery"" when looking for the defendant at his home following a call about his welfare. He was not in but officers gained entry and noticed the lockable freezer, around which flies were gathering. This video can not be played After Younis refused to return from the cells for sentencing, Ms Mustafa's family spoke outside the court Ms Szucs, 32, originally from Hungary, was last seen alive in 2016 and was killed shortly before the defendant bought the freezer in November that year, the court heard. Younis's second victim, 38-year-old Ms Mustafa, was last heard from in May 2018. Ms Szucs and Ms Mustafa were ""vulnerable women living somewhat chaotic lives"", including periods of homelessness and drug addiction, the court heard. Jurors were told Younis purchased the freezer shortly after killing Ms Szucs ""for the sole purpose"" of concealing her body. Zahid Younis was in an abusive relationship with Henriett Szucs, the court heard The nature of the crime scene meant a cause of death could not be established, but the scientific evidence showed that the women had been subjected to serious violence before their deaths. They had both suffered numerous rib fractures while Ms Szucs had sustained ""dreadful"" head injuries and Ms Mustafa's sternum and larynx had been fractured. Det Ch Insp Simon Harding said the freezer had been forced open by one of the officers on ""an old-fashioned police hunch"" about what was inside it. He said: ""He broke open the freezer and discovered what could only be seen, at the time, as only one body. ""It actually took the freezer being taken away and X-rayed for it to be seen there was another body underneath that. It was a gruesome discovery for the officers."" The Met's missing person inquiry into Mihrican Mustafa - which started in 2018 - did not examine vital phone evidence, which would have shown contact with Younis around the time she vanished Det Ch Insp Harding described Ms Szucs as someone who had been in abusive relationships before and was preyed upon by Younis. She moved in with him - although Younis denied having a long-term relationship with her - and ""we have shown that she was really in love with him in her own way"", the detective said. ""She wrote him letters that we found. Unfortunately to him, she did not mean anything."" The court heard that Younis has several previous convictions for assaulting partners. A BBC investigation has identified a series of issues relating to the case: In 2002, a teenage girl told police that Younis had attacked her with a hammer and crowbar, after falsely imprisoning her. No further action was taken. In 2007, 26 charges against Younis relating to two young teenage girls were discontinued after a judge directed that a jury should clear him of many of the offences following evidence from one of the victims. In 2008, a plea agreement resulted in several charges against Younis being discontinued, including rape and sexual assault. In 2016, Ms Szucs was placed in a safe house for victims of trafficking after she was thrown from a block of flats by a man - not Younis - who was on bail for allegedly raping her. The CPS had declined to authorise a rape charge after it was first reported in February 2015. The Met Police lost contact with her as she fell under the control of Younis. The Met's missing person inquiry into Ms Mustafa - which started in 2018 - did not examine vital phone evidence, which would have shown contact with Younis around the time she vanished. It is now the subject of an internal Scotland Yard inquiry after her family made a series of complaints. Younis, known as ""Boxer"", denied murder but did admit putting the women in the freezer, pleading guilty to two counts of preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body. He claimed he was out when Ms Szucs died at his flat and did not tell police because he was ""panicking"". The jury was told he paid a man to help him get Ms Szucs' body into the freezer and that his accomplice later blackmailed him into putting Ms Mustafa's corpse in the same place. Jurors deliberated for over 16 hours before returning majority verdicts. Younis showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out while members of Ms Mustafa's large family, who attended every day of the three-week trial, said ""yes"" in the public gallery. Her older sister, Mel Mustafa, said: ""Thank you God, thank you."" The defendant refused to return to court from the cells for sentencing, during which Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described him as an ""arch deceiver"" who had ""spent a lifetime destroying lives"". She added he had shown no remorse about killing ""two beautiful and creative women"" and he might never be released from prison.

"It is crunch time for coronavirus in the UK. Children are returning to school and, with summer over, the return of colder weather and dark nights means more time will be spent indoors, giving the virus a better chance of spreading. So how strong a position are we in to fight the virus? There was a point at which the UK appeared to be among the worst-hit countries in the pandemic -a review by the Office for National Statistics found that by the middle of June, the UK had the highest level of excess deaths. But if you make international comparisons now, the UK is performing remarkably well. This is despite much being made of the rise in cases since early July. Daily case numbers have risen from just above 500, on average, to over 1,300 - although some of that is down to more testing being put in place. But the numbers also need to be seen in context. Because of the lack of testing available in the spring, it is unclear exactly how many cases there were when coronavirus was at its peak in the UK. There were days when confirmed cases hit 6,000. But that was just the tip of the iceberg. It has since been estimated there were perhaps as many as 100,000 infections a day at the end of March. Of course, the system is still not detecting all the cases even with the extra testing in place. The Office for National Statistics surveillance programme suggests the true level of infection may be about twice what is being recorded currently. But that's still a fraction of the cases seen in the spring. And while there is evidence of cases increasing, that has not translated into an increase in people being admitted to hospital. Deaths are also low - down to under 10 a day on average. There is no guarantee it will stay like this, of course. Many of the new cases are being seen in young adults who are now out more, either working or socialising. They are at very low risk of complications so this may not seem too concerning - after all, society has to function - but the fear remains that this could lead to the frail and vulnerable catching the virus. That said, those who fall into the more vulnerable groups will naturally be taking more precautions. But the problem, says Edinburgh University infectious diseases expert Prof Mark Woolhouse, comes if the levels of infection rise substantially from the level being seen at the moment. ""Spillover into the high-risk population could become very hard to avoid.""  How do I get a coronavirus test? Can my child go to school with a cold? The international effort to find a vaccine is unprecedented. There are about 150 initiatives in development, including more than 20 that have begun human trials. One of the most promising is being developed by Oxford University - and early results suggest it can trigger an immune response. A deal has been signed to supply 100 million doses in the UK alone. But even with the rapid progress that is being made, a vaccine is very unlikely to be available until the middle of next year at the earliest. And there are, of course, no guarantees it will work or just how long the protection it offers us will last. Leading immunologist Prof Sir John Bell, of the University of Oxford, believes the likeliest scenario will be a vaccine like the one for flu that offers some protection for a limited period. A smallpox scenario whereby a jab can wipe out the diseaseis only considered to be a remote possibility. Real progress has been made in the past few months on how best to treat patients who fall seriously ill with coronavirus - for the overwhelming majority it only causes a mild illness. A cheap and widely available, low-dose steroid treatment - dexamethasone - has been found to reduce the risk of death in seriously ill patients (those who require intensive care) by a third and is now being routinely used on the front line. It was research carried out in the UK that helped to make this breakthrough, which came in June. Since then trials have found another steroid, hydrocortisone, is equally effective. Other breakthroughs will no doubt come. Different treatments are being tested on patients around the world, including the use of blood plasma from people who have been infected and recovered from the virus. What is dexamethasone and how does it fight Covid-19? It is going to be a major challenge. The virus is stealthy. It can be passed on before symptoms develop and, significantly, some people never even know they are infectious. This is what makes it so difficult to contain. Infections are almost certainly going to rise. But the key question is by how much and among which groups. Crucial to the success will be the testing and tracing regime. Each UK nation runs its own contact tracing system, but they work on the same principles - the details of positive cases are passed on to contact tracers who then try to identify their close contacts and ask them to isolate. Huge strides have been made to set up an effective system. The UK is now carrying out more tests per head of population than Spain, France and Germany. But problems still remain. A backlog has developed in processing tests at the three mega labs, which means it is taking longer to give people results - the average turnaround time is now more than 24 hours. The problems have prompted testing to be prioritised in high infection areas,meaning in some areas people are struggling to book tests at local centres. And demand continues to grow all the time. Scotland saw a big rise in tests being requested for children after schools went back in August. Contact tracing is also still a work in progress. England's service, for example, is still not quite reaching the 80% of positive cases and close contacts it is aiming to - although it is not that far short. But for all the difficulties that remain, the pattern of infections, the infrastructure now in place and the improvement in treatment all do offer hope.

"The children, aged between one and eight, were found in a family home The bodies of five children have been found in a flat in a large housing block in the western German city of Solingen, police say. Police say they suspect the 27-year-old mother of killing the children before attempting to take her own life at a train station in nearby DÃ¼sseldorf. Few details have been provided, with no information about the cause of death. Emergency services were called to the residential block in the Hasseldelle area of the city on Thursday afternoon. Responding to call at about 13:45 local time (11:45 GMT), police said they arrived at the building in Solingen, in North Rhine-Westphalia state, to discover the bodies of five children - three girls and two boys - aged from one to eight. A sixth child, reportedly an 11-year-old boy, was said to have survived. The children's grandmother, who lives 60km (37 miles) away in the city of MÃ¶nchengladbach, had alerted the emergency services, the German news website Bild reported. The entrance to the block of flats has been sealed off and forensic officers are at the scene Police spokesman Stefan Weiand said the children's mother had been ""seriously injured"" after throwing herself in front of a train in DÃ¼sseldorf and was being treated in hospital under police guard. ""Background and further details are not known at this point and that is what we are trying to find out,"" Mr Weiand told journalists, adding that police investigators were at the scene ""in full force"". Police said they were hoping to learn more about the ""incredibly tragic occurrence"" after speaking with the mother. The entrance to the block of flats in Solingen has been sealed off and images show police cars and ambulances lining the streets, with forensic officers also at the scene. A woman places a candle alongside a teddy at the residential building in Solingen, Germany The mayor of Solingen, Tim Kurzbach, wrote on Facebook that he had visited the housing block where ""this terrible act took place"" after hearing the news. ""For me it is still incomprehensible,"" he wrote in the post, adding: ""Today is a day of mourning for all of Solingen."" Later on Thursday, residents began leaving flowers and candles at the entrance to the building as a tribute.

A cheap and widely available, low-dose steroid treatment - dexamethasone - has been found to reduce the risk of death in seriously ill patients (those who require intensive care) by a third and is now being routinely used on the front line. It was research carried out in the UK that helped to make this breakthrough, which came in June. Since then trials have found another steroid, hydrocortisone, is equally effective. Other breakthroughs will no doubt come. Different treatments are being tested on patients around the world, including the use of blood plasma from people who have been infected and recovered from the virus. What is dexamethasone and how does it fight Covid-19? It is going to be a major challenge. The virus is stealthy. It can be passed on before symptoms develop and, significantly, some people never even know they are infectious. This is what makes it so difficult to contain. Infections are almost certainly going to rise. But the key question is by how much and among which groups. Crucial to the success will be the testing and tracing regime. Each UK nation runs its own contact tracing system, but they work on the same principles - the details of positive cases are passed on to contact tracers who then try to identify their close contacts and ask them to isolate. Huge strides have been made to set up an effective system. The UK is now carrying out more tests per head of population than Spain, France and Germany. But problems still remain. A backlog has developed in processing tests at the three mega labs, which means it is taking longer to give people results - the average turnaround time is now more than 24 hours. The problems have prompted testing to be prioritised in high infection areas,meaning in some areas people are struggling to book tests at local centres. And demand continues to grow all the time. Scotland saw a big rise in tests being requested for children after schools went back in August. Contact tracing is also still a work in progress. England's service, for example, is still not quite reaching the 80% of positive cases and close contacts it is aiming to - although it is not that far short. But for all the difficulties that remain, the pattern of infections, the infrastructure now in place and the improvement in treatment all do offer hope.

"Henriett Szucs (left) and Mihrican Mustafa were subjected to ""very significant violence"", the trial heard A convicted sex offender has been found guilty of murdering two women whose bodies were found in his freezer. The remains of Henriett Szucs and Mihrican Mustafa were discovered at Zahid Younis's flat in Canning Town, east London, in April 2019. Prosecutors at Southwark Crown Court said Younis preyed on the vulnerable women, subjecting them to ""very significant violence"". He received a life sentence, with a minimum jail term of 38 years. How warnings about Heni and Jan's killer were missed The four-week trial heard police made the ""grim discovery"" when looking for the defendant at his home following a call about his welfare. He was not in but officers gained entry and noticed the lockable freezer, around which flies were gathering. This video can not be played After Younis refused to return from the cells for sentencing, Ms Mustafa's family spoke outside the court Ms Szucs, 32, originally from Hungary, was last seen alive in 2016 and was killed shortly before the defendant bought the freezer in November that year, the court heard. Younis's second victim, 38-year-old Ms Mustafa, was last heard from in May 2018. Ms Szucs and Ms Mustafa were ""vulnerable women living somewhat chaotic lives"", including periods of homelessness and drug addiction, the court heard. Jurors were told Younis purchased the freezer shortly after killing Ms Szucs ""for the sole purpose"" of concealing her body. Zahid Younis was in an abusive relationship with Henriett Szucs, the court heard The nature of the crime scene meant a cause of death could not be established, but the scientific evidence showed that the women had been subjected to serious violence before their deaths. They had both suffered numerous rib fractures while Ms Szucs had sustained ""dreadful"" head injuries and Ms Mustafa's sternum and larynx had been fractured. Det Ch Insp Simon Harding said the freezer had been forced open by one of the officers on ""an old-fashioned police hunch"" about what was inside it. He said: ""He broke open the freezer and discovered what could only be seen, at the time, as only one body. ""It actually took the freezer being taken away and X-rayed for it to be seen there was another body underneath that. It was a gruesome discovery for the officers."" The Met's missing person inquiry into Mihrican Mustafa - which started in 2018 - did not examine vital phone evidence, which would have shown contact with Younis around the time she vanished Det Ch Insp Harding described Ms Szucs as someone who had been in abusive relationships before and was preyed upon by Younis. She moved in with him - although Younis denied having a long-term relationship with her - and ""we have shown that she was really in love with him in her own way"", the detective said. ""She wrote him letters that we found. Unfortunately to him, she did not mean anything."" The court heard that Younis has several previous convictions for assaulting partners. A BBC investigation has identified a series of issues relating to the case: In 2002, a teenage girl told police that Younis had attacked her with a hammer and crowbar, after falsely imprisoning her. No further action was taken. In 2007, 26 charges against Younis relating to two young teenage girls were discontinued after a judge directed that a jury should clear him of many of the offences following evidence from one of the victims. In 2008, a plea agreement resulted in several charges against Younis being discontinued, including rape and sexual assault. In 2016, Ms Szucs was placed in a safe house for victims of trafficking after she was thrown from a block of flats by a man - not Younis - who was on bail for allegedly raping her. The CPS had declined to authorise a rape charge after it was first reported in February 2015. The Met Police lost contact with her as she fell under the control of Younis. The Met's missing person inquiry into Ms Mustafa - which started in 2018 - did not examine vital phone evidence, which would have shown contact with Younis around the time she vanished. It is now the subject of an internal Scotland Yard inquiry after her family made a series of complaints. Younis, known as ""Boxer"", denied murder but did admit putting the women in the freezer, pleading guilty to two counts of preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body. He claimed he was out when Ms Szucs died at his flat and did not tell police because he was ""panicking"". The jury was told he paid a man to help him get Ms Szucs' body into the freezer and that his accomplice later blackmailed him into putting Ms Mustafa's corpse in the same place. Jurors deliberated for over 16 hours before returning majority verdicts. Younis showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out while members of Ms Mustafa's large family, who attended every day of the three-week trial, said ""yes"" in the public gallery. Her older sister, Mel Mustafa, said: ""Thank you God, thank you."" The defendant refused to return to court from the cells for sentencing, during which Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described him as an ""arch deceiver"" who had ""spent a lifetime destroying lives"". She added he had shown no remorse about killing ""two beautiful and creative women"" and he might never be released from prison.

"There is UK division, as travellers to Wales from Portugal and six Greek islands must self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Friday Scotland will introduce quarantine for travellers from Portugal and French Polynesia on Saturday But no countries are added to England, or Northern Ireland's, travel quarantine list today The US Centers for Disease Control is asking states to get rid of red tape to allow distribution of a potential vaccine by 1 November Under the scenario being planned for, a vaccine would be rolled out for certain groups days before the US election Globally, there have been more than 26m confirmed cases since the outbreak began and 863,000 deaths Claire Heald That's all for our live coverage today. Thanks for joining us. Here's a recap of the main stories from the UK and around the world related to the pandemic:  Today's coverage has been brought to you by Claire Heald, Flora Drury, Penny Spiller, Paul Kirby, Alex Therrien, Georgina Rannard, Vanessa Buschschluter, Krutika Pathi, Max Matza, David Walker and Doug Faulkner. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Ministerial decisions around adding or removing countries from the list take into account a range of factors, including virus incidence rates, information on a country's testing capacity, an assessment of the quality of data available, the effectiveness of the measures being deployed by a country to tackle the virus, and an estimate of the proportion of the population that is currently infectious in each country. The Department for Transport says the reason for not putting Portugal on the list of countries from which returning travellers to England must quarantine is that: ""Portugal has drastically increased its testing capacity, as well as taking measures to control the spread of the virus. ""We will closely monitor this situation, and as the Secretary of State for Transport has made clear, we are prepared to act at pace to remove a country from our Travel Corridor list in order to protect public health."" So from that you could read that Portugal increasing testing and taking strong steps to tackle  coronavirus cancels out the case rate being slightly above 20. If you are just joining us, you might be confused about which countries you can travel from without having to quarantine in your home UK country on your return. Here is what has changed today: The Scottish government has confirmed that travellers from Portugal and French Polynesia will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Saturday. Scotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf also said Gibraltar is ""high up on our watch list"" and would be monitored closely. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor We've been hearing about the long journeys people have been asked to take to access a coronavirus test in the UK. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country. There has been an apology to those who were told to go a hundred miles or more for a test. Officials acknowledge that resources are stretched and have to be targeted at areas with local outbreaks. But they point out that a new mega lab is set to come on stream in the East Midlands soon. They argue that trials of new rapid testing techniques will be expanded, which could prove to be game-changers. For now though, the system is stretched, even though the official numbers suggest capacity is running ahead of demand. Questions will continue to be asked about whether the system can cope with the challenges ahead as schools return and winter approaches. The cancellation of much-loved festivals and events have been frustrating for many around the world during the pandemic. But in one Nepalese city it resulted in clashes with the police and tear gas. Hundreds of residents in Lalitpur, near Kathmandu, defied a ban on mass gatherings to hold their time-honoured tradition of a chariot procession to the rain god Rato Machhindranath. As more and more people gathered in the streets, police said they were unable to control the numbers. ""We charged (with) water cannon and tear gas to stop the
rally,"" police official Tek Prasad Rai told Reuters news agency. Rocks were thrown in retaliation and a police motorcycle was set on fire. It is not known how many people were injured but at least one wounded person was carried away by police, witnesses told Reuters. BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Lynn hasn't seen her husband for five weeks because of local coronavirus lockdowns. BBC Radio 5 Live has been focusing today on the restrictions around visiting family in care homes, after a woman whose husband has dementia said she'd not seen him for five weeks, because of local lockdown changes. Lynn lives in Trafford which was subject to extra lockdown rules at the end of July. Yesterday those restrictions were due to lift, but the decision was reversed after a rise in cases. Dementia charity John's Campaign is seeking a judicial review of the government guidance on care home visits.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We know limiting visits in care homes has been difficult for many families."" Click here to listen to a special 5 Live Your Call about care homes on BBC Sounds. France has registered more than 7,000 new coronavirus cases for the second day in a row. The health ministry said on Thursday there were 7,157 new infections, a slight increase on the previous day's figure of 7,017 but shy of the
7,578 record set on 31 March. The ministry said the cumulative number of
confirmed cases was now 300,181.

There were 20 more virus-linked deaths, taking the total to 30,706. France is one of several European countries battling a resurgence of infections.

The head of the European Union's public health agency says numbers of cases are back to levels seen in March, when the virus first gripped the continent. Residents will be asked to pay Â£50 to be tested after seven days In contrast to Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, residents returning to the Isle of Man - a crown dependency - can now self-isolate for seven days if they pay for a Covid-19 test and the result is negative, the chief minister there has said. Currently, anyone arriving on the Isle of Man must self-isolate for 14 days. From Monday, returning residents can pay Â£50 to be tested for coronavirus after a week and will be allowed to leave their home, under certain restrictions, if it is negative. Residents who pay for a Covid-19 test, which comes back negative, will be allowed to leave isolation early. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Earlier, surprisingly, the UK government said it was not
adding Portugal to the list of countries requiring returning travellers to quarantine for 14 days. Itâs surprising because Portugal is above the benchmark the
UK government has set and said publicly it is following - of 20 cases per 100,000 people, at 23. So it is a bit confusing why the UK government hasnât, but the Welsh and possibly the
Scottish government have, made the change. And then there is Greece. The Scottish government said
earlier in the week all of Greece would be added to its quarantine list whereas
Wales has listed six Greek islands including Zakynthos. Some British holiday
makers returning from there recently have come back with the
virus. So the Welsh government is going for a regional approach in terms of
Greece. From a public health perspective all the nations' governments are
saying this is necessary right now. If you look at it from the travel industry
perspective it canât go on like this much longer. Portugal will be added to Scotland's quarantine list from this weekend, senior Scottish government sources have told BBC Scotland. Read morehere. A bit more now on the Welsh government's move to put Portugal and six Greek islands on its list of places that come under quarantine regulations from early Friday morning. Although travellers returning from Portugal face self-isolation if they come back after 0400 BST on Friday, the Azores and Madeira will remain exempt, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said. The Greek islands of Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos and Crete have also been added to the quarantine list, along with Gibraltar and French Polynesia.  Ebbsfleet and Ashford stations, in Kent, are to be mothballed
after an ""unprecedented fall in demand"". It means passengers in Kent will need to start their journeys at St Pancras, in London. In a statement Eurostar said: ""Covid-19 has had a severe impact on the travel industry and on our business and we continue to operate in very challenging conditions. ""We have experienced an unprecedented fall in demand, with bookings down by 90% compared to last year. ""The environment remains very unpredictable and has been exacerbated by quarantine restrictions which are now across all of our markets."" The rail operator said it had not taken the decision not to reopen Ebbsfleet and Ashford before 2022 lightly, but said because of the ""severity of the situation"" it had to take action.  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has said quarantine restrictions are ""killing"" international travel and would not be necessary with a better thought-through testing regime. Speaking to the BBC's Newscast podcast, the ex-Labour leader welcomed new testing trials announced by the government but said they could have come several months ago - as he predicted we could be dealing with restrictions for another two years. Mr Blair said: ""I donât think itâs necessary to do 14 day quarantine when you come back into the country. That is if you want literally zero risk."" He added ""for international travel, [the quarantine is] killing it"". Newscast is on BBC One at 23.45 BST and on BBC Sounds.. BBC reporters have been at two primary schools in England today, asking pupils and parents how it feels to be back after the unprecedented break caused by the pandemic lockdown. Eight-year-old Aarizuddin Halim said he was excited about meeting his friends again while Alicja Golinczak said she wondered what her new teacher was going to be like. Mickel Baptiste, who was back on the school run with his seven-year-old daughter, Alyssa, said it was good to return to some sense of normality. Read our full report here. Travellers to Wales from Portugal and six Greek islands will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Friday,the Welsh government has announced. Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros, Antiparos and Crete are among the islands affected. Gibraltar and French Polynesia will also be removed from the list of countries exempt from the quarantine restrictions. It is the first time that Wales has applied its own quarantine rules. The head of England's NHS Test and Trace system has apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand - with some being asked to travel hundreds of miles for a test. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England,said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted that the ""vast majority"" of people could still secure appointments nearby. The booking website is now prioritising high risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted home testing kits and few booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said by Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. There will be no changes to England's quarantine list on Thursday, the transport secretary has said, amid speculation Portugal and Greece were about to be added. Grant Shapps tweeted that the list was always under review and the government wouldn't hesitate to make changes if needed. The decision covers England and other parts of the UK may make individual decisions. Peoplearriving from Greece to Scotland have to quarantine for 14 days as of 04:00 BST on Thursday, while arrivals into Wales from the Greek island of Zakynthoswere asked to self-isolate after a cluster of cases.

A controversial French professor, who had defended the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus, faces an ethics complaint that could see him sanctioned or barred from practising. Didier Raoult, head of the infectious diseases department of La Timone hospital in Marseille, is accused by medical peers of spreading false information about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine. The drug has been promoted by some, including US President Donald Trump and his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro, but there is currently no proof it works against coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against misuse of the drug because of serious side-effects. In March, Prof Raoult said his study of 80 patients showed ""favourable"" outcomes for four in five of those who received hydroxychloroquine.

But in the complaint, seen by French newspaper Le Figaro, his critics say he promoted the drug ""without any real scientific evidence on the subject, and against the health authorities' recommendations"". According to Le Figaro, a group representing 500 specialists of France's Infectious Diseases Society filed the complaint against Prof Raoult. They accuse him of breaking nine rules of the doctors' code of ethics. Read more about hydroxychloroquine: The latest figures from the UK government show there were 1,735

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says there are 101 new positive cases, 53 of them in the Greater Glasgow area One more death, which took place in mid-August, has been recorded following a positive test Ms Sturgeon says the R number is probably now above one, and could be as high as 1.4 Home Farm care home on Skye, where 10 residents died from Covid-19, will be taken into NHS ownership Health officials have found evidence of coronavirus spreading in schools in Glasgow BBC Scotland News If you are just joining us, the key points from the Scottish government briefing are:  That's all from us on the live page, please take care and stay safe. Simon
  Johnson from The
  Telegraph says he spoke to Professor Linda Bauld who said she does not think the elimination strategy is going well, given the rise in cases. He says he asked the professor if Scotland had adopted a Wack-A-Mole tactic and she said absolutely. The first minister says she thinks a great deal of Linda Bauld who she says is an expert who talks a lot of sense. Ms Sturgeon adds that she is advised by experts on how to keep this virus to the lowest possible level and eliminate it if possible. When outbreaks occur the government will try to hit them hard, but ""elimination is my objective"". Professor Leitch adds that the Glasgow area outbreak is not affecting very young children or very elderly people. ""It's families and young adults...in general terms its mixed households by gender and its mixed age groups,"" he says. That's good as the very old are the most vulnerable and one of the reasons for the restrictions is to protect that, he adds. Libby
  Brooks from The
  Guardian asks for more detail on the targeted restrictions brought in for the Glasgow area. The first minister replies that the outbreak is still ongoing and the Test and Protect work continues. The government will try to give people as full a picture as it develops, Ms Sturgeon pledges. One of the issues is that the outbreak is more disparate than we have seen, which requires targeted measures, she says. She points out that the decisions are informed by date, but also involve a lot of judgement. Tom Martin from the Daily Express wonders why the restrictions in the west of Scotland are so broad and cannot be more targeted. He also asks about how to deal with the feeling some might have about being punished for others' behaviours. ""Nobody's being punished,"" replies Ms Sturgeon. She says she wishes she was able to say precisely where a cluster started, but unfortunately population-based measures are necessary. ""We will try to be as targeted as possible. That can often be more difficult in a city,"" she adds. Jason Leitch adds that in some cases in has been more appropriate to go down to postcode level, such as in the Dumfries & Galloway case which was linked to Carlisle hospital employees. Katrine
  Bussey from PA asks if the previous owners of Home Farm, HC One, will make a profit from its sale to NHS Highland. If so, is that not them being rewarded financially for providing a service which the health secretary says ""put at risk life and limb"", asks Ms Bussey. Jeane Freeman says the government must do everything possible to protect citizens. The health secretary says the conclusion of the negotiations with HC One have provided stability and security for the residents and has been the best use of public funds. To have done anything else would have led to a financial arrangement that would have cost a lot more, she explains. Globalâs Mr Knight also queries why
the NHS is still seeking to buy Home Farm care home when the court action has
been dropped by the Care Inspectorate. The health secretary says the Care
Inspectorate assessed at the time the situation at the care home was a risk to
life and limb. NHS Highland then stepped in to
provide support and leadership â which meant the need for the Care Inspectorate
to go to court was reduced, she says. However, this improvement needs to
be sustained and the conclusion was this would not be the case if NHS Highland
stepped away, Ms Freeman explains. Fraser Knight from Global says the
incidence rate in Greece is 14 people per 100,000. This compares with 22 per
100,000 in Glasgow, suggesting it is safer to holiday in Greece right now
than Glasgow. Should people avoid holidaying in
Glasgow for the next two weeks?, he asks. The first minister says the advice
for Glasgow residents is about not going into other peopleâs houses as that is
what seems to be driving transmission. Cases per 100,000 is not the only
measure to look at as getting an accurate measure will depend on the volume of
testing, she adds. She highlights that in Glasgow the rate
of return for positive test results in Scotland yesterday was around 1%, but in
Glasgow it was 2.2%. Alan
  Smith from Bauer returns to the issue of quarantine and the decision to impose it on people arriving from Greece. Mr Smith asks why the policy covers all of Greece, while in Wales the policy only applies to Zante. He also asks if the case numbers keep dropping in Glasgow will the restrictions be lifted earlier? The first minister points out that we have to be cautious about individual days and need to look at the average over seven days. There is a lot of judgement applied to the restrictions, she adds, pointing out the drivers of transmission can produce the same numbers in different areas. On Greece, the Scottish government will come to its decision and other countries will have to come to their own decisions, Ms Sturgeon says. Peter Macmahon from ITV Border quotes
the first minister saying the virus was âfirmly in retreatâ in June. He asks
whether this assessment was too optimistic or are we on track to get back to
our normal lives. Ms Sturgeon highlights there is a
lot more normality back into our lives, but adds it is not a situation where we
can go back to normal fully. An infectious virus is still out
there, she adds. âWe are fighting it in different
ways now than we were when lockdown was much, much more restrictive,â the first
minister says. She also highlights uncertainty
about how the changing seasons will impact the virus. National Clinical Director Jason Leitch adds that it's quite difficult to be sure where the positive cases are among teachers and pupils. Professor Leitch points out he expects transmission in schools and  and Test and Protect will interrupt the chains of transmission. ""It may be that a few kids or few teachers, or maybe a class at a time will have to be isolated,"" he says. ""We hope, it's not impossible that a school will have to close, we hope that will be kept to an absolute minimum."" The first time we have school transmission is not such an important  moment, he points out. Ewan Petrie from STV points out we have nowseen the first cases of transmission in schoolsand
unions have raised concerns about social distancing there. He asks if the first minister is satisfied the current
guidelines are enough to mitigate the risk to staff and pupils. The first minister replies: ""I don't think it is yet the case that we can definitively say that there has been transmission within schools."" She explains: ""We have never tried to claim that we won't have instances of transmission within schools and the guidance that is in place is designed, as effectively as possible, to mitigate against that."" The first minister points out that well under 1% of the tests taken by younger people and children have been positive. Lucy Whyte from BBC Scotland points to warnings about job losses in the aviation industry and asks whether airports could take on a role in testing for Covid-19. The first minister says the government is continuing to look at whether there are ""effective alternatives"" to quarantine, but due to the period of incubation of the virus a test may not pick up all positive cases. ""Quarantine for 14 days is the most effective way to mitigate the risk of positive cases coming into the country,"" she adds. National clinical director Jason Leitch says he hopes science will hopefully help out with this dilemma, but for now quarantine from some countries is the safest thing to do. Allow Twitter content?

Nicola Sturgeon says the cases in the Glasgow area should be a wake-up call for all of us. The first minister stresses again that people must follow the five
pieces of advice in FACTS: They are: The first minister says some people may wonder why Test and Protect is not stopping these outbreaks. Ms Sturgeon explains Test and Protect is a vital part of the approach, however it is not the equivalent of a vaccine. ""It doesn't magically make Covid go away,"" she says. ""What it does is step in on these occasions when the virus gets past us. All of us when we follow all the advice are the first line of defence against it."" Health Secretary Jeane Freeman confirms the Home Farm care home in Portree is to be bought by NHS Highland. The home is currently owned by HC One, but NHS Highland has previously stepped in after concerns were raised by the Care Inspectorate. A number of residents died at the care home earlier this year from coronavirus. All staff will be moved onto NHS contracts, says Ms Freeman, which will provide more security and better conditions. The health secretary also confirms new guidance on communal activities and says visiting at adult care homes has also been published today. From 7 September, care homes that meet the criteria will be able to resume services from medical specialists. Ms Sturgeon says transmission in Glasgow appears to be largely household based. ""That is what led to the decision to impose household restrictions, but not close pubs,"" she says. She points out the government is trying to be much more guided and targeted with the measures it introduces. They will be reviewed in a week, the first minister reminds us. The first minister returns to the new restrictions following the rise in cases in the Glasgow area. Restrictions  on visiting other householdswere reintroduced in Glasgow and two neighbouring areason Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon says Test and Protect has indicated the cases in Glasgow City, West Dunbartonshire and East
Renfrewshire are not linked to any big outbreak. They are instead associated with multiple, smaller, unconnected household-based clusters. ""That then raises a concern about the risks of wider community transmission,"" she says. The first minister adds: ""Doing nothing was not an option."" Ms Sturgeon explains that Test and Protect provides intelligence, informing the actions that need to be taken by the government. The first minister says measures can then be targeted specifically, as they were with the 2 Sisters Coupar Angus outbreak. She points out that Test and Protect also identified in Aberdeen that the outbreak started in pubs and there was a danger of community transmission. The first minster says again that specific measures were brought in to fight that cluster and the Aberdeen outbreak is now effectively over. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The owners of Millers of Speyside took the decision to close the factory for 14 days An abattoir in the Highlands has been shut down after an increase in cases in a Covid-19 cluster. Twenty-nine of the 31 cases in the Grantown on Spey area are linked to the town's Millers of Speyside meat processing factory. A nursery in Boat of Garten has closed and visiting to local care homes has also been suspended due to the rise from five cases earlier in the week. NHS Highland said its health protection team was carrying out contact tracing. Highland Council has offered support to people who are having to self-isolate. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said an investigation was ongoing to find any ""themes"" to the outbreak and whether any additional measures were required to tackle it. Allow Twitter content?

NHS Highland said the owners of Millers of Speyside had taken the decision to shut for two weeks, and were assisting in an investigation of the outbreak. Highland Council said Deshars Primary's nursery was closed until 8 September on the advice of NHS Highland's public health team as part of its test and protect investigation. The primary school remains open. A council spokeswoman said: ""All Highland Council educational settings are following rigorous controls including enhanced cleaning, and hand hygiene, and the wearing of face coverings in secondary schools in corridors and at break-out times."" The cluster in the Grantown on Spey area has increased from five earlier this week NHS Highland said there was currently no evidence that food was a source of Covid-19, and it was ""very unlikely"" it could be transmitted through the consumption of food. Dr Tim Allison, director of public health at NHS Highland, said: ""NHS Highland and partners are working together to manage this community outbreak. ""Our health protection team is following up with contacts and the appropriate advice is being given to those identified. ""We would also like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that the virus can recur even in rural communities and so everyone should continue to adhere to physical distancing guidelines, wear a face-covering when in enclosed spaces, clean your hands and surfaces regularly and immediately self-isolate if you develop symptoms."" Sandy Milne, managing director at Millers of Speyside said the company had ""worked tirelessly"" through the pandemic to ensure continued food production. He said: ""To prevent further spread of the virus among both our employees and the local community, we have opted to close our facility for 14 days."" Alan Clarke, chief executive at Quality Meat Scotland, said the red meat industry had taken precautions to tackle Covid-19. She said: ""Millers of Speyside, like other Scottish food businesses, has whole-heartedly embraced these measures and has followed all guidelines, to isolate the spread of infection, protecting the health and wellbeing of their workforce and the local community.""

"It is crunch time for coronavirus in the UK. Children are returning to school and, with summer over, the return of colder weather and dark nights means more time will be spent indoors, giving the virus a better chance of spreading. So how strong a position are we in to fight the virus? There was a point at which the UK appeared to be among the worst-hit countries in the pandemic -a review by the Office for National Statistics found that by the middle of June, the UK had the highest level of excess deaths. But if you make international comparisons now, the UK is performing remarkably well. This is despite much being made of the rise in cases since early July. Daily case numbers have risen from just above 500, on average, to over 1,300 - although some of that is down to more testing being put in place. But the numbers also need to be seen in context. Because of the lack of testing available in the spring, it is unclear exactly how many cases there were when coronavirus was at its peak in the UK. There were days when confirmed cases hit 6,000. But that was just the tip of the iceberg. It has since been estimated there were perhaps as many as 100,000 infections a day at the end of March. Of course, the system is still not detecting all the cases even with the extra testing in place. The Office for National Statistics surveillance programme suggests the true level of infection may be about twice what is being recorded currently. But that's still a fraction of the cases seen in the spring. And while there is evidence of cases increasing, that has not translated into an increase in people being admitted to hospital. Deaths are also low - down to under 10 a day on average. There is no guarantee it will stay like this, of course. Many of the new cases are being seen in young adults who are now out more, either working or socialising. They are at very low risk of complications so this may not seem too concerning - after all, society has to function - but the fear remains that this could lead to the frail and vulnerable catching the virus. That said, those who fall into the more vulnerable groups will naturally be taking more precautions. But the problem, says Edinburgh University infectious diseases expert Prof Mark Woolhouse, comes if the levels of infection rise substantially from the level being seen at the moment. ""Spillover into the high-risk population could become very hard to avoid.""  How do I get a coronavirus test? Can my child go to school with a cold? The international effort to find a vaccine is unprecedented. There are about 150 initiatives in development, including more than 20 that have begun human trials. One of the most promising is being developed by Oxford University - and early results suggest it can trigger an immune response. A deal has been signed to supply 100 million doses in the UK alone. But even with the rapid progress that is being made, a vaccine is very unlikely to be available until the middle of next year at the earliest. And there are, of course, no guarantees it will work or just how long the protection it offers us will last. Leading immunologist Prof Sir John Bell, of the University of Oxford, believes the likeliest scenario will be a vaccine like the one for flu that offers some protection for a limited period. A smallpox scenario whereby a jab can wipe out the diseaseis only considered to be a remote possibility. Real progress has been made in the past few months on how best to treat patients who fall seriously ill with coronavirus - for the overwhelming majority it only causes a mild illness. A cheap and widely available, low-dose steroid treatment - dexamethasone - has been found to reduce the risk of death in seriously ill patients (those who require intensive care) by a third and is now being routinely used on the front line. It was research carried out in the UK that helped to make this breakthrough, which came in June. Since then trials have found another steroid, hydrocortisone, is equally effective. Other breakthroughs will no doubt come. Different treatments are being tested on patients around the world, including the use of blood plasma from people who have been infected and recovered from the virus. What is dexamethasone and how does it fight Covid-19? It is going to be a major challenge. The virus is stealthy. It can be passed on before symptoms develop and, significantly, some people never even know they are infectious. This is what makes it so difficult to contain. Infections are almost certainly going to rise. But the key question is by how much and among which groups. Crucial to the success will be the testing and tracing regime. Each UK nation runs its own contact tracing system, but they work on the same principles - the details of positive cases are passed on to contact tracers who then try to identify their close contacts and ask them to isolate. Huge strides have been made to set up an effective system. The UK is now carrying out more tests per head of population than Spain, France and Germany. But problems still remain. A backlog has developed in processing tests at the three mega labs, which means it is taking longer to give people results - the average turnaround time is now more than 24 hours. The problems have prompted testing to be prioritised in high infection areas,meaning in some areas people are struggling to book tests at local centres. And demand continues to grow all the time. Scotland saw a big rise in tests being requested for children after schools went back in August. Contact tracing is also still a work in progress. England's service, for example, is still not quite reaching the 80% of positive cases and close contacts it is aiming to - although it is not that far short. But for all the difficulties that remain, the pattern of infections, the infrastructure now in place and the improvement in treatment all do offer hope.

"Coffee chain Costa Coffee has said that up to 1,650 roles are at risk of being cut, as it is forced to reduce costs because of the impact of coronavirus. It says there are still ""high levels of uncertainty"" as to when trade will regain pre-pandemic volumes. The firm is consulting with staff to try to find roles in other parts of the business for those facing redundancy. Costa Coffee said the decision to cut jobs was an ""extremely difficult"" one to make. ""Our baristas are the heart of the Costa business and I am truly sorry that many now face uncertainty following today's news,"" said Neil Lake, managing director for Costa Coffee UK and Ireland. The company is suggesting the role of assistant store manager will be removed in branches across the UK. Most of its UK coffee shops that were closed during lockdown have now reopened, but the impact of Covid-19 remains ""challenging"", the company said in a statement. Despite benefiting from measures such as the government's cut in VAT for the hospitality industry and the ""eat out to help out"" scheme, the company said, ""there remain high levels of uncertainty as to when trade will recover to pre-Covid levels"". It added that it had already frozen all pay increases within its support centre and cut all non-essential expenditure. Warnings of 'ghost towns' if offices stay empty Costa employs 16,000 people in its wholly owned coffee shops, and there are a further 10,500 people working in its franchise network. ""We have had to make these difficult decisions to protect the business and ensure we safeguard as many jobs as possible for our 16,000 team members, whilst emerging stronger, ready for future growth"", the company said. It is the latest food and drink company to make cuts following the lockdown and the resulting lack of shoppers and office workers in town centres. Businesses that rely on lunchtime or after-work trade from offices have been particularly hard hit. Last week, sandwich chainPret A Manger announced it would be cutting 3,000 jobs, a third of its workforce. Julie Palmer, partner at the business recovery firm, Begbies Traynor, said many firms were currently trying to cut costs. ""Attempts are being made by some businesses to work with local councils in order to utilise outside spaces where consumers feel more comfortable, but with winter approaching, they are running out of time"", she commented. ""It's likely that as businesses try to recoup their losses from the past few months, many others will follow a similar suit to Costa Coffee.""

"People arriving in Wales and Scotland from Portugal must now self-isolate for 14 days, but the rules covering England and Northern Ireland are unchanged. The difference between the nations has been criticised as confusing. The rules for Wales apply from 04:00 BST on Friday, while in Scotland they begin 24 hours later on Saturday. Cases in Portugal have risen in the past week beyond the threshold at which ministers generally consider imposing 14-day mandatory self-isolation. The Department for Transport said decisions around adding or removing countries from the quarantine list ""take into account a range of factors"" - including how many people are being tested. ""Portugal has drastically increased its testing capacity, as well as taking measures to control the spread of the virus,"" said a spokesperson, adding it would closely monitor the situation. What are the UK's quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? The latest quarantine rulesintroduced in Walesapply to travellers from Portugal, Gibraltar, six Greek islands and French Polynesia. The six islands are Crete, Mykonos, Zakynthos (or Zante), Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos. Scotland has alreadyreintroduced self-isolation measures for arrivals from Greeceand has now addedPortugal and French Polynesiato its list of countries requiring quarantine. ""This week's data shows an increase in test positivity and cases per 100k in Portugal,"" said Scottish justice minister Humza Yousaf. Changes to the rules for arrivals from Greece coming to England have been considered - but Greece will stay on its safe list for now. In Portugal, the seven-day infection rate has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. This is above the threshold of 20 which is when the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Greece's rate overall is below the threshold at 13.8 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 2 September, down from 14.9 a week earlier. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday: ""There are no English additions or removals today. We continue to keep the travel corridor list under constant review and won't hesitate to remove countries if needed."" ""Nonetheless, holidaymakers are reminded - 14-day quarantine countries can and do change at very short notice."" He said the government takes several factors into account, including the prevalence of the virus as well as the level and rate of change, how many tests the country is doing, the extent of the contained outbreak and the government's actions. Northern Ireland's department of health also confirmed that NI would not make any further changes at present. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? The changes have drawn criticism from industry experts as well as holidaymakers. ""The quarantine policy is in tatters and dividing the United Kingdom,"" said Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy firm The PC Agency. ""Consumers are totally confused by the different approaches and it's impossible to understand the government's own criteria any more on when to add or remove a country. ""The current strategy has to change. The weekly reviews have been causing anxiety and financial pain for so many consumers and travel firms,"" he added. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""Days of speculation around this announcement meant many people rushed to pay extortionate prices for flights back to England to avoid having to quarantine on their return - only to now find out there was no need. ""The government knows this and yet it continues to offer no clarity around how these decisions are made."" One aviation boss described travelling abroad right now as ""quarantine roulette"" because the list of destinations which are affected keeps changing. But the governments in Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardiff are now clearly at odds over which countries pose a clear risk. Portugal's infection rate is above the UK government's benchmark of 20 cases of the virus for every 100,000 people. But the UK government has surprised us all and not added Portugal to the list for England. It's not clear why. Greece is even more complicated as the Welsh government is opting for a policy where only people arriving from certain Greek islands have to self-isolate while Scotland has introduced a quarantine for arrivals from across Greece. For months the travel industry has been lobbying the UK government for an approach where they consider particular regions in a country but ministers in London are not keen on the idea. The quarantine was already hard or impossible to police. But discrepancies between different UK nations makes it even harder as someone could, theoretically, fly into Newcastle from Greece and drive into Scotland. That person should self-isolate for 14 days, but no-one will be checking. Some holidaymakers have told the BBC they havepaid as much as Â£1,000 for flightsto get home from Portugal in anticipation of the rules changing. Kelly, from Birmingham, and her family changed their flights home from the Algarve from Saturday to Friday at a cost of Â£900 to avoid potential quarantine because she did not want her children to miss out on two weeks of school. The 45-year-old said the situation was ""absolutely disgusting"". ""It's cost us a lot more money and it's money we didn't need to spend now. We've lost an extra night in our villa - we won't get that back - we've got a hire car, so we're taking that back a day early."" She added: ""The government just change the goalposts left, right and centre at the moment. It's embarrassing."" Damian Martin from Swansea - who is currently on holiday in Lagos, Portugal - said he only arrived earlier on Thursday. ""Work had been full on so I decided to go,"" said Damian ""I had already switched my holiday from Spain and I won't be able to come back early,"" he said. ""I will be able to self-isolate, I think, but I work for a supermarket so will have to check in with them."" He added: ""I'm supposed to be here eight nights. I might as well try to enjoy it. Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal. Most head to the Algarve in the south, drawn by sunny Atlantic beaches, picturesque fishing villages and golf courses. During May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed.

"Rachel Murray, seven, took part in the trial Diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal cramps in children could be a sign of coronavirus infection, UK researchers say. The Queen's University Belfast team have been studying children and say this may be worth adding to the checklist of symptoms. Currently, the officially recognised symptoms in the UK are a fever, cough and loss of smell or taste. Anyone with any of these should isolate and get tested for the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control already lists nausea or vomiting and diarrhoea among possible Covid-19 symptoms. 'Reassuring' study of children's 'tiny' risk Children's role in spread puzzles scientists Coronavirus: Children affected by rare Kawasaki-like disease In the trial, nearly 1,000 children had their blood tested to see if they had recently caught coronavirus. The results, published but not yet peer-reviewed atmedRxiv,external, revealed 68 of the 992 children had antibodies to the virus, suggesting they had been infected with Sars-Cov-2 at some point. Half of those who tested positive reported having symptoms. Fever was the most common - reported by 21 of the 68 children who tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. Cough was also common but less specific, being reported as commonly by children who tested negative as those who tested positive. Gastrointestinal symptoms - such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal cramps - were reported by 13 of the 68 children who tested positive for antibodies, and appeared to be significantly associated with coronavirus infection. Loss of smell or taste was less common - reported by six of the children with antibodies. None of the children in the study was seriously ill or needed to be admitted to hospital. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Lead researcher Dr Tom Waterfield said: ""We know that, thankfully, most children who get the virus will not be very ill with it - but we still do not know how much children may be spreading it."" In the study, testing only those children with fever, cough or changes in smell or taste would have identified 26 out of 34 or 76% of the symptomatic cases. Adding gastrointestinal symptoms would have identified nearly all - 33 out of 34 or 97% - of the symptomatic cases, he explained. ""We are finding that diarrhoea and vomiting is a symptom reported by some children and I think adding it to the list of known symptoms is worth considering,"" Dr Waterfield said. A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""An expert scientific group keeps the symptoms of Covid-19 under review as we increase our understanding of the virus. ""Anyone in England experiencing the main symptoms of coronavirus - a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or a loss or change to sense of smell or taste - should get a test as soon as possible.""

"The children, aged between one and eight, were found in a family home The bodies of five children have been found in a flat in a large housing block in the western German city of Solingen, police say. Police say they suspect the 27-year-old mother of killing the children before attempting to take her own life at a train station in nearby DÃ¼sseldorf. Few details have been provided, with no information about the cause of death. Emergency services were called to the residential block in the Hasseldelle area of the city on Thursday afternoon. Responding to call at about 13:45 local time (11:45 GMT), police said they arrived at the building in Solingen, in North Rhine-Westphalia state, to discover the bodies of five children - three girls and two boys - aged from one to eight. A sixth child, reportedly an 11-year-old boy, was said to have survived. The children's grandmother, who lives 60km (37 miles) away in the city of MÃ¶nchengladbach, had alerted the emergency services, the German news website Bild reported. The entrance to the block of flats has been sealed off and forensic officers are at the scene Police spokesman Stefan Weiand said the children's mother had been ""seriously injured"" after throwing herself in front of a train in DÃ¼sseldorf and was being treated in hospital under police guard. ""Background and further details are not known at this point and that is what we are trying to find out,"" Mr Weiand told journalists, adding that police investigators were at the scene ""in full force"". Police said they were hoping to learn more about the ""incredibly tragic occurrence"" after speaking with the mother. The entrance to the block of flats in Solingen has been sealed off and images show police cars and ambulances lining the streets, with forensic officers also at the scene. A woman places a candle alongside a teddy at the residential building in Solingen, Germany The mayor of Solingen, Tim Kurzbach, wrote on Facebook that he had visited the housing block where ""this terrible act took place"" after hearing the news. ""For me it is still incomprehensible,"" he wrote in the post, adding: ""Today is a day of mourning for all of Solingen."" Later on Thursday, residents began leaving flowers and candles at the entrance to the building as a tribute.

"Online retail giant Amazon has said it will create a further 7,000 UK jobs this year to meet growing demand. Amazon said it had already added 3,000 roles so far in 2020, and so by the end of the year it will have created a total of 10,000 new jobs. This will take its total permanent UK workforce to more than 40,000. Amazon says the new jobs will be permanent and pay a minimum of Â£9.50 an hour. It is also recruiting 20,000 seasonal posts for the festive period. The company has faced criticism in the past from unions overthe way it treats staffandhealth and safety. The coronavirus crisis and lockdowns, which saw many High Street shops temporarily closed, prompted massive growth in online shopping, benefiting online giants such as Amazon. Thelatest retail sales figures,externalshowed that UK online sales in July were more than 50% higher than pre-pandemic levels in February. Online sales as a proportion of all UK retail sales hit a record high of more than 30% in May, before falling back to more than 28% in July. Amazon took on thousands of temporary workers during the pandemic, and it says many of them will now be able to move into these new permanent roles. The company is recruiting at more than 50 sites. It said the creation of the new roles, which will include engineers, graduates, human resources, IT, health and safety and finance specialists, as well as the teams who will pick, pack and ship customer orders, was in response to growing customer demand. Which sectors are hiring at the moment? DPD and B&Q owner to hire 7,500 as demand surges Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work? Amazon at 25: The story of a giant ""At the centre of the job creation programme are three new, state-of-the-art fulfilment centres in Darlington, Durham and Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, each fitted out with advanced Amazon Robotics technology and each creating more than 1,000 new permanent roles,"" the firm said in a statement. ""Construction of these new fulfilment centres began last year. Darlington started operations in May and the sites in Durham and Sutton-in-Ashfield will launch later this autumn."" Amazon's ""huge expansion"" in the UK ""comes as little surprise, given the massive surge in sales the tech giant has experienced, as the e-commerce sector boomed during the pandemic,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Despite spending billions of dollars gearing itself up to operate through the coronavirus crisis, Amazon still delivered a huge increase in profits during the second quarter. ""With expansion planned right across the UK, High Street retailers are going to have to deliver some dramatic changes if they're to compete with the king of e-commerce,"" she added. The news that Amazon is creating another 7,000 permanent jobs should perhaps come as no surprise. Amazon has now quadrupled its workforce from 10,000 to 40,000 in the last five years and the onset of COVID-19 has accelerated a very clear trend towards online rather than physical retail. Just last week, Tesco announced it was creating 16,000 new permanent posts as they reported that online sales which had taken 20 years to reach 9% of their sales took just 20 weeks to nearly double to 16%. Both Amazon and Tesco had hired thousands of temporary workers to cope with that demand - both clearly feel this shift is permanent. At a time when many people are losing their jobs - announcements of thousands of new jobs are welcome. But the rise and rise of Amazon has been mirrored by the decline and recent fall in overall retail employment. As Amazon has added 30,000 jobs in five years, The Office for National Statistics says there are 106,000 fewer total retail jobs over the same period which doesn't even include the COVID impact. Amazon is often criticised for paying too little tax but taxes are levied on profits and Amazon's retail business works on close to zero profit margins. That is very hard to compete with. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the pandemic had been a ""challenging time for many businesses"" but that the new Amazon jobs were ""hugely encouraging"". Many firms - especially High Street retailers - have been cutting jobs in recent months, due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic andas the government's jobs retention scheme starts to wind down. The number of employees on UK payrollsfell by 730,000between March to July,according to the most recent figures,external. However, while many sectors have been hit hard, some companies have been recruiting. Courier firm DPD and B&Q owner Kingfishersaid in June that they would be hiring thousands more staff. Supermarkets, whichsaw a surge in demand for online deliveries due to the pandemic, have also been hiring. Tesco said in August thatit would create 16,000 permanent jobsafter lockdown led to ""exceptional growth"" in its online business.

"People arriving in Wales and Scotland from Portugal must now self-isolate for 14 days, but the rules covering England and Northern Ireland are unchanged. The difference between the nations has been criticised as confusing. The rules for Wales apply from 04:00 BST on Friday, while in Scotland they begin 24 hours later on Saturday. Cases in Portugal have risen in the past week beyond the threshold at which ministers generally consider imposing 14-day mandatory self-isolation. The Department for Transport said decisions around adding or removing countries from the quarantine list ""take into account a range of factors"" - including how many people are being tested. ""Portugal has drastically increased its testing capacity, as well as taking measures to control the spread of the virus,"" said a spokesperson, adding it would closely monitor the situation. What are the UK's quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? The latest quarantine rulesintroduced in Walesapply to travellers from Portugal, Gibraltar, six Greek islands and French Polynesia. The six islands are Crete, Mykonos, Zakynthos (or Zante), Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos. Scotland has alreadyreintroduced self-isolation measures for arrivals from Greeceand has now addedPortugal and French Polynesiato its list of countries requiring quarantine. ""This week's data shows an increase in test positivity and cases per 100k in Portugal,"" said Scottish justice minister Humza Yousaf. Changes to the rules for arrivals from Greece coming to England have been considered - but Greece will stay on its safe list for now. In Portugal, the seven-day infection rate has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. This is above the threshold of 20 which is when the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Greece's rate overall is below the threshold at 13.8 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 2 September, down from 14.9 a week earlier. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday: ""There are no English additions or removals today. We continue to keep the travel corridor list under constant review and won't hesitate to remove countries if needed."" ""Nonetheless, holidaymakers are reminded - 14-day quarantine countries can and do change at very short notice."" He said the government takes several factors into account, including the prevalence of the virus as well as the level and rate of change, how many tests the country is doing, the extent of the contained outbreak and the government's actions. Northern Ireland's department of health also confirmed that NI would not make any further changes at present. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? The changes have drawn criticism from industry experts as well as holidaymakers. ""The quarantine policy is in tatters and dividing the United Kingdom,"" said Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy firm The PC Agency. ""Consumers are totally confused by the different approaches and it's impossible to understand the government's own criteria any more on when to add or remove a country. ""The current strategy has to change. The weekly reviews have been causing anxiety and financial pain for so many consumers and travel firms,"" he added. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""Days of speculation around this announcement meant many people rushed to pay extortionate prices for flights back to England to avoid having to quarantine on their return - only to now find out there was no need. ""The government knows this and yet it continues to offer no clarity around how these decisions are made."" One aviation boss described travelling abroad right now as ""quarantine roulette"" because the list of destinations which are affected keeps changing. But the governments in Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardiff are now clearly at odds over which countries pose a clear risk. Portugal's infection rate is above the UK government's benchmark of 20 cases of the virus for every 100,000 people. But the UK government has surprised us all and not added Portugal to the list for England. It's not clear why. Greece is even more complicated as the Welsh government is opting for a policy where only people arriving from certain Greek islands have to self-isolate while Scotland has introduced a quarantine for arrivals from across Greece. For months the travel industry has been lobbying the UK government for an approach where they consider particular regions in a country but ministers in London are not keen on the idea. The quarantine was already hard or impossible to police. But discrepancies between different UK nations makes it even harder as someone could, theoretically, fly into Newcastle from Greece and drive into Scotland. That person should self-isolate for 14 days, but no-one will be checking. Some holidaymakers have told the BBC they havepaid as much as Â£1,000 for flightsto get home from Portugal in anticipation of the rules changing. Kelly, from Birmingham, and her family changed their flights home from the Algarve from Saturday to Friday at a cost of Â£900 to avoid potential quarantine because she did not want her children to miss out on two weeks of school. The 45-year-old said the situation was ""absolutely disgusting"". ""It's cost us a lot more money and it's money we didn't need to spend now. We've lost an extra night in our villa - we won't get that back - we've got a hire car, so we're taking that back a day early."" She added: ""The government just change the goalposts left, right and centre at the moment. It's embarrassing."" Damian Martin from Swansea - who is currently on holiday in Lagos, Portugal - said he only arrived earlier on Thursday. ""Work had been full on so I decided to go,"" said Damian ""I had already switched my holiday from Spain and I won't be able to come back early,"" he said. ""I will be able to self-isolate, I think, but I work for a supermarket so will have to check in with them."" He added: ""I'm supposed to be here eight nights. I might as well try to enjoy it. Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal. Most head to the Algarve in the south, drawn by sunny Atlantic beaches, picturesque fishing villages and golf courses. During May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed.

"The owners of Millers of Speyside took the decision to close the factory for 14 days An abattoir in the Highlands has been shut down after an increase in cases in a Covid-19 cluster. Twenty-nine of the 31 cases in the Grantown on Spey area are linked to the town's Millers of Speyside meat processing factory. A nursery in Boat of Garten has closed and visiting to local care homes has also been suspended due to the rise from five cases earlier in the week. NHS Highland said its health protection team was carrying out contact tracing. Highland Council has offered support to people who are having to self-isolate. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said an investigation was ongoing to find any ""themes"" to the outbreak and whether any additional measures were required to tackle it. Allow Twitter content?

NHS Highland said the owners of Millers of Speyside had taken the decision to shut for two weeks, and were assisting in an investigation of the outbreak. Highland Council said Deshars Primary's nursery was closed until 8 September on the advice of NHS Highland's public health team as part of its test and protect investigation. The primary school remains open. A council spokeswoman said: ""All Highland Council educational settings are following rigorous controls including enhanced cleaning, and hand hygiene, and the wearing of face coverings in secondary schools in corridors and at break-out times."" The cluster in the Grantown on Spey area has increased from five earlier this week NHS Highland said there was currently no evidence that food was a source of Covid-19, and it was ""very unlikely"" it could be transmitted through the consumption of food. Dr Tim Allison, director of public health at NHS Highland, said: ""NHS Highland and partners are working together to manage this community outbreak. ""Our health protection team is following up with contacts and the appropriate advice is being given to those identified. ""We would also like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that the virus can recur even in rural communities and so everyone should continue to adhere to physical distancing guidelines, wear a face-covering when in enclosed spaces, clean your hands and surfaces regularly and immediately self-isolate if you develop symptoms."" Sandy Milne, managing director at Millers of Speyside said the company had ""worked tirelessly"" through the pandemic to ensure continued food production. He said: ""To prevent further spread of the virus among both our employees and the local community, we have opted to close our facility for 14 days."" Alan Clarke, chief executive at Quality Meat Scotland, said the red meat industry had taken precautions to tackle Covid-19. She said: ""Millers of Speyside, like other Scottish food businesses, has whole-heartedly embraced these measures and has followed all guidelines, to isolate the spread of infection, protecting the health and wellbeing of their workforce and the local community.""

""Star Trek has always made a mission of giving visibility to underrepresented communities,"" said a producer. The show's co-runner and executive producer Michelle Paradise added: ""It believes in showing people that a future without division on the basis of race, gender, gender identity or sexual orientation is entirely within our reach."" The programme, which will begin again next month on US TV network CBS, previously featured the first married gay characters in the franchise's history; while Sonequa Martin-Green also became the first Black woman to lead a Star Trek TV series.

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says there are 101 new positive cases, 53 of them in the Greater Glasgow area One more death, which took place in mid-August, has been recorded following a positive test Ms Sturgeon says the R number is probably now above one, and could be as high as 1.4 Home Farm care home on Skye, where 10 residents died from Covid-19, will be taken into NHS ownership Health officials have found evidence of coronavirus spreading in schools in Glasgow BBC Scotland News If you are just joining us, the key points from the Scottish government briefing are:  That's all from us on the live page, please take care and stay safe. Simon
  Johnson from The
  Telegraph says he spoke to Professor Linda Bauld who said she does not think the elimination strategy is going well, given the rise in cases. He says he asked the professor if Scotland had adopted a Wack-A-Mole tactic and she said absolutely. The first minister says she thinks a great deal of Linda Bauld who she says is an expert who talks a lot of sense. Ms Sturgeon adds that she is advised by experts on how to keep this virus to the lowest possible level and eliminate it if possible. When outbreaks occur the government will try to hit them hard, but ""elimination is my objective"". Professor Leitch adds that the Glasgow area outbreak is not affecting very young children or very elderly people. ""It's families and young adults...in general terms its mixed households by gender and its mixed age groups,"" he says. That's good as the very old are the most vulnerable and one of the reasons for the restrictions is to protect that, he adds. Libby
  Brooks from The
  Guardian asks for more detail on the targeted restrictions brought in for the Glasgow area. The first minister replies that the outbreak is still ongoing and the Test and Protect work continues. The government will try to give people as full a picture as it develops, Ms Sturgeon pledges. One of the issues is that the outbreak is more disparate than we have seen, which requires targeted measures, she says. She points out that the decisions are informed by date, but also involve a lot of judgement. Tom Martin from the Daily Express wonders why the restrictions in the west of Scotland are so broad and cannot be more targeted. He also asks about how to deal with the feeling some might have about being punished for others' behaviours. ""Nobody's being punished,"" replies Ms Sturgeon. She says she wishes she was able to say precisely where a cluster started, but unfortunately population-based measures are necessary. ""We will try to be as targeted as possible. That can often be more difficult in a city,"" she adds. Jason Leitch adds that in some cases in has been more appropriate to go down to postcode level, such as in the Dumfries & Galloway case which was linked to Carlisle hospital employees. Katrine
  Bussey from PA asks if the previous owners of Home Farm, HC One, will make a profit from its sale to NHS Highland. If so, is that not them being rewarded financially for providing a service which the health secretary says ""put at risk life and limb"", asks Ms Bussey. Jeane Freeman says the government must do everything possible to protect citizens. The health secretary says the conclusion of the negotiations with HC One have provided stability and security for the residents and has been the best use of public funds. To have done anything else would have led to a financial arrangement that would have cost a lot more, she explains. Globalâs Mr Knight also queries why
the NHS is still seeking to buy Home Farm care home when the court action has
been dropped by the Care Inspectorate. The health secretary says the Care
Inspectorate assessed at the time the situation at the care home was a risk to
life and limb. NHS Highland then stepped in to
provide support and leadership â which meant the need for the Care Inspectorate
to go to court was reduced, she says. However, this improvement needs to
be sustained and the conclusion was this would not be the case if NHS Highland
stepped away, Ms Freeman explains. Fraser Knight from Global says the
incidence rate in Greece is 14 people per 100,000. This compares with 22 per
100,000 in Glasgow, suggesting it is safer to holiday in Greece right now
than Glasgow. Should people avoid holidaying in
Glasgow for the next two weeks?, he asks. The first minister says the advice
for Glasgow residents is about not going into other peopleâs houses as that is
what seems to be driving transmission. Cases per 100,000 is not the only
measure to look at as getting an accurate measure will depend on the volume of
testing, she adds. She highlights that in Glasgow the rate
of return for positive test results in Scotland yesterday was around 1%, but in
Glasgow it was 2.2%. Alan
  Smith from Bauer returns to the issue of quarantine and the decision to impose it on people arriving from Greece. Mr Smith asks why the policy covers all of Greece, while in Wales the policy only applies to Zante. He also asks if the case numbers keep dropping in Glasgow will the restrictions be lifted earlier? The first minister points out that we have to be cautious about individual days and need to look at the average over seven days. There is a lot of judgement applied to the restrictions, she adds, pointing out the drivers of transmission can produce the same numbers in different areas. On Greece, the Scottish government will come to its decision and other countries will have to come to their own decisions, Ms Sturgeon says. Peter Macmahon from ITV Border quotes
the first minister saying the virus was âfirmly in retreatâ in June. He asks
whether this assessment was too optimistic or are we on track to get back to
our normal lives. Ms Sturgeon highlights there is a
lot more normality back into our lives, but adds it is not a situation where we
can go back to normal fully. An infectious virus is still out
there, she adds. âWe are fighting it in different
ways now than we were when lockdown was much, much more restrictive,â the first
minister says. She also highlights uncertainty
about how the changing seasons will impact the virus. National Clinical Director Jason Leitch adds that it's quite difficult to be sure where the positive cases are among teachers and pupils. Professor Leitch points out he expects transmission in schools and  and Test and Protect will interrupt the chains of transmission. ""It may be that a few kids or few teachers, or maybe a class at a time will have to be isolated,"" he says. ""We hope, it's not impossible that a school will have to close, we hope that will be kept to an absolute minimum."" The first time we have school transmission is not such an important  moment, he points out. Ewan Petrie from STV points out we have nowseen the first cases of transmission in schoolsand
unions have raised concerns about social distancing there. He asks if the first minister is satisfied the current
guidelines are enough to mitigate the risk to staff and pupils. The first minister replies: ""I don't think it is yet the case that we can definitively say that there has been transmission within schools."" She explains: ""We have never tried to claim that we won't have instances of transmission within schools and the guidance that is in place is designed, as effectively as possible, to mitigate against that."" The first minister points out that well under 1% of the tests taken by younger people and children have been positive. Lucy Whyte from BBC Scotland points to warnings about job losses in the aviation industry and asks whether airports could take on a role in testing for Covid-19. The first minister says the government is continuing to look at whether there are ""effective alternatives"" to quarantine, but due to the period of incubation of the virus a test may not pick up all positive cases. ""Quarantine for 14 days is the most effective way to mitigate the risk of positive cases coming into the country,"" she adds. National clinical director Jason Leitch says he hopes science will hopefully help out with this dilemma, but for now quarantine from some countries is the safest thing to do. Allow Twitter content?

Nicola Sturgeon says the cases in the Glasgow area should be a wake-up call for all of us. The first minister stresses again that people must follow the five
pieces of advice in FACTS: They are: The first minister says some people may wonder why Test and Protect is not stopping these outbreaks. Ms Sturgeon explains Test and Protect is a vital part of the approach, however it is not the equivalent of a vaccine. ""It doesn't magically make Covid go away,"" she says. ""What it does is step in on these occasions when the virus gets past us. All of us when we follow all the advice are the first line of defence against it."" Health Secretary Jeane Freeman confirms the Home Farm care home in Portree is to be bought by NHS Highland. The home is currently owned by HC One, but NHS Highland has previously stepped in after concerns were raised by the Care Inspectorate. A number of residents died at the care home earlier this year from coronavirus. All staff will be moved onto NHS contracts, says Ms Freeman, which will provide more security and better conditions. The health secretary also confirms new guidance on communal activities and says visiting at adult care homes has also been published today. From 7 September, care homes that meet the criteria will be able to resume services from medical specialists. Ms Sturgeon says transmission in Glasgow appears to be largely household based. ""That is what led to the decision to impose household restrictions, but not close pubs,"" she says. She points out the government is trying to be much more guided and targeted with the measures it introduces. They will be reviewed in a week, the first minister reminds us. The first minister returns to the new restrictions following the rise in cases in the Glasgow area. Restrictions  on visiting other householdswere reintroduced in Glasgow and two neighbouring areason Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon says Test and Protect has indicated the cases in Glasgow City, West Dunbartonshire and East
Renfrewshire are not linked to any big outbreak. They are instead associated with multiple, smaller, unconnected household-based clusters. ""That then raises a concern about the risks of wider community transmission,"" she says. The first minister adds: ""Doing nothing was not an option."" Ms Sturgeon explains that Test and Protect provides intelligence, informing the actions that need to be taken by the government. The first minister says measures can then be targeted specifically, as they were with the 2 Sisters Coupar Angus outbreak. She points out that Test and Protect also identified in Aberdeen that the outbreak started in pubs and there was a danger of community transmission. The first minster says again that specific measures were brought in to fight that cluster and the Aberdeen outbreak is now effectively over. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The airline said 212 people in total were on the flight from Crete to Luton Eight teenage holidaymakers who travelled to the UK from Crete have tested positive for coronavirus. The boys were on board Wizz Air's flight 8168 from Heraklion to Luton Airport on 25 August. The airline said 212 people were on the flight but it had ""informed the relevant health authorities"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it was aware of the situation and was advising those affected to self-isolate. The teenagers, who are from Winchester, Hampshire, were part of a group of 12 on board the flight and had spent 10 days in Crete. Shortly after returning to the UK they were contacted by friends they had made on holiday from Estonia, who said they had tested positive upon their return home. The teenagers later took tests at a local drive-through centre. Damian Stafford, whose 18-year-old son tested positive, said his family had not been contacted by the NHS test-and-trace system. ""We've simply had to rely on the much vaunted British common sense and do things on our own without any help from the authorities, and what we're doing obviously is self-isolating,"" he said. ""The track-and-trace system doesn't have to be world beating, it just has to work, and it clearly doesn't at the moment."" Are Greece and Portugal next on the quarantine list? England under pressure to impose Greek quarantine Government 'overseeing the demise of UK aviation' The Department of Health and Social Care insisted the system was effective. It said: ""Hundreds of thousands of people are being tested every day and to make sure we stay in control of this virus, we are targeting our testing capacity at the areas that need it most, including those where there is an outbreak as well as prioritising at-risk groups."" Greece insisted it is doing ""everything in our power"" to keep UK holidaymakers safe In a statement, Wizz Air said: ""The airline has now informed the relevant health authorities in England who are responsible for contacting and advising the 204 other passengers who were on board the flight. ""Wizz Air operates all flights in compliance with local travel regulations, and the safety of passengers and staff is the number one priority."" The government has faced growing pressure to decide whether tourists returning to England from Greece should quarantine,after Scotland and Wales introduced their own measures. Leading figures in the aviation industry have also expressed frustration the government has still not given its backing for testing at airports, akin to systems in place in Germany and France, in order to avoid quarantine measures for those returning from countries with higher rates of infection. Meanwhile, Greece has insisted it is doing ""everything in our power"" to keep UK holidaymakers safe.

"This video can not be played Oliver Gard, known as Ollie, was born on the day after what would have been his brother Charlie's fourth birthday The parents of Charlie Gard, who was at the centre of a legal row over his treatment before he died, have said they have been ""blessed"" by the birth of another son. Oliver Gard was born the day after what would have been Charlie's fourth birthday and has not inherited his brother's rare genetic condition. Charlie died in 2017 after a legal bid for experimental treatment was refused. Connie Yates and Chris Gard said: ""We never thought we'd be happy again."" ""As soon as I found out I was pregnant I felt happier, like I could smile again,"" Ms Yates told BBC Breakfast. ""I think before, I would plaster a smile on and say 'yeah I am OK' all the time. But now I feel I can smile and mean it."" Charlie had encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome - a rare genetic condition - and died in a hospice aged 11 months. Charlie Gard appeared perfectly healthy at birth but his health soon began to deteriorate Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital said he could not see, hear or move and had irreversible brain damage. They argued it was not clear if he could feel pain and said he should be allowed to die with dignity, but Charlie's parents fought for him to be given an experimental treatment in the US. Their battle attracted worldwide attention and drew support fromDonald Trump and Pope Francisbut ended in defeat with aHigh Court ruling. The tragic case of Charlie Gard 'Beautiful boy' Charlie Gard dies Pope and Trump offer Charlie Gard support Mr Gard said: ""After we lost Charlie I just felt like a part of us died with him."" ""We will always live the 'what if Charlie was given the treatment?' ""After I lost Charlie I didn't think I could love another boy like I did him. ""So when he [Oliver] was born a lot of it was relief, because I felt like I did with Charlie and just this instant rush of love."" Connie Yates and Chris Gard raised more than Â£1.3m for experimental treatment for Charlie There was a chance Oliver, who was born on 5 August, might also have Charlie's rare genetic condition but he was born healthy. Ms Yates' contractions began on what would have been Charlie's birthday at about the time Charlie was born, Mr Gard said.

"Police arrested Zoe-Lee Buhler in her home for posting about an anti-lockdown protest online The arrest of a woman in Australia for promoting an anti-lockdown protest online has drawn criticism, after video of the incident went viral. Footage shows officers handcuffing pregnant woman Zoe-Lee Buhler, 28, in her home in Victoria on Wednesday in front of her partner and children. She starts crying during the arrest, telling police: ""I didn't realise I was doing anything wrong."" Authorities have defended the officers, saying they acted appropriately. Victoria has been in lockdown since July to curb a coronavirus outbreak that has fuelled Australia's second wave. Authorities have imposed stay-at-home rules and a curfew in Melbourne, the state capital. The lockdown has closed many businesses and banned gatherings around the state. Many people support the measures but others oppose them, and they have been targeted by a fringe anti-lockdown movement. Last week Victoria Police warned it would arrest people for organising protests in breach of the ban on gatherings. The video - which was live-streamed on Facebook and has been viewed over two million times - shows Ms Buhler and her partner speaking to police in their home in the city of Ballarat. The Victoria Police officers are seen with a warrant. When asked what the arrest is about, one officer says: ""It's in relation to a Facebook post, in relation to a lockdown protest you put on just that day."" Ms Buhler was arrested in front of her family Ms Buhler, who is wearing pyjamas, then offers to delete her post. ""My two kids are here - I have an ultrasound in an hour,"" she says. ""This is ridiculous... I didn't realise I was doing anything wrong."" But the officers respond by telling her she has been charged with ""incitement"" over a planned protest in Ballarat on Saturday. The event is  part of wider anti-lockdown rallies. State Premier Daniel Andrews defended the arrest, saying protests undermined public health efforts. ""Now is not the time to protest about anything. Because to do so is not safe,"" he said on Thursday. Police Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius added: ""[I'm] outraged to say there are still people in our community who think it's a good idea at the time of this deadly pandemic to leave home and protest."" Police patrol Melbourne's streets during lockdown But the incident has been criticised by human rights activists and opposition lawmakers on the left and right of politics. ""Arresting people pre-emptively for the act of organising peaceful protests or for social media posts is something that happens all too often under authoritarian regimes, and it should not be happening in a democracy like Australia,"" said Elaine Pearson of Human Rights Watch. Critics also warned that it could further stoke anti-lockdown sentiment or conspiracy theories, noting the video had been shared among groups in Australia and the US. Such groups have often incorrectly alleged that lockdown measures such as travel restrictions and mask-wearing orders infringe human rights. Individuals can face fines of A$1,652 (Â£910; $1,210) for breaking restrictions, or imprisonment for serious breaches. The lockdown has worked to slow the virus - Victoria has recorded below 100 cases on most days this week, compared to over 700 during the peak in August. Supporters say the police enforcement measures have been necessary to this success. But civil liberties activists have argued Victoria's restrictions are among the harshest seen in Western democracies. They have also disproportionately affected poorer and more ethnically diverse communities, advocates say. In July, many were angered whenthe state confined 3,000 public housing residents to a police-guard lockdownfollowing clusters in some tower blocks. This video can not be played Melbourne tower lockdown 'like being in prison' Under the current lockdown most residents are only allowed outside for an hour per day. The state government has warned the lockdown may extend beyond 13 September, its scheduled finish date. Australia has recorded 678 deaths and more than 26,000 cases.

"Leading figures in UK aviation have expressed frustration that the government has still not given backing for Covid-19 testing at airports. The head of Southampton, Aberdeen and Glasgow airports accused ministers of ""overseeing the demise of UK aviation"". And the bosses of Virgin Atlantic and Heathrow Airport said ""leadership"" was needed on the testing issue, warning of the huge number of jobs at stake. The Department for Transport said it had given huge support to the sector. The aviation industry sees airport testing as a way for passengers to leave quarantine early, and also help the travel industry get back on its feet after lockdown. Foreign travel was paralysed for several months by the pandemic, with airlines, airports and tour firms shedding thousands of jobs. Derek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports, which runs Southampton, Aberdeen and Glasgow, said the sector was seeing more job losses than the demise of the coal industry in the 1980s. ""That's surely not an accolade any government would like to have,"" he said. Mr Provan said the government was ""overseeing the demise of UK aviation"". France and Germany are already using testing at airports for passengers arriving from countries with a higher infection rate. Ministers in the UK have for months been considering whether to back testing at UK airports. They are said to be looking at a two-test system to reduce the risk of someone who recently contracted the virus giving a ""false negative"" result. Under that system two negative results, several days apart, would mean someone would not have to quarantine for the full 14-day period. Heathrow seeks staff pay cuts with jobs warning UK considers returning Portugal to quarantine list Gatwick passenger numbers collapse by 14.7 million BA owner says crisis worst in its history Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said testing was ""essential"" to help kick-start the economy. ""Without free and fast travel with the US, we won't see a rebound of aviation and this will stall the economic recovery of the UK, which of course is already in recession,"" he said. A pilot project was set up at Heathrow to trial coronavirus testing but it is currently not in operation because the tests have not been endorsed by the government. With the list of countries on the UK's quarantine list changing every week, the boss of Heathrow said travellers to and from Britain were facing ""quarantine roulette"". Holidaymakers returning from countries on theUK's quarantine list,externalare required to self-isolate for 14 days. Countries are normally added to the list when they record more than 20 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. Last week, Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic joined France, Spain and a number of others on the list. Ministers are expected to decide later whether Portugal and Greece should be added. Scotland put Greece on its quarantine list following reports of people in the UK testing positive after holidaying on the island of Zakynthos. John Holland-Kaye said the government needed to change its approach. ""I think the government has been very cautious, really focusing on the health crisis and yet we have an unemployment crisis looming. ""The UK government needs to get behind testing as an alternative to quarantine to save millions of jobs in this country,"" he said. The impact of air travel crisis was underlined on Wednesday whenHeathrow said it was in talks with unions about pay cuts for about 2,500 staff.The move was needed to protect jobs, the airport said. Aviation bosses also want ""regional travel corridors"" when certain parts of a country have a low infection rate. Mr Provan said calls for regional travel corridors and testing at airports were falling on deaf ears. ""We are not getting any response back from the government."" And he said that this was causing ""huge frustration"" across an industry that was already having to shed tens of thousands of jobs. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""We provided unprecedented support to the aviation industry - taking early action on airport slots, loans, tax deferrals, and paying people's wages through the furlough scheme. ""While protecting public health remains our priority, we are working closely with experts to keep our approach to quarantine under constant review,"" the spokesman said.

"There is ""unequivocal proof"" that Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, Germany has said. Chancellor Angela Merkel said he was a victim of attempted murder and the world would look to Russia for answers. Mr Navalny was flown to Berlin after falling ill on a flight in Siberia last month, and remains in a coma. His team says he was poisoned on President Vladimir Putin's orders. The Kremlin has dismissed the allegation. The Kremlin spokesman called on Germany for a full exchange of information and foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova complained the Novichok allegations were not backed up by evidence. ""Where are the facts, where are the formulas, at least some kind of information?"" she asked. Navlany 'Novichok poisoning' test for the West What are Novichok agents and what do they do? Navalny and Russiaâs arsenal of exotic poisons A Novichok nerve agent was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in 2018. While they survived, a British woman later died in hospital. The UK accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack. Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the latest attack,externalas ""outrageous"". ""The Russian government must now explain what happened to Mr Navalny - we will work with international partners to ensure justice is done,"" he tweeted. After the government in Berlin released results of toxicology tests carried out at a military laboratory, Chancellor Merkel said there were now ""serious questions that only the Russian government can and must answer"". ""Someone tried to silence [Mr Navalny] and in the name of the whole German government I condemn that in the strongest terms."" Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Navalnyâs team sees Kremlin behind attack Chancellor Merkel said Germany's Nato and EU partners had been informed of the results of the investigation and they would decide on a common and appropriate response based on Russia's reaction. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya and Russia's ambassador to Germany would also be informed of the findings, the Berlin government said. The European Union has demanded a ""transparent"" investigation by the Russian government. ""Those responsible must be brought to justice,""a statement read,external. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also called for an inquiryin a tweet,external, while the US National Security Council (NSC) said the suspected poisoning was ""completely reprehensible"". ""We will work with allies and the international community to hold those in Russia accountable, wherever the evidence leads, and restrict funds for their malign activities,""an NSC spokesman said,external. Alexei Navalny is a name President Putin refuses to say out loud. It's an attempt to diminish his political significance, but the endless prosecutions, police detentions and giant fines Mr Navalny's faced over the years tell a different story about his impact. He's certainly annoyed a lot of people, from those targeted by his anti-corruption investigations to Vladimir Putin himself. So it is possible someone wanted to resolve the ""Navalny problem"" for good. The timing is largely irrelevant. Why now? Well, why not. But if whoever did this hoped to contain the fallout - a mysterious collapse, never explained by Russian doctors - the fact Navalny's team got him to Germany has blown that calculation. The ""collapse"" is now a deliberate attack, and a major international scandal. The Kremlin response so far is familiar: deny, obfuscate, demand proof. Mr Putin's spokesman has even hinted that if Mr Navalny had been poisoned, then it must have happened in Germany because doctors here detected nothing suspicious. Expect to hear a lot more along those lines in the days to come. Mr Navalny fell ill on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow. His supporters suspect poison was placed in a cup of tea at Tomsk airport. The flight of the prominent Putin critic was diverted to Omsk, where doctors treated him for three days before he was transferred to the CharitÃ© hospital in Berlin. Mr Navalny's transfer to Germany came after three days in hospital in Omsk The Kremlin says Russian doctors administered atropine - which can be used to treat the effects of nerve agents - but found no evidence of poisoning. Mrs Navalnaya said she feared Russian doctors had delayed his transfer as authorities were trying to wait for evidence of any chemical substance to disappear. Doctors at CharitÃ© hospital have said his condition is continuing to improve but he remains in an intensive care unit on a ventilator. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of advanced nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Novichok agents have similar effects to other nerve agents - they act by blocking messages from the nerves to the muscles, causing a collapse of many bodily functions. While some Novichok agents are liquids, others are thought to exist in solid form. This means they can be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Novichoks were designed to be more toxic than other chemical weapons, so some versions begin to take effect rapidly - in the order of 30 seconds to two minutes. In 2018, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were left critically ill in the British city of Salisbury, after Russian suspects were alleged to have smeared the nerve agent on the door handle of the former Russian spy's home. What is the Salisbury poisoning's legacy? Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. Her partner became critically ill but recovered. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who has led nationwide protests against the Russian authorities. He has called Mr Putin's party a place of ""crooks and thieves"" that is ""sucking the blood out of Russia"". However, he has been banned from standing against Mr Putin in elections because of a conviction for embezzlement. He denies the crime, saying his legal troubles are Kremlin reprisals for his fierce criticism. There have been a number of previous attacks on high-profile critics or opponents of President Putin, including politicians, intelligence officers and journalists. The Kremlin has always denied involvement. In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko - an ex-Russian intelligence officer who became a Kremlin critic and fled to the UK - died after his tea was poisoned by radioactive polonium-210. More recently, journalist and opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza alleged he was poisoned twice by Russian security services. He nearly died after suffering kidney failure in 2015 and two years later went into a coma for a week. Another Kremlin critic, Pyotr Verzilov, accused Russia's intelligence services of poisoning him in 2018, when he fell ill after a court hearing, losing his sight and ability to speak. He too was treated by Berlin's CharitÃ© hospital, and asked the Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation to arrange Mr Navalny's airlift there.

"Low-deposit mortgage deals available to borrowers have plummeted in recent months as lenders play safer during the economic fall-out from coronavirus. Borrowers able to offer 10% of the value of a home as a deposit could have chosen from 779 deals at the start of March, data from Moneyfacts shows. Six months later, the choice was now down to around 60, the financial information company said. Lenders are being stricter about who they lend to amid fears of defaults. Some large lenders have already said they would not currently consider applications from people on furlough and who did not have a return to work date. When does the stamp duty holiday end? First-time buyers: Four ways the property market 'will be tougher' Pent-up demand 'leading to quicker home sales' First-time buyers are at particular risk from the squeeze on mortgages, as they usually have less in savings to use as a deposit. Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts, said the situation was ""hugely frustrating"" for these potential buyers. ""Product availability has plummeted since March, when there were hundreds of deals to choose from. There are now very few. Those who had expected to get a foot onto the property ladder may now hold their plans, particularly if they only have a 5% deposit,"" she said. Amy is relocating from Glasgow and had a mortgage agreed in principle, but has now been told she needs to offer more upfront. ""I now need to make the difference up with another Â£20,000,"" the 38-year-old said. ""It was all totally manageable, I don't understand, it just seems ludicrous. I'm employed in social services so my job isn't in threat, I've been working as a key worker throughout this pandemic. I've had a mortgage since I was 21. ""I've moved my daughter's schools, so I just had to go forward with it. It's not ideal for a five-year-old, it's not very fair."" HSBC became the latest lender to temporarily restrict lending on 90% loan-to-value deals in what one mortgage broker described as a ""sign of the times"". Aaron Strutt, of Trinity Financial, said that lenders had to balance the books, and that meant a spread of borrowers ranging from first-time buyers - who might be more risky if house prices fell - to those borrowing a far smaller proportion of the value of a property. Self-employed people were also being asked for more information, including bank statements and accounts, when they applied for a mortgage. Mortgage lending has still picked up since lockdown, with many people trying to secure mortgages after a relatively swift agreement to buy a property during a post-lockdownpick-up in house-buying and prices. However, there is an expectation that this mini-boom will not last as job losses mount and finances are stretched as government support schemes are wound down.

"Tony Abbott is visiting the UK Ministers have defended former Australian PM Tony Abbott amid reports that he is being lined up for a role in post-Brexit trade talks. Trade Minister Greg Hands told MPs he welcomed Mr Abbott's desire to ""help this country out"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he had ""real concerns"" and ""wouldn't appoint"" Mr Abbott if he were PM. Mr Abbott says he has had talks with UK ministers about a role but it has yet to be officially confirmed. Opposition and some Tory MPs say he is unfit to represent the UK due to his views on climate change and past ""misogynist"" and ""homophobic"" comments. A group of equality activists - including actor Sir Ian McKellen and Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies - have alsowritten an open letter against Mr Abbott's appointment,external, saying: ""This man is not fit to be representing the UK as our trade envoy."" Mr Abbott's position would be as a member of the UK board of trade, a panel of experts that is being put together to advise International Trade Secretary Liz Truss. Who is Tony Abbott? New Zealand 'frustrated' over UK trade talks End tariffs on UK-made ice cream vans - minister Asked about the potential appointment in the Commons, Mr Hands said: ""No appointments have been confirmed, but personally I welcome the fact that a former prime minister of Australia is willing to help this country out."" On Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked on Sky News about concerns surrounding Mr Abbott's attitude towards women and homosexuality. Mr Hancock said he did not believe Mr Abbott is homophobic or misogynistic, and when pushed, he added: ""He is also an expert on trade."" Reports that Mr Abbott, who was Australia's prime minister between 2013 and 2015 is being lined up to work alongside Liz Truss have been met with anger from UK opposition parties and some Conservative MPs. Labour MPs Chris Bryant and Wes Streeting, who are both gay, accused Mr Hancock of hypocrisy after the health secretarytweeted about the ""fantastic"" new LGBT-inclusive relationships,externaland sex education programme introduced in schools. Mr Bryant said: ""So why on earth would you countenance Tony Abbott as a trade envoy?"" Mr Streeting tweeted: ""Matt, we know you're a social liberal with a decent voting record on LGBT equality. That's why your defence of Tony Abbott was even more nauseating."" Sir Keir said: ""I have real concerns about Tony Abbott, I don't think he's the right person for the job. If I was prime minister, I wouldn't appoint him."" Labour MP Marie Rimmer added: ""Surely there's trade experts who aren't homophobic and misogynists? Britain deserves better than Tony Abbott representing us on the world stage."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Abbott's coronavirus views were ""deeply offensive and wrong"" and he was not fit to be a trade envoy. ""But Tony Abbott, before these comments, is a misogynist, he's a sexist, he's a climate change denier,"" she told Sky News. ""Trade, in many respects, should reflect our values - there should be ethics attached to any country's trading profile."" Liz Truss is in charge of negotiating trade deals with other countries International Trade Secretary Liz Truss was later asked in the Commons about the possible appointment. Following criticism from Labour MP Ruth Cadbury, Ms Truss said: ""I think it's absolute hypocrisy to hear this type of argument from the Labour Party. ""This is a party that has never elected a female leader despite having the opportunity time and time again. ""The reality is they'd rather virtue signal and indulge in tokenism rather than take real action to improve the lives of women."" Labour's Christian Matheson said: ""The appointment of the sexist and homophobic Tony Abbott is also the appointment of a climate change denier. ""So does this indicate the government is moving away from any commitment in trade deals to maintain environmental protection? And if not, why have you put him in the job?"" Ms Truss replied: ""The reality is that those on the left of politics are always intolerant of anyone who doesn't agree with them but are prepared to defend anything from their own friends."" Conservative MP and chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat was asked about the criticism of Mr Abbott. Speaking on BBC News, he said: ""I would like to see people from the United Kingdom representing the regions and nations. ""Businessmen, politicians and industry leaders from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and the different regions from Cornwall and Kent and wherever else in between, making the case that isn't simply trade based on a few narrow industries."" Mr Abbott who led Australia's Liberal Party between 2009 and 2015, was challenged about some of his past comments at a hearing of Mr Tugendhat's select committee on Tuesday. Labour MP Claudia Webbe quoted remarks attributed to him in 2012, that men were by physiology or temperament, more adapted than women to exercise authority and issue commands, and asked if, in the light of that opinion, he would have difficulty accepting the authority of Liz Truss. Mr Abbott said he ""wasn't sure"" he had ever used those words, and that it ""doesn't sound like anything I've said"". The former Australian prime minister is said to have struck up a friendship with Boris Johnson when he was foreign secretary.

"Proposals to allow couples in England and Wales to marry outdoors or inside family homes have been put forward. The Law Commission says the regulations that govern weddings are ""no longer meeting the needs of many couples"". It has proposed private gardens, beaches, parks and cruise ships as potential suitable venues. Rather than force couples to choose between civil and religious marriages, it believes there should be scope for ceremonies reflecting other beliefs. Professor Nick Hopkins, family law commissioner at the Law Commission, which reviews legislation, said wedding days were one of the most important events in people's lives but current laws were not fit for purpose. What are the rules on weddings? 'Weddings every day of the week' in 2021 'Quarantine change has cost us 30 wedding guests' ""Our proposals would give couples the freedom to choose the wedding venue they want and a ceremony that is meaningful for them. By doing so, we hope to make the laws that govern weddings reflect the wishes and needs of today's society,"" he said. A spokesman for the Church of England said it would study and respond to the proposals. ""Our research shows that being married in a place that has meaning is still important to couples and their families,"" they said. ""The moments of waiting to walk down the aisle, standing at the steps and exchanging timeless vows that can only be said in a church, and turning to walk out of the church as a newly-married couple, are cherished."" Gardens are among the suggested suitable wedding venues In England and Wales state a wedding must beeither a religious ceremony or a civil ceremony,external. For religious weddings: The ceremony must take place at a registered religious building Same-sex couples can only be married in a building registered for the marriage of same-sex couples An authorised person, such as a religious minister, must attend the ceremony and register the marriage. For civil ceremonies: The civil ceremony must take place a register office or a venue approved by the local council Two witnesses must be present at the ceremony A registrar must carry out, or be present at, your ceremony. Civil ceremonies can include readings, songs or music, but must not include hymns or readings from religious scriptures. The commission says wedding regulations are ""out of kilter"" with the more modern approach to weddings in Scotland, Ireland and the Channel Islands. You can marry where you like in Scotland Scottish weddings are not governed by location restrictions. It means couples have been married in isolated glens, on uninhabited islands and in ancient castles. In addition, the Marriage (Scotland) Act 2002 stipulates marriages be conducted by any ""authorised celebrants"" - not necessarily a minister of religion or a registrar. In Northern Ireland, wheresame sex religious marriages became lawful on Tuesday, there is no restriction on the location of a religious marriage.

"Proposals to allow couples in England and Wales to marry outdoors or inside family homes have been put forward. The Law Commission says the regulations that govern weddings are ""no longer meeting the needs of many couples"". It has proposed private gardens, beaches, parks and cruise ships as potential suitable venues. Rather than force couples to choose between civil and religious marriages, it believes there should be scope for ceremonies reflecting other beliefs. Professor Nick Hopkins, family law commissioner at the Law Commission, which reviews legislation, said wedding days were one of the most important events in people's lives but current laws were not fit for purpose. What are the rules on weddings? 'Weddings every day of the week' in 2021 'Quarantine change has cost us 30 wedding guests' ""Our proposals would give couples the freedom to choose the wedding venue they want and a ceremony that is meaningful for them. By doing so, we hope to make the laws that govern weddings reflect the wishes and needs of today's society,"" he said. A spokesman for the Church of England said it would study and respond to the proposals. ""Our research shows that being married in a place that has meaning is still important to couples and their families,"" they said. ""The moments of waiting to walk down the aisle, standing at the steps and exchanging timeless vows that can only be said in a church, and turning to walk out of the church as a newly-married couple, are cherished."" Gardens are among the suggested suitable wedding venues In England and Wales state a wedding must beeither a religious ceremony or a civil ceremony,external. For religious weddings: The ceremony must take place at a registered religious building Same-sex couples can only be married in a building registered for the marriage of same-sex couples An authorised person, such as a religious minister, must attend the ceremony and register the marriage. For civil ceremonies: The civil ceremony must take place a register office or a venue approved by the local council Two witnesses must be present at the ceremony A registrar must carry out, or be present at, your ceremony. Civil ceremonies can include readings, songs or music, but must not include hymns or readings from religious scriptures. The commission says wedding regulations are ""out of kilter"" with the more modern approach to weddings in Scotland, Ireland and the Channel Islands. You can marry where you like in Scotland Scottish weddings are not governed by location restrictions. It means couples have been married in isolated glens, on uninhabited islands and in ancient castles. In addition, the Marriage (Scotland) Act 2002 stipulates marriages be conducted by any ""authorised celebrants"" - not necessarily a minister of religion or a registrar. In Northern Ireland, wheresame sex religious marriages became lawful on Tuesday, there is no restriction on the location of a religious marriage. However, civil marriages can only take place in approved venues. In England, the Marriage Act 1994 allowed civil marriages to be take place in certain ""approved premises"" other than churches and register offices.

"Breonna Taylor's name has become a rallying cry at anti-racism protests Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has urged charges against police who shot two black Americans, Jacob Blake and Breonna Taylor. Speaking in Delaware, Mr Biden did not specify what counts should be brought in the cases, which have fuelled racial justice protests nationwide. The Democrat spoke after notching up a record fundraising haul in August. He has a lead over President Donald Trump, a Republican, in opinion polls ahead of November's election. During a news conference in his hometown of Wilmington on Wednesday, Mr Biden was asked whether he agreed with his running mate, Kamala Harris, that the officers in the Blake and Taylor cases should be charged. ""I think we should let the judicial system work its way,"" he said. ""I do think at a minimum, they need to be charged, the officers."" Mr Blake, 29, was shot seven times in the back and paralysed during an arrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on 23 August. No action has so far been taken against the officer involved, pending investigations by the Wisconsin and US departments of justice. Ms Taylor, 26, was fatally shot in her home during a drug raid in Louisville, Kentucky, on 13 March. One of the officers is losing his job; two others have been placed on administrative leave as the investigation into their actions proceeds. What do we know about Jacob Blake's shooting? Why Breonna Taylor's name is chanted at demos Mr Biden also mentioned the gunman, identified in US media as a far-left activist, who fatally shot a Trump supporter on the streets of Portland, Oregon, last weekend. The Democratic nominee stopped short of calling for charges in that case, but said: ""They should be investigated and it should follow through on what needs to be done. ""Let the judicial system work. Let's make sure justice is done."" Mr Biden had been delivering remarks about how to open schools safely in light of the coronavirus pandemic. His comments came a day before he travels to Kenosha, where he says he wants to help ""heal"" the city after it was rocked by days of violent protests. The Joe Biden story What Biden wants to do This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career Mr Biden said he had received ""overwhelming requests"" to visit this latest flashpoint in America's racial reckoning over law enforcement shootings. The Democrat will meet Mr Blake's father and other members of the family during the visit. US father 'won't play politics' over son's shooting President Trump, a Republican, did not meet the family during his own visit to Kenosha on Tuesday, saying he decided not to because of plans to have lawyers attend with the relatives. Mr Biden's visit to Wisconsin comes four years after the previous Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, overlooked the Midwestern state during her campaigning, and it turned out to be pivotal in Mr Trump's against-all-odds 2016 election victory. Has Trump delivered on his promises? Republicans scrap party platform. What that means... At his own event in North Carolina on Wednesday, Mr Trump continued to talk tough about ""violent mobs"" at protests. ""These people know one thing - strength,"" he said. The president also directed his administration to look into stripping federal funding for ""anarchist jurisdictions"" including New York City, Seattle, Washington DC and Portland, Oregon. Earlier in the day, the Biden campaign announced a $364m (Â£272m) fundraising haul for August, more than both he and Mr Trump pulled in in the previous month. The Democrat will splurge $45m of his war chest on a single ad rebutting opposition claims he will not stand up to rioters and looters. This video can not be played George Floyd death: Whatâs changed, 100 days later? It will splice clips of him condemning violence at protests, which he has done several times since the demonstrations began with the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in May. Mr Trump, meanwhile, will air a duelling ad in Minnesota with the message: ""Communities not criminals. Jobs not mobs."" Mr Biden has a clear single-digit lead in opinion polls nationally and is ahead by a somewhat smaller margin in the handful of swing states that will actually decide this election. A new survey covering the critical state of Pennsylvania, by Monmouth University on Wednesday, showed Mr Biden's lead over Mr Trump had shrunk from 10 points in July to three points now.

"Police arrested Zoe-Lee Buhler in her home for posting about an anti-lockdown protest online The arrest of a woman in Australia for promoting an anti-lockdown protest online has drawn criticism, after video of the incident went viral. Footage shows officers handcuffing pregnant woman Zoe-Lee Buhler, 28, in her home in Victoria on Wednesday in front of her partner and children. She starts crying during the arrest, telling police: ""I didn't realise I was doing anything wrong."" Authorities have defended the officers, saying they acted appropriately. Victoria has been in lockdown since July to curb a coronavirus outbreak that has fuelled Australia's second wave. Authorities have imposed stay-at-home rules and a curfew in Melbourne, the state capital. The lockdown has closed many businesses and banned gatherings around the state. Many people support the measures but others oppose them, and they have been targeted by a fringe anti-lockdown movement. Last week Victoria Police warned it would arrest people for organising protests in breach of the ban on gatherings. The video - which was live-streamed on Facebook and has been viewed over two million times - shows Ms Buhler and her partner speaking to police in their home in the city of Ballarat. The Victoria Police officers are seen with a warrant. When asked what the arrest is about, one officer says: ""It's in relation to a Facebook post, in relation to a lockdown protest you put on just that day."" Ms Buhler was arrested in front of her family Ms Buhler, who is wearing pyjamas, then offers to delete her post. ""My two kids are here - I have an ultrasound in an hour,"" she says. ""This is ridiculous... I didn't realise I was doing anything wrong."" But the officers respond by telling her she has been charged with ""incitement"" over a planned protest in Ballarat on Saturday. The event is  part of wider anti-lockdown rallies. State Premier Daniel Andrews defended the arrest, saying protests undermined public health efforts. ""Now is not the time to protest about anything. Because to do so is not safe,"" he said on Thursday. Police Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius added: ""[I'm] outraged to say there are still people in our community who think it's a good idea at the time of this deadly pandemic to leave home and protest."" Police patrol Melbourne's streets during lockdown But the incident has been criticised by human rights activists and opposition lawmakers on the left and right of politics. ""Arresting people pre-emptively for the act of organising peaceful protests or for social media posts is something that happens all too often under authoritarian regimes, and it should not be happening in a democracy like Australia,"" said Elaine Pearson of Human Rights Watch. Critics also warned that it could further stoke anti-lockdown sentiment or conspiracy theories, noting the video had been shared among groups in Australia and the US. Such groups have often incorrectly alleged that lockdown measures such as travel restrictions and mask-wearing orders infringe human rights. Individuals can face fines of A$1,652 (Â£910; $1,210) for breaking restrictions, or imprisonment for serious breaches. The lockdown has worked to slow the virus - Victoria has recorded below 100 cases on most days this week, compared to over 700 during the peak in August. Supporters say the police enforcement measures have been necessary to this success. But civil liberties activists have argued Victoria's restrictions are among the harshest seen in Western democracies. They have also disproportionately affected poorer and more ethnically diverse communities, advocates say. In July, many were angered whenthe state confined 3,000 public housing residents to a police-guard lockdownfollowing clusters in some tower blocks. This video can not be played Melbourne tower lockdown 'like being in prison' Under the current lockdown most residents are only allowed outside for an hour per day. The state government has warned the lockdown may extend beyond 13 September, its scheduled finish date. Australia has recorded 678 deaths and more than 26,000 cases.

"Face-to-face visits are vitally important for dementia patients A dementia charity is seeking a judicial review of the government guidance on care home visits. John's Campaign says many care homes in England are still refusing regular face-to-face visits, often essential for people with severe dementia. Dr Angela McIntyre, a retired doctor backing the campaign, has not seen her 92-year-old mother since March. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We know limiting visits in care homes has been difficult for many families."" He added: ""Our first priority is to prevent infections in care homes, and this means that visiting policy should still be restricted with alternatives sought wherever possible. ""Visiting policies should be tailored by the individual care home and take into account local risks in their area."" 'Hidden catastrophe' in care homes, charities warn 'Care home lockdown sent my grandad into spiral of decline' Care home nurse saves 13 dementia patients ButJohn's Campaign,externalbelieves the guidance does not take into account how important visits from family members are for dementia patients and believes it could be in breach of the law. It cites the case of Dr McIntyre's mother, Joan, who is bed-bound and isolated in her top-floor room. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? NEWS FATIGUE:Is it time to move on? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters COMPARING COUNTRIES:The pitfalls of doing so RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? The charity said: ""Her daughter's visits [were] previously her only comfort. It's now six months since Angela has been allowed to visit Joan despite advising that she would take all infection-control precautions and only enter her room via the fire exit stairs. ""Instead she has been told that she will only be permitted when her mother is dying."" John's Campaign co-founder Julia Jones, whose mother June spent the last two-and-a-half years of her life in a care home, said: ""We know we're speaking for thousands who are experiencing extraordinary bewilderment and anguish. ""We can only hope that the government will waste no more of these people's precious time and will give clear direction and the necessary support for their needs and wishes to be respected."" Rosie, pictured as a child with her mother, says she used to have visitors every day When Rosie was finally allowed to visit her mother in her care home in June, after months of lockdown, she was shocked to see her dementia had worsened. During the August heatwave, and after a spell of not eating, Rosie's mother had begun refusing liquids - a grim sign which led carers to allow Rosie to spend more time with her mother, as long as she wore PPE. Being able to hold her mother's hand in her final days ""felt really important"" and Rosie was ""really grateful I could be there"". ""But at the same time, 30 minutes and a carer would come and say 'you need to leave now',"" she told BBC Radio 4's Sanchia Berg. While Rosie was grateful to the carers who allowed her longer visits in the last days before her mother's death, Rosie said she felt like the months of lockdown where no visits were allowed had led to her mother's decline. In comparison with paid carers on varied shifts, Rosie says her family ""were the constant in understanding my mum's needs"" - and that family members should therefore be ""considered equal to paid care staff"" when it comes to access to care homes. John's Campaign has instructed two legal firms who, it says, are ""in the process of preparing a pre-action letter, the first stage of a legal challenge"" against the government's advice.

"There is UK division, as travellers to Wales from Portugal and six Greek islands must self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Friday Scotland will introduce quarantine for travellers from Portugal and French Polynesia on Saturday But no countries are added to England, or Northern Ireland's, travel quarantine list today The US Centers for Disease Control is asking states to get rid of red tape to allow distribution of a potential vaccine by 1 November Under the scenario being planned for, a vaccine would be rolled out for certain groups days before the US election Globally, there have been more than 26m confirmed cases since the outbreak began and 863,000 deaths Claire Heald That's all for our live coverage today. Thanks for joining us. Here's a recap of the main stories from the UK and around the world related to the pandemic:  Today's coverage has been brought to you by Claire Heald, Flora Drury, Penny Spiller, Paul Kirby, Alex Therrien, Georgina Rannard, Vanessa Buschschluter, Krutika Pathi, Max Matza, David Walker and Doug Faulkner. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Ministerial decisions around adding or removing countries from the list take into account a range of factors, including virus incidence rates, information on a country's testing capacity, an assessment of the quality of data available, the effectiveness of the measures being deployed by a country to tackle the virus, and an estimate of the proportion of the population that is currently infectious in each country. The Department for Transport says the reason for not putting Portugal on the list of countries from which returning travellers to England must quarantine is that: ""Portugal has drastically increased its testing capacity, as well as taking measures to control the spread of the virus. ""We will closely monitor this situation, and as the Secretary of State for Transport has made clear, we are prepared to act at pace to remove a country from our Travel Corridor list in order to protect public health."" So from that you could read that Portugal increasing testing and taking strong steps to tackle  coronavirus cancels out the case rate being slightly above 20. If you are just joining us, you might be confused about which countries you can travel from without having to quarantine in your home UK country on your return. Here is what has changed today: The Scottish government has confirmed that travellers from Portugal and French Polynesia will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Saturday. Scotland's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf also said Gibraltar is ""high up on our watch list"" and would be monitored closely. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor We've been hearing about the long journeys people have been asked to take to access a coronavirus test in the UK. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country. There has been an apology to those who were told to go a hundred miles or more for a test. Officials acknowledge that resources are stretched and have to be targeted at areas with local outbreaks. But they point out that a new mega lab is set to come on stream in the East Midlands soon. They argue that trials of new rapid testing techniques will be expanded, which could prove to be game-changers. For now though, the system is stretched, even though the official numbers suggest capacity is running ahead of demand. Questions will continue to be asked about whether the system can cope with the challenges ahead as schools return and winter approaches. The cancellation of much-loved festivals and events have been frustrating for many around the world during the pandemic. But in one Nepalese city it resulted in clashes with the police and tear gas. Hundreds of residents in Lalitpur, near Kathmandu, defied a ban on mass gatherings to hold their time-honoured tradition of a chariot procession to the rain god Rato Machhindranath. As more and more people gathered in the streets, police said they were unable to control the numbers. ""We charged (with) water cannon and tear gas to stop the
rally,"" police official Tek Prasad Rai told Reuters news agency. Rocks were thrown in retaliation and a police motorcycle was set on fire. It is not known how many people were injured but at least one wounded person was carried away by police, witnesses told Reuters. BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Lynn hasn't seen her husband for five weeks because of local coronavirus lockdowns. BBC Radio 5 Live has been focusing today on the restrictions around visiting family in care homes, after a woman whose husband has dementia said she'd not seen him for five weeks, because of local lockdown changes. Lynn lives in Trafford which was subject to extra lockdown rules at the end of July. Yesterday those restrictions were due to lift, but the decision was reversed after a rise in cases. Dementia charity John's Campaign is seeking a judicial review of the government guidance on care home visits.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We know limiting visits in care homes has been difficult for many families."" Click here to listen to a special 5 Live Your Call about care homes on BBC Sounds. France has registered more than 7,000 new coronavirus cases for the second day in a row. The health ministry said on Thursday there were 7,157 new infections, a slight increase on the previous day's figure of 7,017 but shy of the
7,578 record set on 31 March. The ministry said the cumulative number of
confirmed cases was now 300,181.

There were 20 more virus-linked deaths, taking the total to 30,706. France is one of several European countries battling a resurgence of infections.

The head of the European Union's public health agency says numbers of cases are back to levels seen in March, when the virus first gripped the continent. Residents will be asked to pay Â£50 to be tested after seven days In contrast to Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, residents returning to the Isle of Man - a crown dependency - can now self-isolate for seven days if they pay for a Covid-19 test and the result is negative, the chief minister there has said. Currently, anyone arriving on the Isle of Man must self-isolate for 14 days. From Monday, returning residents can pay Â£50 to be tested for coronavirus after a week and will be allowed to leave their home, under certain restrictions, if it is negative. Residents who pay for a Covid-19 test, which comes back negative, will be allowed to leave isolation early. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent Earlier, surprisingly, the UK government said it was not
adding Portugal to the list of countries requiring returning travellers to quarantine for 14 days. Itâs surprising because Portugal is above the benchmark the
UK government has set and said publicly it is following - of 20 cases per 100,000 people, at 23. So it is a bit confusing why the UK government hasnât, but the Welsh and possibly the
Scottish government have, made the change. And then there is Greece. The Scottish government said
earlier in the week all of Greece would be added to its quarantine list whereas
Wales has listed six Greek islands including Zakynthos. Some British holiday
makers returning from there recently have come back with the
virus. So the Welsh government is going for a regional approach in terms of
Greece. From a public health perspective all the nations' governments are
saying this is necessary right now. If you look at it from the travel industry
perspective it canât go on like this much longer. Portugal will be added to Scotland's quarantine list from this weekend, senior Scottish government sources have told BBC Scotland. Read morehere. A bit more now on the Welsh government's move to put Portugal and six Greek islands on its list of places that come under quarantine regulations from early Friday morning. Although travellers returning from Portugal face self-isolation if they come back after 0400 BST on Friday, the Azores and Madeira will remain exempt, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said. The Greek islands of Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos and Crete have also been added to the quarantine list, along with Gibraltar and French Polynesia.  Ebbsfleet and Ashford stations, in Kent, are to be mothballed
after an ""unprecedented fall in demand"". It means passengers in Kent will need to start their journeys at St Pancras, in London. In a statement Eurostar said: ""Covid-19 has had a severe impact on the travel industry and on our business and we continue to operate in very challenging conditions. ""We have experienced an unprecedented fall in demand, with bookings down by 90% compared to last year. ""The environment remains very unpredictable and has been exacerbated by quarantine restrictions which are now across all of our markets."" The rail operator said it had not taken the decision not to reopen Ebbsfleet and Ashford before 2022 lightly, but said because of the ""severity of the situation"" it had to take action.  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has said quarantine restrictions are ""killing"" international travel and would not be necessary with a better thought-through testing regime. Speaking to the BBC's Newscast podcast, the ex-Labour leader welcomed new testing trials announced by the government but said they could have come several months ago - as he predicted we could be dealing with restrictions for another two years. Mr Blair said: ""I donât think itâs necessary to do 14 day quarantine when you come back into the country. That is if you want literally zero risk."" He added ""for international travel, [the quarantine is] killing it"". Newscast is on BBC One at 23.45 BST and on BBC Sounds.. BBC reporters have been at two primary schools in England today, asking pupils and parents how it feels to be back after the unprecedented break caused by the pandemic lockdown. Eight-year-old Aarizuddin Halim said he was excited about meeting his friends again while Alicja Golinczak said she wondered what her new teacher was going to be like. Mickel Baptiste, who was back on the school run with his seven-year-old daughter, Alyssa, said it was good to return to some sense of normality. Read our full report here. Travellers to Wales from Portugal and six Greek islands will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST on Friday,the Welsh government has announced. Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros, Antiparos and Crete are among the islands affected. Gibraltar and French Polynesia will also be removed from the list of countries exempt from the quarantine restrictions. It is the first time that Wales has applied its own quarantine rules. The head of England's NHS Test and Trace system has apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand - with some being asked to travel hundreds of miles for a test. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England,said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted that the ""vast majority"" of people could still secure appointments nearby. The booking website is now prioritising high risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted home testing kits and few booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said by Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. There will be no changes to England's quarantine list on Thursday, the transport secretary has said, amid speculation Portugal and Greece were about to be added. Grant Shapps tweeted that the list was always under review and the government wouldn't hesitate to make changes if needed. The decision covers England and other parts of the UK may make individual decisions. Peoplearriving from Greece to Scotland have to quarantine for 14 days as of 04:00 BST on Thursday, while arrivals into Wales from the Greek island of Zakynthoswere asked to self-isolate after a cluster of cases.

A controversial French professor, who had defended the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus, faces an ethics complaint that could see him sanctioned or barred from practising. Didier Raoult, head of the infectious diseases department of La Timone hospital in Marseille, is accused by medical peers of spreading false information about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine. The drug has been promoted by some, including US President Donald Trump and his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro, but there is currently no proof it works against coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against misuse of the drug because of serious side-effects. In March, Prof Raoult said his study of 80 patients showed ""favourable"" outcomes for four in five of those who received hydroxychloroquine.

But in the complaint, seen by French newspaper Le Figaro, his critics say he promoted the drug ""without any real scientific evidence on the subject, and against the health authorities' recommendations"". According to Le Figaro, a group representing 500 specialists of France's Infectious Diseases Society filed the complaint against Prof Raoult. They accuse him of breaking nine rules of the doctors' code of ethics. Read more about hydroxychloroquine: The latest figures from the UK government show there were 1,735

"Leading figures in UK aviation have expressed frustration that the government has still not given backing for Covid-19 testing at airports. The head of Southampton, Aberdeen and Glasgow airports accused ministers of ""overseeing the demise of UK aviation"". And the bosses of Virgin Atlantic and Heathrow Airport said ""leadership"" was needed on the testing issue, warning of the huge number of jobs at stake. The Department for Transport said it had given huge support to the sector. The aviation industry sees airport testing as a way for passengers to leave quarantine early, and also help the travel industry get back on its feet after lockdown. Foreign travel was paralysed for several months by the pandemic, with airlines, airports and tour firms shedding thousands of jobs. Derek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports, which runs Southampton, Aberdeen and Glasgow, said the sector was seeing more job losses than the demise of the coal industry in the 1980s. ""That's surely not an accolade any government would like to have,"" he said. Mr Provan said the government was ""overseeing the demise of UK aviation"". France and Germany are already using testing at airports for passengers arriving from countries with a higher infection rate. Ministers in the UK have for months been considering whether to back testing at UK airports. They are said to be looking at a two-test system to reduce the risk of someone who recently contracted the virus giving a ""false negative"" result. Under that system two negative results, several days apart, would mean someone would not have to quarantine for the full 14-day period. Heathrow seeks staff pay cuts with jobs warning UK considers returning Portugal to quarantine list Gatwick passenger numbers collapse by 14.7 million BA owner says crisis worst in its history Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said testing was ""essential"" to help kick-start the economy. ""Without free and fast travel with the US, we won't see a rebound of aviation and this will stall the economic recovery of the UK, which of course is already in recession,"" he said. A pilot project was set up at Heathrow to trial coronavirus testing but it is currently not in operation because the tests have not been endorsed by the government. With the list of countries on the UK's quarantine list changing every week, the boss of Heathrow said travellers to and from Britain were facing ""quarantine roulette"". Holidaymakers returning from countries on theUK's quarantine list,externalare required to self-isolate for 14 days. Countries are normally added to the list when they record more than 20 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. Last week, Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic joined France, Spain and a number of others on the list. Ministers are expected to decide later whether Portugal and Greece should be added. Scotland put Greece on its quarantine list following reports of people in the UK testing positive after holidaying on the island of Zakynthos. John Holland-Kaye said the government needed to change its approach. ""I think the government has been very cautious, really focusing on the health crisis and yet we have an unemployment crisis looming. ""The UK government needs to get behind testing as an alternative to quarantine to save millions of jobs in this country,"" he said. The impact of air travel crisis was underlined on Wednesday whenHeathrow said it was in talks with unions about pay cuts for about 2,500 staff.The move was needed to protect jobs, the airport said. Aviation bosses also want ""regional travel corridors"" when certain parts of a country have a low infection rate. Mr Provan said calls for regional travel corridors and testing at airports were falling on deaf ears. ""We are not getting any response back from the government."" And he said that this was causing ""huge frustration"" across an industry that was already having to shed tens of thousands of jobs. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""We provided unprecedented support to the aviation industry - taking early action on airport slots, loans, tax deferrals, and paying people's wages through the furlough scheme. ""While protecting public health remains our priority, we are working closely with experts to keep our approach to quarantine under constant review,"" the spokesman said.

The former wrestler, who is now the world's highest-paid actor, said he, his wife and two daughters caught the virus despite being ""disciplined"" about health protection.

"Pupils in their bubble at Barry Island Primary School It's back to school in Wales - but not quite as we knew it before. The ""new normal"" in classrooms means working in bubbles and limited contact with pupils outside their group. But parents and teachers have welcomed the staggered return - this week and into next week - following six months of disruption due to coronavirus. Head teachers said it was about reassuring pupils to ensure they were safe and happy before starting to address the learning they had missed. Teachers will be focusing on children's wellbeing Matt Gilbert, head teacher of Barry Island Primary School, said the three weeks back before the summer holidays, with small groups, had been a useful time to test things out. There are staggered start times and year groups - and the school has four entrances, which will help limit contact between different groups. ""Already, the children are very excited and parents are keen for them to come back,"" he said. ""The important thing from our point of view is to have a recovery plan - firstly to support children with their own wellbeing, so they're not anxious and concerned, next is to focus on numeracy and literacy, so they're where they need to be, and to support them."" Parent Renee said it had been almost six months and it was ""time"" and important that children like her daughter Niamh went back to school. ""We participated in home schooling. I believed in getting the children into a routine, we were still getting up in the mornings as if going to school - I can think of one who maybe didn't appreciate it! ""We completed work on a daily basis and then we stopped when it was the holidays,"" she said. ""But Niamh's been like a bottle of pop the last few weeks, excited to be back, it's really healthy and good for their mental health."" Niamh said: ""I'm a little but nervous but excited to get back to see my teachers and friends."" Pupils will face a few changes, including at break times and lunchtimes Another parent Sarah said it was great to see all the children with smiles: ""I won't lie, it's not been easy doing reading, writing and maths - I'd forgotten a lot of it myself. I hadn't realised how difficult the job of a teacher was, so maximum respect. ""The biggest difference is how they have lunch - they've still got their same class buddies, the same faces and teachers."" The biggest issues at home for her two children were ""boredom"" and ""too much noise"" but they still had time to see friends and go to the beach. What do schools look like now? What will schools do if children get coronavirus? All you need to know about schools in Wales returning Paul Smith, year 4 class teacher, said it would be strange just to be seeing a bubble of children and not all members of staff but it was an exciting time. ""A lot of work has gone in behind the scenes - the guidance has been brilliant from the authorities, we're excited and raring to go."" He said they would perhaps also embrace more technology in future, as they had with home-working, and look to creative ways of teaching. ""As long as we're safe, and the children are happy, we'll do what we need to do,"" he added. At Roath Park Primary School in Cardiff, head teacher Jonathan Keohane, said they had to make learning ""fun and safe"" but to appreciate there might be anxiety among children and staff. ""We're trying to make it as normal as possible,"" he said. ""Children spend almost six hours a day in school so we're trying to make the school like it was before March - we want them to feel at home, comfortable and to have their routine."" What are the rules on school buses in Wales? Can my child go to school with a cold? Reopening schools is 'biggest post-devolution challenge' Meanwhile in Gwynedd, Arwyn Williams, headteacher of Ysgol Tryfan, a secondary school in Bangor, said: ""The main challenges have been the lack of time we have had to prepare for some of these changes, specifically the masks, that was introduced quite late in the day."" Ysgol Tryfan's headteacher Arwyn Williams said the main challenge was preparing with limited time ""We had to adapt there. There was a bit of uncertainty regarding school transport for a while as well,"" he said. ""We knew it was going to be challenging coming back in September, we knew we had to plan and do everything possible to keep pupils safe. ""When we have late changes it makes it increasingly difficult."" Education Minister Kirsty Williams said children returning to school was ""critical"" for their development and health and that ""every precaution"" had been taken to minimise risk. Safety precautions in schools include increased cleaning and reduced movement and contact between groups. She also added that the Welsh Government was working with councils on the ""cost implications"" of the increased use of face coverings - and said the government was ""ready to make its contribution to this"".

"CCDH says tech firm's failure to act may limit take-up of Covid-19 vaccines when they become available Social networks are failing to tackle coronavirus-related anti-vaccination posts containing ""clearly harmful information"" even after the material is brought to their attention, according to a campaign group. It flagged more than 900 examples,externalto Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube via a team of volunteers. It said the firms did not remove or otherwise deal with 95% of the cases. The four platforms each have policies designed to restrict such content. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) said UK lawmakers should accelerate existing plans to hold the companies to account as a consequence. The US firms were shown a copy of the report ahead of its publication. It contains selected examples. But CCDH has yet to disclose the full list of links of the posts involved, although it has pledged to do so on request now that the report is out. CCDH said many of the posts it flagged had made reference to the philanthropist Bill Gates This has limited the US companies' ability to address the specific cases. But the firms have said they have removed and labelled millions of other items since the virus was declared a public health emergency. None of the tech firms involved forbid users from posting inaccurate information about vaccinations. However, after a series of measles outbreaks in 2019,Facebook - which owns Instagram - said it would start directing users to reliable information,externalfrom the World Health Organization (WHO) when they searched or visited relevant content. Twitter and YouTube also took measures the same year to steer users away from related conspiracy theories. However, the platforms tightened their rules after the outbreak of Covid-19. Facebook said it would remove posts that could lead to physical harm, and would apply warning labels to other relevant posts debunked by fact-checkers. Twitter said it would remove coronavirus-related posts that could cause widespread panic and/or social unrest, and add warning messages to other disputed or misleading information about the pandemic. And YouTube said it had banned content about Covid-19 that posed a ""serious risk of egregious harm"" or contradicted medical information given by the WHO and local health authorities. CCDH said a total of 912 items posted by anti-vaccine protesters that it had judged to have fallen foul of the companies' Covid-19 rules were flagged to the firms between July and August. Of these: Facebook received 569 complaints. It removed 14 posts, added warnings to 19 but did not suspend any accounts - representing action on 5.8% of the cases Instagram received 144 complaints. It removed three posts, suspended one account and added warnings to two posts - representing action on 4.2% of the cases Twitter received 137 complaints. It removed four posts, suspended two accounts, and did not add any warnings - representing action on 4.4% of the cases YouTube received 41 complaints. It did not act on any of them Among the examples of material that CCDH said was not tackled were: an Instagram post saying the ""upcoming coronavirus vaccine is a killer"" that would cause ""DNA-level damage"" a Facebook post claiming the only way to catch a virus was to be ""injected with one via a vaccine"" a tweet saying that vaccines cause people to become genetically modified and thus no longer the way God intended a YouTube clip in which an interviewee claims that Covid is part of a ""depopulation agenda"" and that vaccines cause cancer CCDH added that about one in 10 of all examples made reference to conspiracy theories involving Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, including suggestions that he wanted people to be fitted with microchips that would cause them to starve if they refused a vaccine. Facebook responded by saying it had taken ""aggressive steps to limit the spread of misinformation"" about Covid-19, including the removal of more than seven million items and the addition of warning labels to a further 98 million pieces of misinformation. CCDH said that a number of posts claimed that Covid was a ""false flag"" or ""plandemic"" created to force mass vaccinations Twitter said that while it did not take action on every tweet containing disputed information about the virus, it did prioritise those that had a call to action that could cause harm. ""Our automated systems have challenged millions of accounts which were targeting discussions around Covid-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviours,"" it added. And Google said that it had taken a number of steps to ""combat harmful misinformation"", including banning some clips and displaying fact-checking panels alongside others. But CCDH's chief executive said politicians and regulators in the US and UK must now force the firms into tougher action. ""This is an immediate crisis, with a ticking time bomb about to go off in our societies,"" said Imran Ahmed. ""Social media companies... do not listen to polite requests for change. Given the acute nature of the coronavirus crisis, their failure to act must now be met with real consequences."" London-based CCDH is funded by the Pears Foundation, Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and Barrow Cadbury Trust, as well as others the group says do do not want to be named in case they are targeted as a result. Public health experts warn that coronavirus vaccine conspiracy theories spread quickly online and pose a grave threat to all of us. If a significant number of people decide not to take a safe and approved vaccine, our ability to suppress the disease will be limited. It's legitimate to have concerns that a vaccine is safe and properly tested. It's also legitimate to want to discuss this in private chats or online. But claims a coronavirus vaccine will be a tool for mass surveillance or genocide only do harm. The theories are often spread by popular pseudo-science figures and large Facebook pages notorious for promoting disinformation. They then drip into the average person's feeds and are sometimes amplified by celebrities, sowing seeds of doubt. The social media firms say they are taking action, but critics say that if they don't do more -  whether voluntarily or under compulsion - they could contribute to a public health disaster.

"Daniel Prude died a week after he was restrained by police An African American man died in New York state after being hooded by police and held face down to the road for two minutes, body camera footage shows. Daniel Prude, 41, who had mental health issues and who was unarmed, was restrained in March by police who put a ""spit hood"" - used to stop detainees spitting or biting - on his head. He later died of asphyxiation but his story has only now been made public. His death was two months before the killing of George Floyd. Don't shoot, I'm disabled The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life The other names we're hearing after George Floyd's death Mr Floyd died after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly eight minutes in Minnesota. Anti-racism protests broke out in the US and globally in the wake of his killing. In a news conference on Wednesday, Mr Prude's brother, Joe, said he called police in Rochester on 23 March as his sibling was showing acute mental health problems. ""I placed a phone call for my brother to get help, not for my brother to get lynched,"" he said. A warehouse worker from Chicago and father of five, Daniel Prude was visiting his brother at the time of his death. Police body camera footage obtained by the family through a public records request shows Mr Prude, who had been running naked through the streets in a light snow before police arrived, lying unarmed as officers restrain him on the ground. The video shows that Mr Prude complied immediately when officers arrived on the scene and ordered him to lie on the ground and put his hands behind his back. He can be heard saying: ""Sure thing, sure thing."" He becomes agitated, at times swearing at the officers who surround him and spitting, but he does not appear to offer any physical resistance, according to the footage. 'They push black people out and replace us with BLM signs' They filmed police brutality - then faced a backlash Mr Prude told officers he was infected with coronavirus, and they placed a white ""spit hood"" over his head. One officer is seen pressing down with both hands on Mr Prude's head and saying: ""Stop spitting."" This video can not be played George Floyd death: Whatâs changed, 100 days later? After he stops writhing and goes quiet, one officer notes: ""He feels pretty cold."" Medics try to revive him before he is carried into an ambulance. He was taken off life support a week later on 30 March. The family's lawyer said the reason the case was not made public earlier was that it had taken ""months"" for police footage to be released. According to a post-mortem examination report seen by the Rochester-based Democrat and Chronicle newspaper, Mr Prude's death was a homicide caused by ""complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint"". The report also listed PCP, a strong hallucinogenic drug, as a complication. In a statement, New York state's attorney general called the death a ""tragedy"" and said an investigation was under way. Mr Prude's brother called his death ""cold-blooded murder"". ""How many more brothers gotta die for society to understand this needs to stop?"" he added at the news conference. Lawyers for the family are in the process of filing a wrongful death suit. The family have also called for the firing and arrest of the officers, US media report. The officers involved have not been suspended. Protesters gathered in the city of Rochester, New York, on Wednesday over Mr Prude's death. Rochester police used pepper spray and pepper balls against some demonstrators outside the Public Safety Building, according to the Democrat and Chronicle newspaper. Several people were briefly taken into custody after entering the building, which serves as police headquarters, the local media reports say. ""Spit hoods"" are mesh fabric hoods placed over the heads of suspects. They are intended to protect officers from a detainee's saliva. Critics who oppose their use say they are distressing and humiliating, can cause panic in the detained person, and make it harder to notice if a prisoner is having difficulty breathing. In recent years, they have been scrutinised as a factor in the deaths of several detainees in the US and other countries. Some police forces in the UK use ""spit hoods"" In the UK, campaign group Liberty said that, as of February 2019, ""spit hoods"" werebeing used by at least 30 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales.,external Back in 2016, UK police forces told the BBC they only used them when ""proportionate, appropriate and justifiable"" to protect officers. The Metropolitan Police says its medically supervised tests have found ""spit hoods"" present no risk to a suspect's breathing. The death of George Floyd sparked huge protests in the US, some violent, against police brutality and racism in both the police force and society in general. Demonstrations were held in many other countries. News of Mr Prude's death came amid heightened tensions in the US after black man Jacob Blake was shot multiple times in the back during an arrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on 23 August, sparking days of protests in the city. Mr Blake's father has saidhis son is now paralysedfrom the waist down - though doctors do not know if it is permanent. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Bidenon Wednesday called for charges against policeinvolved in Mr Blake's shooting and that of Breonna Taylor, an African-American womanwho was shot eight times by police who entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky on 13 March. Joe Biden has called for officers involved in the shootings of Jacob Blake and Breonna Taylor to be charged ""I think we should let the judicial system work its way,"" he told a news conference in Delaware. ""I do think, at a minimum, they need to be charged, the officers."" US Attorney General William Barr dismissed accusations that black and white Americans were treated differently due to police racism. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, he said it was very rare for an unarmed black person to be shot by white officers. ""I think the narrative that the police are in some epidemic of shooting unarmed black men is simply a false narrative,"" he said.

"Security camera footage from eSalon SF shows Nancy Pelosi without a mask over her face US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said her visit to a San Francisco hair salon in breach of coronavirus rules was a ""setup"". ""I take responsibility for trusting the word of a neighbourhood salon,"" the top Democrat told reporters on Wednesday. ""It turns out it was a setup."" She visited the eSalon SF on 31 August, despite a ban on such services indoors in the Californian city. Mrs Pelosi was also pictured in the salon without a mask over her face. The California lawmaker has often criticised President Donald Trump for refusing to wear a mask. ""I take responsibility for trusting the word of a neighbourhood salon that I've been to over the years many times,"" Mrs Pelosi said in a testy press conference in San Francisco when asked about the incident. She said eSalon SF had told her they could accommodate one guest at a time. ""I trusted that - as it turns out it was a setup,"" Mrs Pelosi said. ""So I take responsibility for falling for a setup and that's all I'm going to say on that."" Mrs Pelosi has herself previously cited US Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommending that Americans wear face masks in public, especially when physical distancing measures are difficult. ""I think this salon owes me an apology for setting up,"" she added. ""We have to get our country moving again and I will not let this subject take away from the fact that we have 185,000 plus people who have died from this virus."" Mrs Pelosi was seen on security camera footage, obtained by Fox News, wearing a face mask around her neck rather than over her mouth and nose. During the pandemic, she has always worn masks in public and has chastised Republicans for not listening to US health agency guidance. Mr Trump weighed in on Twitter, saying Mrs Pelosi was ""being decimated for having a beauty parlour opened when all others are closed and for not wearing a mask - despite constantly lecturing everyone else"". Why we should all be wearing face masks Why are Americans so angry about masks? Why men are less likely to wear face masks A spokesman for the speaker earlier issued a statement saying the business told Mrs Pelosi they were allowed to have one customer inside at a time. The salon's owner, Erica Kious, told Fox News a stylist informed her Mrs Pelosi wanted to come in for a wash and blow dry. ""It was a slap in the face that she went in, you know, that she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no-one else can go in, and I can't work.""

"Bosses in charge of the coronavirus testing system have apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand. Some people are being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England, said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted the ""vast majority"" of people could still get appointments nearby. How do I get a coronavirus test? Testing and tracing 'key to schools returning' Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again The booking website is now prioritising high-risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted numbers of home testing kits and fewer booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said they were working hard to rectify the problem and a new lab facility would be opened in the coming weeks. By Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. But Prof Paul Hunter, a public health expert at the University of East Anglia, said these issues could act as a ""big disincentive to being tested"" and result in local increases being missed. David was offered a test in Blackburn when he lives in Suffolk David Llewellyntried to book a test on Sunday and was directed to a test centre near Blackburn - 250 miles and the other side of England from his home in Stowmarket, Suffolk. ""I thought I'd entered my home location incorrectly so went through the booking process again, only to get the same location for testing. Needless to say I have subsequently ordered a home testing kit, which despite three automated email reminders to take the test has yet to arrive. I'd do the test if I had it. I think it's ridiculous."" Lucy Evans lives in Pooleon the south coast. She was offered a test 220 miles away in Oldham and Blackburn. She tried again and was offered the Isle of Wight. ""I tried 14 times to get a test nearer and in the end had to get a home test as I ran out of time to get this done within five days. By the time I was tested my symptoms had disappeared."" Lucy tested negative for Covid on Tuesday. Lisa lives in Plymouthand tried to get a test for her 14-year-old son. She was offered a test 688 miles away in Inverness. ""People aren't going to travel all that way for a test are they? You'd just have to make stops along the way and could be spreading it around if you had the virus."" She eventually got a test locally and her son was negative. The government says the network of labs used to process tests has capacity to process 250,000 tests a day at the moment. Currently around 175,000 tests a day are being processed, which the government has said is more per head of population than many countries. But the government said it has faced problems because demand is not smooth - at weekends it drops and on weekdays there can be surges. Over the past month it has meant a backlog has developed, meaning the time taken to turnaround tests has been increasing. To curb demand, the availability of slots at testing centres have been reduced. The government said it has done this to ensure high risk areas, including care homes and towns with high rates of infections, can be prioritised for testing. The most recent data shows test results are now being provided more quickly, with the average turnaround time 24 hours or less for mobile testing units and local testing centres. It also said booking slots open up throughout the day so if people keep trying they should be able to get a more convenient location for a test, or order a home test. A new lab is also being opened near Loughborough at the end of the month that will be able to process 50,000 tests a day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there were some ""operational challenges"", but said the ""vast majority"" of people could get a test close to home. Mr Hancock also set out plans to pilot more rapid, easy-to-use tests. A Â£500m programme is under way to trial a range of different tests, including ones that use saliva (instead of nose and throat swabs) and tests that can be processed quickly, and sometimes on the spot - at the moment swab tests are sent off to labs to be processed. Repeat testing of members of the public will be tried out in Salford in Greater Manchester. Meanwhile, students and school pupils in Southampton will also be tested weekly in another study. The technologies open up the prospect of mass population testing which, if successful, could reduce the need for social distancing. Mr Hancock said: ""Short of a vaccine, this is the best chance we have of reducing social distancing whilst controlling the virus, especially with winter coming and all the challenges that brings."" But he refused to be drawn on a timescale for when this might become available, saying it was essential to see if they worked first. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances for virus tests, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient testing capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June - and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country. There's been an apology to those who were told to go 100 miles or more for a test. Officials acknowledge that resources are stretched and have to be targeted at areas with local outbreaks. But they point out that a new ""mega lab"" is set to come on stream in the east Midlands soon. They also argue that trials of new rapid testing techniques will be expanded, which could prove to be game-changers. For now though, the system is stretched, even though the official numbers suggest capacity is running ahead of demand. Questions will continue to be asked about whether the system can cope with challenges ahead, with schools returning and winter approaching.

"Alexei Navalny was flown to Berlin for treatment in August after falling ill The German government's announcement on Wednesday that Russian opposition figureAlexei Navalny has been poisoned by a sophisticated nerve agent known as a Novichokmakes this case even more serious than it already was. Most importantly, it will increase suspicions that, despite its denials, the Russian state was behind his poisoning. Novichok - meaning ""newcomer"" in Russian - applies to a group of synthetically produced nerve agents originally developed by the Soviet Union in a laboratory in Uzbekistan before the USSR disintegrated in 1991. Western intelligence agencies believe that Novichok has since been refined into a hard-to-detect assassination weapon in covert techniques practised by operatives of the GRU, Russian military intelligence, including being smeared on to door handles. Novichok can be deployed in both liquid and solid forms. What are Novichok nerve agents? Two of those operatives were widely believed to have poisoned the Russian defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in 2018 using Novichok. A local Wiltshire resident, Dawn Sturgess, subsequently died after handling the contents of the discarded perfume bottle used to disguise the nerve agent. This video can not be played On the trail of Russians Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who UK police believe carried out a nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018 Western governments reacted forcefully to this failed assassination attempt on British soil. In a co-ordinated move, 20 countries expelled more than a hundred Russian diplomats and spies, dealing a huge blow to Moscow's intelligence-gathering networks in the West. Even covert agents in deep cover inside Britain, whom Moscow believed were operating undetected by MI5, the security service, were ordered to leave. This was all in marked contrast to the mild British government response - since criticised - to the poisoning of former KGB officer and defector Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. After the agonising death in a London hospital by radioactive Polonium poisoning of this former Russian colonel, branded as a traitor by the Kremlin, an investigation dragged on for years while the two Russian suspects remained at large in Russia. Critics believe the lack of a forceful response by the West encouraged hardliners in the Kremlin to sanction the targeting abroad of those considered traitors to the Russian state. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny: 'Putin is the tsar of corruption' Today, Alexei Navalny has no shortage of enemies. As a vigorous campaigner against corruption, he has amassed millions of young followers but also angered those people whose nefarious activities have been exposed in his popular videos. There are plenty of people both in government and in business circles who would like to see him removed from the public sphere. But Novichok, unlike naturally occurring toxins that can be refined from natural products found in the countryside, is not something casually cooked up by amateurs. It is a military-grade chemical weapon that tends to point the finger of suspicion towards the Russian state. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Although Mr Navalny appeared to be poisoned on Russian soil, rather than in a Nato member country, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""there were now very serious questions which only the Russian government could and must answer"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab echoed that comment, saying that the Russian government had a clear case to answer about what happened to Mr Navalny. He said Britain would now work closely with Germany and other allies to show there were consequences for using banned chemical weapons. In Washington, the White House National Security Council issued a statement saying it would work with allies to hold those in Russia accountable. The former British Army officer and chemical weapons expert, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, has been warning for years that the unchecked use of chemical weapons against rebels and civilians alike in populated areas by the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria sends a dangerous signal. How governments now react to this latest use of a Novichok nerve agent against a public political figure will be influenced in part by the findings of the global chemical watchdog, the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons, the OPCW.
