"The Indonesian capital of Jakarta is home to 10 million peoplebut itis also one of the fastest-sinking cities in the world. If this goes unchecked, parts of the megacity could be entirely submerged by 2050, say researchers. Is it too late? It sits on swampy land, the Java Sea lapping against it, and 13 rivers running through it. So it shouldn't be a surprise that flooding is frequent in Jakarta and, according to experts, it is getting worse. But it's not just about freak floods, this massive city is literally disappearing into the ground. North Jakarta is sinking by about 25cm every year ""The potential for Jakarta to be submerged isn't a laughing matter,"" says Heri Andreas, who has studied Jakarta's land subsidence for the past 20 years at the Bandung Institute of Technology. ""If we look at our models, by 2050 about 95% of North Jakarta will be submerged."" Heri Andreas points at a dyke built to prevent sea water from flooding houses when it rains It's already happening - North Jakarta has sunk 2.5m in 10 years and is continuing to sink by as much as 25cm a year in some parts, which is more than double the global average for coastal megacities. Jakarta is sinking by an average of 1-15cm a year and almost half the city now sits below sea level. The impact is immediately apparent in North Jakarta. In the district of  Muara Baru, an entire office building lies abandoned. It once housed a fishing company but the first-floor veranda is the only functional part left. The ground floor of this abandoned office building is now underground The submerged ground floor is full of stagnant floodwater. The land around it is higher so the water has nowhere to go.  Buildings that are so deeply sunk are rarely abandoned like this, because most of the time the owners will try to fix, rebuild and find short-term remedies for the issue. But what they can't do is stop the soil sucking this part of the city down. Stagnant water on the ground floor An open air fish market is just a five-minute drive away. ""The walkways are like waves, curving up and down, people can trip and fall,"" says Ridwan, a Muara Baru resident who often visits the fish market. As the water levels underground are being depleted, the very ground market-goers walk on is sinking and shifting, creating an uneven and unstable surface. ""Year after year, the ground has just kept sinking,"" he said, just one of many inhabitants of this quarter alarmed at what is happening to the neighbourhood. A large crack in the foundation of a fish market that has seen severe land subsidence North Jakarta has historically been a port city and even today it houses one of Indonesia's busiest sea ports, Tanjung Priok. Its strategic location where the Ciliwung river flows into the Java Sea was one of the reasons why Dutch colonists chose to make it their bustling hub in the 17th Century. Today 1.8 million people live in the municipality, a curious mixture of fading port businesses, poor coastal communities and a substantial population of wealthy Chinese Indonesians. Fortuna Sophia lives in a luxurious villa with a sea view. The sinking of her home is not immediately visible but she says cracks appear in the walls and pillars every six months. Fortuna says that when it rains, flood waters can submerge the pool ""We just have to keep fixing it,"" she says, standing beside her swimming pool with her private dock just a few metres away.  ""The maintenance men say the cracks are caused by the shifting of the ground."" She's lived here for four years but it has already flooded several times: ""The seawater flows in and covers the swimming pool entirely. We have to move all our furniture up to the first floor."" The heroes and politics of Jakarta's floods 'Fossil' groundwater's modern secret But the impact on the small homes right by the sea is magnified. Residents who once had a sea view now see only a dull grey dyke, built and rebuilt in a valiant attempt to keep seawater out. ""Every year the tide gets about 5cm higher,"" Mahardi, a fisherman, said. None of this has deterred the property developers. More and more luxury apartments dot the North Jakarta skyline regardless of the risks. The head of the advisory council for Indonesia's Association of Housing Development, Eddy Ganefo, says he has urged the government to halt further development here. But, he says, ""so long as we can sell apartments, development will continue"". The rest of Jakarta is also sinking, albeit at a slower rate. In West Jakarta, the ground is sinking by as much as 15cm annually, by 10cm annually in the east, 2cm in Central Jakarta and just 1cm in South Jakarta. Coastal cities across the world are affected because of rising sea levelscaused by climate change. Increased sea levels occur because of thermal expansion - the water expanding because of extra heat -  and the melting of polar ice. The speed at which Jakarta is sinking is alarming experts. It may seem surprising but there are few complaints from Jakartans because for residents here the subsidence is just one among a myriad of infrastructure challenges they have to deal with daily. And that is part of the story of why this is happening. See more stories and videos like this The dramatic rate at which Jakarta is sinking is partly down to the excessive extraction of groundwater for use as drinking water, for bathing and other everyday purposes by city dwellers. Piped water isn't reliable or available in most areas so people have no choice but to resort to pumping water from the aquifers deep underground. But when groundwater is pumped out, the land above it sinks as if it is sitting on a deflating balloon - and this leads to land subsidence. This video can not be played Why Indonesia's capital Jakarta is sinking The situation is exacerbated by lax regulation allowing just about anyone, from individual homeowners to massive shopping mall operators, to carry out their own groundwater extractions. ""Everyone has a right, from residents to industries, to use groundwater so long as this is regulated,"" says Heri Andreas. The problem is that they take more than what is allowed. People say they have no choice when the authorities are unable to meet their water needs and experts confirm that water management authorities can only meet 40% of Jakarta's demand for water. Most of Jakarta's residents rely on groundwater A landlord in central Jakarta, known only as Hendri, runs a dormitory-like block called a kos-kosan and has been pumping his own groundwater for 10 years to supply tenants. He is one of many on his street who do this. ""It's better to use our own groundwater rather than relying on the authorities. A kos-kosan like this needs a lot of water."" The local government has only recently admitted it has a problem with illegal groundwater extraction. In May, the Jakarta city authority inspected 80 buildings in Central Jakarta's Jalan Thamrin, a road lined with skyscrapers, shopping malls and hotels. It found that 56 buildings had their own groundwater pump and 33 were extracting water illegally. Jakarta's Governor Anies Baswedan says everyone should have a licence, which will enable the authorities to measure how much groundwater is being extracted. Those without a licence will have their building-worthiness certificate revoked, as would other businesses in the same building. An inspection of buildings in Jalan Thamrin, central Jakarta found many operators pumping groundwater without a permit Authorities are also hoping that the Great Garuda, a 32km outer sea wall being built across Jakarta Bay along with 17 artificial islands, will help rescue the sinking city - at a cost of about $40bn. It's being supported by the Dutch and South Korean governments and creates an artificial lagoon in which water levels can be lowered to allow the city's rivers to drain. It will help with the flooding which is an issue when the rains come. The sea wall is meant to mitigate the city's severe flooding But three Dutch non-profit groups released a report in 2017 which cast doubt on whether the sea wall and artificial islands could solve Jakarta's subsidence problem. Jan Jaap Brinkman, a hydrologist with the Dutch water research institute Deltares, argues it can only ever be an interim measure. He says it will only buy Jakarta an extra 20-30 years to stop the long-term subsidence. ""There is only one solution and everybody knows the solution,"" he says. The construction of the sea wall is underway That would be to halt all groundwater extraction and solely rely on other sources of water, such as rain or river water or piped water from man-made reservoirs. He says Jakarta must do this by 2050 to avoid major subsidence. Alternative water sources like the Citarum river are extremely polluted It is not a message that is being taken to heart yet and Jakarta's Governor Anies Baswedan thinks a less drastic measure will do. He says people should be able to extract groundwater legally as long as they replace it using something called the biopori method. This involves digging a hole, 10cm in diameter and 100cm deep, into the ground to allow water to be reabsorbed into the soil. Critics say this scheme would only replace water at a superficial level, whereas in Jakarta water is often pumped out from several hundred metres below ground level. Houses once overlooking the ocean now face a dyke There is technology to replace groundwater deep at its source but it's extremely expensive. Tokyo used this method, known as artificial recharge, when it faced severe land subsidence 50 years ago. The government also restricted groundwater extraction and businesses were required to use reclaimed water. Land subsidence subsequently halted. But Jakarta needs alternative water sources for that to work. Heri Andreas, from Bandung Institute of Technology, says it could take up to 10 years to clean up the rivers, dams and lakes to allow water to be piped anywhere or used as a replacement for the aquifers deep underground. President Joko Widodo has said it will take years to clean up Jakarta's rivers Jakarta's residents adopt a somewhat fatalistic attitude to their future in this sinking city. ""Living here is a risk,"" says Sophia Fortuna in her home. ""The people here have all accepted that risk."" Additional reporting by Tom de Souza.

"Jake O'Neill was motivated to set up the project Bikestormz in 2015 When Jake O'Neill first tried to stop London knife crime by getting teenagers on their bikes, ""20 to 30 people"" showed up. On Saturday, 3,000 people - mostly teenage boys -rode through the capital, pulling tricks and stopping the traffic. Jake, 19 - also known as Jake 100 - set up theBikestormz,externalproject with his friend Mac after his best friend's older brother was stabbed to death. ""I quite literally want people to put their knives down and pick their bikes up,"" Jake told the BBC. ""Hence the slogan Knives Down, Bikes Up."" Jake is from east London, where ""some of his friends"" were stabbed. ""It really made me think about what I could do to change things in my community,"" he says. ""We wanted to bring young people together, take them off the streets and give them something uplifting to do."" He thinks riding together makes violence less likely. ""They've never been in a fight whilst riding their bikes,"" he says. This video can not be played #Knivesdownbikesup: 'Hundreds' of young cyclists cause gridlock But not everyone was as positive. One local resident said the cyclists ""had no concern for their own safety."" ""Hundreds of young people were cycling down Battersea Park Road,"" she said.

"Police said the victims' injuries were not life-threatening Two children were among 10 people hurt in a shooting in the Moss Side area of Manchester, which police are treating as attempted murder. They were injured with what police believe was a shotgun with ""pellets in its rounds"" at a street party in Claremont Road at about 02:30 BST. Nine victims had ""pellet-type wounds"" and a man suffered a broken leg. The shooting took place at a party held after the first day of this weekend's Caribbean Carnival in Alexandra Park. The victims, including two children over the age of 12, with ""pellet-type wounds"" were not seriously injured but the man with the broken leg was in a serious condition. Another two people attended hospital later on Sunday to be ""checked over"" but their injuries are not thought to be serious, police said. Firearms officers had earlier been sent to the scene Ch Supt Wasim Chaudhry, from Greater Manchester Police, said those injured were aged between 12 and their 50s and mainly suffered injuries to their legs. ""Discharging a firearm... in as large a crowd as this is completely reckless,"" he said. ""I think its more by luck than by anything else that people haven't suffered life-threatening injuries,"" he added, saying the motive remained unclear. He said two armed officers were ""quickly in attendance, within a minute in fact"", followed by other officers. Police urged anyone with information to contact them as they were treating the attack as the attempted murder of 10 people. Thousands of people attend the Caribbean Carnival every year Caribbean Carnival chairman Mike Bisson said people had come from around the country to the ""flagship"" carnival, which continued on Sunday. ""Whatever happened outside has no connection to the carnival and it will be safe today and the crowds are coming in. ""The spirit of carnival is dance, music, vibrancy and well-behaved people enjoying themselves."" Councillor Pat Karney said: ""You can't tar a whole community because of some idiotic behaviour. ""I think the fact that over 16,000 people came out to the carnival yesterday indicates the strength of the community here and their desire to celebrate their area."" The Caribbean Carnival, which has been held every summer since 1972, draws thousands of people. Greater Manchester Police said more officers would be patrolling the area over the coming days Residents said a street party was usually held in Claremont Road after the first day of events. Youth worker Kemoy Walker, who had been on the main stage at the carnival on Saturday, said he had been at another street party in Claremont Road until about 23:30. ""The party I was at was beautiful,"" he said. ""When I left there was lovely dancing. That's Moss Side, that's the culture. I'm in shock this morning."" I was there enjoying the good vibes, having a drink, and then I noticed two crowds of youths gathering and I thought something might happen but I wasn't expecting a shooting. The next thing I heard was one gunshot, which I thought was a balloon or some kind of glass getting dropped, but then I heard two more and then there was a lot of panic. I went behind a wall because I didn't know whether it was the start of some kind of gun battle but I was safe. There was a man surrounded by people and he was injured but luckily he was alive. He was able to walk to the ambulance. It was quite a long time [before the police arrived] considering somebody had been shot but I think the ambulance was waiting for armed police - it was just informal security there - and then eventually the police did turn up. This is just a street party - it's nothing to do with the main carnival. In fact, organisers advise people not to go to the street parties because they are not officially affiliated or sanctioned by carnival. Greater Manchester deputy mayor Beverley Hughes praised police for ""their swift action"", saying the shooting was ""very upsetting and it causes a deal of distress and people feel that their reputation is challenged again"". She added: ""I think the carnival, as well as being two days of intense enjoyment for the community, is a really important statement about where that community has comeâ¦ and so I think for it to be abandoned would be a very unfortunate message."" The shooting took place on Claremont Road Det Sup Debbie Dooley said: ""The area is being searched and examined while we are also trying to speak to as many people as possible and are reviewing CCTV to get all the facts."" Extra officers will be patrolling the area over the coming days to reassure the public, she added. Since the 1980s, Moss Side has been associated with problems linked todrugs, gangs and violence. The Caribbean Carnival was meant to be a celebratory event, especially given the 70th anniversary of the arrival of the Windrush generation. Moss Side has done much work in the last few years to reinvent its image - in the past it had become notorious for violent crime. The events overnight will be seen as absolutely shocking for the local community. Officers will understand that and they will know there will be a lot of people who will be scared in their own homes - that is why they are putting on extra patrols over the coming days. Former police officer Martin Harding, who now works with local schools, said the number of shootings had significantly fallen in recent years. ""It's another sign that some of the work in Moss Side - and neighbouring Hulme - is working because, going back, it used to be an almost a daily occurrence that there would be incidents of a similar nature taking place in the area,"" he said. He said the area, where a new Manchester Metropolitan University building is based, had a ""proud community"" and there would be ""lots and lots of disappointment"" with the latest shooting.

"This video can not be played Rescue workers pulled children from the rubble At least 67 people were killed and 33 injured by an explosion at an arms depot in rebel-held northern Syria on Sunday, rescuers and activists say. The blast in the village of Sarmada, in Idlib province, caused the collapse of two five-storey buildings. More than 50 of the dead were civilians. The others were members of a jihadist alliance linked to al-Qaeda, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The depot is reported to have been run by an arms dealer who works with HTS. The alliance is the dominant armed opposition force in Idlib, which is home to some 2.9 million people, including a million who have fled other rebel-held parts of Syria. The unstoppable momentum of Assadâs war Why is there a war in Syria? The Syria Civil Defence, whose volunteer first responders are commonly known as the White Helmets, said on Monday morning that it had completed its search and rescue operation in Sarmada's Bab al-Hawa Square after 22 hours. The bodies of 67 people had been recovered from beneath the rubble of the collapsed buildings, while 17 people had been pulled out alive, it added. The cause of the initial blast at the arms depot is not yet known The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, put the death toll at 69 and said it included 17 children and 14 women. Most of the civilians were displaced people from the central province of Homs. The cause of the initial blast is not yet known. However, HTS's news outlet Iba cited one of the alliance's security officials as criticising the arms dealer for storing powerful explosives in a residential area. Abu Abdul Malik said it showed ""a total and clear disregard for the lives of people"" and vowed to take action to regulate the activities of arms dealers. Meanwhile, pro-government media report that the Syrian military has sent more reinforcements to areas bordering Idlib province ahead of a major ground offensive on the rebel stronghold. On Sunday, the newspaper al-Watan cited military sources as saying troops had arrived in the northern countryside of Hama province in preparation for an assault, with the ultimate aim to recapture the provincial city of Idlib. President Bashar al-Assad has indicated that Idlib will be his next target, after forces loyal to him retook the Eastern Ghouta region near Damascus and the south-western provinces of Deraa and Quneitra earlier this year with the help of Russian air strikes and Iranian-backed militias. The Syrian military has dropped leaflets over Idlib, urging people to agree to a return of state rule United Nations humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland appealed, on Thursday, for talks between the warring parties to avoid a ""civilian bloodbath"" in Idlib. ""It is bad [there] now,"" he told reporters in Geneva. ""It could be 100 times worse."" Mr Egeland said it would be very hard for the UN and its partners to feed and provide shelter for the large numbers of people who might be displaced by an offensive, and that he had asked Turkey to keep its border open to refugees. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that his country was finalising preparations to create safe areas on the Syrian side of the border. It has already set up military observation posts in Idlib to monitor a ""de-escalation"" zone agreed with Russia and Iran.

"A shop in the old city of Damascus sells flags of the World Cup teams Damascus feels different. The centre of the city was barely damaged in the last seven years of war, unlike many of the suburbs, which have been turned into rubble. But the soundtrack of the war almost always accompanied daily life: air and artillery strikes on the suburbs, and much less powerfully, shelling coming from the rebel forces. However, since the fall of Eastern Ghouta, the big rebel enclave on the edge of Damascus in the spring, all that has changed. The war is still in the minds of the people, dominating lives. But physically it is elsewhere, concentrated at the moment in the south, close to the border with Jordan and the boundary with the Golan Heights, Syrian territory occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. In the Christian quarter of the old walled city, the narrow streets and narrower alleys are packed with people. Shops and restaurants are open and busy. Bars have big screens ready for another evening of games at the World Cup. Cafes in Damascus are showing World Cup matches Back in March, when I was here last, I interviewed a teenage girl whose leg had been blown off by a mortar, fired from rebel positions, which landed in the same streets. A much heavier weight of fire was directed at Eastern Ghouta - at the rebels who controlled it, and the civilians who had the bad luck to be living there. The fire came from the Syrian Arab Army, its allied militias and its Russian allies. It is now possible, with official permission and a military escort, to visit the ruins of Eastern Ghouta. Damage is everywhere. The areas closest to the front lines are worst. Concrete blocks of flats, half a dozen or so storeys high, are smashed and perforated by shell holes, and often gutted by fire too. Why is there a war in Syria? Southern Syria fighting displaces 270,000 War crimes committed in Syria battle - UN The main armed group in Eastern Ghouta, Jaish al-Islam, constructed an alternative subterranean life. It dug tunnels that linked concrete basements. The workmanship was remarkable, considering the tunnels were built in an enclave that was effectively under siege from the end of 2011 to only a few months ago. Some of the tunnels are big enough for a medium-sized van to be driven along them. An underground hospital that was packed with the dead and the dying during the worst of the shelling is still open, under the flags of Syria and Russia. It still functions, treating children who have hurt themselves playing on bomb sites. One of the tunnels built under Eastern Ghouta In the end, Jaish al-Islam's organisation was not enough to resist the tenacity and ruthlessness of the Syrian armed forces, and the firepower of the Russians. In the last few years most of the armed groups in Syria lost the backing of outside powers. Earlier in the war, the US, Britain, as well as Turkey, the Saudis and Qatar, to varying degrees, helped train and arm rebels who wanted to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. Everything changed after 2015,when Russia intervened decisively in the war. The men who built the tunnels under Eastern Ghouta expected to win. They were wrong, though for a while it looked as if they might be right. But with the fall of Eastern Ghouta, and a few other small enclaves around Damascus, the regime has built up formidable momentum. President Assad and his generals have been ostracised and sanctioned by the Western world, the Saudis and others. But after seven years they are closing in on victory in the conflict that started in March 2011 in Deraa, south of Damascus on the border with Jordan. The town is now the focus of an offensive by government troops, supported by the Russians. They are aiming to recapture a broad section of southern Syria from the rebels. Leaflets have been seen in Deraa, referring back to the first demonstrations, stating that the uprising began in the city and it would be buried there. Control of south-western Syria (27 June 2018) At the time of writing, something like 270,000 civilians (according to UN figures) have been displaced by the fighting. They are not being allowed into Jordan, or the Golan Heights. The UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross have issued grave warnings about the threat to life. The Syrian army's tactics are now familiar. Heavy military pressure is accompanied by talks for ""reconciliation"", which is another word for a negotiated surrender. Some groups that have opposed the regime for years are complying. Others insist they will fight on. It is hard to see how the battle can be sustained for more than a short time against the firepower of the Syrian army and the Russians. Behind the fighting is a bigger reality. The Assad regime believes it has almost finished off its enemies. It cannot do much aboutthe big powers who have troops in parts of Syria, particularly Turkey, the United States and their allies. But the armed groups who claim descent from the first demonstrators in Deraa in March 2011 are fighting their last battles. Syria's bloodshed, Syria's wars, its smashed cities, continue to break lives. But the Assad regime's fight for survival is almost done.

"The government has unveiled its Â£100m strategy to tackle rough sleeping on England's streets. It wants to ""help people turn their lives around"", including support for mental health and addictions. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire vowed to make homelessness ""a thing of the past"" and the government has vowed to end rough sleeping by 2027. But Labour says the plan is already ""unravelling"" as it's become clear no new money is being invested. Homelessness has been on the rise for the past seven years, with around4,750 people estimated to be sleeping roughon any given night in England in 2017. Charities have welcomed the plan, but warned that it was ""a step forward and not a total fix"". Rough sleeping rises for seventh year UK 'could end homelessness in a decade' Homeless in the snow: 'I hope I wake up' The Rough Sleeping Strategy will focus on preventing people from becoming homeless in the first place by offering a range of support.

But when questioned on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Brokenshire said half of the promised Â£100m had already been committed to homelessness and rough sleeping, with the other half ""reprioritised"" from existing budgets in his department. ""There are significant sums of money being focused and targeted,"" he said. ""Half of that has already been committed to homelessness and rough sleeping. ""The other remaining half of this is money that's new to rough sleeping and homelessness, reflecting and recognising the priorities and importance of taxes."" He also denied that government policies were behind the rise in homelessness. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said: ""The government's rough sleeping plan has unravelled just hours after it was announced. It's now clear there is no additional money for the housing department to tackle the crisis of rough sleeping. ""Rough sleeping has more than doubled since 2010 thanks to decisions made by Tory ministers, but this feeble plan lacks any urgency."" He added that the next Labour government would end rough sleeping within its first term by making 8,000 homes available to those with a history of sleeping on the streets. And Sarah Jones, shadow housing minister, said she was ""shocked"" it was not new money. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We still need to tackle the chronic lack of genuinely affordable homes, deep instability of renting and problems with housing benefit that are leaving so many without a home.""

Crisis chief executive Jon Sparkes told Today: ""They're intervening in the right way - more outreach work, mental health support and so on. ""But of course, it's not tackling the root causes of homelessness and indeed rough sleeping. Which are that we don't have enough social houses, we have a welfare system which doesn't cover the cost of housing and there are huge groups of people excluded from the system altogether."" Ministers are also expected to review legislation on homelessness and rough sleeping, including the Vagrancy Act - which currently makes it illegal to sleep rough or beg in England and Wales. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We recognise this is a complex issue - as well as ensuring people have somewhere to live, we have to deal with underlying problems and ultimately help people turn their lives around."" ""It is simply unacceptable that people have to sleep on the streets and I am determined to make it a thing of the past,"" added Mr Brokenshire. Local Government Association chairman Lord Porter said the strategy was ""a positive first step"" but added: ""We must go much further, much faster. ""Rough sleeping is only the tip of the iceberg - right now, councils are currently housing over 79,000 homeless families and 123,000 children in temporary housing.

"This video can not be played Is homosexuality still taboo in British Asian families? BBC Three investigates British Asians are more socially conservative - and more optimistic - than the wider UK population, a ComRes survey for the Asian Network suggests. The survey found that less than half of respondents - 43% - thought same-sex relationships were acceptable. It also found more than half (54%) of British Asians had ""toned down"" their Asian identity to ""fit in"". More than 2,000 British Asians responded to the poll as part of the BBC's Big British Asian Summer. A similar number of UK citizens responded to the same questions to generate a reflection of the views of the wider population. Of the 2,026 respondents to the British Asian survey, 1,197 were born in the UK - with countries of origin being predominantly India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. The survey will be discussed on a special live debate show on theAsian Network, on 14 August from 22:00 BST - midnight. According to the surveys, just 5% of UK-wide respondents would be offended if a relative had sex before marriage - while more than a third (34%) of British Asians would be. On same-sex relationships, 15% of UK-wide respondents said they were not acceptable. This rose to more than a third (36%) of British Asians. The surveys also revealed differences in how age affects attitudes. In the UK-wide survey, younger people were more supportive of same-sex relationships, compared to older people. But in the British Asian survey, attitudes were broadly similar across all age groups. On religion, over half of 18-34 year olds in the general population said it wasn't important to them ""at all"". Just 8% of young British Asians said the same. Overall, 46% of British Asians said it was ""very important"" to them - compared to 12% of the general population. Meanwhile, when asked to describe Asian culture, 33% of British Asians said it was ""modernising"" and 25% ""progressive"". The UK-wide response was 9% and 8% respectively. When asked about changing their behaviour to fit in, about 12% said they frequently ""toned down"" their Asian identity - 23% said occasionally and 18% rarely. Some 79% said at least some of their cultural traditions were dying out. Overall, though, British Asians were more hopeful about their future than the population at large. Some 72% said Britain is somewhere you can fulfil your aspirations and ambitions, compared to 64% of the population at large. The most optimistic group of all were British Indians - with over three-quarters believing in a bright future. This video can not be played Three generations of British Asian families argue the toss over relationships and dating. The survey also asked about other topics, including the police and the monarchy: 59% of British Asians trusted the police, compared to 65% of of the wider population 51% of British Asians wanted to keep the monarchy, with 26% preferring a republic (the rest were unsure) Across the UK, 65% wanted to keep the monarchy, with 21% preferring a republic 48% of British Asians saw religion as a source of division and conflict, compared to 77% of the wider population Meanwhile, 30% of British Asians thought Britain has become a ""more tolerant place"" in the last couple of years - compared to 22% of the general population Chirag said people have had difficulty pronouncing his name Chirag Asnani, 25, could agree with parts of the survey's findings - he told the BBC's Asian Network he changed his name to try to fit in with British culture. At school, he temporarily called himself Craig because people mispronounced Chirag - and because he thought Craig was more of a ""white name"". ""At the time I thought it would be cool because no-one else had the name Chirag - and also Daniel Craig was just becoming James Bond at that point,"" he said. ""I thought it would catch on. After I while I thought 'this is dumb' and my parents thought 'this is dumb'. ""So I went back to Chirag and just made sure people were saying it right."" By BBC Asian Network's Nomia Iqbal The survey confirms what many British Asians have always said - bridging two cultures involves complication and contradiction. More than half of respondents say that they've toned down their Asian identity in order to better fit into British society. This could mean people using Western-sounding names or altering their accents. Perhaps it's a reminder that ultimately this is how integration can happen. For their parents, who came to the UK after World War II, the intention hadn't necessarily been to stay. Facing racism and being few in number, many held tight to community and tradition to retain a sense of identity. When they ended up staying so did those values which many passed to their British-born children. This is perhaps why the survey suggests that the British Asian community has more socially conservative views on gay relationships and sex before marriage, even amongst the younger generation. But it seems that British Asians are, as a whole, more optimistic than the general population - indicating that despite the internal and external challenges, people are confidently navigating society. Living with contradiction becomes second nature. Qudrat Khan, 24, said she would straighten her hair and tried to stay out of the sun because she ""wanted to be as light and fair as possible to adhere to these western beauty standards"". ""There have definitely been points where I have diluted aspects of my identity to try and fit with the more British norm,"" she said. Qudrat Khan said her curly hair made her stand out as a child Madihah Khan, 24, has on occasion had to ""Anglicise"" her name to help with pronunciation and, when going to university, ""definitely did down my Muslimness"". Meanwhile, Shahzam Uddin, 28, said as a boy he felt conflicted by his Asian and British roots - but as he got older ""just accepted"" it. Ms Khan added that people might turn to religion more if they do not feel accepted by wider society. Madihah Khan (right) said religion plays a part in conservative attitudes The Big British Asian Summer is aseason of programmes across the BBC this August, in which British Asians share their stories.

"Fiona Bruce and art dealer Philip Mould with the painting A painting bought for Â£165,000, and thought to have been painted by British artist Sir William Nicholson, could be nearly worthless after an art expert cast doubt on its authenticity. The still life of a glass jug and pears was examined on the BBC's Fake or Fortune? programme. An expert said there was not enough evidence to confirm who painted it. However, a handwriting expert believes the work is authentic, and evidence links it to Nicholson's paint box. Presenter Fiona Bruce said she was ""shocked"" as the case had been ""so strong"". ""It was just love at first sight,"" owner Lyn said of the piece, adding that she ""didn't have any doubt"" of its authenticity when she bought it in 2006. But when a catalogue of Nicholson's work - the official list of all his known pieces - was published by Reed in 2011, Lyn's painting was not included. ""I was hurt. I feel it's a miscarriage of justice,"" Lyn said. And so she hoped the Fake Or Fortune? team could prove otherwise. Will Darby, whose Mayfair gallery - Browse and Darby - exhibited the painting before selling it to Lyn for Â£165,000 ($210,456), told Fiona Bruce: ""I was shocked. As far as I was concerned this painting couldn't have been done by anyone else."" Lyn said she was 'sore' to learn that Patricia Reed thought her painting was not an authentic Nicholson In Sunday night's episode, new evidence was revealed that scientifically linked the painting to Nicholson's own paint box which is kept in his grandson's house. A handwriting expert told the programme he was ""100% convinced"" that writing on the back of the painting was by Nicholson.

""There is nothing that gives direct evidence that he actually executed the work himself,"" she said. Born in 1872, Nicholson spent five decades painting portraits, landscapes and still lifes. Reed said some of Nicholson's painting boards would be reused by painters being taught by him in his studio.

""There is nothing that gives direct evidence that he actually executed the work himself,"" she said. Born in 1872, Nicholson spent five decades painting portraits, landscapes and still lifes. Reed said some of Nicholson's painting boards would be reused by painters being taught by him in his studio. This group, known as the ""Sunday painters"", famously included Winston Churchill and Ms Reed said the painting could have been executed by one of them.

"Whale J35 is seen here earlier supporting her dead calf A killer whale has stopped carrying her dead newborn calf after at least 17 days, during which she covered 1,000 miles (1,600km), scientists say. The whale ""vigorously chased a school of salmon with her pod-mates in Haro Strait"" off Canada's Vancouver Island, the Center for Whale Research said. ""Her tour of grief is now over and her behaviour is remarkably frisky."" Killer whales have been known to carry dead calves for a week, but scientists believe this mother ""sets a record"". Killer whale spotted pushing dead calf for two days The mother whale - known as J35 - has captivated the world's attention in the past few days. ""Telephoto digital images taken from shore show that this mother whale appears to be in good physical condition,""CWR said in a statement on Saturday.,external ""The carcass has probably sunk to the bottom of these inland marine waters of the Salish Sea [between Canada and the US], and researchers may not get a chance to examine it for necropsy (autopsy of an animal)."" The mother whale was first spotted carrying her dead calf on 24 July, off the shore of Vancouver Island. The calf is believed to have died the same day. The cause of death is unknown. Both Canada and the US list the Southern Resident killer whale as endangered. The whales depend on Chinook salmon - which have been in dramatic decline in recent years - for food.

"A soldier keeps watch on the Ghazni road A Taliban attack on Ghazni has continued for a third day - with intense fighting and conflicting claims over who controls the Afghan city. Mohammad Sharif Yaftali, the Afghan army's chief-of-staff, said the strategic city was not under threat of falling into the militants' hands. But people inside Ghazni say it has been overrun, with very little still under government control. The Taliban launched the assault in the early hours of Friday. By late Friday morning, at least 16 people had been killed and many more injured. Local television station 1TV says the number of fatalities has risen to more than 100, but there is no official confirmation. News of what exactly is happening in Ghazni, a provincial capital on the key road between Kabul and Kandahar, is difficult to get after the militants damaged a telecommunications tower. Afghan civilian deaths 'hit record high' Counting the cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan The US military, which has conducted a series of air strikes in order to repel the Taliban fighters, played down the initial attack, telling reporters it was ""another failed... attempt to seize terrain"". On Sunday, Lt Col Martin O'Donnell, US Forces Afghanistan spokesperson, said the Afghan army ""continue to hold their ground and maintain control of all government centres"". His words were echoed by Gen Yafti, who told reporters: ""Strategic locations and centres in the city are under the control of Afghan forces and the Taliban are hiding inside people's homes and shops and resisting."" But a very different picture emerges from inside the city. Local lawmaker Chaman Shah Ehtemadi told Reuters news agency: ""Only the governor's office, police headquarters and intelligence agency's compound are in the hands of the government and Taliban are pushing to take them."" A reporter for news agency AFP in Ghazni said the Taliban were not hiding at all, but roaming across the city, where they are in control of several police checkpoints and have been setting fire to government offices. There are also reports the road outside the city has been mined, making it difficult for residents to escape. Abdul Wakil, who had managed to flee, told Reuters: ""There was burning and fire and dead bodies everywhere in the city."" The Tolo news agency said an Afghan military convoy on the way to Ghazni from Paktia had been ambushed about 80km from Ghazni city and had not been able to move further forward. The attack comes as pressure continues on the Taliban to enter peace talks with the Afghan government. Secret talks were recently held in Qatar between Taliban and US officials after an unprecedented three-day ceasefire during Eid celebrations in June that was largely respected by both sides.

"A hippo in a Colombian zoo. The teeth are sharp and the animal is aggressive A Taiwanese tourist has died after being bitten in the chest by a hippo he was trying to photograph in Kenya. Chang Ming Chuang, 66, was tracking the animal at a wildlife resort on Lake Naivasha, 90km (56 miles) north-west of the capital, Nairobi. A second tourist, also from Taiwan, was injured. Wildlife officials later shot dead the hippo. High water levels have seen hippos - the world's deadliest large land mammal - stray on to resorts for pasture. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) initially identified the two tourists as Chinese but Taiwan's foreign ministry later confirmed they were Taiwanese nationals. Kenya has no formal ties with Taiwan and recognises China's claims over the island. Africa Live: More updates on this and other stories Hippos - herbivores or carnivores? BBC Nature - Hippos What are the world's deadliest animals? Witnesses said the two had come too close to the animal near the Sopa hotel. The bitten man was rushed to hospital bleeding profusely but later died. The second tourist, named as Wu Peng Te, was treated for minor bruising at Naivasha District Hospital. ""Our officers tracked and shot the animal after the incident,"" said KWS warden Nelson Cheruiyot. David Kilo, chairman of Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association, told Kenya's Star newspaper that rising water levels had reduced pasture areas for hippos, forcing them on to farms and hotel grounds, and increasing contact between the mammals and humans. Six people have been killed by hippos in the area this year. Hippos, which are aggressive, have sharp teeth and weigh up to 2,750kg (three tons), kill an estimated 500 people every year in Africa. Tourism earned Kenya $1.2bn (Â£950m) last year, with 1.4 million international arrivals. 'Swallowed by a hippo' Video, 00:04:13'Swallowed by a hippo' What are the world's deadliest animals?

"Fiona Bruce and art dealer Philip Mould with the painting A painting bought for Â£165,000, and thought to have been painted by British artist Sir William Nicholson, could be nearly worthless after an art expert cast doubt on its authenticity. The still life of a glass jug and pears was examined on the BBC's Fake or Fortune? programme. An expert said there was not enough evidence to confirm who painted it. However, a handwriting expert believes the work is authentic, and evidence links it to Nicholson's paint box. Presenter Fiona Bruce said she was ""shocked"" as the case had been ""so strong"". ""It was just love at first sight,"" owner Lyn said of the piece, adding that she ""didn't have any doubt"" of its authenticity when she bought it in 2006. But when a catalogue of Nicholson's work - the official list of all his known pieces - was published by Reed in 2011, Lyn's painting was not included. ""I was hurt. I feel it's a miscarriage of justice,"" Lyn said. And so she hoped the Fake Or Fortune? team could prove otherwise. Will Darby, whose Mayfair gallery - Browse and Darby - exhibited the painting before selling it to Lyn for Â£165,000 ($210,456), told Fiona Bruce: ""I was shocked. As far as I was concerned this painting couldn't have been done by anyone else."" Lyn said she was 'sore' to learn that Patricia Reed thought her painting was not an authentic Nicholson In Sunday night's episode, new evidence was revealed that scientifically linked the painting to Nicholson's own paint box which is kept in his grandson's house. A handwriting expert told the programme he was ""100% convinced"" that writing on the back of the painting was by Nicholson. Pigments also matched those used in a very similar Nicholson painting now in Canada. Augustus John painting found after house cleared out Work starts to restore painted-over Banksy murals Stolen art found under drug dealer's bed Despite this, expert Patricia Reed was still not convinced it was genuine.

"Several of the guinea pigs had escaped and have not been found, the RSPCA said A box of guinea pigs found in a car park had been ""fly-tipped"", the RSPCA said. The box containing between six and ten guinea pigs was found at Weir Water in Admirals Bridge Lane, East Grinstead, on Wednesday. Some of the animals had escaped and were roaming free, before five of them were rounded up. RSPCA inspector Liz Wheeler said a few others had escaped into the undergrowth and could not be found. The RSPCA said a number of the guinea pigs needed treatment for mites ""It was a challenge trying to catch the guinea pigs as there were between six and ten in total and they were so frightened and skittish,"" she said. ""They were running off in all directions through the brambles, nettles and thick ferns. ""Despite us searching and going back later on, we haven't been able to find them."" Some of the animals have been suffering with mites and would need some veterinary treatment. Two of the guinea pigs are pregnant and due to give birth soon. ""It's possible the owner became overwhelmed with the number of pets - but still, abandoning an animal is never the right option,"" Ms Wheeler said.

"San Antonio is known for its lively party scene A British holidaymaker has died in the Spanish resort of San Antonio in Ibiza. He has been named locally as Conor Lee.

"Idris Elba has posted a cryptic tweet suggesting he could be the next James Bond. Days after reports that a producer of the franchise is tipping him to be 007, he posted: ""My name's Elba, Idris Elba"". Fans are taking it as a big hint that he could be about to take on the role when Daniel Craig leaves next year. There've been rumours linking Idris to the Bond role since 2014, which he's neither confirmed nor denied. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The 45-year-old actor, best known for his roles in Star Trek, Luther and The Wire, has in the past saidhe's too oldto take on the famous 007 role. But, he's never shied away from the speculation and has said he ""feels like a national treasure"" being associated with Bond. Earlier this week, reports said Bond movie boss Barbara Broccoli had said ""it is time"" for a non-white actor to take on the role. Speaking to theDaily Star,external, director Antoine Fuqua said that Broccoli had told her that she felt that a black actor in the famous role ""will happen eventually"". Barbara is the daughter of Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli - one of the men who started the official Bond film franchise in the 1960s with Sean Connery in the role. Fans have been left shaken and stirred by the Idris rumours with some tweeting that he ""might just be teasing"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The idea of a black James Bond isn't without controversy - with some people pointing out that that's not how the character was initially portrayed. ""It was created by Ian Fleming and it was his work of art,"" says David Black who helps run theInternational James Bond Fan club,external. ""Surely you should be as true as you can be to what he wanted. Otherwise, where do we end up?"" David Black suggests another role for Idris: ""[He] would absolutely make a very good Bond villain,"" he goes on. ""But I think you've got to keep in reality the context of Bond. ""People picture him as Sean Connery which is probably about as close as Ian Fleming described him."" Sean Connery (the first Bond) prepares for a casino scene in Thunderball, the fourth 007 movie It seems like we've been here before with the Bond rumour mill, but one thing is for sure - it seems Idris is enjoying fuelling the fire.

He was the sixth actor to take on the role after Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan. Daniel Craig has always said he wanted to""go out on a high note."" It's unlikely that we'll know the identity of the next Bond until after Daniel Craig's last outing.

Sunday's ceremony took place in the town's Memorial Garden, where wreaths were laid and the names of all those killed in the attack were read out, one by one. The memorial service took place in Omagh on Sunday afternoon Representatives of the British, Irish and Spanish governments attended, reflecting the nationalities of the victims. As well as prayers, speeches and music, a minute's silence was held in remembrance of those who died.

Mr Gallagher said that communal inter-worship had been well supported over the past two decades and added it  ""makes a powerful statement about the community in Omagh"". ""As a small province, we are facing our greatest challenges ahead. We would appeal to the political parties to seek agreement so that we can move forward,"" he said. ""Working alone we can achieve very little but in collaborative ventures we can achieve a great deal. ""We as a community have paid the highest price. Let us not forget why we need to make this work, showing strength, courage and leadership,"" added Mr Gallagher.

Read more The bomb, which was packed with 225kg of explosives, detonated in a vehicle parked in the middle of the main street just after 15:10 BST on 15 August 1998. A warning had been called in 40 minutes earlier but had given the wrong location of the car containing the bomb. The dead included three generations of one family. No-one has been convicted over the bombing. Last year, relatives of the victimsannounced they would sue the PSNI's chief constableGeorge Hamilton for failings they believed allowed the killers to escape justice. Mr Hamilton said he understands why the families ""would feel angry and let down"". PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton ""There has been a huge amount of investigative effort has gone into Omagh.  There have been 99 arrests and between ourselves and An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police), over 11,000 investigative actions pursued, but it is not good enough. A child leaves a tribute at the memorial ""People have not been brought to justice....  but the families have an assurance from me that if new evidence emerges, we will actively pursue that. But it is also fair to say, and realistic, that as time goes by, the chances of a criminal justice outcome reduces,"" added the chief constable. It is one of those events that people will look back at and remember where they were and what they were doing on 15 August 1998. The overwhelming sentiment, speaking to people in the town over the last few days, is how hard it is to believe that was 20 years ago. I'm standing beside the memorial garden and inscribed in stone, along with the names of those killed, is a sense of what happened that day. It says: ""Weather-wise, it was one of the best days that summer had seen. ""Ordinary people were doing ordinary things on an ordinary day and in one fateful moment, all this was changed forever. ""Time stood still, futures were obliterated, lives were shattered and hearts were broken."" Each year, over those last 20 years, people have come together to mark the anniversary, but this year's event in the memorial garden is due to be the last to take place on this scale. Aseparate legal challenge to the government's refusal to hold a public inquiry into the bombing has been pushed back to 2019. On Wednesday, the day of the 20th anniversary of the bombing, the town will host a public vigil of ""remembrance and hope"".

"Just a handful of the cats at the sanctuary in Greece Who hasn't dreamed of giving the rat race up to live on a sunny island? Well, now you can do just that - as long as you like cats. A lot. A job at a cat sanctuary on the idyllic Greek island of Syros has come up, complete with accommodation, views of the Aegean Sea and - currently - 55 feline friends. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the advert has garnered a lot of interest since it was first posted on Facebook earlier this month. So far, it has been shared 20,000 times, and some 200 people have emailed sanctuary owner Joan Bowell expressing their interest. Of course, not everyone is going to be a good fit for God's Little People Cat Rescue. Ms Bowell, an artist, is looking for someone over the age of 45, who is not only capable of loving the cats, but also knows how to ""trap or handle a feral or non-sociable cat"".

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons A man who stole an empty passenger plane from Seattle airport and then crashed it was an airline worker with full credentials, authorities say. The 29-year-old had worked for Horizon Air for more than three years, towing and tidying aircraft and loading bags. The man, named by US media as Richard Russell, took off late on Friday, forcing the airport to close while two fighter jets gave chase. After making ""incredible manoeuvres"", he crashed the plane and was killed. The flight lasted 90 minutes and the crash site is on Ketron Island, a sparsely populated area in Puget Sound. ""At this time, we believe he was the only one in the aircraft but of course, we haven't confirmed that at the crash site,"" said Jay Tabb, chief of the FBI's Seattle division. Transcripts of his conversation with air traffic control reveal a man who appears surprised about his feat, who is unclear as to the full operations of the plane, who has no intention to hurt anyone and who ultimately apologises to his loved ones, saying he is ""just a broken guy"". Richard Russell worked as a ground-service agent for Horizon Air The airline worker, whose nickname was Beebo, has not yet been formally named as the pilot of the plane but he has been identified as such by his family and by US media. In a statement, his family said they were ""stunned and heartbroken"". ""It may seem difficult for those watching at home to believe, but Beebo was a warm, compassionate man,"" the statement said. ""He was a faithful husband, a loving son and a good friend."" According to an online blog, Mr Russell lived in Sumner, Washington. He was born in Key West, Florida, and moved to Wasilla, Alaska, when he was seven years old. This video can not be played The family of Richard Russell released a statement His profile tells of how he met his wife in Oregon in 2010,externaland says they ran a bakery together there for three years before moving to Washington to be closer to her family. Mr Russell was active in the local Christian youth ministry, often working with troubled children. He also writes about his job with Horizon Airlines, saying he is ""able to fly to Alaska at my leisure"". Russell said he appreciated his job as it allowed him flights to Alaska ""In this season of life we enjoy exploring as much as possible, whether it's a day (or so) trip to one of Alaska Airline's destinations, or visiting a new area of Washington,"" the blog post, apparently written two years ago, says. A former airline colleague of Mr Russell described him as a ""quiet guy"". ""He was well liked by the other workers,""Rick Christenson told The Seattle Times.,external""I feel really bad for Richard and for his family. I hope they can make it through this."" Mike Ehl, director of aviation operations at the airport, said the employee ""had access legitimately"" to the plane and that ""no security violations were committed"". This video can not be played Brad Tilden (L), the CEO of Alaska Air Group speaks during a news briefing Alaska Airlines CEO Brad Tilden said the worker had been ""background checked"". ""He worked his shift yesterday and we believe he was in uniform,"" he added. Mr Tilden said planes do not have door or ignition keys, and that other airport security measures keep them safe. Gary Beck, CEO of Horizon Air, said that ""to our knowledge, he didn't have a pilot's licence"" and that he had no idea how he had gained the skills to fly such a ""complex machine"". FBI spokeswoman Ayn S Dietrich-Williams said agents were working with the transportation safety board and other groups to process the scene of the crash. The 76-seat, twin-engine turboprop Bombardier Q400, belonging to Horizon Air, took off from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport at 19:32 local time (02:32 GMT). Officials say the employee used a pushback tractor to first manoeuvre the plane 180 degrees from a maintenance location into the correct position for take-off. The plane flew very low to the water After take-off he performed at least one dramatic roll, pulling the aircraft up just metres from the water before gaining altitude again. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) issued a statement saying that two F15 fighter jets were launched from Portland to intercept. A number of videos showed them following the passenger plane. Norad said the F15s were ""working to redirect the aircraft out over the Pacific Ocean when it crashed on the southern tip of Ketron island"", about 30 miles (48km) south of the airport. ""Norad fighters did not fire upon the aircraft,"" it said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officials say they lost contact with the plane at 20:47 local time, more than an hour after it left the airport. Richard Russell's messages vary from options for landing, to apologies for what he is doing to the often bizarre. The controllers suggest he needs some help flying the plane, to which he replies: ""Nah, I mean, I don't need that much help; I've played some video games before."" But he also shows a limited knowledge of operations, acknowledging that the amount of fuel used on take-off was quite a lot more than he expected and that some instructions to him were ""mumbo jumbo"". Advised that he try to land at the US Air Force base at McChord Field, he says: ""Aw man, those guys would rough me up if I tried landing there... Oh, they've probably got anti-aircraft."" The controller asks for a left turn, receiving the reply: ""This is probably jail time for life, huh? Well I hope it would be for a guy like me."" Among the more odd exchanges, Mr Russell discusses: The co-ordinates foran orca carrying her dead calf on her backwhich featured in the news last week Looking at the view and possibly going to look at the Olympic Mountains in Washington state Whether or not Alaska Airlines would give him a job after a successful landing However, there are also indications that Mr Russell might not have been expecting to land safely. He talks of doing a barrel roll and ""calling it a night"" by going ""nose down"". Footage shows a fire burning in the spot where the plane went down When asked to land he says: ""I don't know, man. I don't want to. I was kind of hoping that was going to be it, you know."" He also says: ""I've got a lot of people that care about me. It's going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. ""I would like to apologise to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it, until now.""

"Rescuers walked for two hours to reach the site of the crash A 12-year-old boy has been found alive in the wreckage of a plane crash which killed eight people in Indonesia. Photos from the scene show the boy conscious and looking at the camera. He was found with the wreckage on a mountainside near the border with Papua New Guinea on Sunday morning. The aircraft he had been travelling in lost contact with air traffic control on Saturday afternoon, shortly before it was due to land at Oksibil airport. The plane, owned by private charter Dimonim Air, had been travelling from Tanah Merah, about 40 minutes flight south, to Oksibil in the province of Papua when it went down. It was carrying nine people, including two crew members. The boy was bought down on a stretcher According to news agency AFP, nearby villagers heard a ""loud roar followed by an explosion"". An investigation into the cause of the crash will be carried out, officials said. Planes are one of the few ways to get around Papua province, a remote and mountainous region which is extremely difficult to navigate. However, its rapidly changing weather conditions mean it is not an easy place to fly. Three years ago,a Trigana Air twin turboprop plane came downnear to Oksibil, killing all 54 on board.

""As a small province, we are facing our greatest challenges ahead. We would appeal to the political parties to seek agreement so that we can move forward,"" he said. ""Working alone we can achieve very little but in collaborative ventures we can achieve a great deal. ""We as a community have paid the highest price. Let us not forget why we need to make this work, showing strength, courage and leadership,"" added Mr Gallagher. Kat Wilkinson, whose brother was killed, said that the time was ""right"" to discontinue the public events to mark the anniversary and ""let families be on their own for that day, go to the grave and do their own grieving on the next anniversaries"". Kevin Skelton, who lost his wife in the bomb, said there is no strategy to ""look after people left behind"" Stanley McComb, whose wife died in the bomb, said: ""It doesn't seem like 20 years, but those 20 years certainly have taken its toll on everyone."" Kevin Skelton, who also lost his wife, expressed his anger that there ""is no strategy to deal with the victims."" ""The past is the past...it is time we deal with the present and look after people left behind,"" he said.

Read more The bomb, which was packed with 225kg of explosives, detonated in a vehicle parked in the middle of the main street just after 15:10 BST on 15 August 1998. A warning had been called in 40 minutes earlier but had given the wrong location of the car containing the bomb. The dead included three generations of one family. No-one has been convicted over the bombing. Last year, relatives of the victimsannounced they would sue the PSNI's chief constableGeorge Hamilton for failings they believed allowed the killers to escape justice. Mr Hamilton said he understands why the families ""would feel angry and let down"". PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton ""There has been a huge amount of investigative effort has gone into Omagh.  There have been 99 arrests and between ourselves and An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police), over 11,000 investigative actions pursued, but it is not good enough. A child leaves a tribute at the memorial ""People have not been brought to justice....  but the families have an assurance from me that if new evidence emerges, we will actively pursue that. But it is also fair to say, and realistic, that as time goes by, the chances of a criminal justice outcome reduces,"" added the chief constable. It is one of those events that people will look back at and remember where they were and what they were doing on 15 August 1998. The overwhelming sentiment, speaking to people in the town over the last few days, is how hard it is to believe that was 20 years ago. I'm standing beside the memorial garden and inscribed in stone, along with the names of those killed, is a sense of what happened that day. It says: ""Weather-wise, it was one of the best days that summer had seen. ""Ordinary people were doing ordinary things on an ordinary day and in one fateful moment, all this was changed forever. ""Time stood still, futures were obliterated, lives were shattered and hearts were broken."" Each year, over those last 20 years, people have come together to mark the anniversary, but this year's event in the memorial garden is due to be the last to take place on this scale. Aseparate legal challenge to the government's refusal to hold a public inquiry into the bombing has been pushed back to 2019. On Wednesday, the day of the 20th anniversary of the bombing, the town will host a public vigil of ""remembrance and hope"".

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons A man who stole an empty passenger plane from Seattle airport and then crashed it was an airline worker with full credentials, authorities say. The 29-year-old had worked for Horizon Air for more than three years, towing and tidying aircraft and loading bags. The man, named by US media as Richard Russell, took off late on Friday, forcing the airport to close while two fighter jets gave chase. After making ""incredible manoeuvres"", he crashed the plane and was killed. The flight lasted 90 minutes and the crash site is on Ketron Island, a sparsely populated area in Puget Sound. ""At this time, we believe he was the only one in the aircraft but of course, we haven't confirmed that at the crash site,"" said Jay Tabb, chief of the FBI's Seattle division. Transcripts of his conversation with air traffic control reveal a man who appears surprised about his feat, who is unclear as to the full operations of the plane, who has no intention to hurt anyone and who ultimately apologises to his loved ones, saying he is ""just a broken guy"". Richard Russell worked as a ground-service agent for Horizon Air The airline worker, whose nickname was Beebo, has not yet been formally named as the pilot of the plane but he has been identified as such by his family and by US media. In a statement, his family said they were ""stunned and heartbroken"". ""It may seem difficult for those watching at home to believe, but Beebo was a warm, compassionate man,"" the statement said. ""He was a faithful husband, a loving son and a good friend."" According to an online blog, Mr Russell lived in Sumner, Washington. He was born in Key West, Florida, and moved to Wasilla, Alaska, when he was seven years old. This video can not be played The family of Richard Russell released a statement His profile tells of how he met his wife in Oregon in 2010,externaland says they ran a bakery together there for three years before moving to Washington to be closer to her family. Mr Russell was active in the local Christian youth ministry, often working with troubled children. He also writes about his job with Horizon Airlines, saying he is ""able to fly to Alaska at my leisure"". Russell said he appreciated his job as it allowed him flights to Alaska ""In this season of life we enjoy exploring as much as possible, whether it's a day (or so) trip to one of Alaska Airline's destinations, or visiting a new area of Washington,"" the blog post, apparently written two years ago, says. A former airline colleague of Mr Russell described him as a ""quiet guy"". ""He was well liked by the other workers,""Rick Christenson told The Seattle Times.,external""I feel really bad for Richard and for his family. I hope they can make it through this."" Mike Ehl, director of aviation operations at the airport, said the employee ""had access legitimately"" to the plane and that ""no security violations were committed"". This video can not be played Brad Tilden (L), the CEO of Alaska Air Group speaks during a news briefing Alaska Airlines CEO Brad Tilden said the worker had been ""background checked"". ""He worked his shift yesterday and we believe he was in uniform,"" he added. Mr Tilden said planes do not have door or ignition keys, and that other airport security measures keep them safe. Gary Beck, CEO of Horizon Air, said that ""to our knowledge, he didn't have a pilot's licence"" and that he had no idea how he had gained the skills to fly such a ""complex machine"". FBI spokeswoman Ayn S Dietrich-Williams said agents were working with the transportation safety board and other groups to process the scene of the crash. The 76-seat, twin-engine turboprop Bombardier Q400, belonging to Horizon Air, took off from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport at 19:32 local time (02:32 GMT). Officials say the employee used a pushback tractor to first manoeuvre the plane 180 degrees from a maintenance location into the correct position for take-off. The plane flew very low to the water After take-off he performed at least one dramatic roll, pulling the aircraft up just metres from the water before gaining altitude again. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) issued a statement saying that two F15 fighter jets were launched from Portland to intercept. A number of videos showed them following the passenger plane. Norad said the F15s were ""working to redirect the aircraft out over the Pacific Ocean when it crashed on the southern tip of Ketron island"", about 30 miles (48km) south of the airport. ""Norad fighters did not fire upon the aircraft,"" it said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officials say they lost contact with the plane at 20:47 local time, more than an hour after it left the airport. Richard Russell's messages vary from options for landing, to apologies for what he is doing to the often bizarre. The controllers suggest he needs some help flying the plane, to which he replies: ""Nah, I mean, I don't need that much help; I've played some video games before."" But he also shows a limited knowledge of operations, acknowledging that the amount of fuel used on take-off was quite a lot more than he expected and that some instructions to him were ""mumbo jumbo"". Advised that he try to land at the US Air Force base at McChord Field, he says: ""Aw man, those guys would rough me up if I tried landing there... Oh, they've probably got anti-aircraft."" The controller asks for a left turn, receiving the reply: ""This is probably jail time for life, huh? Well I hope it would be for a guy like me."" Among the more odd exchanges, Mr Russell discusses: The co-ordinates foran orca carrying her dead calf on her backwhich featured in the news last week Looking at the view and possibly going to look at the Olympic Mountains in Washington state Whether or not Alaska Airlines would give him a job after a successful landing However, there are also indications that Mr Russell might not have been expecting to land safely. He talks of doing a barrel roll and ""calling it a night"" by going ""nose down"". Footage shows a fire burning in the spot where the plane went down When asked to land he says: ""I don't know, man. I don't want to. I was kind of hoping that was going to be it, you know."" He also says: ""I've got a lot of people that care about me. It's going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. ""I would like to apologise to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it, until now.""

"This video can not be played Campaigners says new cycling law 'missed opportunity' Cyclists who kill pedestrians could face charges of ""death by dangerous cycling"" or ""death by careless cycling"", under government proposals. The Department for Transport has launched a 12-week consultation looking at whether new offences should be introduced for dangerous cyclists. Matt Briggs, whose wife was killed by a cyclist, welcomed the proposed changes to current ""arcane laws"". But campaigners accused the government of ""tinkering"". Causing death by dangerous driving carries a maximum sentence of14 years' imprisonment,external. Death by careless driving has a maximum sentence of five years. Duncan Dollimore, Cycling UK's head of campaigns, said: ""Adding one or two new offences specific to cyclists would be merely tinkering around the edges. ""If the government is serious about addressing behaviour that puts others at risk on our roads, they should grasp the opportunity to do the job properly, rather than attempt to patch up an area of legislation that's simply not working."" Kim Briggs's death in 2016 prompted a campaign for a change in the law But Mr Briggs said there was a ""gap in the law"" after cyclist Charlie Alliston wasjailed for 18 monthsfor the death of his wife, Kim Briggs, last year. Alliston was riding a fixed gear bike with no front brakes when he hit the 44-year-old mother-of-two as she crossed a road in east London in February 2016. The cyclist was cleared of manslaughter, but found guilty of causing bodily harm by ""wanton or furious driving"" - a Victorian-era law intended for drivers of horse-drawn carriages which carries a maximum sentence of two years. Under the current law, this offence is the closest thing to dangerous driving a cyclist can be charged with. ""This public consultation is an important step towards updating the arcane laws that are currently being used to prosecute cycling offences,"" said Mr Briggs. 'Not fit for purpose' The number of cases involving collisions between cyclists and pedestrians remains relatively low. Department for Transport figures for 2016 show that 448 pedestrians were killed on Britain's roads, but only three cases involved bicycles. By contrast, Cycling UK said that 99.4% of deaths on the road in the last ten years involved a motor vehicle. The charity claims both cyclists and pedestrians are regularly being failed by existing road safety legislation. ""The way the justice system deals with mistakes, carelessness, recklessness and deliberately dangerous behaviour by all road users hasn't been fit for purpose for years,"" said Mr Dollimore. Cycling and Walking Minister Jesse Norman said the government had already announced a range of measures to protect ""vulnerable road users"" including: Training for driving instructors to raise awareness of cyclists' safety Better investigation of crashes Â£100 million investment to improve dangerous roads In addition, the Department for Transport has announced further measures, including a review of the Highway Code to make it clearer to motorists how to safely pass cyclists. Mr Norman said: ""All these measures are designed to support the continued growth of cycling and walking, with all the benefits they bring to our communities, economy, environment and society.""

"This video can not be played The Parker Solar Probe spacecraft takes off on its mission to the Sun US space agency Nasa has launched its mission to send a satellite closer to the Sun than any before. The Parker Solar Probe rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The probe is set to become the fastest-moving manmade object in history. Its data promises to crack longstanding mysteries about the Sun's behaviour. It is the first space craft to be named after a living person - astrophysicist Eugene Parker, 91, who first described solar wind in 1958. ""Wow, here we go! We're in for some learning over the next several years,"" he said after watching the lift-off from the scene. The University of Chicago professor said he had been biting his nails in anticipation. Astrophysicist Dr Eugene Parker with a model of the Parker Solar Probe that he inspired The Delta-IV Heavy rocket - which was carrying the probe - launched at 03:31 local time (07:31 GMT). It came after a failed attempt the previous day, when a last-minute alarm caused the agency to miss its 65-minute window. Just under an hour after the launch, Nasa confirmed that the spacecraft had successfully separated and the probe had been released into space. The probe aims to dip directly into our star's outer atmosphere, or corona. Analysis: Why this mission is important It will zip past Venus in six weeks and make a first rendezvous with the Sun a further six weeks after that. This video can not be played Parker Solar Probe: How Nasa is trying to 'touch' the Sun Over the course of seven years, Parker will make 24 loops around our star to study the physics of the corona, the place where much of the important activity that affects the Earth seems to originate. The probe will dip inside this tenuous atmosphere, sampling conditions, and getting to just 6.16 million km (3.83 million miles) from the Sun's broiling ""surface"". ""I realise that might not sound that close, but imagine the Sun and the Earth were a metre apart. Parker Solar Probe would be just 4cm away from the Sun,"" explained Dr Nicky Fox, the UK-born project scientist who is affiliated to the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

"Police said the victims' injuries were not life-threatening Two children were among 10 people hurt in a shooting in the Moss Side area of Manchester, which police are treating as attempted murder. They were injured with what police believe was a shotgun with ""pellets in its rounds"" at a street party in Claremont Road at about 02:30 BST. Nine victims had ""pellet-type wounds"" and a man suffered a broken leg. The shooting took place at a party held after the first day of this weekend's Caribbean Carnival in Alexandra Park. The victims, including two children over the age of 12, with ""pellet-type wounds"" were not seriously injured but the man with the broken leg was in a serious condition. Another two people attended hospital later on Sunday to be ""checked over"" but their injuries are not thought to be serious, police said. Firearms officers had earlier been sent to the scene Ch Supt Wasim Chaudhry, from Greater Manchester Police, said those injured were aged between 12 and their 50s and mainly suffered injuries to their legs. ""Discharging a firearm... in as large a crowd as this is completely reckless,"" he said. ""I think its more by luck than by anything else that people haven't suffered life-threatening injuries,"" he added, saying the motive remained unclear. He said two armed officers were ""quickly in attendance, within a minute in fact"", followed by other officers. Police urged anyone with information to contact them as they were treating the attack as the attempted murder of 10 people. Thousands of people attend the Caribbean Carnival every year Caribbean Carnival chairman Mike Bisson said people had come from around the country to the ""flagship"" carnival, which continued on Sunday. ""Whatever happened outside has no connection to the carnival and it will be safe today and the crowds are coming in. ""The spirit of carnival is dance, music, vibrancy and well-behaved people enjoying themselves."" Councillor Pat Karney said: ""You can't tar a whole community because of some idiotic behaviour. ""I think the fact that over 16,000 people came out to the carnival yesterday indicates the strength of the community here and their desire to celebrate their area."" The Caribbean Carnival, which has been held every summer since 1972, draws thousands of people. Greater Manchester Police said more officers would be patrolling the area over the coming days Residents said a street party was usually held in Claremont Road after the first day of events. Youth worker Kemoy Walker, who had been on the main stage at the carnival on Saturday, said he had been at another street party in Claremont Road until about 23:30. ""The party I was at was beautiful,"" he said. ""When I left there was lovely dancing. That's Moss Side, that's the culture. I'm in shock this morning."" I was there enjoying the good vibes, having a drink, and then I noticed two crowds of youths gathering and I thought something might happen but I wasn't expecting a shooting. The next thing I heard was one gunshot, which I thought was a balloon or some kind of glass getting dropped, but then I heard two more and then there was a lot of panic. I went behind a wall because I didn't know whether it was the start of some kind of gun battle but I was safe. There was a man surrounded by people and he was injured but luckily he was alive. He was able to walk to the ambulance. It was quite a long time [before the police arrived] considering somebody had been shot but I think the ambulance was waiting for armed police - it was just informal security there - and then eventually the police did turn up. This is just a street party - it's nothing to do with the main carnival. In fact, organisers advise people not to go to the street parties because they are not officially affiliated or sanctioned by carnival. Greater Manchester deputy mayor Beverley Hughes praised police for ""their swift action"", saying the shooting was ""very upsetting and it causes a deal of distress and people feel that their reputation is challenged again"". She added: ""I think the carnival, as well as being two days of intense enjoyment for the community, is a really important statement about where that community has comeâ¦ and so I think for it to be abandoned would be a very unfortunate message."" The shooting took place on Claremont Road Det Sup Debbie Dooley said: ""The area is being searched and examined while we are also trying to speak to as many people as possible and are reviewing CCTV to get all the facts."" Extra officers will be patrolling the area over the coming days to reassure the public, she added. Since the 1980s, Moss Side has been associated with problems linked todrugs, gangs and violence. The Caribbean Carnival was meant to be a celebratory event, especially given the 70th anniversary of the arrival of the Windrush generation. Moss Side has done much work in the last few years to reinvent its image - in the past it had become notorious for violent crime. The events overnight will be seen as absolutely shocking for the local community. Officers will understand that and they will know there will be a lot of people who will be scared in their own homes - that is why they are putting on extra patrols over the coming days. Former police officer Martin Harding, who now works with local schools, said the number of shootings had significantly fallen in recent years. ""It's another sign that some of the work in Moss Side - and neighbouring Hulme - is working because, going back, it used to be an almost a daily occurrence that there would be incidents of a similar nature taking place in the area,"" he said. He said the area, where a new Manchester Metropolitan University building is based, had a ""proud community"" and there would be ""lots and lots of disappointment"" with the latest shooting.

"The nine will now train intensively on the systems they will operate in space Nasa has named the astronauts who will fly the first missions into space on commercially provided rockets and capsules, starting next year. The nine individuals will go up on systems developed by - and contracted from - the Boeing and SpaceX firms. Most have previous experience in orbit. Among them are the commander and pilot ofthe final shuttle mission in 2011. For the past seven years, Russian rockets have been the only way for Nasa to get people into orbit. US space agency Administrator Jim Bridenstine introduced the astronauts during a ceremony at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. ""For the first time since 2011, we are on the brink of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil,"" he told the enthusiastic audience. Artwork: SpaceX's Dragon (L) is currently set to fly before Boeing's Starliner (R) The commander on the historic last shuttle mission,Chris Ferguson,external, is now a Boeing employee and has been heavily involved in developing the company's CST-100 Starliner capsule. When this ship makes its maiden crewed flight in the middle of next year, launching atop an Atlas rocket from Cape Canaveral, Ferguson will be joined byEric Boe,externalandNicole Aunapu Mann,external. Boe is a former shuttle pilot; Mann will be making her first trip into space. The SpaceX Dragon capsule, on current timelines, is set to make its maiden crewed flight in April. It will ride atop a Falcon-9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center. It will actually use one of the old shuttle pads, although this has now been modified for the smaller Falcon. At the helm will beDoug Hurley,externalandBob Behnken,external. Hurley was the pilot on the last shuttle mission. Behnken has been in space on two previous occasions. The companies have designed their own spacesuits for the capsules The initial crewed flights by Boeing and SpaceX will spend a short period in orbit - measured perhaps in days or a few weeks, and attached to the International Space Station (ISS) - before coming back to Earth. It is on later missions that the crew capsules will go to the station and dock for more extended stays, and Nasa also named the astronauts for those first flights as well. For Boeing, this introductory long-duration mission includesJosh Cassada,external, who has never been in space before, andSuni Williams,external, who is one of the most experienced American astronauts in history, having spent a cumulative 321 days in orbit through her career. For SpaceX, such an ISS mission would involveVictor Glover,external, another newbie, andMike Hopkins,external, who has already spent 166 days on the sky-high lab during two tours of duty. Nasa took the decision after the shuttle retired to turn transportation to low-Earth obit destinations intoa service that it could buy,external. It has given seed money to SpaceX and Boeing to incentivise them, but the companies themselves have also had to invest their own money. Nasa's motivation was to save money it could then spend on a rocket and capsule system to take humans back to the Moon and on to Mars. That system will likely fly some time early next decade.

"This video can not be played Could Trump's 'Space Force' become a reality? Donald Trump's goal of creating a new military branch has yet to lift off, but his campaign is hoping it will fill their coffers to infinity and beyond. Trump 2020 re-election campaign manager Brad Parscale emailed supporters on Tuesday asking them to vote on a Space Force logo which will be sold later on. The email came as Vice President Mike Pence hailed the proposed Space Force during a speech at the Pentagon. He said the agency would be tasked with winning wars in this ""new battlefield"". ""President Trump wants a SPACE FORCE - a groundbreaking endeavour for the future of America and the final frontier,"" read the email from the Trump campaign. ""As a way to celebrate President Trump's huge announcement, our campaign will be selling a new line of gear."" Mr Parscale then asked supporters to choose from six logos, one of which includes the phrase: ""Mars awaits."" Supporters were asked to vote on their favourite logo Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, Washington Donald Trump's Space Force as an actual sixth branch of the US military faces numerous bureaucratic and political obstacles. Space Force as a presidential marketing campaign, however, is already blasting off. Not that any of the proposals are particularly good, of course. One is a direct rip-off of Nasa's logo. Another looks like bad clip-art. And what does defending US commercial and military assets in Earth orbit have to do with Mars? Of course, the real point of the email poll from Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale becomes obvious after readers choose their favourite graphic, in the form of a campaign fundraising pitch. And if the direct approach doesn't work, there's a potentially more lucrative cash grab on the horizon. The White House Gift Shop is already taking pre-orders for Space Force commemorative coins. Once Space Force merchandise hits the Trump campaign store, it won't be long before it starts showing up at Trump rallies. It's a brilliant bit of marketing from the folks who brought you the ubiquitous ""Make America Great Again"" hat. After selecting a logo, people were then asked to donate money to the Trump campaign. The email came hours after Mr Pence gave a speech at the Pentagon, where he argued that the US must invest in creating a new force in order to counter Russian and Chinese operations. Afterwards, in an apparent sign of approval, Mr Trump tweeted: ""Space Force all the way!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Novelist Sir VS Naipaul, who won the Nobel Prize in literature, has died aged 85, his family have said. Sir Vidia, who was born in rural Trinidad in 1932, wrote more than 30 books including A Bend in the River and his masterpiece, A House for Mr Biswas. His wife, Lady Naipaul, called him a ""giant in all that he achieved"". She said he died at his home in London ""surrounded by those he loved, having lived a life which was full of wonderful creativity and endeavour"". Geordie Greig, editor of the Mail on Sunday and a close friend, said his death leaves a ""gaping hole in Britain's literary heritage"", but there is ""no doubt"" that his ""books live on"". Obituary: VS Naipaul American travel writer Paul Theroux, who had a bitter 15-year feud with Sir Vidia before reconciling, said: ""He will go down as one of the greatest writers of our time."" Paying tribute to his friend, who he said had been in poor health, Theroux added: ""He also never wrote falsely. ""He was a scourge of anyone who used a clichÃ© or an un-thought out sentence. He was very scrupulous about his writing, very severe, too."" Salman Rushdie, who also disagreed repeatedly with Sir Vidia, said he was ""as sad as if I just lost a beloved older brother"".

Farrukh Dhondy, a writer and long-time friend of Sir Vidia, told BBC News that his writing was distinguished by its clarity, lack of self-indulgence and for his unique perspective on the post-colonial world. ""It's window pane prose. You're looking through a very clean, polished glass window at the object beyond,"" he said. ""He was one of the greatest literary talents of the last century, and he was quite a remarkable personality, with insights which I don't think anybody else had - on a personal level, on a broader civilisational level."" On social media, fans paid tribute to Sir Vidia and expressed their sadness. Author Laila Lalamidescribed,externalhim as a ""wonderful stylist and a terrible curmudgeon"", adding: ""At his best, he could write with great tenderness and good humor [sic] about people whose lives were erased by colonial narratives."" British novelist and journalist Hari Kunzru recalled interviewing him and said: ""When we sat down, the first thing he said was 'tell me what you've read and don't lie'. Only then would he consent to be questioned."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Writer Jeet Heercalled,externalhim a ""powerful novelist"" who ""at his best approached Conrad and even the shadow of Dickens"", while blogger Patrice Yursikdescribed,externalhim as a ""titan of Caribbean literature"". One fan said ""no-one inspired me to read more than Naipaul"" while another tweeted that his novel A House for Mr Biswas ""stayed with me as a lasting memory for 30+ years"". Sir Vidia, who as a child was read Shakespeare and Dickens by his father, was raised as a Hindu and attended Queen's Royal College in Trinidad. He moved to Britain and enrolled at Oxford University in 1950 after winning a government scholarship giving him entry into any Commonwealth university of his choosing. As a student, he struggled with depression and once attempted to take his own life. His first book, The Mystic Masseur, was published in 1957. It was made into a film directed by Ismail Merchant in 2001. In 1961 he published his most celebrated novel, A House for Mr Biswas, which took more than three years to write. Sir Vidia with his second wife, Nadira, in 2013 Sir Vidia, who was a broadcaster for the BBC's Caribbean service between 1957 and 1961, was one of the first winners of the Booker Prize, for In A Free State, in 1971. Awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 2001, the committee said Sir Vidia had ""united perceptive narrative and incorruptible scrutiny in works that compel us to see the presence of suppressed histories"". It added: ""Naipaul is a modern philosopher. In a vigilant style, which has been deservedly admired, he transforms rage into precision and allows events to speak with their own inherent irony."" His first wife, Patricia Hale, died in 1996 and he went on to marry Pakistani journalist, Nadira. Sir Vidia was outspoken and became known for criticisms of Tony Blair - who he described as a ""pirate"" - as well as Charles Dickens and EM Forster. He also fell out with the American travel writer Paul Theroux, who he had mentored, in a bitter 15-year feud, after Theroux discovered a book he had given Naipaul in a second-hand bookshop. They later reunited.

Services across north-west England have been affected as engineering projects caused crew scheduling ""difficulties"". The RMT union said the firm was passing the ""blame"" while Greater Manchester's deputy mayor Beverley Hughes described it as a ""weekly shambles"". The Government called it unacceptable. Northern apologised and added about 5% of its Sunday services were affected.

More than 165 daily train services were cancelled following a chaotic timetable introduction Darren Ireland, the union's regional organiser, said it was ""ludicrous"" to blame engineering works for the latest cancellations. ""If anything, that would mean they need fewer crews because of the [resulting] cancellations. ""They are blaming everyone apart from the mismanagement of the company.""

"Robb Costello was the father of four and Sara Burns the mother of three A man has been charged with four counts of murder after two police officers and two civilians were shot dead in New Brunswick in Canada on Friday morning. Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, was arrested after the shooting locked down the provincial capital, Fredericton. It was the deadliest day for the Canadian police force in four years. The officers were shot after responding to reports of a gun poking out of a window and two bodies lying in a courtyard outside. The officers have been named as Constable Robert (Robb) Costello, 45, and Constable Sara Burns, 43. Constable Costello was a father of four and a 20-year police force veteran. Constable Burns had been on the force for two years, after serving as an auxiliary officer, and was married with three children. Halifax police chief Jean-Michel Blais tweeted: ""To the children of Sara Burns and Robb Costello, I wish you peace and comfort this night."" The two residents killed were Donald Adam Robichaud, 42, and 32-year-old Bobbie Lee Wright. Mr Robichaud's cousin Sean Callahan told CityNews Edmonton: ""The guy was so likable, like I don't think he had anybody that hated him."" He said Mr Robichaud was a father of three children and was a musician in a few local bands. A notice outside the Evangelist Anglican church in Fredericton Police have not given full details of the incident but witnesses told media that officers were called to a low-rise, four-building apartment complex on Brookside Drive, in the north of the city, at about 07:00 (10:00 GMT) on Friday. A cluster of shots had been heard, the witnesses said. The first two police responders were shot dead. Heavily armed police were then called to the scene and some nearby residents were escorted to safety. Other people were urged to stay indoors and a lockdown was enforced. The suspect was later arrested in his flat. The shooting was the worst for the Canadian police sinceJustin Bourque killed three officers in Moncton, New Brunswick, in June 2014. But it also came a few weeks aftera man killed a woman and a child and injured 13 other people in Toronto.

"Mike Bird said travellers ""run around on motorbikes shouting abuse"" A council leader has apologised for saying travellers are a ""lawless society"" who ""run around on motorbikes shouting abuse"". Mike Bird, the leader of the controlling Conservative group at Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council, made the comments duringa phone-in on BBC WM. A travellers charity previously said it was disgusted by Mr Bird's ""hate"". Mr Bird said he did not intend to cause offence. He told the BBC: ""I would like to express my sincere regret and apologies to anyone who was offended by the use of this deeply unpleasant word in relation to any community. ""I respect every community and individual equally and that is something I firmly believe in. ""I deeply regret any offence caused, it was certainly not intended or meant."" Mike Bird is leader at Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council Mr Bird drew distinction between ""their"" and ""our"" culture and also accused travellers of thefts in the borough during a phone-in on Danny Kelly's mid-morning show on Thursday. One caller labelled travellers ""parasitic"" during a long complaint to which Mr Bird responded: ""The gentleman is absolutely 100% right."" Mr Bird had said: ""The ones that I've come across, they are a lawless society, they have no respect whatsoever for our community."" A spokesperson for charity Friends, Families and Travellers, which ""seeks to end racism and discrimination against Gypsies, travellers and Roma"", said it was ""disgusted"" by Mr Bird's comments which were filled with ""hate and based upon generalisations"".

"Claim:Most major Western European countries would ""only dream"" of having the UK's record on train punctuality and performance. Reality Check verdict:UK passengers are more satisfied with their train service than many of their European neighbours, according to a report from 2013 - although this data is now a little old. But this doesn't necessarily reflect the actual quality of the service. UK trains are similarly punctual to many major Western European countries. They are more heavily used and more expensive, however. Passengers on Northern, coveringareas including Manchester, Liverpool and Cumbria, have faced cancelled trains and major delayssince a new timetable was introduced in May. Amid the chaos, Robert Nisbet, director of the rail companies' membership body the Rail Delivery Group, told BBC 5 live that the UK's railways were the ""envy"" of Europe. ""We're a hugely successful railway in many ways - much more so than many countries in Western Europe who would only dream about having our kind of performance and punctuality records,"" he said. He was referring toa European Commission report,,externalpublished in 2013, which compared customer satisfaction with rail services across 26 EU countries - excluding Cyprus and Malta which do not have national or regional trains. This video can not be played 'I'm constantly late for work' Looking at overall customer satisfaction with rail services, the UK came second only to Finland. The European Commission's directorate of mobility and transport interviewed 26,034 respondents aged 15 years old or more from different social and demographic groups. They were asked questions about how satisfied they were with things like the punctuality and reliability of services, frequency of trains, stations and facilities on the trains including toilets. Looking only at satisfaction with the punctuality and reliability of trains, the UK did a little worse, coming fourth. But for frequency of trains, it came out top. However, this report - the most recent European comparison available - dates from 2013 and so does not capture any recent disruption, including Northern's cancellations and Southern's recent strike action. Northern: Cancelled services resume after timetable chaos Rail industry 'has failed passengers' Rail timetable chaos inquiry launched Reality Check: When is a train on time? Satisfaction ratings also don't necessarily tell you how good a service is in reality. Despite passengers being far more satisfied,more recent research, also from the European Commission,,externalfound the punctuality of UK trains was similar to its European neighbours. UK trains were on time about 90% of the time, compared with 91% in France and 93% in Germany - although thecountries' definitions of ""on time"" vary.The least punctual trains were in Hungary and Croatia. A far higher proportion of UK trains were cancelled than in Germany or Spain, and a similar proportion were cancelled in France and Italy. The UK has experienced much greater growth in passenger numbers and reduction in government subsidy than Germany, France or Italy - and costs for passengers have risen faster too. The Rail Delivery Group argues that while the tax-payer picks up more of the cost in those countries, in the UK government funding goes into investment to improve the service. While the European data provides a useful snapshot, but it is not up-to-date enough to reflect recent changes to rail services. Trains in France are about as punctual as in the UK The latest UK data we have comes from independent watchdog Transport Focus and was gathered between 15 January and 28 March 2018  - so it is much more recent, but still does not capture the changes to Northern's services, which began in May. The watchdog'sNational Rail Passenger Survey,externalfound overall satisfaction with train services had slightly declined in the past year, having increased from the year before. But it also revealed massive variation between different train lines, with satisfaction ranging from 69% to 95% across the country. The lowest ratings for overall satisfaction were given to some of the biggest franchises, including Southern, TfL Rail and Great Northern. Northern came 21st out of the 26 companies with an 80% overall satisfaction rate - only above: Great Northern (78%) Greater Anglia (76%) South Eastern (75%) Southern (69%) TFL (68%) We don't know how the recent turmoil may have affected these ratings.

Victims who ""suffered and those who are still suffering"" have been remembered at a cross-community ceremony ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Omagh bomb. Twenty-nine people - including a woman pregnant with twins - died in the 1998 attack in the County Tyrone town.,external The memorial included prayers in both English and Irish as well as a reading in Spanish, the native tongue of two of the victims. The event also paid tribute to ""all victims of terrorism"" around the world. Omagh bomb relatives sue NI police chief Timeline of Omagh bomb legal cases The Omagh bombing inflicted the greatest single loss of life of any terror atrocity in the history of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, were killed in the 1998 attack The car bomb attack was carried out by the dissident republican group the Real IRA, several months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. Sunday's ceremony took place in the town's Memorial Garden, where wreaths were laid and the names of all those killed in the attack were read out, one by one. The memorial service took place in Omagh on Sunday afternoon Representatives of the British, Irish and Spanish governments attended, reflecting the nationalities of the victims. As well as prayers, speeches and music, a minute's silence was held in remembrance of those who died. The ecumenical service included contributions from the Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Methodist and Catholic Churches. Donna-Marie McGillion, who suffered burns to 65% of her body in the bombing, at the memorial service It also heard from council officials who led local government agencies' response in the aftermath of the bombing. The organisers paid tribute to ""those who have suffered and those who are still suffering, as a result of 15th August 1998 atrocity"". ""We thank the first responders, the police services, the intelligent services, the fire departments, the first aiders, the paramedics and the medical professionals for the courageous work that they carry out,"" they said.

Michael Gallagher, whose son was killed in the bombing, speaking at the memorial service His 21-year-old son, Aiden, was among those killed in the blast. Mr Gallagher said that communal inter-worship had been well supported over the past two decades and added it  ""makes a powerful statement about the community in Omagh"". ""As a small province, we are facing our greatest challenges ahead. We would appeal to the political parties to seek agreement so that we can move forward,"" he said. ""Working alone we can achieve very little but in collaborative ventures we can achieve a great deal. ""We as a community have paid the highest price. Let us not forget why we need to make this work, showing strength, courage and leadership,"" added Mr Gallagher. Kat Wilkinson, whose brother was killed, said that the time was ""right"" to discontinue the public events to mark the anniversary and ""let families be on their own for that day, go to the grave and do their own grieving on the next anniversaries"". Kevin Skelton, who lost his wife in the bomb, said there is no strategy to ""look after people left behind"" Stanley McComb, whose wife died in the bomb, said: ""It doesn't seem like 20 years, but those 20 years certainly have taken its toll on everyone."" Kevin Skelton, who also lost his wife, expressed his anger that there ""is no strategy to deal with the victims."" ""The past is the past...it is time we deal with the present and look after people left behind,"" he said.

Read more The bomb, which was packed with 225kg of explosives, detonated in a vehicle parked in the middle of the main street just after 15:10 BST on 15 August 1998. A warning had been called in 40 minutes earlier but had given the wrong location of the car containing the bomb. The dead included three generations of one family. No-one has been convicted over the bombing. Last year, relatives of the victimsannounced they would sue the PSNI's chief constableGeorge Hamilton for failings they believed allowed the killers to escape justice. Mr Hamilton said he understands why the families ""would feel angry and let down"". PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton ""There has been a huge amount of investigative effort has gone into Omagh.  There have been 99 arrests and between ourselves and An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police), over 11,000 investigative actions pursued, but it is not good enough. A child leaves a tribute at the memorial ""People have not been brought to justice....  but the families have an assurance from me that if new evidence emerges, we will actively pursue that. But it is also fair to say, and realistic, that as time goes by, the chances of a criminal justice outcome reduces,"" added the chief constable. It is one of those events that people will look back at and remember where they were and what they were doing on 15 August 1998. The overwhelming sentiment, speaking to people in the town over the last few days, is how hard it is to believe that was 20 years ago. I'm standing beside the memorial garden and inscribed in stone, along with the names of those killed, is a sense of what happened that day. It says: ""Weather-wise, it was one of the best days that summer had seen. ""Ordinary people were doing ordinary things on an ordinary day and in one fateful moment, all this was changed forever. ""Time stood still, futures were obliterated, lives were shattered and hearts were broken."" Each year, over those last 20 years, people have come together to mark the anniversary, but this year's event in the memorial garden is due to be the last to take place on this scale. Aseparate legal challenge to the government's refusal to hold a public inquiry into the bombing has been pushed back to 2019. On Wednesday, the day of the 20th anniversary of the bombing, the town will host a public vigil of ""remembrance and hope"".

"Police said the victims' injuries were not life-threatening Two children were among 10 people hurt in a shooting in the Moss Side area of Manchester, which police are treating as attempted murder. They were injured with what police believe was a shotgun with ""pellets in its rounds"" at a street party in Claremont Road at about 02:30 BST. Nine victims had ""pellet-type wounds"" and a man suffered a broken leg. The shooting took place at a party held after the first day of this weekend's Caribbean Carnival in Alexandra Park. The victims, including two children over the age of 12, with ""pellet-type wounds"" were not seriously injured but the man with the broken leg was in a serious condition. Another two people attended hospital later on Sunday to be ""checked over"" but their injuries are not thought to be serious, police said. Firearms officers had earlier been sent to the scene Ch Supt Wasim Chaudhry, from Greater Manchester Police, said those injured were aged between 12 and their 50s and mainly suffered injuries to their legs. ""Discharging a firearm... in as large a crowd as this is completely reckless,"" he said. ""I think its more by luck than by anything else that people haven't suffered life-threatening injuries,"" he added, saying the motive remained unclear. He said two armed officers were ""quickly in attendance, within a minute in fact"", followed by other officers. Police urged anyone with information to contact them as they were treating the attack as the attempted murder of 10 people. Thousands of people attend the Caribbean Carnival every year Caribbean Carnival chairman Mike Bisson said people had come from around the country to the ""flagship"" carnival, which continued on Sunday. ""Whatever happened outside has no connection to the carnival and it will be safe today and the crowds are coming in. ""The spirit of carnival is dance, music, vibrancy and well-behaved people enjoying themselves."" Councillor Pat Karney said: ""You can't tar a whole community because of some idiotic behaviour. ""I think the fact that over 16,000 people came out to the carnival yesterday indicates the strength of the community here and their desire to celebrate their area."" The Caribbean Carnival, which has been held every summer since 1972, draws thousands of people. Greater Manchester Police said more officers would be patrolling the area over the coming days Residents said a street party was usually held in Claremont Road after the first day of events. Youth worker Kemoy Walker, who had been on the main stage at the carnival on Saturday, said he had been at another street party in Claremont Road until about 23:30. ""The party I was at was beautiful,"" he said. ""When I left there was lovely dancing. That's Moss Side, that's the culture. I'm in shock this morning."" I was there enjoying the good vibes, having a drink, and then I noticed two crowds of youths gathering and I thought something might happen but I wasn't expecting a shooting. The next thing I heard was one gunshot, which I thought was a balloon or some kind of glass getting dropped, but then I heard two more and then there was a lot of panic. I went behind a wall because I didn't know whether it was the start of some kind of gun battle but I was safe. There was a man surrounded by people and he was injured but luckily he was alive. He was able to walk to the ambulance. It was quite a long time [before the police arrived] considering somebody had been shot but I think the ambulance was waiting for armed police - it was just informal security there - and then eventually the police did turn up. This is just a street party - it's nothing to do with the main carnival. In fact, organisers advise people not to go to the street parties because they are not officially affiliated or sanctioned by carnival. Greater Manchester deputy mayor Beverley Hughes praised police for ""their swift action"", saying the shooting was ""very upsetting and it causes a deal of distress and people feel that their reputation is challenged again"". She added: ""I think the carnival, as well as being two days of intense enjoyment for the community, is a really important statement about where that community has comeâ¦ and so I think for it to be abandoned would be a very unfortunate message."" The shooting took place on Claremont Road Det Sup Debbie Dooley said: ""The area is being searched and examined while we are also trying to speak to as many people as possible and are reviewing CCTV to get all the facts."" Extra officers will be patrolling the area over the coming days to reassure the public, she added. Since the 1980s, Moss Side has been associated with problems linked todrugs, gangs and violence. The Caribbean Carnival was meant to be a celebratory event, especially given the 70th anniversary of the arrival of the Windrush generation. Moss Side has done much work in the last few years to reinvent its image - in the past it had become notorious for violent crime. The events overnight will be seen as absolutely shocking for the local community. Officers will understand that and they will know there will be a lot of people who will be scared in their own homes - that is why they are putting on extra patrols over the coming days. Former police officer Martin Harding, who now works with local schools, said the number of shootings had significantly fallen in recent years. ""It's another sign that some of the work in Moss Side - and neighbouring Hulme - is working because, going back, it used to be an almost a daily occurrence that there would be incidents of a similar nature taking place in the area,"" he said. He said the area, where a new Manchester Metropolitan University building is based, had a ""proud community"" and there would be ""lots and lots of disappointment"" with the latest shooting.

"Many demonstrators are calling on the government to resign Thousands of Romanians are again taking part in an anti-government rally in the capital Bucharest, a day after clashes left more than 400 people injured. So far the protest near the government offices has been noisy but peaceful. Similar demonstrations are also reported in other cities including Cluj, Sibiu, Timisoara and Iasi. On Friday, more than 50,000 people took to the streets against what they described as entrenched corruption and low wages. Many of the demonstrators are Romanian expats who have returned from across Europe to voice their anger at the government. Police held back the crowds on Saturday in Bucharest but no clashes were reported Several police officers were hurt on Friday as some protesters threw bottles and police used tear gas and water cannon. President Klaus Iohannis said the police reaction was ""disproportionate"". ""I firmly condemn riot police's brutal intervention, strongly disproportionate to the actions of the majority of people,"" he said. Romania protests grow over corruption decree Romanian stopped for number plate protest Read more about Romania The demonstration was staged in front of the government headquarters in the city centre. The protesters were demanding the resignation of the government, objecting to the perceived efforts to weaken the judiciary by the governing Social Democrats (PSD). The clashes on Friday began when some demonstrators tried to break into a government building The violence began when some in the crowd tried to break into the government building - but were held back by the police security cordon. Other protesters were seen throwing paving slabs at the police, who responded with tear gas, pepper spray and water cannon. Police said they had acted in a proportionate way, responding to the violent behaviour of hooligans in the crowd. Ileana Anghel travelled all the way from her home in Spain with her husband to take part in the demonstration. ""We want to see modern roads and schools and above all to not have to pay bribes to the left and right,"" she told AFP. Burning barricades were seen in central Bucharest late into the night Vlad, 60, flew back to Romania from New York, his home of 30 years. ""Corruption and embezzlement, which profit the ruling class, are what bothers me,"" Vlad told the same news agency. According to the World Bank, up to a quarter of the Romanian population - between three and five million people - live and work abroad, sending back around $5bn (Â£3.9bn) to one of the EU's least developed countries. Protests have been building against the PSD for months. In July, President Iohannis approved the dismissal of anti-corruption prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi, who had been leading corruption investigations into local and national politicians. Mr Iohannis had been under extensive pressure from the PSD government to agree to her removal. Around 150,000 gathered in Bucharest last yearafter the government passed a decree that could free those jailed on corruption charges.

Omagh bomb relatives sue NI police chief Timeline of Omagh bomb legal cases The Omagh bombing inflicted the greatest single loss of life of any terror atrocity in the history of the Northern Ireland Troubles.

Sunday's ceremony took place in the town's Memorial Garden, where wreaths were laid and the names of all those killed in the attack were read out, one by one. The memorial service took place in Omagh on Sunday afternoon Representatives of the British, Irish and Spanish governments attended, reflecting the nationalities of the victims. As well as prayers, speeches and music, a minute's silence was held in remembrance of those who died.

Mr Gallagher said that communal inter-worship had been well supported over the past two decades and added it  ""makes a powerful statement about the community in Omagh"". ""As a small province, we are facing our greatest challenges ahead. We would appeal to the political parties to seek agreement so that we can move forward,"" he said. ""Working alone we can achieve very little but in collaborative ventures we can achieve a great deal. ""We as a community have paid the highest price. Let us not forget why we need to make this work, showing strength, courage and leadership,"" added Mr Gallagher. Kat Wilkinson, whose brother was killed, said that the time was ""right"" to discontinue the public events to mark the anniversary and ""let families be on their own for that day, go to the grave and do their own grieving on the next anniversaries"". Kevin Skelton, who lost his wife in the bomb, said there is no strategy to ""look after people left behind"" Stanley McComb, whose wife died in the bomb, said: ""It doesn't seem like 20 years, but those 20 years certainly have taken its toll on everyone."" Kevin Skelton, who also lost his wife, expressed his anger that there ""is no strategy to deal with the victims."" ""The past is the past...it is time we deal with the present and look after people left behind,"" he said.

Read more The bomb, which was packed with 225kg of explosives, detonated in a vehicle parked in the middle of the main street just after 15:10 BST on 15 August 1998. A warning had been called in 40 minutes earlier but had given the wrong location of the car containing the bomb. The dead included three generations of one family. No-one has been convicted over the bombing. Last year, relatives of the victimsannounced they would sue the PSNI's chief constableGeorge Hamilton for failings they believed allowed the killers to escape justice. Mr Hamilton said he understands why the families ""would feel angry and let down"". PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton ""There has been a huge amount of investigative effort has gone into Omagh.  There have been 99 arrests and between ourselves and An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police), over 11,000 investigative actions pursued, but it is not good enough. A child leaves a tribute at the memorial ""People have not been brought to justice....  but the families have an assurance from me that if new evidence emerges, we will actively pursue that. But it is also fair to say, and realistic, that as time goes by, the chances of a criminal justice outcome reduces,"" added the chief constable. It is one of those events that people will look back at and remember where they were and what they were doing on 15 August 1998. The overwhelming sentiment, speaking to people in the town over the last few days, is how hard it is to believe that was 20 years ago. I'm standing beside the memorial garden and inscribed in stone, along with the names of those killed, is a sense of what happened that day. It says: ""Weather-wise, it was one of the best days that summer had seen. ""Ordinary people were doing ordinary things on an ordinary day and in one fateful moment, all this was changed forever. ""Time stood still, futures were obliterated, lives were shattered and hearts were broken."" Each year, over those last 20 years, people have come together to mark the anniversary, but this year's event in the memorial garden is due to be the last to take place on this scale. Aseparate legal challenge to the government's refusal to hold a public inquiry into the bombing has been pushed back to 2019. On Wednesday, the day of the 20th anniversary of the bombing, the town will host a public vigil of ""remembrance and hope"".

"The cross-party group of politicians said improved transport connections were crucial for narrowing the divide between London and other English cities More than 80 MPs and Peers have called for a Â£100bn investment in transport in northern England by 2050. A cross-party group of politicians from the North has written to the chancellor asking for regional road and rail links to be improved in time for the proposed arrival of HS2 in 2032. The letter said the money was needed to ""reverse decades of underinvestment"". Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the North would get the ""lion's share"" of future transport investment. The letter's author, Kevin Hollinrake, Conservative MP for Thirsk and Malton and the co-chair of the Northern Powerhouse all-party parliamentary group, said the proposed Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) plan was at a ""critical stage"". This video can not be played Passengers in Liverpool say Northern Rail services are ""abysmal"" The plan, once described as HS3, is focused on cutting rail journey times, particularly east to west across the North. It would see new high-speed lines between Manchester and Liverpool, Sheffield and Leeds as well as upgrading existing lines between Leeds and Hull and Sheffield and Hull. The Ordsall Chord cost Â£85m The government created a ""rail bottleneck"" in Manchester despite spending Â£85m on a new rail link in the city, Greater Manchester Metro Mayor Andy Burnham has said. He said a freeze on rail projects by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling meant stations near the Ordsall Chord rail link, which connects Manchester's three main stations, did not receive the extra spending on capacity they needed. He said ""The new timetable that came in is trying to pour more trains into the bottleneck of Manchester city centre than it can cope with. "" I'm afraid there has-been a real lack of joined-up thinking from the Department for Transport. They spent a fortune on the Ordsall Chord, but they didn't spend the extra money needed on the capacity through Deansgate, Oxford Road and Piccadilly stations."" Mr Hollinrake said: ""Bringing forward the delivery date of NPR to the same time as HS2 arrives in the North could see the coming generation enjoy further education and job opportunities currently beyond young people today, and stimulate significant growth for the whole of the UK."" Signatories to the letter include a number of Tory MPs representing northern constituencies at a time when Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has come under fire for his handling ofrecent changes in Northern Rail'stimetable, which saw trains cancelled and disruption across the network. The Northern Powerhouse Partnership has estimated businesses have lost almost Â£38m because of Northern Rail disruption. Labour's Caroline Flint, another co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group and a former minister, said the demanded Â£100bn investment was ""a must-have for the people of the North"". ""We have seen the huge impact the recent timetable fiasco has had on the Northern Powerhouse - commuters unable to get to work, businesses losing out and childcare arrangements being disrupted,"" said Ms Flint, whose Don Valley constituency is in South Yorkshire. ""It is simply not good enough and needs urgent action to address the North's outdated transport network."" Are UK trains the 'envy' of Europe? Rail industry 'has failed passengers' The North's road and rail commuter woes Speaking on a visit to Leeds, Mr Grayling said that it was ""a myth to say London gets a lot more money"". ""Actually the independent figures produced for government now show that investment in the North per head of population is greater than in the South,"" he said.

"Many demonstrators are calling on the government to resign Thousands of Romanians are again taking part in an anti-government rally in the capital Bucharest, a day after clashes left more than 400 people injured. So far the protest near the government offices has been noisy but peaceful. Similar demonstrations are also reported in other cities including Cluj, Sibiu, Timisoara and Iasi. On Friday, more than 50,000 people took to the streets against what they described as entrenched corruption and low wages. Many of the demonstrators are Romanian expats who have returned from across Europe to voice their anger at the government. Police held back the crowds on Saturday in Bucharest but no clashes were reported Several police officers were hurt on Friday as some protesters threw bottles and police used tear gas and water cannon. President Klaus Iohannis said the police reaction was ""disproportionate"". ""I firmly condemn riot police's brutal intervention, strongly disproportionate to the actions of the majority of people,"" he said. Romania protests grow over corruption decree Romanian stopped for number plate protest Read more about Romania The demonstration was staged in front of the government headquarters in the city centre. The protesters were demanding the resignation of the government, objecting to the perceived efforts to weaken the judiciary by the governing Social Democrats (PSD). The clashes on Friday began when some demonstrators tried to break into a government building The violence began when some in the crowd tried to break into the government building - but were held back by the police security cordon. Other protesters were seen throwing paving slabs at the police, who responded with tear gas, pepper spray and water cannon. Police said they had acted in a proportionate way, responding to the violent behaviour of hooligans in the crowd. Ileana Anghel travelled all the way from her home in Spain with her husband to take part in the demonstration. ""We want to see modern roads and schools and above all to not have to pay bribes to the left and right,"" she told AFP. Burning barricades were seen in central Bucharest late into the night Vlad, 60, flew back to Romania from New York, his home of 30 years. ""Corruption and embezzlement, which profit the ruling class, are what bothers me,"" Vlad told the same news agency. According to the World Bank, up to a quarter of the Romanian population - between three and five million people - live and work abroad, sending back around $5bn (Â£3.9bn) to one of the EU's least developed countries. Protests have been building against the PSD for months. In July, President Iohannis approved the dismissal of anti-corruption prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi, who had been leading corruption investigations into local and national politicians. Mr Iohannis had been under extensive pressure from the PSD government to agree to her removal. Around 150,000 gathered in Bucharest last yearafter the government passed a decree that could free those jailed on corruption charges.

"David Evans said he was left in debt after his dad died A drunken message on social media very rarely solves your biggest problems. David Evans' family was in debt and facing a ""bureaucratic nightmare"" after the death of his 56-year-old father in Germany, with no will in place. One night Mr Evans, from Llandudno, Conwy county, posted a message to his MP Guto Bebb on Facebook after a ""few too many beers"". But the Aberconwy MP stepped in to help, bringing his two-and-a-half year battle to an end. Following the death of Mr Evans - also known as David - in January 2016, his family wanted to bring the body back to Wales to be buried, but repatriating it and the funeral itself ran up bills of about Â£10,000. These costs were on top of paying off Mr Evans' father's debts. Facebook offers solution to end drunken posts What are four of the biggest hazards of social media?

"Sid Ouared said a BA manager told him he had ""girl's hair"" A British Airways check-in worker has said the company's dress code discriminated against him after he was sacked for his man bun hairstyle. Londoner Sid Ouared claims he was fired from his job at Heathrow because he refused to change his look. He said the style was accepted for women but he was ordered to cut it, wear a turban or style his hair in dreadlocks. The company said it did not comment on individual employment matters. Mr Ouared, who is 26, said he was told he was being dismissed after only a couple of weeks in the job because his hair did not conform to the uniform standards. He said: ""It's ridiculous in 2018. There are more and more men that have the same hairstyle as me. There's 100% sexism going on."" The ""man bun"" hairstyle has been worn by celebrities such as footballer Gareth Bale and singer Harry Styles. ""BA are stuck in the 1970s, their policy is very much from the 1970s, it's not conforming with our times,"" Mr Ouared said. The airline issues guidelines for staff wearing uniforms, which says men's hair must not fall over the face or touch the shirt collar. Ponytails are only acceptable for men with dreadlocks, it says. Women have their own requirements regarding hairstyles, including a ban on close-shaven hair, along with rules on hosiery, make-up and skirt length. During the interview process, Mr Ouared said no one mentioned his hair, although managers did ask him about tattoos and piercings, which he does not have. But early in his training a line manager told him he would have to cut his hair. Real Madrid and Wales winger Gareth Bale is among the stars seen sporting a man bun He says a more senior manager described his hair as ""girls' hair"" and said if he did not wear it shorter, he would have to wear a turban or style it in dreadlocks. ""I didn't want to cut my hair because I've been employed by several companies and I have never ever been told that my hair has been an issue,"" Mr Ouared said. He said that a turban or dreadlocks were religious dress for Sikhs and Rastafarians, which he did not regard as appropriate for him. ""I don't even know how to put a turban on,"" he said. The bun was a style frequently worn by female staff, according to Mr Ouared. He said: ""I was made to feel like a black sheep, I felt discriminated against."" Beverley Sunderland, managing director of Crossland Employment Solicitors, said that employers were allowed to require a ""conventional standard of appearance"" which might be different for men and women. That decision came in a 1996 Court of Appeal case where a man with long hair had complained that his employer, Safeway, required him to cut it. But she said a case today would depend on whether men with long hair tied up in a bun were now considered sufficiently ""conventional"". Ms Sunderland said: ""What might not have been a conventional appearance at one stage might be now. I wasn't allowed to wear trousers at work 30 years ago. All that has changed."" Other men have taken a stand against restrictive rules on office fashion in other ways. Call centre worker Joey Barge was sent home last yearbecause his navy shorts did not conform to the dress code. He returned in a pink and black dress, prompting the company to relax its attitude to shorts. Is it legal to force women to wear high heels at work?

"A shop worker who painted the nails of one of her customers after she was turned away from a nail salon is being celebrated online. Ebony Harris who works at a Walmart superstore in Burton, Michigan, in the US, painted the nails of Angela Peters on her lunch break. Angela has Cerebral Palsy and had earlier been turned away from a nail salon within the superstore because she ""moves too much"". The condition causes her muscles to shake involuntarily. Angela whowrites poems in her spare time,externaland is a published author told the BBC the response she'd received since the post had been ""overwhelming"". From left to right: Angela Peters with Tasia Smith and Ebony Harris Ebony often helps Angela do her shopping at Walmart. Tasia Smith, who works at a restaurant also within the superstore, captured the moment Ebony painted Angela's nails and posted pictures of the good deed online. Her Facebook update has been reacted to more than 5,400 times and shared nearly 4,000 times since it was posted on 30 July. ""I think people like my story because I've been so positive about the whole thing,"" said Angela. ""I've not let what happened get me down. ""I'm grateful for what Ebony did for me.""
