"No story dominates the headlines but the Sunday Telegraph and Sunday Times both lead on defence issues. TheSunday Telegraph takes aim at officials in the Ministry of Defence,external, reporting that MPs will blame a ""rotten core"" of civil servants for allowing British soldiers to be hounded by false claims of abuse dating from the Iraq War. The story is based on a parliamentary inquiry whose findings have not yet been published. The Telegraph expects the report to condemn the activities of the government's Iraq Historic Allegations Team and to call for it to be shut down immediately. IHAT has said that it handles investigations with sensitivity. The Telegraph, though, calls it a ""grotesque charade"". TheMoD also finds itself under attack from the Sunday Times, which claims that equipment failures,externaland bungled procurement deals have left gaping holes in Britain's defences. Among a number of examples, it cites the Royal Navy's new Type 45 destroyers, which are apparently so noisy they can be detected by Russian submarines 100 miles away. In a statement, the MoD says it is focused on delivering the equipment needed to keep Britain safe. Elsewhere, theSun on Sunday reports that the British veteran, Johnson Beharry, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for heroism in Iraq, was delayed and questioned at JFK airport,externalin New York by officials enforcing President Trump's travel ban. Lance Sergeant Beharry, who was en route to a charity event for war veterans, believes that an Iraq stamp in his passport aroused suspicions. He complains that he felt ""humiliated"" and missed the fund-raising show because of the delay. TheObserver says that the government is to break with Margaret Thatcher's policy of supporting home ownership,external, with a shift in favour of people who rent. It says the new approach, to be set out in a White Paper this week, will aim to deliver more affordable and secure rental deals, and threaten tougher action against rogue landlords. In the Observer's view, it is a turning point for the Conservative party and an admission by Theresa May's government that home ownership is out of reach for millions of families because of sky-high property prices. TheMail on Sunday devotes its front page and two others to news that the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage is sharing a house,externalin west London with a French politician, described by the newspaper as ""glamorous"" and ""foxy"". The Mail says Laure Ferrari, who moved in with Mr Farage last week, is the head of a Eurosceptic think-tank which is accused of diverting EU funding to UKIP before the general election and the referendum. Mr Farage tells the Mail he is simply helping Miss Ferrari with somewhere to stay. They both deny having an affair. Mr Farage also denies any financial wrongdoing. David Beckham appears on a number of front pages, after the leak of private emails apparently revealing his anger at missing out on a knighthood in 2013. His spokesman has said that the emails have been ""hacked and doctored"" and contain ""outdated material taken out of context"". TheMail on Sunday is unimpressed by friends of the footballer,externalexplaining that he was simply ""a normal person"" who was ""extremely disappointed"" not to get a knighthood. Butthe Sunday Mirror says it is understandable that Beckham feels ""miffed"",externalafter giving so much to charity and his country. It says it is high time he was told ""Arise, Sir David"". The story of Mary Ellis from the Isle of Wight, one of the few women who flew Spitfires during World War Two, is told in theSunday Times,externaland theMail on Sunday.,external Mrs Ellis, who turned 100 last week, joined the Air Transport Auxiliary in 1941. She and her fellow so-called ""ATA girls"" delivered planes to RAF airfields, releasing male pilots for combat duty. For an early birthday treat, she recently took control of a Spitfire once again on a flight over the South Coast accompanied by a co-pilot. Finally, for those with a sweet tooth, theSunday Times reports that chocolate bars are about to get 20% smaller.,external It comes as manufacturers try to meet government targets for reducing sugar in their products. They can not use artificial sweeteners, according to the paper, because this ruins the taste and can even have a laxative effect. Mars and Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, declined to comment on the possible 20% cut.

"This video can not be played Five best shots as Inglot and Murray win doubles Davis Cup: Canada v Great Britain Venue:TD Place Arena, OttawaDates:3-5 FebTime:17:00 GMT on Sunday Sunday's coverage:Watch live on BBC Red Button, Connected TV and online from 17:00, plus follow text updates on the BBC Sport website. Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot put Great Britain 2-1 up against Canada with victory in Saturday's Davis Cup doubles contest in Ottawa. The British pair beat Daniel Nestor and Vasek Pospisil 7-6 (7-1) 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 to edge the visitors ahead in the best-of-five World Group tie. Dan Evans will play Pospisil in Sunday's fourth rubber, before Kyle Edmund faces Denis Shapovalov. The winners of the tie willtravel to Francefor the quarter-finals in April. BBC coverage: Davis Cup TV and online times ""Both teams knew how important this match was to give them a lead going into Sunday,"" said Murray. ""It was 50/50 going into the match. We knew it would be a close game because of the surface, how everyone was serving on the court and because we all know how to play doubles."" Captain Leon Smith said: ""There's still a lot of tennis. We've been in these situations before. The good thing is it gives you two cracks at it and gives everyone a lot of confidence. ""It does feel good going into the team room, it feels like the momentum is with you, and we've got two very good players that we can prepare for Sunday."" Both Britain and Canada are without their leading players, as world number one Andy Murray recuperates after the Australian Open and number four Milos Raonic is injured. Inglot and Murray were playing their third Davis Cup doubles rubber as a team Pospisil's surprise win over Edmundin the second singles on Friday had given Canada a huge boost, but Britain took back control of the tie over the course of three hours with a clinical performance. On the fast indoor surface there was only one break of serve apiece, and three tie-breaks were required, but the final break-point tally stood at 10-2 in favour of the Britons. In 44-year-old Nestor, playing his 50th Davis Cup tie, Canada had one of the most successful doubles players in history alongside Pospisil, himself a former Wimbledon doubles champion. The Canadian pair had the edge in rankings but after the opening two sets were shared in tie-breaks, it was Scotland's Murray and Englishman Inglot who began to take charge. Three break points went begging in the third set, before they were gifted a mini-break in the tie-break thanks to a Pospisil double fault, and Inglot in particular forced home the advantage. Pospisil, who had served superbly for three sets, was now the one under pressure and he succumbed in the fourth set to give Britain a decisive lead. It was Inglot, the man of the match, who coolly served out to put Britain within sight of their fourth Davis Cup quarter-final in a row. ""As the match went on we started to start the points better and make a few returns. And I think they got a bit tired as well,"" said Murray. ""The surface was not easy, it was hard on the joints. Vasek played yesterday and Daniel is older than us, so there was no excuse for us not to outlast them. ""We did a great job, we stayed strong in the important moments. It was fine margins."" Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent: Murray has now won seven rubbers in a row in the Davis Cup and he was very ably supported by Inglot, in what may have been his best display yet in British colours. The visitors were sharper in the key moments, and are in a strong position heading into Sunday's singles. A quarter-final in France in the first week of April beckons if Britain can win one one more point. Dan Evans has first use of the slick court against Vasek Pospisil: both have been in good form, and both will enjoy the surface. It would be a third match in three days for the Canadian, but he is taking pain killers for a knee injury and when he spoke after Saturday's doubles did not sound overly confident about his chances of playing.

"This video can not be played Wales Women got their Six Nations off to a winning start Women's Six Nations: Italy v Wales Italy (8) 8 Tries:FurlanPens:Sillari Wales (10) 20 Tries:Thomas, Hywel, PhillipsConv:SnowsillPens:Snowsill Wales Women made a winning start to the Six Nations with a gritty 20-8 victory over Italy Women at Jesi. Caryl Thomas' close-range score after 16 minutes helped Wales to a 10-0 lead, with Elinor Snowsill kicking a penalty and conversion. Italy cut the Welsh lead to 10-8 at the break after Manuela Furlan's try. But full-back Dyddgu Hywel and hooker Carys Phillips crossed for Wales in the second period before the Welsh defence held out in the closing stages. Wales dominated the early territory thanks to an astute kicking game, with Snowsill chipping over a 25-metre penalty after nine minutes. The visitors then made the most of running a tap penalty, with prop Thomas emerging from underneath a pile of bodies as the Welsh pack drove over, Snowsill converting. Dyddgu Hywel (centre) scored Wales Women's third try of the afternoon against Italy Italy mounted a storming comeback in the second quarter as winger Michela Sillari knocked over a penalty after the Welsh scrum was put under severe pressure, to the delight of a noisy home crowd. Then full-back Furlan made the most of room out wide to cross in the corner, leaving Wales hanging on to a precarious 10-8 advantage at half-time. A similar move then saw Wales' number 15 Hywel emulate Furlan, cutting inside to score the visitors' second try five minutes after the break. Wales had their fair share of defending to do, but proved more efficient in turning pressure into points as captain Phillips crashed over from a driving maul with 10 minutes left. Wales then held out in defence for a fifth straight win under new coach Rowland Phillips, the former Wales flanker. Hywel was named woman of the match for a commanding all-round performance in attack and defence. She told BBC Wales Sport: ""First half, the Italians were putting quite a lot of pressure on us, maybe we lost our shape at some points, but we kept our composure and came back stronger in the second half. ""I feel in the second half we really showed what we can do on the pitch. It's always nice to score but it came off a good drive by the forwards and simple work to finish it off from the backs. ""We've got a lot of analysis to do and then head into training on Tuesday to concentrate on the England game. ""It's a great environment with new management - we've had the perfect build-up with four warm-ups and beating Ireland two weeks ago. It's all about confidence and thankfully we've got that massive win [and are] ready for England next week.""

Join us for live coverage of the game from Perth tomorrow. Jayden Stockley and Ryan Christie combined for Aberdeen's second goal FT: Hamilton Accies 1-1 Kilmarnock Hamilton Accies manager Martin Canningtold BBC Scotland: ""I think a point was just about right,"" he said. ""Kilmarnock started better than we did, but we changed it and I was pleased with our second-half performance. ""Kilmarnock have had a week to prepare for the game while we had a big game in midweek and so they were a little fresher than we were at the start. ""I will take a point. It is four out of six and, while I would have wanted six out of six, this is still valuable. ""This league is so tight, it only takes two or three wins in a row for people to push themselves into the top six."" FT: Inverness CT 2-2 Dundee Dundee manager Paul Hartleytalking to BBC Scotland: ""At 2-0, we looked comfortable. I was happy with how we were doing.Â ""We always thought Caley Thistle would try and come back into it with set-plays and we give away a needless penalty. After that, we still had great opportunities to kill the game off. ""Cammy Kerr had some great deliveries and it's pleasing to create so many chances, although it's frustrating to give away disappointing goals. ""The second one is a blatant penalty. Jules [Julen Etxabeguren] has to learn that is unacceptable then Scott [Bain] makes a great save.Â ""Their second goal, we should prevent. We should have seen the game out."" Here's Martin Dowden's view of that thrilling fightback by Caley Thistle against Dundee. Will it prove a significant moment as Inverness look to avoid relegation? Greg Tansey rescues a point for Inverness, who remain bottom of the Scottish Premiership despite drawing with Dundee. FT: Hibs 1-1 Ayr United Hibs manager Neil Lennontold BBC Scotland he was relieved to secure a point against Ayr and his stretched their lead at the top of the Championship. ""The first-half performance was awful and the goal we conceded was symptomatic of the way that we played,"" he said. ""The second half was a lot better, so I'm pleased we showed a bit of character to get something out of the game. It feels like we dropped a couple of points, no question. ""Our build-up play was poor, pedestrian, looked like there was a bit of panic out there at times.Â ""I don't know where that's come from, but it was a poor performance in the first half, very disjointed.Â ""In the second half we made a few changes and got the goal we deserved and on balance should probably have won the game."" FT: Inverness CT 2-2 Dundee Assistant manager Scott Kellacher was the man to speak for Caley Thistle after their draw with Dundee. ""We have to be positive,"" he told BBC Scotland in boss Richie Foran's absence.Â ""We asked the guys to be brave on the ball, pass it; and that's exactly what they did.Â ""We need to do individual jobs better, like defending balls into the box. But heads never went down. ""The boys did great to keep going, they showed commitment and desire and the fans got right behind us. You can't ask for much more. ""I thought both teams went for it and there were a lot of chances at both ends. We'll build on this and keep battling away."" Here's Richard Wilson's thoughts as Hibs slip up at home to Ayr but extend their Championship lead. Championship leaders Hibernian need a Jason Cummings header to rescue a point against second bottom Ayr United. FT: Hamilton Accies 1-1 Kilmarnock Kilmarnock manager Lee Clarkon BBC Scotland: ""The draw was probably the right result.Â ""But it's frustrating and disappointing because we were outstanding in the first half."" Here's Scott Davie's impression of Aberdeen's win over Partick Thistle. Substitutes Jayden Stockley and Ryan Christie are on target as Aberdeen beat Partick Thistle to move second in the Premiership. You can now read our match report as Rangers slip up for a second time within a few days. Rangers slip to third in the Scottish Premiership after drawing with Ross County for a third time this season. In League Two, Forfar Athletic stretched their lead at the top to 11 points with a 1-0 win away to second-top Arbroath. Barry Ferguson's Clyde slipped up again, drawing 0-0 away to Edinburgh City and are five points behind fourth-top Annan Athletic in the race for a promotion play-off spot. In League One, Airdrieonians move into second after their 4-1 thumping of Peterhead. They move above Alloa Athletic, who were held at home by leaders Livingston. At the bottom, Stranraer moved to within a point of Stenhousemuir, who drew away to Brechin City, after a fine 3-0 win over Albion Rovers. Hibs go nine points clear at the top of the Championship despite that draw at home to Ayr United. Dundee United have the chance to reduce that when they host Raith Rovers in the evening game live on BBC Alba, with the kick off at 17:15. Falkirk ended Dunfermline Athletic's 11-game unbeaten run to move above Morton in third and all but end the Pars' hopes of a promotion play-off place. St Mirren remain seven points adrift of Ayr at the foot of the table after their draw with Dumbarton. FT: Aberdeen 2-0 Partick Thistle Aberdeen manager Derek McInneson BBC Radio Scotland: ""I thought it was at times a tough afternoon. ""We have got to give credit to Partick Thistle. ""We were asked a question and we had to find a way to win and I am delighted we answered up. ""The importance of all three substitutes for the part they played in our goals."" Hibernian 1-1 Ayr United Richard WilsonBBC Scotland at Easter Road ""Hibs will feel they should have won this game, with Grant Holt's late header cleared off the line, but it was a poor day at the office for Neil Lennon's side. They were out of sorts and made difficult work of scoring the equaliser through Jason Cummings. The highlight of this game was Robbie Crawford's solo goal after just four minutes."" Aberdeen's victory over Partick Thistle, combined with Rangers' draw with Ross County, means the Dons take over in second spot in the Premiership - and they still have a game in hand. However, they are both a massive 24 points adrift of leaders Celtic, who play St Johnstone tomorrow. At the bottom, Inverness Caley Thistle remain three points behind Hamilton Accies after both were held to a draw at home.

"One of the show gardens will be located inside a 44-tonne granite cube at Chatsworth Estate and will only be visible through peepholes The first new Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) show in a decade will ""break the mould"" of Chelsea and allow ""revolutionary"" designs to take centre stage, organisers say. The show at Chatsworth, a Derbyshire stately home, will have eight ""freeform"" gardens, RHS said. ""Chelsea is a big event crammed into a small site - we'll have more freedom,"" Chatsworth's Steve Porter said. ""Predictability is being thrown out of the window,"" he added. The RHS Chatsworth Show will run from 7-11 June and up to 80,000 visitors are expected. Three new temporary pontoon bridges will be built across the River Derwent as part of the show to allow visitors to access displays on both sides. The Wordless Cupboard by Sheena Seeks is a freeform garden with a ""landslide of glacial boulders"" that will not contain any plants All three will float on the water, with one being designed in classic Palladian style with a flower display inside it. RHS spokesman Liz Patterson said artists of all genres including sculptors and visual artists will take part. One installation, called The Wordless Cupboard, has two 3-metre high cubes and a ""landslide of glacial boulders"" that are meant to evoke ""the oppression of powerlessness"". A garden designed by landscape architecture students from Leeds Beckett University called the Path of Least Resistance will include weeds and wildflowers in ""an urban wasteland"". Moveable Feast is a garden for the ""Rent Generation"" who want something that will move with them when they move from house to house. The Moveable Feast by Worcestershire-based Tanya Batkin is a pack-up-and-go garden aimed at the Rent Generation who want portability ""The sheer scale of the location, with the River Derwent running through it, allows designers to ""break the mould and do something slightly different"" Ms Patterson said. ""Our aim is to create a new show that champions the horticultural innovation of today and the future, and encourages exhibitors to be progressive and think outside the box,"" RHS director of shows Nick Mattingley added.

"This late autumn photo - from Snowdonia National Park in North Wales - has been crowned the overall winner of the 10th annual International Garden Photographer of the Year competition. Taken by Lee Acaster, and entitled Left, this stark image won the Trees, Woods and Forests category - and then beat thousands of other entries to win the top spot. Garden designer Chris Beardshaw - one ofthe competition,externaljudges - says the photo ""perfectly encapsulates both the extremes of fortune and personality of these giants"". While Clare Foggett - who edits The English Garden Magazine - says the image ""draws the viewer in, to reveal the still surface of the lake behind. It demands closer inspection"". Scroll down to see a selection of some of the best images from each category. Nigel McCall - 1st Place Autumn Evening at Aberglasney Aberglasney Gardens, Carmarthenshire, Wales, UK Judges' comments Philip Smith, founder of International Garden Photographer of the Year: ""This is a classical composition with the bridge leading us into the garden and its wonderful display of October colour. The angle of view is very precisely aligned, creating the feeling of serene calm."" Clare Foggett, Editor of the English Garden Magazine: ""It has a calm, almost Eastern zen-like quality. The autumn leaves on the handrail could have been artfully placed there by a stylist, but the fact that they had been spontaneously placed there by children visiting the garden earlier seems to add even more serendipity to the image."" Cathy Cooper - Finalist Marigold Glow Windamere Hotel, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India Volker Michael - Finalist First Rays Jistrum, Friesland, The Netherlands Rosanna Castrini - Highly Commended Towards the Clearing Botanical Garden of Villa Bricherasio, Piedmont, Italy Jason Ingram - Commended Folly Farm Lavender Berkshire, England, UK Jason Ingram - Highly Commended Stavordale Priory in Winter Somerset, England, UK Nigel McCall - Highly Commended Mist over the Lower Walled Garden Aberglasney Gardens, Carmarthenshire, Wales, UK Volker Michael - Commended Prairie Plantation Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany Ross Hoddinott - 1st Place Marbled White Butterfly Dunsdon National Nature Reserve, Devon, England, UK Judges' comments Philip Smith, founder of the International Garden Photographer of the Year: ""A dreamy midsummer scene. It is an unusual composition with the main subject near the picture's edge, but this, taken together with the empty space in the middle of the frame, heightens the faint sense of unreality that marks this photograph out."" Chris Beardshaw, garden designer: ""A fleeting and delicate image that encourages a holding of the breath and calm silence, for fear of disturbing the perfection."" Henrik Spranz - 2nd Place Evening Encounter Vienna, Austria Minghui Yuan - Finalist Frog Prince Wuhan Botanical Garden, Wuhan City, China Lili Gao - Finalist Waiting Dandong City, Liaoning Province, China Julian Rad - Finalist Thirsty Squirrel Vienna, Austria Minghui Yuan - Commended Band of Brothers Wuhan City, China Yi Fan - Highly Commended Fantastic Homeland Yunnan Province, China Mateusz Piesiak - Commended At Sunset WrocÅaw, Lower Silesia, Poland Gianluca Benini - 1st Place White Stars at Sunset Belluno, Veneto, Italy Judges' comments Clare Foggett, Editor of The English Garden Magazine: ""Wordsworth was right about daffodils filling the heart with pleasure and this photo of 'the stars that shine and twinkle on the Milky Way' does just that, with beautiful light from the setting sun. One look at the image and you want to be there."" Susan Brown, Royal Photographic Society Representative: ""White Stars at Sunset is a descriptive title for this field of wild Narcissus with the beautifully backlit sta- shaped flowers. The low viewpoint chosen by the photographer has encouraged the flowers to command the stage against a dramatic evening sky."" Yi Fan - 2nd Place Standing Alone Hengduan Mountain Range, Yunnan Province, China Salvo Orlando - 3rd Place Saponaria Etna National Park, Sicily, Italy Carole Drake - Finalist Pavement Flowers at Dawn County Clare, Republic of Ireland John Glover - Highly Commended Viper's Bugloss at Sunrise Cuckmere Valley, East Sussex, England, UK Marcio Cabral - Highly Commended Golden Grass Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, Goias, Brazil Dianne English - 1st Place Bergenia New South Wales, Australia Judges' comments Philip Smith, founder of International Garden Photographer of the Year: ""Texture and softening effects have been created in post-capture processing, but the strength of the image is in its very simple but accurate composition. In simplifying the still-life, the photographer has created a strong sense of romantic elegance."" Susan Brown, Royal Photographic Society Representative: ""This charming image of Bergenia not only illustrates the character of the flower, but the added texture and softness to the palette gives it an artistic painterly feel."" Alexis Javier Acosta Simon - 3rd Place Las Animas La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain Bert Shankman - Finalist Little Boy II Montgomery County, Maryland, USA Rosanna Castrini - Commended The Ring Piedmont, Italy Angela de Groot - Finalist Bothering Buttercups Dorset, England, UK Nigel Burkitt - Commended Poppies Earley, Berkshire, England, UK Anil Sud - 1st Place Mountain Fog Maroon Bells Scenic Area, Colorado, USA Judges' comments Susan Brown, Royal Photographic Society Representative: ""No-one could fault this image for not being true to its subject 'Breathing Spaces'. The glimpse of the mountainside in the break in the clouds has been very well caught and contrasts with the vibrant autumn colours of the foreground. A strong composition with the diagonal of the hillside."" Chris Beardshaw, garden designer: ""Bold, vivid and beautifully capturing the seasonal landscape."" Mauro Tronto - 2nd Place All Together Lago di Campotosto, Abruzzo, Italy Nikki Munro - Finalist A Midsummer Night's Dream Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, UK Theam Meng Sea - Highly Commended Tea Farm Sunset Cameron Highlands District, Pahang, Malaysia Mauro Tronto - Highly Commended Awakening San Severino Marche, Macerata, Italy Stefano Coltelli - Commended Plitvice Falls The Plitvice Lakes National Park, Plitvicka Jezera, Croatia Geoff Kell - Highly Commended Summer Breeze Northumberland National Park, England, UK Francis Taylor - Commended Cotton Grass Ringinglow, Peak District National Park, Sheffield, England, UK Dawn Blight - Commended Sheffield Park National Trust Sheffield Park and Garden, East Sussex, England, UK Evelyn Nodwell - 1st Place Bringing Home the Fodder Guizhou Province, China Judges' comments Susan Brown, Royal Photographic Society Representative: ""This anonymous person collecting fodder for his animals has a touch of humour about it. We have to assume he can see where he is going. The mountainous background with lovely soft, misty and low light adds a sense of place."" Philip Smith, founder of International Garden Photographer of the Year: ""This is a spontaneous shot that tells the story perfectly. The photographer has intuitively positioned the farmer in the frame in such a way that we can trudge along with him to the village we can see in the background."" Flavio Catalano - 2nd Place Savoy Cabbage Piedmont, Italy Mingli Tian - 3rd Place The Miao Terraces Guizhou Province, China Albert Ceolan - Finalist The Grape Harvest South Tyrol, Italy Zsolt Varanka - 1st Place Good night Budapest Budapest, Hungary Judges' comments Philip Smith, founder of International Garden Photographer of the Year: ""A clever shot. The flowers are beautifully lit and balanced with the lights of the city.

"This video can not be played The Birmingham street where Black Sabbath's sound began After several world tours spanning five decades, heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath are bringing it to a close in the city where it all began. How did Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and former member Bill Ward's upbringing in post-war, industrial Birmingham influence their unique sound - and is this really ""the end"" for the band? For a group that has been widely credited with creating the sound of heavy metal, influencing thousands of bands and inspiring generations of guitarists, it was a term Black Sabbath initially wanted to have nothing to do with. ""We called it heavy rock,"" recalls Iommi. ""The term heavy metal came about from a journalist when I came back from America (in the 70s). ""He said 'you're playing heavy metal' and I said 'no, it's heavy rock - what's that?'"" Who coined the phrase is disputed, with Rolling Stone critics Lester Bangs and Mike Saunders both credited with using it first. Throughout the 1970s, many reviewers used it as an insult - a sneering description of this new wave of ""aggressive"" musicians, their loud, thrashing sounds reverberating around packed, sweaty rooms full of fans. Ozzy: 'I'll cry at Black Sabbath finale' ""At first we didn't like being called heavy metal,"" admits Butler. ""But everyone likes to put you into certain pigeon holes, so we sort of got used to it. ""And then instead of it being derogatory, it became a whole lifestyle."" Along with Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath were credited with 'inventing' heavy metal Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, who, like Black Sabbath, formed in 1968, were also progenitors of the movement. But Sabbath are credited with inventing the distinctive riffs that characterised the sound in the early days - and that was all down to a terrible twist of fate that befell a 17-year-old Iommi at a steelworks in Aston, Birmingham. It was the last shift for the young welder at the Summer Lane factory, who was leaving to try and make his fortune as a professional musician. As he went to cut a piece of metal, the guillotine came crashing down on his right hand, slicing off the tips of his middle and right fingers. ""I was told 'you'll never play again',"" says the lead guitarist. ""It was just unbelievable. I sat in the hospital with my hand in this bag and I thought 'that's it - I'm finished'. ""But eventually I thought 'I'm not going to accept that. There must be a way I can play'."" He went home and fashioned new fingertips out of an old Fairy Liquid bottle - ""melted it down, got a hot soldering iron and shaped it like a finger"" - and cut sections from a leather jacket to cover his new homemade prosthetic. ""It helped to make me play a different style because I couldn't play the conventional way - I couldn't play the proper chords like I could before the accident, so I had to come up with a different way of making a bigger sound."" A 17-year-old Iommi fashioned his own prosthetic fingertips to enable him to carry on playing the guitar - the prosthetics he uses today were crafted by professionals ""Tony's an incredible guy,"" says Osbourne. ""He not only played again, he invented a new sound. I often say to him, 'how do you know when you're touching the strings?' - and he says 'I just do it'."" The bleak, factory-laden streets of Aston, where Osbourne, Iommi, Butler and Ward grew up just a few roads apart, also had an impact on Sabbath's haunting sound and ominous lyrics. The working-class suburb hadn't benefitted from post-war regeneration in the way Birmingham city centre had, just a couple of miles away. Iommi and Butler worked in factories after leaving school, Ward delivered coal and Osbourne, after stints in a slaughterhouse and car plant, turned his hand to burglary. Music was an escape for the teenagers. ""It wasn't a great place to be at that time,"" recalls Butler. ""We were listening to songs about San Francisco, the hippies were all love and peace and everything. Within two years of forming their band in Aston, Birmingham, in 1968, Black Sabbath were touring America ""There we were, in Aston, Ozzy was in prison from burgling houses, me and Tony were always in fights with somebody, and Bill, so we had quite a rough upbringing. ""Our music reflected the way we felt."" It was the chance sighting of a small, oddly-written note in a Birmingham music shop - 'Ozzy Zig needs a gig' - that brought the four together. It was spotted by Iommi and Ward, who were looking for a singer after leaving ""a band people could fight to"". ""I knew Ozzy from school, Birchfield Road in Perry Barr, and I didn't know he used to sing,"" remembers Iommi. ""His mum came to the door and we said we were answering the advert, and she said 'John, it's for you'. The musicians all lived a few streets away from each other in Aston - Osbourne and Iommi used to attend the same school Ozzy Osbourne said the band ""had to finish in Birmingham"" where it all began ""I saw him walking up the hallway and I said to Bill, 'forget it'. We talked for a bit and then we left. ""I said, 'I don't think he can sing, I know him from school'."" A few days later, Osbourne and Butler went round to the Iommi family's grocery shop in Aston, saying they were looking for a drummer. ""Bill was with me but he said 'I'm not going to do anything without you',"" says Iommi. ""So we said let's give it a go - the four of us."" ""I have been out of Black Sabbath longer than I've been in,"" says Ozzy Osbourne Tony Iommi's much-publicised battle with cancer is among the reasons the band has finally decided to stop touring Calling themselves Earth, they started out playing blues, before turning their attention to writing their own material. Butler recalls: ""It was always the hippy, happy stuff on the radio and there were we, in Aston, having to go to work in factories. ""We wanted to put how we thought about the world at the time. We didn't want to write happy pop songs. We gave that industrial feeling to it."" And it was Butler and Iommi's love of horror films that gave the group its signature, stirring sound. ""We wanted to create a vibe like you get off horror films - try and create a tension within the music,"" says Iommi. ""We thought it would be really good to get this sort of vibe, this fear and excitement. ""It was a struggle. There was nothing like what we were doing. We'd taken on something because we believed in it, and loved what we were doing."" Black Sabbath have had many line-ups over the years, with Tony Iommi the only constant presence Following a mix-up with another band called Earth, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath, after the title track that took its moniker from a 1963 horror film by Boris Karloff. And within just two years, they were flying to the US to perform to an emerging, global fan base at the start of a career that would span the next 50 years. Over 70 million records, several line-up changes - Iommi has been the only constant presence - and one headless bat later, the band has decided to call time on touring, performing the last gig on their exhausting 81-date ""The End"" tour in their home city. Iommi's much-documented cancer battle and the musicians' advancing years - Osbourne and Iommi are 68 and Butler is 67 - contributed to the decision to slow down. All three founding members speak with a mixture of pride, excitement and sadness when talking about performing in their beloved Birmingham. ""We've toured everywhere else in the world but there's nowhere like Birmingham,"" says Butler. Geezer Butler said the band ""came from nothing"", growing up on the streets of Aston, Birmingham ""It's still the only place where I get nervous before I go on. It means the world to me. It's where our hearts are."" ""It's where we started,"" adds Osbourne. ""The old road has gone back to Birmingham. ""I don't live there any more but most of my family live there. We started in Birmingham so why not finish in Birmingham?"" But, like many bands before them who have announced ""the end"" before being enticed back on stage with lucrative deals, should we actually expect to see Sabbath back together again one day? Iommi's certainly keen. ""We're not saying goodbye as such, as in we're never going to do it again, [but] we don't want to do any more world tours,"" he says. ""I wouldn't rule out doing a one-off show. Or even an album. I think the door's open."" Osbourne, however, is resolute. ""As far as I am concerned, this is the end,"" he insists. ""I have been out of Black Sabbath longer than I've been in. We've all had different arguments and fallings out. ""I don't know about them but I'm not doing it again. We want to end on a high note.""

"Marco Hauenstein as a baby with his birth mother A man who launched an online search for his missing birth mother discovered she died years ago in Germany -  but bureaucratic errors led to the family never being informed. Gina Hauenstein, who came from a small village in northern Switzerland, had been listed as officially missing since 2000. In January this year her son Marco, who spent his childhood with foster parents in another part of the country, posted a Facebook appeal for information about the mother he last saw as an infant. His story captured attention across Europe, prompting new enquiries - until Swiss police confirmed that the remains of Gina Hauenstein had actually been found just across the border in Germany in 2013. Marco did not have an easy start in life. He knew very little about his birth family, but he did know that his mother had been a drug addict, and is believed to have spent time during the 1990s in Zurich's then-notorious Platzspitz drugs scene, where addicts bought heroin in a city centre park and injected it openly. Marco Hauenstein's search drew mass media attention When Marco was born in 1997, he was already addicted, and had to spend the first months of his life in hospital withdrawing and recovering. Although his mother visited him from time to time, he never lived with her, and when Marco was just three, she disappeared. Although Marco describes his childhood with foster parents as happy, he says questions about his birth family were ""always on my mind"". His search first started when he was around 16, and he began by asking local town councils in the region of Switzerland his mother had come from. He also made enquiries with the police. No information was forthcoming. Police told him that despite a search both within Switzerland and across Europe, no trace of her had ever been found. Gina Hauenstein had been missing since 2000 Only when an appeal Marco made on Facebook began to attract attention - it was shared thousands of times in just a few days - did Swiss police look again at their records. They discovered that in 2013 they had been contacted by German police, with news that human bones had been found in a village just across the border from Gina Hauenstein's home town in Switzerland. The results of a forensic examination by Swiss investigators confirmed the bones were Gina's. Local police in her home town were informed in 2015, but inexplicably that information never reached either Gina's family or the German authorities investigating the remains. This week, Swiss police visited Marco and broke the news, apologising for a mistake they admit should never have happened. Marco's social media feeds were saturated with messages during the search Marco, who patiently gave many interviews when he first launched his Facebook appeal just four weeks ago, is now taking time for himself to digest the news. He has not posted on Facebook since January. While not quite the happy end he had hoped for, there was at least one positive development. ""Danke! Thank you! Merci!"" he wrote. ""Thanks to your help, on 20 January, I was able to meet my uncle and my grandmother for the first time. It was a very emotional moment. ""At last, I have part of my family back.""

"Lady Gaga says her Super Bowl performance will span her entire career Lady Gaga is leading the pitch invasion at Sunday's Super Bowl, where she'll perform the all-important half-time show. With a television audience of 110 million, it's one of the biggest platforms in the world - and Gaga has been putting in the hours to ensure her set is suitably spectacular. ""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" How to follow Sunday's Super Bowl on the BBC Tom Brady, Lady Gaga and Tea - Super Bowl LI What to expect from Gaga's Super Bowl show She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds.Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. Sheonly performed one song,external, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year. You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX. She raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic. For the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers. 1987's show was altogether more bizarre. A magician named ""Elvis Presto"" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics. At the culmination of the show, the ""Prince of Prestidigitation"" performed an interactive magic trick (""pick a card, concentrate real hard"") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses. It was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach. She arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous ""left shark"". He was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves. It quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star. And when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend. Poor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob. Few ever believed that the ""wardrobe malfunction"" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press). Nonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered. But there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online. In response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.

"Wales players celebrate against Belgium The story of Wales' remarkable journey to the semi-final of Euro 2016 is to be released in cinemas. Don't Take Me Home follows how Wales ended a 58-year wait to reach a major tournament and surpassed expectations in France. Chris Coleman's team topped their group and beat Belgium on their way to the last four before losing to Portugal. The film is out in UK cinemas on 3 March but there will be previews around Wales on St David's Day. In his first interview about the movie, film-maker Jonny Owen told the BBC's Good Evening Wales programme: ""The biggest part for me, and one of the biggest parts of the film, was that we'd finally made a major tournament for the first time in nearly 60 years and, when we found our place in the sun, boy did we revel in it. ""I think everybody would want Wales in a major tournament from now on because the way we were was just exemplary all round."" Fans cheer in the Parc de Prince stadium Mr Owen said the FAW brought him in after the Wales team watched his film about Nottingham Forest - I believe in Miracles - while in France. And he added that he had only managed to keep it a secret because he was living in Nottingham. ""If I'd been living in Wales and had a few pints with the boys, I might have been more loose-lipped,"" he said. ""Full credit to the FAW, they kept their nerve and didn't say anything when they could have and they wanted it to be a big surprise."" He said he had interviewed all the players who started games, so it is their narrative in the film. Gareth Bale celebrates victory with his daughter Alba Viola And he said the glossy film footage is interspersed with lots of mobile phone footage, showing the fans' journey as well as that of the players. He said he had been told watching the film was an emotional experience. ""I do mention the passing of Gary Speed at the top because one thing about this team was they were young men, or young boys in many cases, when Gary passed. ""What they've achieved since is very emotional when you think of where they've come from."" Hero's welcome for Wales football team 'Party' on streets despite Euros loss.

"Iran is ""on notice"" after a missile test, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn says, but didn't specify what US ramifications would be Within days of an Iranian missile test and a subsequent warning from the Trump administration, the US has now followed up by imposing a new round of economic sanctions. The sanctions focus upon suppliers to Iran's missile programme and groups that help to arm what Washington sees as terror organisations in the region. It is hard to see what practical impact these sanctions will have, since few of these organisations or individuals probably do business in the United States. But the sanctions sends a clear warning to Tehran the guard has changed in Washington. The Obama administration saw its relationship with Iran largely through the prism of the need to negotiate a deal to constrain Tehran's nuclear programme. Iran's regional activities - support for Hamas and Hezbollah, military support for the Assad regime, backing of the Houthis in Yemen, and its growing influence in Iraq  - were all played down to ensure that the nuclear deal might go ahead. For the Obama team, restraining Iran's nuclear activities was the overarching goal. This was seen as an end in itself, one that might stave off military action, but also a step that might, over time, also lead Iran away from its relative economic isolation towards an improved relationship with the West. Opinion was deeply divided on the nuclear deal. The US and its major western allies, along with Russia, saw merit in the nuclear agreement that effectively ""kicked the can down the road"", postponing any confrontation with Tehran over its nuclear programme. Negotiating the Iran nuclear deal Washington's regional allies though - countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, who have watched Tehran's rise with alarm - were much less impressed. And many of them may well have been hoping that the Trump team - which includes several vocal opponents of Tehran - might seek to undo the agreement. Things are a little more complex than that. On a recent trip to Israel's major annual security conference last week, many experts and officials there took the view that a bad deal, if properly implemented, might be better than no deal at all. What worries Israelis is the fact that Iran is now becoming a major player in the region. Its support for the Assad regime in Syria and the deployment of its allies - Hezbollah and various Shia militias, supported by officers from its Revolutionary Guard Corps - has provided Tehran with at least the opportunity to establish its allies on a long border with Israel from the Mediterranean Sea through Lebanon and Syria - all the way to the Jordanian frontier. Jordan too is concerned, as are several of the Gulf states, which explains their quiet strategic rapprochement with Israel. The irony in all of this is that it was largely US military power that established the conditions for Iran's rise to regional prominence. By deposing its archenemy Saddam Hussein and reducing Iraq to a minor military player with many other security problems on its plate - Washington opened the door to the expansion of Iranian influence in the region. Iraqi boys walk near the University of Mosul after its liberation from IS A further irony is that in supporting the Iraqi government's efforts against so-called Islamic State, the US is objectively allied with Tehran, with several Iranian-influenced Shia militias fighting in the same campaign. The Obama administration's failure to countenance the forced removal of Syria's President Assad and its inept and half-hearted efforts to arm and train Sunni forces there, again favoured the emerging Shia axis. So the Trump administration comes to office with a desire fundamentally to change Washington's stance towards Tehran. These sanctions are but the first step. A declaration that Iran is now ""on notice"", in the words of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, may sound good, but it doesn't amount to a policy. What real steps does the Trump team envisage? Is it ready to back - albeit reluctantly - the nuclear accord while monitoring stringently Iran's behaviour? What wider international support can the US gather for tougher action against Tehran's missile programme - which it insists it is entitled to pursue? On the face of it here the US may have a point. UN Security council resolution 2231 calls on Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon. A US National Security Council briefing earlier this week noted that ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering a payload of at least 500kg to a range of 300km are inherently able to deliver nuclear weapons. ""There should be no doubt,"" the briefing went on , ""that the United States is committed to holding Iran accountable for adhering to missile restrictions and accountable for behaviour in the region that we consider to be destabilising."" But what exactly does the Trump Administration mean by phrases like ""holding Iran to account""? These are two countries whose warships potentially come into close proximity in Gulf waters every day. Tensions could spark a major confrontation. Is Washington on a collision course with Tehran? Its rhetoric might suggest so. But it is President Trump's actions - and of course Iran's own responses - that will determine where things go from here.

"Donald Trump (R) met technology leaders when he was president-elect California is a bubble. A rich, liberal, free-loving bubble. It also just so happens to be the sixth largest economy in the world and home to the most influential, profitable and powerful companies on earth. If the bubble bursts, or even just contracts a little, the whole country suffers - including President Donald Trump and his supporters. California is a so-called âdonorâ state, meaning it simply pays more into the US Treasury than it gets out. So when President Trump talks about making deals, heâll know full well that in California he faces formidable bargaining chips he canât ignore. He may even be on the back foot. And that may be one of the reasons why we saw a peculiar thing happen on Friday. Uber boss Travis Kalanick decided not to turn up to President Trumpâs economic advisory panel, and the president said... nothing. He didnât call the company âfailingâ or âonce greatâ or âweakâ or any of those words heâs typically thrown around when he feels personally slighted. In fact, aside from a few pre-election skirmishes with Apple, President Trump has been relatively ambivalent towards tech firms, and thereâs a very good theory as to why - he really needs them. Travis Kalanick put Uber's reputation ahead of the value the company might get from a meeting with the president And they need him too, of course. Under President Trump, Silicon Valley is holding out for a lower corporate tax rate - âwhich could bring billions back into the US, a win-win for both sides. But thereâs a snag in this arrangement. For the most part, the workers at these companies are outraged, seething at the prospect of their bosses even sitting at the same table as the new president. Thatâs why we saw 2,000 Google employees across the world leave their desks on Monday to demonstrate against the immigration ban. Itâs why Amazonâs own employees are calling on the company tostop advertising on right-wing news website Breitbart,external. Itâs why Uberâs staff wrote a lengthy âLetter to Travisâ, informing their boss about how unpopular his involvement with President Trump was among the ranks. It worked. âJoining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,â Mr Kalanick told staff in a memo announcing he was stepping down. The tone was understanding, but a little frustrated. Would it not be better to at least have a seat at the table? Uberâs staff didnât see it that way. Mr Kalanick bemoaned what he called a âperception-reality gapâ. Although he said he didnât support President Trumpâs immigration policy, people thought he did. And thatâs what mattered most. He put Uberâs reputation ahead of the value Uber might get from a meeting with the president. He may have been extra-sensitive after a long week. Last Saturday,a misjudged tweetcaused a reported 200,000 Uber users to delete their accounts - so many, in fact, the company had to create a special tool to automate the process. Uberâs explanation that it was all a big misunderstanding has merit, but the furore, justified or not, underlined the fine line tech companies tread with their users. The firms have until now acted in ways that were âgood for businessâ, but now they are being forced to consider what is simply âgoodâ. One minute you can be helping the people of San Francisco get around, the next those same people are protesting outside your headquarters. Another company tip-toeing along is Twitter, buoyed by its role as the mouthpiece for the most important man in the world, but cowed by what that man chooses to share. It has faced calls toban President Trump from the site,externalon account of some feeling he has breached the networkâs rules on hate speech and harassment. It of course hasnât done that - and to be fair, the demand didnât gain significant traction, even amongst Trumpâs opponents. But Twitterâs employees, nervous about their role as President Trumpâs megaphone, contributed a combined $1m (Â£800,775) to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The ACLU has been the benefactor of choice for companies that have one eye on public perception. Many are dealing with what can be plainly described as the âPeter Thiel problemâ. Mr Thiel, an investor with an arguably unrivalled track record, has his fingers in almost every significant pie around here. And, uncomfortably for many, he also has the ear of the president, of whom he is an outspoken supporter. When Facebookâs chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg chose not to make a public statement on the Womenâs March two weeks ago, people jumped to various conclusions, most of which inevitably led to the hand of Mr Thiel - who sits on Facebookâs board. This comes despite any evidence Mr Thiel is calling any kind of shots on Facebookâs political position. Support for President Trump in California is harder to come by than in other parts of the US Meanwhile, well-regarded start-up accelerator Y Combinator is also feeling pressure thanks to its links with Mr Thiel. The companyâs president Sam Altman said he wouldnât sever ties with the investor. The programme has said it will take on the ACLU as one of its cohorts, offering mentorship on digital projects. It seems for now the rank-and-file of Silicon Valley see advising President Trump as indistinguishable from supporting him. Technology companies are perhaps paying for years of hyperbolic statements about changing the world, in a place where a minor software update gets people âsuper excitedâ. One thing that has struck me about staff at these huge companies is the infectious, passionate loyalty. It exists because those employees believe the company stands for the same issues they do. Any wavering creates shockwaves. The atmosphere may get less toxic as the presidency continues, but it leaves bosses extremely hesitant to get around President Trumpâs table.

"This video can not be played ""I remember... looking at Roger Dodds with his big bunch of keys, locking the door, and that was horrifying"", one victim said Predatory sex offender Roger Dodds was left free to abuse his victims by Sheffield City Council despite bosses having known about his offending for years, BBC News has found. Dodds, who was jailed earlier for 16 years after pleading guilty to four counts of indecent assault, was allowed to operate as an employee of the council ""without sufficient challenge, accountability or consequences"", a council-commissioned report found. Council officials not only knew about his behaviour, but also failed to report his activities to police and gave him early retirement with an enhanced pension. Kenny Dale, who was abused by Dodds in the early 1990s and has waived his right to anonymity, said: ""I was the victim of a horrible man and the council are to blame for that."" Sheffield City Council said it ""accepted responsibility"" and was ""deeply sorry"" Dodds had been allowed to commit these offences while in its employment. Dodds abused at least one man while heading up the council's Grants and Awards Department Dodds, now 81, was employed in 1975 to head the council's Grants and Awards Department. The unit was responsible for providing financial support to students attending college or university. However, Dodds used his position to sexually abuse young men, typically in their late teens. One victim, who did not want to be named, said he was assaulted during their very first meeting. He told the BBC: ""Dodds was asking me things about my studies, and, very gradually, his left hand started to feel its way into my right jeans pocket. When that started to happen, I just became frozen and unable to move."" According to former colleagues, Dodds was part of a club that operated within the council swapping hardcore pornographic magazines in internal envelopes and screening adult films in a basement room. He was first investigated by Sheffield City Council in the early 1980s after a series of allegations were made against him. The complaints gave one employee the courage to tell managers about the abuse he had been subjected to. Richard Rowe said he grew to fear turning up for work as a result of his abuse at the hands of Dodds Richard Rowe, who has also waived his legal right to anonymity, said he was subjected to ""terrifying"" assaults over an 18-month period. However, he said when he told bosses what was happening, he was told to stay quiet. ""They asked for specifics and I gave them as much details as I could bring myself to voice. But they knew, they knew exactly,"" he said. ""At the end of the interview it was, 'there is nothing more to tell us, so go back to the office and you do not speak about this inside or outside the building'.  I clearly remember that warning."" Following the investigation, Dodds was moved to a position working with schools. An investigation carried out for Sheffield City Council, and seen by the BBC, said he was given ""substantial unregulated and unsupervised access to schools"". The report continues that ""there appears to have been no disciplinary consequences to his behaviour at the time"". Nor was his transfer a chastening experience for Dodds. Kenny Dale said he blamed the council for failing to stop Dodds Mr Dale began working at the council in the early 1990s and, despite warnings from colleagues, applied for a post working alongside Dodds. ""Everyone told me not to go for it,"" he said, ""[but] I didn't think that kind of behaviour would be allowed"". He said Dodds began touching him inappropriately almost immediately and continued to do so despite his objections and the lack of challenge from managers. Another investigation by the local authority was launched and in 1993 Roger Dodds left the council. However, despite Mr Dale's insistence Dodds should not be given a payoff, he was given an early retirement package that included an enhanced pension. Mr Dale said he blames the council for the abuse he suffered. ""The council are so responsible, more responsible than he was,"" he said. Roger Dodds was the subject of two internal investigations while working for Sheffield City Council Following the second internal investigation officials concluded a criminal investigation should have been launched. In 2008, one of Dodds' victims went to South Yorkshire Police with his allegations. However, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to prosecute at the time - a CPS spokesman said its files did not contain details on why that decision was taken. Dodds was eventually charged in 2016 after another complainant came forward in 2014. The police investigation prompted the council to commission consultants to investigate how it had handled Dodds. The 2008 review concluded: ""It was clearly wrong that Dodds should receive early retirement. He was not subject to any official sanction by the council for his alleged behaviour."" The 28-page dossier also revealed repeated failures by the council, describing the authority's action as clearly unacceptable not just by present-day standards but by the policies and legislation in place at the time. It conceded the council did not know how many other victims there might be. Its conclusion was damning, stating: ""The actions of Roger Dodds have caused enormous distress to his victims, and the city council has been complicit in allowing Dodds to operate apparently without sufficient challenge, accountability or consequences.""

"Ciaran Maxwell was set upon and beaten unconscious as a teenager in Larne A Royal Marine Commando from Northern Ireland has pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism linked to dissident republicanism. Ciaran Maxwell's case raises alarming questions of how he was able to penetrate the ranks of an elite British military unit and smuggle out arms. In the early hours of a morning back in June 2002, Maxwell, then 16, was walking from his home in Larne towards the Seacourt estate, which sits on a hill overlooking the port. What happened next left the Catholic teenager ""angry and traumatised"", according to someone in the nationalist community who knew him. Maxwell was struck by a bottle, fell to the ground and was set upon and beaten unconscious by a gang of loyalists armed with golf clubs and iron bars. The unprovoked attack featured in the republican newspaper An Phoblacht, which claimed that an Army patrol arrived at the scene but did not intervene. That cannot be substantiated, though amid escalating tension in the town, soldiers were back on the streets to support the police who dealt with nearly 300 sectarian incidents between April 2001 and March 2004. Ciaran Maxwell pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism A security source we spoke to recalled shootings, houses being burnt out and regular beatings. This was the environment in which Maxwell - described as a ""quiet republican"" - became an adult. Several residents in his home town said the mental scars of his beating never fully healed, leaving a vulnerability that others would later exploit. The failure of police to prosecute anyone for the assault may also have caused him bitterness. Eight years later the adventure-loving, physically fit Maxwell began the gruelling 32-week training to become a Royal Marine, writing online: ""Pain is temporary, the Green Beret is forever."" Explosive ingredients were found buried in blue barrels In May 2011 his mother expressed her pride ahead of attending his passing out parade in England. But all was not as it seemed. One of the men who completed training with Maxwell, and does not want to be identified, told the BBC: ""He was a strange character, very reserved, didn't join in with the banter."" He described him as ""shifty"" and unwilling to form close relationships with others in the unit. Before he had even completed his training, court papers show that Maxwell began ""assisting another to commit an act of terrorism"" although it is not clear which individual or group he was working with. He was not the only young man from Larne being drawn into the orbit of dissident republicanism. A friend from the Seacourt estate was jailed in 2014 after pleading guilty to possession of explosives with intent to endanger life. Niall Lehd had buried chemicals, a pipe bomb and a deactivated submachine gun in blue barrels in a field. By 2016, despite having become a father, Maxwell had begun burying his own blue barrels full of explosive ingredients during visits to see family in Larne. Some of the ammunition discovered In a country park, he stockpiled chemicals which he bought online, timer units and improvised detonators. Even more alarmingly, in a remote forest he hid a handgun, ammunition, pipe bombs and Claymore anti-personnel mines he had stolen from the British military. His behaviour was becoming increasingly reckless as he built more hides in the woods near his home in Devon where he also stashed cannabis he planned to sell in Larne. In his work locker were bank card details stolen from fellow Marines to carry out fraud and handwritten notes on tactics used by terrorist groups. But his plans unravelled when police uncovered the hides in Northern Ireland in one of the most significant arms finds of recent years. Detectives traced the serial numbers on the mines across the Irish Sea to 40 Commando, the Royal Marine unit based near Taunton where Ciaran Maxwell had been quietly building a career. They also found his DNA on some of the material found in the woods. Maxwell had endured so much to get the green beret only to trade it for terrorism. Was his a long-planned infiltration or was he dragged back by others to a past he thought he had escaped? In his hometown few are willing to talk on the record about his case. Larne is much calmer these days but the occasional street mural and flag hint at the continuing presence of loyalist paramilitary groups such as the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association. There are concerns that dissident republicans are becoming more active in parts of Northern Ireland. Last month a police officer was shot and injured in north Belfast. Although Maxwell had links to dissident republicans, it is not known how extensive they were. A security source told the BBC that he was ""operating as a bit of a lone wolf."" Sammy Wilson, Democratic Unionist MP for East Antrim, said: ""There has always been a dissident group which has been operating around Larne engaged in firebombing, that kind of activity, and it's been known that they have been trying to move into the area and recruit."" Mr Wilson is concerned that Ciaran Maxwell was able to sneak munitions out of his base and evade detection for so long. He said: ""Where it is clear that someone is vulnerable either to coercion or may well have sympathies to aid and abet terrorist groups because of their background, perhaps we should give special attention to them when they come back to their own community."" The BBC asked the Ministry of Defence about its security vetting procedures for Royal Marines but received no response. The criminal case against Ciaran Maxwell was overwhelming, paving the way for today's guilty plea. What is much less clear is exactly why he turned to terrorism, although his actions offer a stark reminder of the dark forces that still threaten stability in Northern Ireland.

"Our bathrooms are filled with shampoo bottles, toilet rolls and cleaning products which could easily be put into our recycling bins when finished with. Yet research shows our green intentions are washed away as soon as we step near a toilet. Now a business group has come up with an idea for how to combat this problem - two bathroom bins. The Circular Economy Taskforce, who were brought together by Prince Charles's Business in the Community environment charity, says it could boost recycling. So should two bins really sit alongside your stack of loo roll in the bathroom? Why should people have two bins in their bathrooms? ""It's trying to address the problem that people are less likely to recycle packaging for things we use in our bathrooms than for things we use in other rooms of the house,"" says Jonny Hazell, senior policy adviser for environmental think tank Green Alliance. The Recycle Now campaign points to its statistics, which show that while 90% of packaging is recycled in our kitchens, only 50% is being recycled in the bathroom. ""Often homes have one central recycling bin located in the kitchen, so when in the shower or washing your face it can be tricky to remember to transfer it to that bin,"" it says. ""This is why having a recycling bin or bag in the bathroom might be useful, if there is space."" Business in the Community says two bins could make it easier to separate out the plastics that can be recycled. ""But it doesn't have to be a bin, it could be as simple as a bag on the door handle that you bring down to the kitchen every week,"" it added. Where has this idea come from? While recycling has grown from 12% to 45% in the UK over the last decade, campaigners say the bathroom is an area that needs more focus. The Circular Economy Taskforce came up with the idea as part of its work looking at practical collaborative ways to boost recycling and re-use rates. ""The bathroom is one of the areas that has come up time and time again in the group as somewhere where both business and consumers can make a difference to help us all reduce our impact on the environment,"" says Business in the Community. ""Thinking about how different types of bins could boost recycling in the bathroom is just one example of a potential simple solution that could have a big impact."" Why are people failing to recycle their bathroom products? Campaigners believes it comes down not just to where a recycling bin is located but also to confusion over what can be recycled. Recycle Now says: ""There can also be confusion about what can or can't be recycled with bathroom products. ""For example many people don't realise that bleach bottles can be easily recycled - simply make sure it's empty and put the lid back on. ""Recycling just one bleach bottle saves enough energy to power a street light for 6.5 hours, so the value quickly adds up."" Research from the University of Exeter,externalalso found that people who threw away waste in the bathroom saw it as being ""dirty"" and were less likely to recycle it. Going through your bathroom bin to separate out what can and can't be recycled can seem off-putting,"" says Business in the Community. It added: ""There is also a lot of confusion around what can be recycled in the bathroom, for example many consumers are confused by aerosols."" How much recyclable waste comes from a bathroom? A surprising amount. Typical products include: Plastic shampoo, conditioner and shower gel bottles, plastic moisturiser bottles (such as for hand cream and body lotion), glass face cream pots (plus the cardboard packaging they come in), perfume and aftershave bottles, aerosols for deodorant, air freshener and shaving foam, bleach and bathroom cleaner bottles, toothpaste boxes and toilet roll tubes. Is a lack of recycling in bathrooms a real problem? Every little helps, is the message from environmental and recycling groups. ""In general, the less we recycle, the more water and energy we need to use to produce the materials we use in our daily lives,"" said Mr Hazell. Recycle Now says recycling reduces the amount we are sending to landfill and makes use of resources already available rather than making them from scratch. ""Ultimately this means reduced levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere which contribute to climate change,"" it added. ""For instance it takes 75% less energy to make a plastic shampoo bottle from recycled plastic compared with using virgin materials."" Can two bins have a meaningful impact on recycling overall? ""Ensuring you recycle in the bathroom can make a big difference,"" says Recycle Now. ""It would save Â£135,000 in landfill costs if every UK household threw their next empty shampoo bottles into the recycling bin. ""On top of this, if everyone recycled one more toilet roll tube it would save enough cardboard inner tubes from landfill to go round the M25 38 times."" But what if you don't have the space for two bins? There are other options. Hang a reusable bag on the bathroom door so you can transfer your recyclable items straight into the recycling bin. Or opt for a bin with split compartments which can be used to separate recyclable and non-recyclable items. UK recycling figure drops for first time Are you rubbish at recycling?

"Kale is used as an alternative to iceberg lettuce in Riverford's Caesar salad Some supermarkets are rationing iceberg lettuces, with experts warning it could be the, er, tip of the iceberg. Bad weather in Europe has already caused a#courgette crisis, alongside a shortage of broccoli, tomatoes, salad peppers and aubergines. Withvegetable shortagesexpected to continue until April, what alternatives are there for shoppers? During the UK's winter months of December, January and February, UK farmers produce beetroot, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celeriac, chicory, fennel, Jerusalem artichokes, kale, leeks, parsnips, potatoes, red cabbage, swede and turnips. We've become a ""slightly strange group"", expecting all-year-round produce, according to Lord Haskins, the former chairman of Northern Foods, which supplies Tesco. Riverford founder Guy Watson with the January King cabbage ""Thirty years ago you'd never have worried about buying lettuce in the middle of the winter - lettuces were things that grew in the summer and you ate them in the summer - you ate cauliflowers and Brussels sprouts in the winter,"" he says. Why is there a vegetable shortage? As for courgettes, they are actually ""very, very out of season"", says organic vegetable retailer Riverford.  We have just got used to supermarkets supplying them all year round. Eating British produce that's in season is often cheaper, as it is produced locally - and it can be healthier too. According to food industry campaign group Love British Food, fruit and vegetables that are in season contain the nutrients, minerals and trace elements that our bodies need at particular times of year. Apples, for example, are packed with vitamin C to boost our resistance to winter colds. Beetroot is ""terrific in soups"" says Alexia Robinson from Love British Food The group's Alexia Robinson recommends beetroot, kale, cabbages, broccoli and traditional root vegetables for their health-giving properties. Riverford says a slaw made with cabbage, beetroot or swede will offer ""10 times more nutrients"" than an iceberg lettuce - which it says aren't known for their nutritional value. If you are really keen on iceberg lettuces, you can probably pay a bit more for one from Peru or South Africa, says Lord Haskins. But imported vegetables can clock up a lot of air miles before they land on your plate - making them worse for the environment. Hatty Richards, from the Community Farm in Chew Magna, Somerset, says buying local is better. ""We have such a range on our doorsteps already, it's fresher, it's really good for the environment - it reduces air miles - and it supports local business which is crucial."" Lord Haskins agrees, and suggests your tastebuds may also be grateful: ""We all buy stuff from far parts. They don't taste nearly as good: strawberries at this time of year from Egypt don't taste anything like as good as a British strawberry in May, June, July."" Kale is a hardy winter leaf that can withstand frosty weather A leafy salad is nice - but there are plenty of alternative dishes to try. Riverford's Guy Watson thinks the UK's more bitter winter salad leaves and root vegetables can provide ""a far superior substitute"" which will easily make up for a lack of lettuce. Vibrant winter coleslaws and cauliflower salads ""bring British veg to life"", he says, adding that one of the Riverford Field Kitchen's most popular winter dishes is a kale caesar salad. Kale, which was originally used to feed cows, is a robust, hardy winder leaf that can withstand frosty weather. It can also be used in soups, stews, stir fries, gratins or just wilted with butter. Ms Robinson suggests embracing winter comfort food with a ""good old fashioned winter stew with plenty of root vegetables with tender meat"". If you're still not convinced you can do without leafy salads, try growing your own. Those who do want to eat lettuce need not despair. According to the campaign group Eat Seasonably, lettuce, rocket and other crunchy salad leaves are some of the easiest things to grow at home, all year around - on a seed tray indoors, on your window sill or in the garden. Spinach is easily grown, even in window boxes, says Ms Robinson Ms Robinson says: ""As well as the cress there are many great veg that can be easily grown in window boxes such as leaf lettuce, radishes, spinach, green onions and of course a good selection of herbs."" Another easy win is beetroot, Eat Seasonably says, which can be grown in a big pot. Though beetroot is harvested in October, Riverford says it can last up to four months if it's kept in a cold storage. ""Carrots are not too hard to grow either,"" Riverford's Emily Muddeman said, ""Leeks, kale - you could plant just four or five stalks of kale and it will go on sprouting."" Any budding gardeners could start with planting onions later this month - Eat Seasonably says they are ""not even slightly difficult to grow"".

"Tara Reid and Ian Ziering have been ever present in the Sharknado series Sharknado fans rejoiced this weekat the news,externalthat the Syfy channel is pressing ahead with a fifth instalment in the trashy disaster franchise. Directed as ever by Anthony C Ferrante, Sharknado 5 will see returning stars Ian Ziering and Tara Reid travel to London to avert a global shark tornado. Since it began in 2013, the TV movie series has been met with glee by viewers - and derision by critics. Here are five critically-panned movies that audiences have grown to love. Often cited as the worst movie ever made, Tommy Wiseau's self-financed opus came and went in 2003 but has since developed an enthusiastic fan following. Audiences at special screenings regularly congregate to yell abuse, recite lines from the script in unison and throw plastic spoons at the screen (don't ask!) Tommy Wiseau wrote, directed and produced the film and also played the lead role Wiseau, who also appeared in the film, has taken this in good humour, appearing at screenings to take questions and even taking part in a live reading of his script. He's since reteamed with co-star Greg Sestero for a new film called Best F(r)iends, while James Franco has made a film about The Room's production, entitled The Masterpiece. Read more about The Room from BBC Culture. Made for less than $10,000 (Â£8,000), this ultra low-budget attempt to replicate Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds on a shoestring had audiences flocking to revel in its awfulness. James Nguyen's film was particularly derided for its special effects, which consisted mainly of shoddy CGI eagles interacting unconvincingly with the film's cast of unknowns. US distribution company Severin Films saw potential in its ineptitude and took the film on a ""Birdemic experience tour"" that included a visit to London in 2010. Not to be deterred, Nguyen released a sequel, Birdemic 2: The Resurrection, in 2013 and has plans to round out the franchise with Birdemic 3: Sea Eagle. Paul Verhoeven with Showgirls stars Gina Gershon and Elizabeth Berkley in 1995 Riding high on the success of Basic Instinct, Dutch director Paul Verhoeven reteamed with writer Joe Eszterhas for this torrid tale about a Las Vegas dancer stripping her way to stardom. Their labours were met with derision by the critics, who poured scorn on the script, Elizabeth Berkley's lead performance and one particularly ill-judged swimming pool sex scene. As is the way of these things, though, the film developed a cult following on home video and is now a staple on the midnight screening circuit. Verhoeven, incidentally, is currently getting some of the best reviews of his career for Elle, a dark drama about rape that won two Golden Globes last month. Just three years on from Return of the Jedi, George Lucas laid an almighty egg with this disastrous stab at bringing Marvel's wise-quacking alien to the big screen. Back to the Future's Lea Thompson was among Howard the Duck's human stars Released as Howard: A New Breed of Hero in the UK, the film's crimes against cinema include putting an actor with dwarfism in an inexpressive duck suit that reportedly cost $2m (Â£1.6m) to make. Since its release in 1986, though, the film has come to be embraced both by lovers of bad movies and fans of the original comic book character. Howard's brief appearance at the end of 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy, meanwhile, has prompted talk that a movie comeback may be on the cards. Edward Wood Jr's status as the world's worst director is largely down to a 1959 black-and-white creature feature that languished in late-night TV obscurity for 20 years. But after film critic Michael Medved declared it the worst movie ever made in 1980, it found a new audience among those who saw a camp value in its cheap effects and cheesy sci-fi storyline. Many were particularly impressed by Wood's billing of Bela Lugosi as the film's star, despite the fact that he barely appears and actually died three years before the film's release. The film and Wood himself were subsequently granted the ultimate accolade when Tim Burton made a film about the director's life, starring Johnny Depp as Wood and Martin Landau as Lugosi.

"Australia detains asylum seekers on the small Pacific nation of Nauru As the US-Australia refugee deal dominated headlines this week, a medical emergency was unfolding at an Australian detention centre on the Pacific island of Nauru. Advocacy groups have been pushing the Australian government to allow a Kuwaiti refugee, who is 37 weeks pregnant, to be flown to Brisbane to give birth by caesarean section. They say they alerted the government that she was a high-risk patient in December, due to the condition of pre-eclampsia, her baby being in the breech position, because of her age of 37 and because she had been prescribed the antidepressant citalopram, which can result in harmful side-effects on newborn babies. Known only as ""Dee"", the woman has been on Nauru since late 2013 and is now living in the local community after being deemed a genuine refugee. Trump criticises 'dumb deal' with Australia However, with Australia having not approved her entry, the woman had remained in Nauru's general hospital. While previously refugees on Nauru were routinely allowed into Australia to give birth in better-equipped hospitals, Australia has been reluctant to allow the practice since 2015, fearing that once in the country refugees will seek legal help to remain here. Finally on Friday, Dee was flown to Brisbane. According toNauru's government,external, it came after Australia gave permission late on Thursday night. Conditions for refugees in Nauru have been criticised by rights groups Australia sends all asylum seekers who arrive by boat to detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island. Those processed there and classed as genuine refugees have been released into the local communities. Children of asylum seekers who give birth in Australiaare not automatically given visas or citizenship. This ""Pacific Solution"" has been criticised by refugee advocacy groups, who say Australia - the sixth-largest country in the world geographically and with the seventh-lowest population density - could afford to show more compassion to asylum seekers and is obliged to do so under a UN convention. The government, supported by the main opposition, argues boat journeys are dangerous and controlled by people-smugglers. It says its policies have restored the integrity of Australia's borders, prevented deaths at sea and discouraged people who aren't genuine refugees from making the journey. It becomes still more complicated by the question of who should bear the responsibility in medical emergencies for those awaiting processing. Canberra's reluctance to grant medical evacuations is not confined to problematic pregnancies. It has also been the case for refugees needing other treatment, such as an 11-year-old Iranian boy who was prevented from going to Australia for corrective surgery on a broken arm in 2015, despite a storm of protest. Australia-based activist groups Doctors for Refugees and the Refugee Action Coalition say the government's delayed action over Dee was based on a fear of her remaining in Australia after her procedure, and showed again that the government was ready to put lives at risk to make a political point. It was not immediately clear if her condition had changed before she was airlifted on Friday. Doctors for Refugees President Dr Barri Phatarfod said Dee had been identified by a team of several Australia-based specialists assessing her medical tests as a high-risk patient requiring urgent transfer to Australia in December. But, Dr Phatarfod said, approaches to Australia's Immigration Minister Peter Dutton had been rebuffed. ""Either the minster, who is not an obstetrician, chose not to believe us, which would take a certain amount of arrogance, or else the government just doesn't care,"" Dr Phatarfod told the BBC. ""This is a very high-risk pregnancy, which requires medical assistance that simply cannot be provided on Nauru. The Australian government is putting politics above people's lives. ""Nauruan women with complicated pregnancies are allowed to be flown to Australia. But because Dee is a refugee, she's effectively a prisoner. Her choices have been taken away. She'll be delivering how the Australian government says she'll be delivering."" Dr Phatarfod said despite promised funding from Australia to upgrade the Nauru hospital, the facility was still grossly inadequate for cases such as Dee's and operated by poorly trained staff. Asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei died from a bacterial infection in 2014 She said the woman also had a large fibroid, or benign tumour, on the front of her uterus. Cutting through such growths for a caesarean delivery usually resulted in substantial bleeding, and Dr Phatarfod said the Nauru hospital was not equipped to handle transfusions. This issue has been in the spotlight in the past few years through several high-profile cases, including: Iranian asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei, 24, who contracted a bacterial infection on Manus Island that ultimately led to his death in 2014. He was flown unconscious to Brisbane, four days after firstcomplaining of being ill,external, where he later died. A baby known as ""Asha"", born in Australia to Nauru-based asylum seekers, was sent back to Nauru when five months old in 2015 despite dire warnings from Australian medical personnel about conditions there. She returned to Australia for treatment for burns last year, after which doctors refused to discharge her, saying Nauru was not a safe environment. The governmenteventually allowed her to stay,externalin Australia under community detention arrangements. A Sudanese refugee, 27, who fell and suffered a seizure at the Manus Island centre before being airlifted to Australia, where hedied in hospital,external. Refugee advocates said the man had suffered several collapses in the months before his death. Also in 2016, a Somali refugee and her newborn infant were evacuated from Nauru in a critical condition and placed on life support in a Brisbane hospitalafter she gave birth,external, by caesarean section, one month prematurely. ""After that [the Somali refugee's] case, who in their right mind would take this risk with this latest case?"" said Sydney-based Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul. ""People on Nauru are hostage to politics. And Australia's two big political parties (Liberal and Labor) are both hostage to the offshore solution. There's no principled position by the two main political parties anymore."" Australia's offshore detention policies have been the subject of protests Australia's Department of Immigration and Border Protection has kept its statements on the case brief. Handling media enquiries via email, it said it did not ""provide specific details on the health and transfer arrangements of individuals"". ""Australia provides comprehensive medical support services to the regional processing centre in Nauru and to the Nauruan Government Health Facilities,"" a spokesman wrote in an email to the BBC. ""Refugees in Nauru are eligible to access the Government of Nauru Overseas Medical Referral process if required medical services are not available in Nauru. This process is under the management of the Government of Nauru. ""Decisions relating to medical treatment, including medical transfers, for refugees in Nauru are made at the discretion of the Government of Nauru."" In a statement late on Thursday, Nauru's government said it had ""no control over decisions by Australia on who to transfer"". ""Within the last 30 minutes we have received confirmation from Australia that the patient [Dee] will be airlifted and this is expected to happen tomorrow,"" it said in a statement. Nauru's government and Mr Rintoul confirmed Dee had boarded the plane early on Friday afternoon. Australia did not comment on Friday. The Refugee Action Coalition says there are 1,800 people who have been determined to be refugees on Nauru and Manus. Australia's agreement with the US is for it to take up to 1,250 of them, although President Donald Trump'scriticism of the dealmeans it is far from certain. Even if all 1,250 were resettled, Mr Rintoul says this would still leave 550 in limbo on the Pacific islands, and continuing debate over their care.

"When I was a child I vividly remember being marched into town at the end of the summer holidays for new shoes and a coat before autumn arrived. That was just the way it was. But now, it seems British shoppers are doing things differently. We are waiting for the sales and buying things out of season, holding on to them until they are needed. And this has led to a fall in sales. The overall value of retail sales dropped by 2% in 2016 compared to 2015,according to consumer insight company Kantar Worldpanel,external. With shoppers being more flexible on when they buy items, shops have leftover stock, which then has to be discounted to shift it. Glen Tooke, consumer insight director at Kantar, says many retailers have been ""left behind"" as buying patterns have changed. ""These companies are stuck in a rigid, seasonal buying cycle which no longer reflects how consumers shop,"" says Mr Tooke. The data covered clothing, footwear and accessories sold by both High Street retailers and supermarkets. The drop in sales was across all types of clothing, including children's, according to Kantar Worldpanel ""This is the deepest decline the market has seen since August 2009, knocking nearly Â£750m off its total value in the 52 weeks ending 18 December 2016,"" Kantar said in a statement. Mr Tooke said the decline was a ""serious cause for concern"". Retail analyst Richard Hyman agrees that shoppers are shifting focus away from seasons when buying. ""There are twin evils at play here. The discounting going on and retailers not knowing their customers well enough to know what they want. ""In 90% of the trading weeks in 2016, more than half the retailers in the fashion market had some sort of sale going on."" This, Mr Hyman says, results in customers learning that if they hang on, the item they have their eye on might well end up being reduced in price. Dr Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at UCL, says the constant discounting can lead to a ""dilution of trust"" meaning shoppers come to believe goods are overpriced to begin with. Dr Tsivrikos believes there could also be something else at play - shoppers have adopted an entirely new way of thinking about their wardrobes. ""Retailers are failing to fully understand that consumers are now making modular purchases rather than single-item purchases,"" he says. For example, rather than buying a thick winter coat, a shopper might instead invest in a lighter spring jacket, and a sports layer such as a hoodie, which can then be worn together or separately across the seasons. Consumers are increasingly looking to buy items they can layer up ""This trend is supported by key design labels, which are leaving behind the conventional fashion week presentations and shows. Such events are driven by seasons, so instead these key design labels present fewer and more versatile collections of garments that consumers can wear throughout the year,"" says Dr Tsivrikos. There is also another train of thought, particularly for the footwear industry. ""Online purchases have already reached 25% of overall sales of footwear in the UK - this is the fastest-growing sector,"" says John Saunders, chief executive of the British Footwear Association. ""The growth of online is doing away with season as collections change on a much more regular basis and products are available all year round to reflect consumer demand. ""A good example of this is the growth of sandals and open footwear for consumers taking winter sun holidays,"" he adds. Winter sun holidays means we are buying sandals and flip-flops all year round There were some bright spots for the retail market in Kantar Worldpanel's data - online-only retailers saw impressive growth of 7% in 2016 compared to 2015, while independent retailers improved sales by 3%. So what are they doing differently? ""It sounds obvious, but the fashion retailers that are doing well right now are the ones that are managing to keep all the balls in the air at once - having the right product, at the right price, in the right place, at the right time,"" says Graham Soult, owner of retail consultancy CannyInsights. ""It's where chains like Uniqlo and Zara benefit from controlling their own supply chains, and being really agile in getting new stock into store quickly when it's needed. ""At the same time, some of the online fashion retailers, such as Boden, are great at mixing selected seasonal pieces with timeless items that can be layered or accessorised, and sold and worn throughout the year,"" he adds. But there's a new threat around the corner, one that will affect all retailers, big, small and online: the continuing fluctuation and downward trend in the value of the pound. We hear forecasts of prices going up as retailers are forced to pass on the rising costs of items imported from abroad, but in a world where most of us own more items of clothing than are strictly necessary, will we continue to buy if prices rise? Mr Hyman thinks not. ""It's easy to make do. Our wardrobes are generally made up of 10% items we need, 90% items we want. Retail has to inspire desire, or we won't buy. Higher prices won't do that,"" he says. So if retailers are paying more, but cannot pass on these increases, the future for the British High Street could be as uncertain as a shopper's whim.

"Our bathrooms are filled with shampoo bottles, toilet rolls and cleaning products which could easily be put into our recycling bins when finished with. Yet research shows our green intentions are washed away as soon as we step near a toilet. Now a business group has come up with an idea for how to combat this problem - two bathroom bins. The Circular Economy Taskforce, who were brought together by Prince Charles's Business in the Community environment charity, says it could boost recycling. So should two bins really sit alongside your stack of loo roll in the bathroom? Why should people have two bins in their bathrooms? ""It's trying to address the problem that people are less likely to recycle packaging for things we use in our bathrooms than for things we use in other rooms of the house,"" says Jonny Hazell, senior policy adviser for environmental think tank Green Alliance. The Recycle Now campaign points to its statistics, which show that while 90% of packaging is recycled in our kitchens, only 50% is being recycled in the bathroom. ""Often homes have one central recycling bin located in the kitchen, so when in the shower or washing your face it can be tricky to remember to transfer it to that bin,"" it says. ""This is why having a recycling bin or bag in the bathroom might be useful, if there is space."" Business in the Community says two bins could make it easier to separate out the plastics that can be recycled. ""But it doesn't have to be a bin, it could be as simple as a bag on the door handle that you bring down to the kitchen every week,"" it added. Where has this idea come from? While recycling has grown from 12% to 45% in the UK over the last decade, campaigners say the bathroom is an area that needs more focus. The Circular Economy Taskforce came up with the idea as part of its work looking at practical collaborative ways to boost recycling and re-use rates. ""The bathroom is one of the areas that has come up time and time again in the group as somewhere where both business and consumers can make a difference to help us all reduce our impact on the environment,"" says Business in the Community. ""Thinking about how different types of bins could boost recycling in the bathroom is just one example of a potential simple solution that could have a big impact."" Why are people failing to recycle their bathroom products? Campaigners believes it comes down not just to where a recycling bin is located but also to confusion over what can be recycled. Recycle Now says: ""There can also be confusion about what can or can't be recycled with bathroom products. ""For example many people don't realise that bleach bottles can be easily recycled - simply make sure it's empty and put the lid back on. ""Recycling just one bleach bottle saves enough energy to power a street light for 6.5 hours, so the value quickly adds up."" Research from the University of Exeter,externalalso found that people who threw away waste in the bathroom saw it as being ""dirty"" and were less likely to recycle it. Going through your bathroom bin to separate out what can and can't be recycled can seem off-putting,"" says Business in the Community. It added: ""There is also a lot of confusion around what can be recycled in the bathroom, for example many consumers are confused by aerosols."" How much recyclable waste comes from a bathroom? A surprising amount. Typical products include: Plastic shampoo, conditioner and shower gel bottles, plastic moisturiser bottles (such as for hand cream and body lotion), glass face cream pots (plus the cardboard packaging they come in), perfume and aftershave bottles, aerosols for deodorant, air freshener and shaving foam, bleach and bathroom cleaner bottles, toothpaste boxes and toilet roll tubes. Is a lack of recycling in bathrooms a real problem? Every little helps, is the message from environmental and recycling groups. ""In general, the less we recycle, the more water and energy we need to use to produce the materials we use in our daily lives,"" said Mr Hazell. Recycle Now says recycling reduces the amount we are sending to landfill and makes use of resources already available rather than making them from scratch. ""Ultimately this means reduced levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere which contribute to climate change,"" it added. ""For instance it takes 75% less energy to make a plastic shampoo bottle from recycled plastic compared with using virgin materials."" Can two bins have a meaningful impact on recycling overall? ""Ensuring you recycle in the bathroom can make a big difference,"" says Recycle Now. ""It would save Â£135,000 in landfill costs if every UK household threw their next empty shampoo bottles into the recycling bin. ""On top of this, if everyone recycled one more toilet roll tube it would save enough cardboard inner tubes from landfill to go round the M25 38 times."" But what if you don't have the space for two bins? There are other options. Hang a reusable bag on the bathroom door so you can transfer your recyclable items straight into the recycling bin. Or opt for a bin with split compartments which can be used to separate recyclable and non-recyclable items. UK recycling figure drops for first time Are you rubbish at recycling?
