"This video can not be played Video footage appears to show Yemen's Houthi forces in trucks leaving a key port Yemen's Houthi rebels have begun withdrawing from a key strategic port, in the first major step since a ceasefire agreement signed in December. Both the Houthis and government forces agreed to withdraw from Hudaydah port to allow in vital humanitarian aid. Video footage obtained by the BBC shows Houthi forces setting off in trucks. The redeployment is expected to take four days in total. But Yemen's government has accused the rebels of staging a ""ploy"". At least 6,800 civilians have died in Yemen's four-year civil war. Some 10,700 more have been injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations, and many thousands more have died from preventable causes such as malnutrition, disease and poor health. AFP news agency quoted UN spokesman Farhan Haq as confirming that the withdrawal had begun. The process has been described by the UN's special envoy for Yemen as a ""first step"". ""I'm hopeful, but it's a fragile vessel,"" Martin Griffiths told the BBC. ""We have still got a job to do to make sure the government of Yemen is eventually happy with it."" Deep distrust still remains among all parties in the war. Al-Hasan Taher, a senior pro-government official, accused the rebels of replacing themselves with other Houthi militia members dressed in coast guard and police uniforms. ""It's an attempt to disinform the international community,"" he told reporters. But the Houthi movement said its ""unilateral"" pullout showed ""commitment to implement the Hudaydah agreement and to achieving peace"". It called on the UN to press all parties to abide by the agreement. This video can not be played The hidden victims of the Yemen war Hudaydah port is the principal lifeline for two-thirds of Yemen's population. Its closure has had a devastating impact on the nation, which now sits on the brink of famine. Under the deal brokered by the UN in December, the warring parties agreed to withdraw from Hudaydah city and the ports of Hudaydah, Salif and Ras Issa. Yemen conflict in 400 words How my country has changed The rise of Houthi rebels The Houthi withdrawal marks the first major step in bringing that ceasefire agreement into being. The UN has repeatedly appealed to both sides for access to a vast store of grain in Hudaydah port that holds enough food to feed 3.7 million people for a month. Aid workers have been unable to reach the stores for five months, andthe UN previously warned that the grain was at risk of rotting,external. Pro-government forces have twice tried to seize the port, and accuse the Houthis of using it to smuggle in weapons from Iran. The group and Tehran both deny these accusations. Deep distrust between warring parties has stalled this deal for months and continues to plague this first unilateral step by the Houthis. A pullout from the ports is a move of least risk for the Houthis in this strategic corner. They've reinforced in the city of Hudaydah in recent months and can find other means to replace lost revenue. Many of the Coast Guard and port officials are regarded as civil servants who, if this pullout is completed, will run the ports with UN experts. But the Yemeni government suspects the Houthis of moving militia into ports posing as ordinary workers. They're dismissing this unilateral pullout as a ploy. The UN's emphasis, since the Stockholm deal, is on monitoring, not trust. Its patrols are now in place. If this step is deemed genuine, it could create conditions for a wider redeployment of forces from all sides. If it isn't, it could mean the end of what's regarded as the best chance to move toward peace. The conflict has its roots in the failure of a political transition after an Arab Spring uprising that forced its longtime authoritarian President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, in 2011. The Houthi movement, which fought a series of rebellions against Mr Saleh during the previous decade, took advantage of the new president's weakness to take control of their northern heartland of Saada province and neighbouring areas. Houthi supporters at a rally in the capital Sanaa, last month Many ordinary Yemenis supported the Houthis, and in late 2014 and early 2015, the rebels took over the capital Sanaa, forcing President Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. Talks have repeatedly stalled and broken down, and withdrawal deadlines have been missed amid disagreements over who would control the vacated locations. In depth: Why is Yemen at war?

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit talks with the Labour Party are a ""grave mistake"", according to former defence secretary Gavin Williamson. Mrs May is hoping to reach a cross-party consensus on her withdrawal agreement after failing to get it through Parliament three times. But Mr Williamson -sacked over the Huawei leak- told theMail on Sunday,externalthe talks were ""destined to fail"". He added Jeremy Corbyn's only real interest was a general election. BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said a Downing Street source had indicated Mr Williamson had been ""supportive of the process while he was in the cabinet"" and that he had ""not been involved in the talks himself"". The Conservative MP for South Staffordshire said doing a deal with Labour on Brexit ""sounds so simple and so reasonable"" - but would not work. Verhofstadt: I don't know if Brexit will happen Brexit talks: Don't expect a love-in Brexit: All you need to know ""Even if Labour do a deal, break bread with the prime minister and announce that both parties have reached an agreement, it can only ever end in tears,"" he said. ""The Labour Party does not exist to help the Conservative Party. ""Jeremy Corbyn will do all he can to divide, disrupt and frustrate the Conservatives in the hope of bringing down the government. ""His goal, and he has made no secret of it, is to bring about a general election."" Mr Williamson said the prime minister seemed oblivious to the fact many Tories believe she is ""negotiating with the enemy"". He continued: ""Even if we get to a point where Jeremy Corbyn agrees a deal with the prime minister, when it comes to detailed scrutiny of the votes, Labour will revert to form. ""Even if it passes the first few votes, it will fail later."" Mr Williamson's comments come after Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady said thathe expected the government's Brexit talks with Labour to ""peter out""within days. Speaking on Saturday, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, said he found it ""very hard"" to see the talks leading to a ""sensible resolution."" Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said that Labour was acting ""in good faith"" in the negotiations but was ""not getting very far"". However, Education Secretary Damian Hinds told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that no other person in Mrs May's position could change the ""parliamentary reality"" of needing to find a majority in the Commons.

Gavin Williamson was sacked by the PM earlier this month Mr Williamson was sacked as defence secretary following an inquiry into a leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting. Downing Street said the PM had ""lost confidence in his ability to serve"" and announced Penny Mordaunt as his successor.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We will abolish the youth rate of the minimum wage"" Labour will extend its plans for a higher Â£10-an-hour minimum wage to include workers under the age of 18, party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said. Currently, under-18s are entitled to a minimum wage of Â£4.35 per hour, compared with Â£8.21 for over-25s. But under a Labour government this ""youth rate"" for the minimum wage would be ended in 2020, Mr Corbyn said. One business group said there was value in having the minimum wage set by an independent group, as it is now. Mr Corbyn hadalready pledged to raise the National Living Wage- a legally binding hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over - to Â£10 an hour next year, if Labour gained power. He said Labour's proposal would see workers aged 16 and 17 paid about Â£2,500 more a year. Mr Corbyn said that young people's work ""should be properly valued"" It is not clear how the proposed changes would impact those on apprenticeship schemes. All UK pupils can leave school at the age of 16. But in England, under-18s must then stay in full-time education, start an apprenticeship or traineeship or spend 20 hours or more a week working or volunteering, while in part-time education or training. How high could the minimum wage go? Minimum wage rates rise, but bills go up too 'Older colleagues are paid more than me' Speaking at a party gathering in Birmingham on Saturday, Mr Corbyn said: ""Equal pay for equal work is hardly a controversial idea, so why are we discriminating against young people? ""You don't get a discount at the shops for being under 18. ""But if the person serving you on the other side of the counter is young, they could be on half the wage of their colleagues. ""It's time to end this discrimination. Young people's work should be properly valued, not exploited by employers to cut their wage bill. If they're doing the job, pay them the wage - the real living wage."" The rates are reviewed each year by the government which is advised by the independent Low Pay Commission. The commission, made up of trade unionists, businesspeople and academics, has previously said different minimum wages have been set for different age groups due to ""evidence that younger workers are more at risk of being priced out of jobs than older workers, with worse consequences if they end up unemployed."" 25 and over: Â£8.21 21-24: Â£7.70 18-20: Â£6.15 Under-18: Â£4.35 Apprentice: Â£3.90 Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the proposals were ""dramatic"" and that they could risk reducing the number of 16 and 17-year-olds in work. That age group would not have much experience and were probably not going to be as productive as more experienced workers, he told Radio 4's Today programme. He added that a lot would be working part time - at the weekends or in the holidays - and that experience would be valuable to them and could include training. Labour said it would use fiscal savings from a reduction in the amount that the Treasury pays out in in-work benefits to provide support for small and medium-sized businesses. Peter Dowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the plans aimed to create fairness, claiming that spending on tax credits to top up low wages had ""ballooned"" from Â£1bn to Â£30bn - a sign wages had to rise. ""We've got to have a system that reflects the needs of small businesses, but also has to reflect the needs of the people they employ, whether they are 16 or 60,"" he said. Mr Johnson added that any compensation scheme would ""need to be very clear, transparent and easy."" Responding to Labour's proposals, the Institute of Directors said there was value in having an independent, evidence-based approach from the Low Pay Commission. ""Politicians directly setting rates will always risk not taking full account of the implications for employers and jobs,"" the business lobby group said. There were an estimated 1.35 million 16 to 17-year-olds in the UK at the end of last year Of those, 6% (81,000) were solely in employment 5% (71,000) were neither in work nor education For those not in full-time education, the employment rate of this group has fallen from 65% in 1993 to 44% in 2018 Source:Low Pay Commission Report 2018,external The young worker Student Neha Gohil began her first job as a tutor in Ealing, west London, aged 16. She says that it ""didn't seem fair"" when she learned she was paid less than her older colleagues. Now 20 and a student at the University of Warwick, she says younger workers can be ""more flexible with their time and can offer a different dynamic"". ""They can offer something different in the workplace: be more creative, more innovative. They might know how to do things with technology that someone who's older might not. ""They can go into a company and offer fresh ideas."" The business owner Businessman Jack Palmer, 27, who owns and runs three hairdressing salons in Hertfordshire said he ""can't see it being affordable"". He employs between 12 to 15 people aged 18 to 25. But, he says, if the Â£10 minimum wage was brought in for all, he might only be able to afford to employ half of them. ""If you've got someone coming straight out of school their skill set is pretty minimal to begin with. ""Of course, they learn on the job and through external training - and it gives us a lot of pleasure nurturing that talent. ""They'll get the opportunity to earn a high wage but to begin with, they're not worth that amount,"" he added. Matthew Percival, head of employment at the Confederation of British Industry, said: ""The minimum wage is an important part of the UK labour market and must not be used as a political football. ""Youth rates play an important role in helping to reduce youth unemployment and should be retained."" Chris Philp MP, Conservative vice-chairman for policy, said: ""Under the Conservatives, we have seen youth unemployment fall by half, the biggest increase in the minimum wage for under-25s in a decade and the economy continue to grow, giving young people the security of a better future.""

"A lawsuit alleges that more than 100 generic drugs were included in a price-fixing scheme More than 40 US states have filed a lawsuit accusing pharmaceutical firms of conspiring to artificially inflate the cost of common medicinal drugs. The lawsuit alleges that as many as 20 companies have been involved in fixing prices for over 100 drugs, including treatments for diabetes and cancer. One of the firms accused is Teva Pharmaceuticals, the world's largest producer of generic medicine. Teva, which has denied any wrongdoing, says it will defend its actions. The legal action, which follows a five-year investigation, accuses drugs companies of involvement in a scheme to boost prices - in some cases by more than 1,000% - and was filed on Friday by Connecticut Attorney General William Tong. ""We have hard evidence that shows the generic drug industry perpetrated a multi-billion dollar fraud on the American people,"" Mr Tong said. ""We have emails, text messages, telephone records and former company insiders that we believe will prove a multi-year conspiracy to fix prices and divide market share for huge numbers of generic drugs."" A representative of Teva in the US said that the Israeli company ""has not engaged in any conduct that would lead to civil or criminal liability"", Reuters news agency reports. The other 19 firms implicated in the lawsuit have yet to comment on the allegations. Fifteen individuals were also named as defendants accused of overseeing the price-fixing scheme on a day-to-day basis. The human cost of insulin in America The little-known safety net of US healthcare According to the lawsuit, the drugs companies allegedly conspired to manipulate prices on dozens of medicines between July 2013 and January 2015. It accuses Teva and others of ""embarking on one of the most egregious and damaging price-fixing conspiracies in the history of the United States"". Mr Tong said the investigation had exposed why the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs was so high in the US. America's healthcare system has been at the forefront of US politics for years. President Donald Trump has frequently promised to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, which was designed to make medical cover affordable for the many Americans who had been priced out of the market. States have argued that eliminating Obamacare would harm millions of Americans who would struggle to meet the costs of medical care.

"An election official empties a ballot box at the count in Durban South Africa's African National Congress (ANC) has been returned to office after winning parliamentary election, but with a reduced majority. The ANC secured 58% of the vote, ahead of the Democratic Alliance (DA) on 21%. The radical Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), came third with 11%. A struggling economy and corruption have eroded the ANC's popularity. ANC leader, President Cyril Ramaphosa, called on the people to build a united South Africa. Five things we've learnt Can Ramaphosa call time on corruption? How South Africa has changed since apartheid - in charts In his victory speech, he said the result showed that South Africans still had faith in the ANC - in power since 1994 - to deliver. ""Let us now work together, black and white, men and women, young and old, to build a South Africa that truly belongs to all who live in it as proclaimed by our forebears,"" Mr Ramaphosa told supporters in Pretoria. He called for a South Africa ""which is united, which is non-racial, which is non-sexist, democratic and prosperous"". The BBC's Will Ross says the ANC may not be too disheartened by the reduced majority. He says that although its support has dropped, this was not a disastrous performance and some might even be tempted to call it a fairly successful exercise in damage limitation considering the ANC's corruption scandals and the slow progress in tackling poverty. Turnout was about 65% in the twin parliamentary and provincial elections - a drop compared to the 73% registered five years ago. It was the first time the ANC's share of the vote has fallen below the 60% mark and it will now have 19 fewer seats in the 400-member parliament. This has been a critical election for the man promising to defeat corruption and boost a stagnant economy. Cyril Ramaphosa will now argue that he has a mandate to create a cabinet capable of reducing unemployment that runs at 27% - more than half of it among the young.  That means sidelining allies of his scandal-plagued predecessor Jacob Zuma. They will however remain entrenched in the structures of the ANC, unless prosecutions or the reports of public inquiries into corruption force them to quit. Perceptions of honest government are critical if Mr Ramaphosa is to attract the investment South Africa needs. This is Africa's largest economy and tackling its inability to provide jobs for the young is the great challenge ahead. In a country where the youth have traditionally led rebellions - in 1976 and again in the mid-1980s against apartheid - the most striking statistic in this election is the fall-off in voting by young people. More than six million did not register to take part - roughly half of those in the 18-30 age bracket who were entitled to vote. Disenchantment over corruption and the failure to provide jobs is deep. It is a trend of alienation that Mr Ramaphosa will need to stem if the long-term health of democracy here is to be guaranteed. Young people queuing to vote spoke of their difficulties in finding jobs. One young voter said her future employment prospects were on her mind. ""I don't feel confident about getting the job I want,"" she said. ""I'm a member of the ANC, but I didn't vote for them this time,"" construction worker Thabo Makhene told Reuters news agency. ""They need to catch a wake-up. The way they run the state, mishandling state funds, they've lost their morals."" This video can not be played 'I am not voting - I'm very upset' However, many voters stayed loyal to the ANC, which led the fight against apartheid. Esau Zwane, 90, waiting to vote in Soweto, Johannesburg, lived under white-minority rule. He told the BBC he was celebrating ""that our country is now ruled by black people"".

"The Pearl Continental Hotel is popular among foreign visitors Three gunmen who stormed a five-star hotel in the restive Pakistani province of Balochistan, killing at least one guard, have been shot dead by security forces, officials say. The attack and subsequent siege, which targeted the Zaver Pearl-Continental Hotel in the strategic port city of Gwadar, lasted several hours. A hotel spokesman said there were no guests and few staff due to Ramadan. The separatist Balochistan Liberation Army said it carried out the attack. The group said that the hotel, the centrepiece of a multi-billion-dollar Chinese project, was selected in order to target Chinese and other investors. Militants in Balochistan oppose Chinese investment, saying it is of little benefit to local people. The gunmen stormed the hotel, usually popular with top government officials and foreign visitors, at around 16:50 local time (11:50 GMT), killing at least one security guard who tried to stop them at the entrance. Security forces entered the hotel and took part in a gun battle with the militants, before cornering them in a staircase leading to the top floor, officials said. Can Pakistan stamp out extremism? Pakistan country profile Due to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the hotel had no guests and a very limited number of staff, a Zaver Pearl-Continental spokesperson told the BBC. However, earlier reports suggested that hotel guests had been evacuated safely. This video can not be played Fishermen say they are no longer allowed to fish near the port The hotel sits on a hilltop overlooking the Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea, which is being developed by China as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a network of roads, railway and pipelines between the two countries. On Twitter,the Chinese embassy in Pakistan condemned the attack,,externalwhich comes just weeks after gunmen killed 14 people, including 11 military personnel, in the region. Gwadar is a city with a heavy military presence. It is viewed by both Chinese and Pakistani officials as the lynchpin of the CPEC, aiming to connect western China with the Arabian Sea. When I visited the port city in late 2017 with other international journalists, we travelled in convoys guarded by armed escorts, and stayed in the same hotel that was targeted. This attack will therefore be seen as a worrying breach of security, and it is not the first time Chinese interests have been targeted by this militant group. Last year the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) carried out an attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi. After that attack, both Pakistani and Chinese officials stressed that violence would not derail their close co-operation. But militant activity in Balochistan remains one of the major concerns about the viability of the CPEC project. Home to a long-running insurgency, Balochistan is Pakistan's poorest and least developed province. It shares a large, porous border with Afghanistan and Iran. Its economy is dominated by natural resources, particularly natural gas, and is being transformed by major Chinese infrastructure projects on the CPEC, part of the ambitious Belt and Road initiative. Several militant groups operate in the region, including the Pakistani Taliban, the BLA and the Sunni Muslim extremist group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.

"The army school attack in 2014 led to a comprehensive counter-terror plan, but impetus was lost As Pakistan detains an alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, Ahmed Rashid argues that Pakistan needs a broader, better co-ordinated strategy from state institutions and a willingness to face up to unpleasant truths if it really wants to curb resurgent extremism. Pakistan faces a renewed threat of rising Islamic extremism, vigilantism, attacks on minorities and a reluctance to face up to how these threats are internally rather than externally inspired. Also missing is the lack of a comprehensive narrative against extremism, articulated unanimously by all bodies of the state and civil society. The result of the failure to push forward a clear counter-terrorism and counter-extremism narrative that embraces the entire public domain is that some extremist groups continue to be tolerated by elements of the state. Just over two years ago, on 16 December 2014,an attack on an army-run school in Peshawarwhich killed 150 people - the majority of them children - galvanised the civilian government, opposition parties and the military to articulate the need for a comprehensive counter-terrorism plan. For the first time there emerged a20-point National Action Plan,external- a list of pointers of what needed to be done, endorsed by the military and all political parties. However the 20 points were never turned into a comprehensive winning strategy or a common narrative and the fight against extremism has diminished ever since. The little boy killed at the market Two tasks for Pakistan's army chief How Peshawar massacre changed Pakistan The army'sOperation Zarb-e-Azb, launched six months earlier, had cleared out North Waziristan, a key staging area for dozens of militant groups - many of them foreigners. Other military operations also took place, dramatically reducing terrorist bombings nationwide. But they were always going to be tactical operations, which still needed to be backed by a strategic plan carried through by the government. Pakistanis want the government to tackle the extremist threat A faction of the Pakistani Taliban said they were behind a recent bomb attack in a mainly Shia area in Parachinar, Peshawar It was the task of the civilian government to carry out educational reforms, job creation, co-ordination among intelligence agencies, galvanising the legal system, a ban on hate speech and a clear strategy of de-radicalisation of the nation's youth. All these aspects of a strategy to be carried out by the government, as opposed to tactical military operations, have been missing, as the government has slipped into inertia and paralysis. At the same time the state gave a pass to those extremist groups who were supportive of Islamabad's foreign policy towards India and Afghanistan. The lack of a strategy and the state support offered to some groups has led to a growing mood of defiance among extremist organisations. In the past few weeksfive bloggershave disappeared (three, including liberal activistSalman Haider, have now returned home), some threatened journalists and civil society activists have fled abroad, non-governmental organisations have been accused of being unpatriotic, the Ahmedi community has been ferociously attacked andminority Shia Muslims have been massacred. Hate speech has become a growing phenomenonin some media outlets, especially television, while increasingly journalists and others are threatened with being charged with blasphemy, against which there is little legal defence. Innocent lives are at risk as public incitement and witch hunts continue. Earlier this week, Hafiz Saeed,the cleric blamed by the US and India for masterminding the Mumbai attacks, was placed under house arrest. The move is being seen as a response to suggestions by US officials that the Trump administration may ban his Jamaat-ud-Dawa charity, seen by the US as a front for terrorists. However a military official said it was ""a policy decision"" and had nothing to do with any foreign pressure. Pakistani blogger Salman Haider went missing for more than 20 days - he has not yet disclosed where he was Pakistan's media regulator has just banned Aamir Liaquat Hussain, a high-profile TV host, accusing him of hate speech that could put lives at risk. Hafiz Saeed is accused by the US and India of masterminding terror attacks A key aspect of the growing defiance of extremists is the insistence that Pakistan's neighbours are to blame for acts of terrorism rather than recognising that it is a home-grown problem. When former army chief Gen Raheel Sharif took over the army three years ago, he repeatedly said that the country must look into itself to counter extremism and not blame foreign powers. That was music to the ears of most Pakistanis, who hoped that the state would tackle the very real threats at home rather than blame outsiders. Yet over the past year the state has been insisting that all major acts of terrorism have been perpetrated by India or Afghanistan, rather than domestic terrorists. Meanwhile, the civilian government has been indecisive and hesitant as to who to blame, while in its home base of Punjab it has clearly been allowing extremist groups to flourish. The conflict between civil and military agencies has left the public bewildered, giving further space for extremist ideas to flourish. This confusion has clouded out the need for a common and united narrative as to how to deal with extremism. Canadian-trained Gen Bajwa has not set out where he perceives the terror threat exists So far, thenew army chief Gen Qamar Bajwahas not categorically restated that terrorism is a domestic rather than a foreign creation. Meanwhile, relations with India and Afghanistan have worsened and other neighbours have distanced themselves from Pakistan, leading to what many experts have claimed is the country's growing isolation in the region. If Pakistan is to defeat extremism, a comprehensive strategy and common narrative, jointly agreed upon by the military and the politicians, needs to be implemented. Both need to ensure that all parts of the state are fully carrying out their responsibilities. Most importantly, the narrative that government agencies build up must be consistent and carry forward badly-needed social reforms that will promote de-radicalisation of young people. Pakistan needs a single, inspired, pragmatic and inclusive narrative that is strictly adhered to and can raise the public's morale instead of adding to their confusion.

"People in Balochistan's capital Quetta try to lead normal lives despite the threat of violence Pakistan's poorest province, Balochistan, is often in the news because of targeted killings, suicide attacks and abductions. The BBC's Shumaila Jaffery met people in the capital Quetta trying to lead normal lives. Yasir is lead singer of underground rock band Malhaar. Bank manager by day but rocker by night, he must keep his passion for music hidden as he lives in a conservative Muslim society where it's taboo to sing and dance. He and his friends gather in the evening in a basement room and play rock tunes to warm up but then get going with Bollywood songs. They're mostly students who use their spare cash to buy musical instruments and equipment. ""My customers at the bank wouldn't like it,"" says Yasir between takes. ""I try not to share my music on my own social media accounts because I fear losing business."" Bank manager Yasir lives the rock'n'roll dream in his basement As he strums his guitar to the tune of an Atif Aslam song, Yasir talks about his love of music. ""Our society is deeply wounded by the violence,"" he says. ""Our purpose for playing music is to entertain people."" There's no public space for Malhaar to perform. They've been invited by universities in the past but their performances have been picketed by right-wing groups and have ended in scuffles. ""The environment is particularly tense for young people. They even have to be careful about how they dress,"" says Yasir. Wearing ""Western"" clothes and not having a long beard can spell trouble. Yasir knows there are no openings for musicians here but lives out his dreams in his basement rehearsal room. ""We just want to make people happy."" Dr Shehla Sami Kakar was the first doctor who rushed towards the scene when a suicide bomber struck outside Quetta's civil hospital in August 2016. Seventy people, mostly lawyers, were killed that day. ""There was a big pool of blood,"" she says. ""Dozens of men in black coats and white shirts were lying on the floor."" Dr Shehla says her religious faith gives her strength The gynaecologist says she didn't know what to do. She now works in Quetta's Bolan Medical complex but suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after the attack. Dr Shehla says her religious faith helped her come through it. ""We have to live in this society,"" she says. ""We survive with the hope every day that it's going to be a normal routine day."" She says all big cities in Pakistan have experienced violence, not just Quetta. ""When you look from the outside, it seems that we are leading very difficult lives,"" she says. ""But I don't agree. It's the tribal mindset and lack of discipline in the city that bothers me the most."" She says women lack education and freedom in Balochistan. ""I am fully aware of the restrictions that male family members place on women, even for their medical treatment,"" she says. ""The women don't have a complete say."" Quetta is home to many different languages and communities But even with all these restrictions and complications, it's Balochistan's multi-ethnic makeup that challenges her the most. ""We have Hazara, Baloch, Pashtun, Punjabi, Urdu and Persian-speaking communities in Quetta,"" says Dr Shehla. ""All of them have different values and traditions so I have to consider their cultural sensitivities while treating them."" Khalil Ahmed is president of the Balochistan Union of Journalists.  His office in the Quetta press club is surrounded by barbed wire and there are armed guards on duty. He is matter of fact about the risks. ""Abduction is not a tradition here,"" he says. ""You will be targeted, shot and silenced forever."" Thirty-eight journalists have been killed in Balochistan over the past decade. Journalist Khalil Ahmed has long lived with the risks of reporting the news They are targeted by the Taliban, al-Qaeda, Baloch separatists and sectarian organisations. There are also allegations of extra-judicial killings of reporters by the military and the state government, which officials deny. As Khalil stands in the courtyard, students are holding a protest outside. ""You can only use a few limited words and cannot share your thoughts freely,"" he says. Reflecting the viewpoint of Baloch separatists who oppose the Pakistani state also lands you in trouble. Eighteen journalists in the province are on trial under anti-terrorism laws for publishing such opinions. Despite repeated promises by the government, these cases have not been thrown out yet. ""Separatists and militants tell us they have got all the information about our children and they can harm them at any time,"" says Khalil. He's been a journalist for 18 years and refuses to give up. ""It's our job,"" he says. ""The night we are destined to be in a grave cannot be changed, so why worry about it?"" Naseem Javed is forced to live in a ghetto. As a Hazara and a Shia, he is in a minority. Hundreds of his people have lost their lives in targeted killings and suicide attacks over the past decade. Haseem Javed seeks to learn from his Hazara elders They have taken refuge in the Marriabad settlement overlooking Quetta. There is one entry point and it's manned by security personnel around the clock. But even this has not stopped the Hazara bloodshed. The community caged in its own city ""Cinema halls are destroyed, markets are closed, art galleries and theatres are in the ruins,"" says Naseem. ""It's difficult to even breathe in this environment."" Men gather close to Qabristan-e-Shuhda, or the ""martyrs' graveyard"", on top of a small hill in the evening. They play a traditional game called ""sang girag"", or throw the stone. As the men play, others sit in the fading sunlight and listen to recitations of religious poetry written in Persian. Naseem Javed is young for the gathering but still visits. Hazara men gather to recite Persian poetry and soak up the evening sun ""We are living under the shadow of death,"" he says. ""Those who can leave the country have already migrated. Youngsters feel that the future is bleak and have only one dream - to run away from this place."" He says their hopes are constantly raised when there is a lull in the violence, then dashed. ""People think that they might be able to lead normal lives but with another targeted killing they return to absolute despair,"" says Naseem, adding that they can only pray that things get better. Journalism student Sehneela Manzoor, 23, is articulate, forthright and confident - and has no time to waste. Sehneela Manzoor believes the world is her oyster if she works hard ""Things are improving,"" she says. ""If I am sitting here and many of my friends and fellows are entering higher education and getting jobs, it shows that change is happening."" Of course, Sehneela, who studies at Balochistan University, is aware of the dangers - but she says she refuses to let them knock her off course. ""If something happens over and over again, people learn to live with it,"" she says. But living where she does puts her at a disadvantage in her career, she admits. ""When we compare ourselves with students from other provinces, they are at a level where it's very hard to compete with them for job opportunities."" Sehneela believes the conservative tribal mindset is the biggest barrier to women's development. But she's still hopeful, despite the fact young people are leaving Balochistan because they think their talent will be wasted. ""The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is here, new businesses are being set up, a lot of construction activity is going on and a new education system is being introduced."" She hopes to profit from it and help others stay and rebuild rather than move away. Asmatullah Khan runs a shoe shop in Quetta's old town. His family has owned the shop since 1982 and he took it over after the death of his father. It's all shipshape in Asmatullah Khan's shop but customers are hard to come by ""Customers are rare and business is bad,"" says Asmatullah, polishing a brown ladies sandal. ""Shopkeepers and customers used to be fearless without a care in the world."" Hashmi market was a favourite shopping destination for tourists from Punjab and Sindh provinces, as well as the families of military officers posted in Quetta. But due to the rise in violence over the past decade, tourist numbers have collapsed and military families remain confined to barracks. ""We use to make about 90,000 Pakistani rupees [about $780; Â£580] a day, but now we earn about 10,000 rupees."" Tourists are reluctant to visit Quetta, far less venture into the old town Asmatullah says that there are fewer attacks now but people's confidence is gone. ""Every morning when I leave home, my mother recites verses from the Koran so I come back safely,"" he says. And the future is bleak. ""I cannot even meet basic needs of my children,"" says Asmatullah. ""The quality of life has gone down drastically. ""If things don't improve, I will quit and go to Dubai as I don't have any other option.""

"The man was hit with the crossbow bolt outside his home A 74-year-old man has suffered ""horrendous, life-changing injuries"" after being shot with a crossbow. It happened outside his home in a remote area near South Stack Road in Holyhead, Anglesey, in the early hours. North Wales Police said the victim was trying to fix a satellite dish on his home when he was hit with the bolt. He managed to get back inside and raised the alarm at about 00:30 BST on Friday. He remains in a critical condition at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor.

"Signature Living has been developing luxury hotels across the UK, including in Liverpool, Cardiff and Belfast Investors in a multi-million pound luxury hotel group said they have been through ""a nightmare"" trying to get money from the company. They described months of delays and unanswered calls or emails to the Liverpool company, Signature Living. The BBC has spoken to six investors, from the UK, Ireland, Singapore and Taiwan, who said they were owed money. Company boss Lawrence Kenwright, who is considering running for mayor of Liverpool, said everyone would be paid. ""We are chasing them, begging for our money. I had many sleepless nights,"" said one of the investors, who all asked not to be named. The company ""is giving Liverpool and the UK a bad name,"" he said. Three other investors told the BBC they had received money they were owed in recent weeks, after payments were delayed by months. With several now demanding their investments be returned, Mr Kenwright said this would happen when the group's remaining hotels were sold or refinanced. Signature Living made Â£5.9m in annual profit, according to the most recent set of financial accounts. Investors in Signature Living hotels were told to expect annual returns of about 8% Mr Kenwright, who built his business up after being bankrupted in 2010, said he had made relatively little money from the company, although records show he shared in Â£610,000 of dividends in 2017. ""I never saw it, I don't know where it went,"" he said when asked about this money. ""The Â£610,000 you're talking about, I have never had a cheque. I have never had a bank account. I drive a five year-old car and wear an old watch,"" he said. Investors in Signature bought individual rooms in luxury hotels being redeveloped by the company, with many paying hundreds of thousands of pounds and some investing their retirement savings. The hotels included the Titanic-themed 30 James Street in Liverpool; Belfast's George Best Hotel, which has yet to open but it is said will be decorated with floor-to-ceiling portraits of the late footballer; and The Exchange Hotel in Cardiff, where rooms come with an en-suite hot tub. These rooms were then leased back to Signature, which typically promised an annual return of about 8% and that it would buy the room back at a profit after a certain number of years. ""It started out fantastically,"" said one investor, who bought a room in The George Best Hotel. The company was offering higher returns than any bank. Then his payments were delayed, he said. ""The first came a little bit late, the second one came a little bit later and the third took a lot of phone calls, emails and shouting before it came."" The opening date for the George Best Hotel in Belfast has yet to be confirmed As the delays continued, staff at Signature ""started getting more and more elusive. No-one would talk to me, everyone was in meetings and no one would return calls,"" said this investor. He said he was finally paid the money owed in the past fortnight. Another investor, whose family invested hundreds of thousands in two hotels in Merseyside, said she was still owed money after years of delayed payments. ""We have to email them and they say 'Yes, we will pay you today,' and then the money doesn't come and they stop responding,"" she said. ""We are being ignored."" A third investor said he had spent eight months trying to get money from the company with no result. ""This whole experience has been a nightmare and we just don't know when we will get this resolved,"" he said. Signature Living recently announced the sale of the Titanic-themed 30 James Street hotel In a letter to investors in March, Mr Kenwright said there had been delays in developing one hotel and ""we have obviously run into a timing problem whereby several bedroom investors are requesting their money back"". In another letter, sent in April, Mr Kenwright told investors ""all rental payments have been suspended and no further monthly or quarterly returns will be paid"", pending the sale or refinancing of five hotels, in Liverpool, Belfast or Cardiff. The BBC has spoken to two investors who have taken legal action against the company. Extract from a letter sent to investors in April 2019 Mr Kenwright, who is well-known for his charitable work in Liverpool, including establishing homeless shelters, confirmed recent reports that he has considered running for mayor of the city. He said he regretted the delays faced by his ""amazing"" investors and that investors in two of the group's hotels had now been paid in full. Every other hotel investor would be paid what they were owed and bought out of their original investment by the end of the month, he said.

"The USS Arlington will join the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Gulf The US is sending a Patriot missile-defence system to the Middle East amid escalating tensions with Iran. A warship, USS Arlington, with amphibious vehicles and aircraft on board, will also join the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group in the Gulf. And US B-52 bombers have arrived at a base in Qatar, the Pentagon said. The US said the moves were a response to a possible threat to US forces in the region by Iran, without specifying. Iran dismissed the claim as nonsense. Tehran has described the deployments as ""psychological warfare"" aimed at intimidating the country. Fact file: Patriot missile defence Battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal begins Iran has also suggested it may resume uranium enrichment nuclear activities. The Pentagon says US forces are responding to a possible threat to US forces, but did not offer any specifics regarding those threats. The latest Pentagon statement on Friday said only that Washington was ""ready to defend US forces and interests in the region"", adding that the US did not seek conflict with Iran. There are about 5,200 US troops currently deployed in neighbouring Iraq. The US Patriot missile defence system (stock photo) The Patriot system can counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. Officials told US media the USS Arlington had already been scheduled to go to the region, but its deployment was brought forward to provide enhanced command and control capabilities. The USS Abraham Lincoln passed through the Suez Canal on Thursday, US Central Command said. Iran's semi-official Isna news agency quoted a senior Iranian cleric, Yousef Tabatabai-Nejad, as saying that the US military fleet could be ""destroyed with one missile"". Last year, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal America and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015. Under the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Nuclear deal - all you need to know How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard Is it about to become more expensive to fill my car? Last month,the US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group. The White House proceeded to end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil. The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests. The Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a ""new deal"" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its ""malign behaviour"" across the Middle East. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - through which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass. Earlier this week Iran announced that it had suspended two commitments under the 2015 accord in response to the economic sanctions the US had re-imposed. It also threatened to step up uranium enrichment if it was not shielded from the sanctions' effects within 60 days. European powers said they remained committed to the Iran nuclear deal but that they ""reject any ultimatums"" from Tehran to prevent its collapse. The real battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal has begun. In the year since the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the deal, Iran and all the other parties have carried on regardless. And the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, has repeatedly given Tehran a clean bill of health. Iran has been living up to its part of the bargain. But Iranian compliance was not the issue for the Trump administration, which says simply that this is a bad deal. The US's main European allies, along with Russia and China, disagree. So the Trump administration has been ratcheting up the pressure on Tehran. The pressure on Iran's economy has been severe and the Iranian government has now decided to act - saying it will no longer respect restrictions on storing enriched uranium and heavy water, and setting deadlines for the other parties to implement their commitments. A difficult couple of months of diplomacy lie ahead, with no guarantee of success. The Trump administration must see its ultimate goal - the collapse of the nuclear deal - as now being in sight. But the danger of conflict - albeit by accident rather than design - is growing.

"This video can not be played Video footage appears to show Yemen's Houthi forces in trucks leaving a key port Yemen's Houthi rebels have begun withdrawing from a key strategic port, in the first major step since a ceasefire agreement signed in December. Both the Houthis and government forces agreed to withdraw from Hudaydah port to allow in vital humanitarian aid. Video footage obtained by the BBC shows Houthi forces setting off in trucks. The redeployment is expected to take four days in total. But Yemen's government has accused the rebels of staging a ""ploy"". At least 6,800 civilians have died in Yemen's four-year civil war. Some 10,700 more have been injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations, and many thousands more have died from preventable causes such as malnutrition, disease and poor health. AFP news agency quoted UN spokesman Farhan Haq as confirming that the withdrawal had begun. The process has been described by the UN's special envoy for Yemen as a ""first step"". ""I'm hopeful, but it's a fragile vessel,"" Martin Griffiths told the BBC. ""We have still got a job to do to make sure the government of Yemen is eventually happy with it."" Deep distrust still remains among all parties in the war. Al-Hasan Taher, a senior pro-government official, accused the rebels of replacing themselves with other Houthi militia members dressed in coast guard and police uniforms. ""It's an attempt to disinform the international community,"" he told reporters. But the Houthi movement said its ""unilateral"" pullout showed ""commitment to implement the Hudaydah agreement and to achieving peace"". It called on the UN to press all parties to abide by the agreement. This video can not be played The hidden victims of the Yemen war Hudaydah port is the principal lifeline for two-thirds of Yemen's population. Its closure has had a devastating impact on the nation, which now sits on the brink of famine. Under the deal brokered by the UN in December, the warring parties agreed to withdraw from Hudaydah city and the ports of Hudaydah, Salif and Ras Issa. Yemen conflict in 400 words How my country has changed The rise of Houthi rebels The Houthi withdrawal marks the first major step in bringing that ceasefire agreement into being. The UN has repeatedly appealed to both sides for access to a vast store of grain in Hudaydah port that holds enough food to feed 3.7 million people for a month. Aid workers have been unable to reach the stores for five months, andthe UN previously warned that the grain was at risk of rotting,external. Pro-government forces have twice tried to seize the port, and accuse the Houthis of using it to smuggle in weapons from Iran. The group and Tehran both deny these accusations. Deep distrust between warring parties has stalled this deal for months and continues to plague this first unilateral step by the Houthis. A pullout from the ports is a move of least risk for the Houthis in this strategic corner. They've reinforced in the city of Hudaydah in recent months and can find other means to replace lost revenue. Many of the Coast Guard and port officials are regarded as civil servants who, if this pullout is completed, will run the ports with UN experts. But the Yemeni government suspects the Houthis of moving militia into ports posing as ordinary workers. They're dismissing this unilateral pullout as a ploy. The UN's emphasis, since the Stockholm deal, is on monitoring, not trust. Its patrols are now in place. If this step is deemed genuine, it could create conditions for a wider redeployment of forces from all sides. If it isn't, it could mean the end of what's regarded as the best chance to move toward peace. The conflict has its roots in the failure of a political transition after an Arab Spring uprising that forced its longtime authoritarian President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, in 2011. The Houthi movement, which fought a series of rebellions against Mr Saleh during the previous decade, took advantage of the new president's weakness to take control of their northern heartland of Saada province and neighbouring areas. Houthi supporters at a rally in the capital Sanaa, last month Many ordinary Yemenis supported the Houthis, and in late 2014 and early 2015, the rebels took over the capital Sanaa, forcing President Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. Talks have repeatedly stalled and broken down, and withdrawal deadlines have been missed amid disagreements over who would control the vacated locations. In depth: Why is Yemen at war?

Here the BBC's Yemen-born Mai Noman, who has returned to her homeland to film short documentaries, reflects on what has become of her country. It's been over two years since I was last here. The only place I call home. A lot has happened and much has changed. It's hard to keep my feelings in check. Beside the physical destruction, memories of what once was are buried under the heavy weight of emotional rubble. Mai and her brother grew up in Taiz As a Yemeni journalist working in international news, I have had to monitor every twist and turn of the civil war in my country, even when I wanted to look away. Truthfully, the thought of coming face-to-face with the new reality shaped by the furious conflict in Yemen has terrified me. But living through the war from outside Yemen was isolating. As we make our way to the capital, Sanaa, on a rugged 10-hour car journey from Aden, I think back to the number of times I quietly broke down after hearing news coming out of Yemen. Working in a newsroom, this happened often. This trip takes me from the south to the north - two parts of a country divided by more than mere miles. In simple terms, the south is under government control, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, and the north is controlled by the Houthi rebels. But the reality is more complicated. I've imagined arriving back home hundreds of times in the last few years. But on the day I was totally unprepared for what I found. Unlike the southern city of Aden, where life seems to be at a standstill, waiting in fearful anticipation of more fighting, Sanaa - apart from the obvious damage - appears the same as ever. Some beautiful buildings in Sanaa have escaped unscathed I can feel the rain approaching. After London that should make me shudder, but it somehow feels welcoming. The jagged mountains which encompass the city slowly fill with clouds transforming the sky into a splendid portrait of misted rocky peaks. All at once telling me I'm home. The Yemeni capital has suffered like other parts of the country, but life there goes on There are more restaurants in town than I recall, and many are over-flowing with people. For a moment I forget there's a war raging across the country. But then Sanaa can be deceptive. I feel exhausted by the time we arrive at my cousin Mona's house. I knock on the door in a typical Yemeni manner - very determinedly. Mona's youngest child, Abdullah, opens the door to greet me. Mai's aunt's car sits where it was hit by a falling missile in the garden of her home It's quite quiet here. A minute later I hear Mona making her way down the narrow stairs at the back of the house. We embrace with joy. She holds my face to see what's changed. ""You're still you,"" she says. A lot kinder than comments I receive later about how my hair is too short or the few extra pounds I've gained. Mona is just as beautiful but her voice has changed, she's gone through a lot in the last few years. Three years ago she lost her father suddenly. She had been very close to him and facing life without him, amid ongoing uncertainty, is hard. ""He was the biggest support I had,"" she tells me, breaking down in tears. Life hasn't been kind to her and the war has now brought with it seemingly endless questions. Would her family be able to leave if it had to? Is it better to be stuck inside surrounded by conflict, or outside separated from relatives and friends? Are Mona's children safe at school or sleeping in their beds? How many more funerals will she have to attend? I have no answers. Even with the most difficult issues I face in my own life, the choices are never so bleak. Our lives have become more different than ever. Over the course of three weeks in Yemen, I reconnect with old acquaintances and hear stories of separation, loss and incredible examples of the tight bonds that keep a community together. But something else weighs heavily on my heart. There is one place I wasn't able to visit. It's the place where I was born and where a more utopian notion of Yemen was engraved in my mind. My grandmother's house in Taiz. But sadly my grandmother is no longer with us and Taiz today is unrecognisable, sitting as it does on the frontline of the conflict. I wonder if I'd even know the house. The fighting on the ground is brutal, the bombardment by the Saudi-led coalition is relentless and the siege on the city by the Houthis continues. It's painful trying to accept the way things have become, one where precious memories have no place among the hardship of this grinding conflict. To me, Taiz is where the heart of home is, and there's nothing harder than losing one's home. When I set off for Yemen it was with a mixture of dread and trepidation at what I might find after years of bombardment and fighting. On arriving I fell into a false sense of relief that the people were still here; home was, in some form, still here. In the days which followed though, it became clear that war damage isn't just the craters and the bombed out buildings. It is the suffering of a population watching helplessly as their lives are being torn apart. Thinking of the time I spent fearing what I'd find when I returned home, I know that regardless of the pain of seeing my country at war, the sense of longing to be part of Yemen, for good or bad, will always draw me back.

"This week's invite only ""Private View"" of the Venice Biennale (which opens today) was one weird affair. It was like being dropped into the middle of a Wes Anderson movie. The place was heaving with characters. Artists, posers, dealers, curators, billionaires, bureaucrats, fakes, freeloaders, snobs, journalists, pseuds, hustlers, and narcissists all cramming themselves into tiny spaces and noisy halls to get a glimpse of some box-fresh contemporary art. They are not a hip crowd like you might find at Coachella or XJAZZ in Berlin. They are more clamorous than glamorous. Art is a shared interest but not the thing that truly binds them. Money and status are the currencies that count. You don't need both, but you sure as hell need one or the other. This is a once every-other-year event that was established in 1895 to promote Italian art before morphing into an international exhibition with countries competing to be Best in Show. Mussolini latched onto it in the 1930s as a way of promoting his fascist agenda, leaving a faintly uncomfortable air of nationalism around what is now a global contemporary art event based around nation states. Nobody has time for anything more than a quickie. Take a look, take a picture, post to Instagram, move on. It is relentless. Visitors experiencing the Japanese Pavilion, where recorders suspended from the ceiling are played by an algorithm The spaces serving free alcohol always seem to be most popular. Or those that have suddenly become ""hot"" as word of some ""amazing work!!!!!"" spreads like a virus through the Giardini Gardens, which serve as the Biennale's picturesque base camp. Anxiety levels are at fever pitch, fuelled by double espressos and a FOMO so profound that you can see the terror lurking in the eyes behind every pair of Tom Ford sunglasses. The scale of the event is staggering. There are 90 national pavilions, each with its own bespoke exhibition featuring the work of an artist, or artists, commissioned to represent the host country. With artists Jos de Gruyter and Harald Thys, the Belgian Pavilion say it's offering an ""anthropological experience, reminiscent of an old Europe"" Added to this is a colossal one-off exhibition spanning two massive buildings, which this year has been put together by a curator called Ralph Rugoff whose day job is running the Hayward Gallery on London's Southbank. There's more. As if the aforementioned wasn't enough to satisfy even the most insatiable art lover, there are myriad other off-site shows by those not invited to take part in the main event: a sort of Venice Biennale Fringe, I suppose. No sane person needs this much art, it is totally overwhelming while, paradoxically, also frequently being totally underwhelming. If the Venice Biennale was a climbing rose it would have been hacked back to manageable proportions long ago. But it is not. It is a hugely successful trade show-cum-visitor attraction, to which hundreds of thousands of tourists will venture over the long hot summer looking for meaning, guidance and some intellectual sustenance in our increasingly secular, divided, complicated world. Will they find what they are looking for in the 2019 edition? You'd hope so. I did. Not in the German Pavilion, which contains an austere post-industrial installation so earnest it is unintentionally funny. The German Pavilion says it is exploring possibilities of survival, resistance and solidarity Quite unlike the French Pavilion opposite, which is hilarious on purpose. The Turner Prize-winning artist Laure Prouvost has created a surreal grotto full of love, humour and ebullient eccentricity. If the Venice Biennale is a theme park of sorts, then Prouvost's invitation to climb into the belly of an octopus is its star attraction. You enter through a narrow back door and step into an excavated basement the artist and her bunch of merry pranksters dug in order to enter the locked Pavilion in January having tunnelled from the bed of Venice's Grand Canal. That's their story anyway. And by way of corroboration, they have laid out their evidence in the room above in the grubby form of dredged detritus such as old plastic bottles, rusted cans and stinking seaweed. The floor is light blue with a translucent, gummy surface that tricks you into thinking you're tiptoeing through dirty canal water. Go with the flow and it eventually leads you into the guts of the artist's eight-limbed cephalopod, which is very dark place. Laure Prouvost's Deep See Blue Surrounding You at the French Pavilion is tipped to win the Golden Lion An elegiac film plays amid scattered stone-effect chairs placed on a spongy carpet that genuinely feels as though it could be the lining of an octopus's stomach. It's disconcerting. And nuts: an eccentric but sincere celebration of the wonderful gift that is the human imagination. It might well win the top prize. It'd get my vote. But there is some strong competition. The Lithuanians have built an off-site beach complete with sunbathers whom you peer down upon as they break out into operatic song. The Lithuanian Pavilion has been transformed into a Sun and Sea Marina, where participants give a contemporary opera performance And there was a lot of chatter about the Philippine Pavilion, which features an archipelago of glass topped platforms on which you walk and look down at household objects arranged beneath your feet. It was fine, but rather like the glass walkway, hardly shattering. The Ghanaian Pavilion, on the other hand, is excellent and will give Prouvost's watery world a run for its money when it comes to the award of the coveted Golden Lion for Best National Pavilion. It has been designed by the architect David Adjaye who has created a series of galleries of roughly-finished curved walls, on which hangs some first-class art. A group of El Anatsui's famous bottle-top wall hangings fill one space; behind them is a tear-inducing three-screen film by John Akomfrah that tackles climate change, imperialism, and the mistreatment of animals. And best of all, in the circular centre, are nine portrait paintings of imagined subjects by the talented Lynette Yiadom-Boakye (who was a Turner Prize runner up in 2013 the year Laure Prouvost won). One of the series of imagined portraits, Just Amongst Ourselves (2019) painted by Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, and shown at the Ghana Pavilion Other highlights include Michael Armitage's paintings (and sketches), which are in the main exhibition, as are those by rising star Njideka Akunyili Crosby. Both are well worth seeking out, as is Arthur Jafa: three to see among a plethora of half-baked mechanical contraptions and dreary installations made by various artists who could be collectively known as Phil Hall. Michael Armitage, who weaves multiple narratives into his works, is one of the 79 artists included in curator Ralph Rugoff's exhibition The Nigerian-born artist Njideka Akunyili Crosby draws on political and personal references, to create densely layered figurative compositions Another tip should you decide to take on the Venice Biennale challenge: Carve out some time to see Edmund de Waal's installation at the Jewish Museum (about 30 minutes from the Giardini Gardens by Vaporetto) in the Campo Ghetto Novo.

"Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, stressed that it was not pulling out of the nuclear deal The real battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal has begun. For a year now since the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the agreement, a kind of ""phoney diplomatic war"" has been under way. Iran and all the other parties to the accord have carried on regardless of Washington's actions. Indeed, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, has repeatedly given Tehran a clean bill of health. Iran has been living up to its part of the bargain. Iran's crude oil exports have more than halved since the start of 2018 But Iranian compliance was not the issue for the Trump administration. It just believes that this is a very bad deal. Its main European allies, along with Russia and China, disagree. So the Trump administration has been ratcheting up the pressure on Tehran. It has re-imposed many sanctions; it has designated the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation; and, most recently, it has not renewed sanctions waivers that allowed several countries to continue purchasing Iranian oil. The pressure on Iran's economy has been severe. Both in terms of responding to popular pressure at home and in an effort to relieve its worsening situation, the Iranian government has now decided to act. It has taken the first anniversary of the US withdrawal from the agreement - known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - to start setting conditions of its own. Iran is pursuing what it sees as a deliberate and measured course. First, it says it is no longer going to respect restrictions on storing enriched uranium and heavy water. Iran nuclear deal - all you need to know How reinstated sanctions have hit Iranians Is it about to become more expensive to fill my car? And it has given a 60-day deadline to the remaining countries involved in the JCPOA to implement what Iran calls ""their commitments"", particularly in the banking and oil sectors. If this deadline passes, then Iran will suspend restrictions on the level of enrichment it is allowed to conduct and halt the modernisation of the Arak heavy-water reactor. Iranians have remained defiant in the face of the sanctions and vowed to overcome them Iran is presenting itself very much as the wronged party, forced to act by unrelenting US pressure. And, if you ignore wider concerns about Iran's regional behaviour or its missile programmes - which, to be fair were never part of the JCPOA - it has a point. It has broadly stuck to the letter of the agreement. US sanctions that were supposed to be lifted have been reimposed. Its economy is suffering badly. Tehran is saying ""enough is enough"". The pressure now is squarely upon the Europeans - in particular the French, the British and German governments which helped to negotiate the deal. Iran is charging them with not having lived up to their promises. They have to do something to relieve the economic pressure on Tehran or, after 60 days, it will move to stage two of its planned suspensions. And there is an explicit warning to the Europeans too. Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, has underlined his country's role in fighting the smuggling of drugs and in constraining the flow of refugees into Europe. US economic pressure, he insists, means that Iran could no longer afford such activities. Iran wants the other signatories to the nuclear deal to shield it from the effects of US sanctions So what can the Europeans do? They have created an elaborate mechanism to facilitate trade with Iran. But it is unclear how effective this has been. Many companies with an international profile would prefer to avoid the risks and choose trade with the US over Iran. European governments are in a double-bind. Relations with Washington have already been soured by this issue. The US wants the JCPOA gone and it is hard to see how the Europeans can do enough by themselves to satisfy Iran to save it. But equally the Europeans, in wanting the nuclear deal to survive, cannot allow Iran to remain in breach of its terms. So a difficult couple of months of diplomacy lie ahead. The US secretary of state arrived in the UK hours after the Iranian nuclear announcement Unless there is a fudge, it is hard to see the JCPOA surviving. The Europeans need to craft some modest understanding that gives Tehran the opportunity to back down and return to full compliance. It cannot be only partly in the JCPOA deal. Washington's unilateral rejection of it at least had the benefit of clarity. Russia and China were also key backers of the JCPOA. They too have a diplomatic part to play, but Washington's position is inevitably causing additional tensions with Moscow and Beijing. Both governments have laid the blame for the JCPOA's problems squarely at Washington's door. The Trump administration must see its ultimate goal - the collapse of the JCPOA - as now being in sight. It will also be applying huge pressure on its European partners who are caught between a rock and a hard place. The Europeans are to some extent ambivalent because they too are concerned about Iran's foreign policy, its support for terrorism, and its missile and missile-export programmes. The US is sending the USS Abraham Lincoln to the Gulf following ""troubling"" Iranian actions This is the context in which tensions are rising. US military warnings are intended to send an unequivocal message that any anti-US actions by Iran or its proxies will have only one return address - Tehran. Is Washington gearing up for a war? Not yet. But the logic of the Trump administration's policy is unforgiving - either Iran radically changes its behaviour, or the US will do as much as it can to bring the Iranian regime down. The danger of conflict - albeit by accident rather than design - is growing. And the collapse of the JCPOA will be another step on the escalatory ladder.

"A boycott of social media sites could force firms to take action to safeguard children, a senior police officer says. Chief Constable Simon Bailey said the companies were able to ""eradicate"" indecent imagery on their platforms. Mr Bailey, the UK's lead officer for child protection, said websites would take notice of ""reputational damage"". The Internet Association, which represents tech firms including Twitter and Facebook, said the industry spent millions removing abusive content. The number of images on the police's child abuse image database has ballooned from less than 10,000 in the 1990s to 13.4 million currently. Starting on Monday, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abusewill hold two weeks of hearings focusing on internet companies' responses,externalto the problem, during which Mr Bailey - and executives from Facebook, Google, Apple, BT and Microsoft - will give evidence. Instagram 'biggest for child grooming online' Facebook and Twitter grilled over MP abuse Viral app Yolo raises abuse concerns Social media effect 'tiny' in teenagers Mr Bailey is the chief constable of Norfolk and also leads on child protection for policing body the National Police Chiefs' Council. He told the Press Association that the government'sonline harms White Paper,externalcould be a ""game changer"", but only if it leads to effective punitive measures. Published last month, the White Paper sets out plans for online safety measures and is currently open for consultation. The White Paper suggests, among other things, that internet sites could be fined or blocked if they fail to tackle issues such as terrorist propaganda and child abuse images. Mr Bailey believes the really big platforms have the technology and funds to ""pretty much eradicate"" indecent imagery - but did not think they were ""taking their responsibilities seriously enough"". ""Ultimately, the financial penalties for some of the giants of this world are going to be an absolute drop in the ocean,"" he said. ""But if the brand starts to become tainted... maybe the damage to that brand will be so significant that they will feel compelled to do something in response. ""We have got to look at how we drive a conversation within our society that says 'do you know what? We are not going to use that any more, that system or that brand or that site because of what they are permitting to be hosted or what they are allowing to take place'."" In response to the calls, the Internet Association said online companies had invested in content moderators and developing technology to remove abusive content. A spokesperson said the companies also work with organisations around the world, including Internet Watch Foundation, a UK-based child abuse watchdog, to remove these images from the internet. ""Internet companies are working hard to get this right and continue to engage with the government's recent online harms White Paper, but we must ensure that any new measures are proportionate and do not damage the significant benefits that the internet brings to the UK."" Facebook says it has removed 8.7 million ""pieces of content"" that violated its policy around child nudity or sexual exploitation of children between July and September last year. Its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said: ""Like Chief Constable Bailey, we think the safety of young people on the internet is of the utmost importance. ""We have strong policies, we are using the most advanced technologies to prevent abuse, we work with experts and the police, and we educate families and young people on the precautions they should take.

"""Crumbs!"" is what Timea Ganji might have said when she noticed the loaf had gone ""a-rye"" A confused ""crust-omer"" opened a loaf of bread only to find the bag was full of crusts. Timea Ganji was hoping to make sandwiches for her children's lunch when she made the unlikely discovery. ""It's not funny first thing in the morning, when you have half an hour to get the kids to school and there's no time to get another loaf,"" she said. Kingsmill said it was investigating how it happened and had posted Mrs Ganji a ""more conventional loaf"". ""It just looked like a normal loaf when we bought it,"" said the 41-year-old, from Radcliffe-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire. ""Because of the yellow packaging, you can't see it properly. You can see it's sliced, but you couldn't see it is all just crusts. ""Then, in the morning, I just wanted some toast and to make sandwiches and I was just staring at it. I don't really understand how it can happen."" Kingsmill said it was investigating how the loaf had left the factory like this The mum-of-two posted photos of the find on Facebook and friends shared ways to use the crusts and old sayings about the benefits of eating them. ""Maybe I'd like curly hair but I don't want a hairy chest,"" she added. ""I don't mind eating them. I love baguettes with butter on them, or an end of sourdough or tiger bread, but these ends are not as tasty. ""You can't make sandwiches with them and the kids won't eat them."" Restaurant owner Mrs Ganji said she had considered adding the bread to a meatloaf or making breadcrumbs. Kingsmill said its bakeries were enclosed and ""would not allow for a loaf consisting solely of crusts to pass through their strict quality control processes"". A spokeswoman said the firm was investigating ""to find out how this particular collection of crusts found its way into Mrs Ganji's shopping"". What can you do with leftover bread? Some ideas fromToo Good To Go,externalandNewsround: Freeze any unused bread before it goes stale and heat it up later Perk up stale bread by sprinkling it with water and heating it in the oven for about 10 minutes Plan ahead and make sure you don't buy more bread than you need Turn it into croutons to put in your soups and salads Make breadcrumbs and use as a topping for macaroni cheese or fish pie Make French toast, bread and butter pudding or Panzanella - an Italian salad.

"This video can not be played Simon Armitage: ""Poetry should respond to climate change"" Poet Simon Armitage, whose ""witty and profound"" work spans sharp observations about modern life and classical myths, is to be the UK's next Poet Laureate. The West Yorkshire writer will hold the historic post for the next decade, taking over from Dame Carol Ann Duffy. Over recent decades, the role has moved away from mainly chronicling royal occasions to promoting poetry and capturing a wider view of British life. Armitage has published 28 collections and is on the national curriculum. His 2017 book The Unaccompaniedwas described by The Guardian,externalas a document of ""a world in social and economic meltdown"". It opens with a poem about climate change called The Last Snowman, and includes another titled Poundland, about ""the Disney design calendar and diary set, three cans of Vimto/cornucopia of potato-based snacks and balm for a sweet tooth"". Carol Ann Duffy began her 10-year stint in 2009 The announcement comes five months after Armitage, from Marsden, won the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry 2018, arguably the most prestigious accolade in poetry behind the laureateship. When that award was announced,Dame Carol Ann noted,externalhow he had ""touched the matter of our lives with characters and subject matter that lived among us: teachers and council tenants, chip shops and television shows, figures who drank in the local pub and shopped in the nearby supermarket"". He has also translated medieval poems about King Arthur and Sir Gawain, retold The Odyssey as a radio play and written Last Days of Troy, a stage play for Shakespeare's Globe and the Manchester Royal Exchange. The 55-year-old is currently professor of poetry at the University of Leeds and served as professor of poetry at the University of Oxford between 2015-2019. He was made a CBE in 2010. His tenure as Poet Laureate will run for a decade. Armitage told BBC News that poetry was ""more valuable and more relevant than it's ever been"". He said: ""I want to celebrate what's best in poetry and build on the work Andrew Motion and Carol Ann Duffy have done over the last two decades in terms of encouraging and identifying talent, particularly among young people, among whom poetry might be a way forward, an outlet."" The poet laureate is an honorary position that is officially appointed by the Queen, acting on advice from the government. He joked that he had ""missed the boat"" to write a poem for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's baby. ""It's been made very clear to me that although the monarch is my line manager, for want of a better word, there are no expectations or obligations in that direction."" He said he planned to use the profile to establish some sort of project or award for writing about climate change, and that he had a dream - ""very possibly completely unrealistic"" - to set up a National Centre for Poetry. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright praised Armitage for his ""witty and profound take on modern life [which] is known and respected across the world"". Mr Wright added: ""He is a very worthy successor to Dame Carol Ann Duffy, who championed the importance of poetry over the past 10 years and made the position relatable to people across the country."" I write in praise of air. I was six or five when a conjurer opened my knotted fist and I held in my palm the whole of the sky. I've carried it with me ever since. Let air be a major god, its being and touch, its breast-milk always tilted to the lips. Both dragonfly and Boeing dangle in its see-through nothingness... Among the jumbled bric-a-brac I keep a padlocked treasure-chest of empty space, and on days when thoughts are fuddled with smog or civilization crosses the street with a white handkerchief over its mouth and cars blow kisses to our lips from theirs I turn the key, throw back the lid, breathe deep. My first word, everyone's first word, was air. By Simon Armitage. Published by Faber & Faber There had been reports that Imtiaz Dharker would be offered the post There had beenreports that Imtiaz Dharker,externalwould be offered the post, buthad decided to turn it down,external. Armitage said he believed there had been ""a lot of discussion behind the scenes"" about whether the job should go to a white man. He stressed that he wanted part of his role to be about amplifying the voices of writers from ""diverse and disadvantaged"" backgrounds. He added that he did not come from the establishment. ""When I grew up in a terraced house on the side of a hill in West Yorkshire, I did not feel like the chosen one,"" he said. ""When I was working as a probation officer in Greater Manchester, dragging junkies out of the gutter and sitting across the table from notorious criminals, it did not feel like a life of privilege. ""I suppose what I'm saying is, I understand to a lesser extent what it means to come from outside the establishment, even if I've arrived at certain established positions, and I need to keep those things in the back of my mind."" The role was established in 1668, and previous Poets Laureate include William Wordsworth, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, John Betjeman and Ted Hughes.

"This video can not be played Video footage appears to show Yemen's Houthi forces in trucks leaving a key port Yemen's Houthi rebels have begun withdrawing from a key strategic port, in the first major step since a ceasefire agreement signed in December. Both the Houthis and government forces agreed to withdraw from Hudaydah port to allow in vital humanitarian aid. Video footage obtained by the BBC shows Houthi forces setting off in trucks. The redeployment is expected to take four days in total. But Yemen's government has accused the rebels of staging a ""ploy"". At least 6,800 civilians have died in Yemen's four-year civil war. Some 10,700 more have been injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations, and many thousands more have died from preventable causes such as malnutrition, disease and poor health. AFP news agency quoted UN spokesman Farhan Haq as confirming that the withdrawal had begun. The process has been described by the UN's special envoy for Yemen as a ""first step"". ""I'm hopeful, but it's a fragile vessel,"" Martin Griffiths told the BBC. ""We have still got a job to do to make sure the government of Yemen is eventually happy with it."" Deep distrust still remains among all parties in the war. Al-Hasan Taher, a senior pro-government official, accused the rebels of replacing themselves with other Houthi militia members dressed in coast guard and police uniforms. ""It's an attempt to disinform the international community,"" he told reporters. But the Houthi movement said its ""unilateral"" pullout showed ""commitment to implement the Hudaydah agreement and to achieving peace"". It called on the UN to press all parties to abide by the agreement. This video can not be played The hidden victims of the Yemen war Hudaydah port is the principal lifeline for two-thirds of Yemen's population. Its closure has had a devastating impact on the nation, which now sits on the brink of famine. Under the deal brokered by the UN in December, the warring parties agreed to withdraw from Hudaydah city and the ports of Hudaydah, Salif and Ras Issa. Yemen conflict in 400 words How my country has changed The rise of Houthi rebels The Houthi withdrawal marks the first major step in bringing that ceasefire agreement into being. The UN has repeatedly appealed to both sides for access to a vast store of grain in Hudaydah port that holds enough food to feed 3.7 million people for a month. Aid workers have been unable to reach the stores for five months, andthe UN previously warned that the grain was at risk of rotting,external. Pro-government forces have twice tried to seize the port, and accuse the Houthis of using it to smuggle in weapons from Iran. The group and Tehran both deny these accusations. Deep distrust between warring parties has stalled this deal for months and continues to plague this first unilateral step by the Houthis. A pullout from the ports is a move of least risk for the Houthis in this strategic corner. They've reinforced in the city of Hudaydah in recent months and can find other means to replace lost revenue. Many of the Coast Guard and port officials are regarded as civil servants who, if this pullout is completed, will run the ports with UN experts. But the Yemeni government suspects the Houthis of moving militia into ports posing as ordinary workers. They're dismissing this unilateral pullout as a ploy. The UN's emphasis, since the Stockholm deal, is on monitoring, not trust. Its patrols are now in place. If this step is deemed genuine, it could create conditions for a wider redeployment of forces from all sides. If it isn't, it could mean the end of what's regarded as the best chance to move toward peace. The conflict has its roots in the failure of a political transition after an Arab Spring uprising that forced its longtime authoritarian President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, in 2011. The Houthi movement, which fought a series of rebellions against Mr Saleh during the previous decade, took advantage of the new president's weakness to take control of their northern heartland of Saada province and neighbouring areas. Houthi supporters at a rally in the capital Sanaa, last month Many ordinary Yemenis supported the Houthis, and in late 2014 and early 2015, the rebels took over the capital Sanaa, forcing President Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. Talks have repeatedly stalled and broken down, and withdrawal deadlines have been missed amid disagreements over who would control the vacated locations. In depth: Why is Yemen at war?

"London Capital & Finance marketing promised high returns Thousands of small-scale investors who lost their savings by investing with London Capital & Finance (LCF) have been given fresh hope they may qualify for compensation. Nearly 12,000 peopleput Â£236m into the firm which collapsed in January. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme said it would ""explore whether there are grounds for compensation"" The compensation body had earlier said investors wouldn't be able to lodge claims as the scheme was unregulated. The FSCS was set up by the government to protect consumers if UK regulated firms went bust. But its chief executive told the BBC in March that it was unlikely LCF customers would get compensation, explaining that the company was not regulated for the purposes of selling its products, which it marketed as low risk investments. However the FSCS has now said it is looking at whether any of the conversations LCF had with investors counted as providing financial advice or whether it conducted other activities which could trigger compensation. The FSCS said LCF investors shouldregister with the FSCS via its website,externalfor updates of its investigation. ""By registering with us they will get regular updates on our investigation and this will be the best way for them to hear whether we believe there are grounds for compensation. ""This is a highly intricate case though, so we expect our investigation may take some time,"" it said. LCF advertised itself as a low-risk ISA, and promised to spread funds from the sale of mini-bonds between hundreds of companies. In reality, the fund did not qualify as an ISA, and the money was only invested in 12 companies - 10 of which were described as ""not independent"" from LCF, in a report by the fund's administrators. The Serious Fraud Office is conducting a probe into individuals associated with LCF. The company's administrators Smith & Williamson released areportwhich found that: There were a number of ""highly suspicious transactions"" involving a ""small group of connected people"" which led to large sums of investors' money ending up in their ""personal possession or control"" A large number of borrowers don't appear to have sufficient assets to pay back LCF investors Some transactions were ""highly suspicious"" or had ""no commercial benefit"" to investors Investors' money was loaned to a complex web of companies, many of which were controlled by people involved in LCF A quarter of all the money invested was paid straight to LCF's marketing company Surge Four targeted over missing millions 'My life savings have been wiped out' Thousands face ruin as Â£236m firm folds Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"About a fifth of Countess of Chester Hospital's patients are from north east Wales A funding dispute in which an English hospital refused to take patients from Wales, apart from emergency and maternity cases, has been resolved. Thousands of people in Flintshire had routinely been using the Countess of Chester Hospital before the row. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said a new cross-border funding deal had now been agreed with UK ministers. Whitehall said it would pay for normal service to resume, with a rise in Welsh Government payments in future. The hospital announced last month it would take fewer patients from Wales, but that it hoped to reverse the decision once a ""national agreement"" had been reached. In awritten statement,externalon Friday, Mr Gething said he expected the hospital to ""honour the agreement reached and reverse the decision not to accept new elective referrals for Welsh patients"". He said he remained ""disappointed"" with the action the hospital taken ""whilst negotiations were ongoing"". ""This was wholly avoidable and a transparent breach of the agreed protocol on cross border healthcare,"" he said. Funding threat in hospital patient row English hospital says no to Wales' patients Minister survives no-confidence vote Vaughan Gething said he hoped patients would be reassured by his statement Mr Gething said changes to ""tariff costs in England since 2017"" had created a ""complex set of issues in relation to cross border arrangements"" but Wales would now be represented on the body advising on those charges. ""We need to fully track policy developments in England that will potentially impact on the tariff in future to aid planning in the Welsh context,"" he added. UK Health Minister Nicola Blackwood said: ""We will provide the necessary funding for this year so thatÂ normal services can resume for local residentsÂ withÂ the Welsh GovernmentÂ committingÂ to cover the costs in future years. ""We sympathise with anyone who was inconvenienced or adversely affected and I'm pleased this is now resolved."" Acting Welsh Tory health spokesman Darren Millar said his assembly group would be ""keeping a close eye on how the Welsh Government moves forward with this situation, holding it to account and ensuring patients are not left to suffer again thanks to its disastrous inability to plan ahead with our healthcare system"". Susan Gilby, chief executive officer for the Countess of Chester NHS trust, said she was ""grateful"" to the two governments and NHS England for ""working hard together to resolve this issue"". ""We now look forward to agreeing a contract with Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in the knowledge that all patients will benefit from the planned safety investments enabled by appropriate resources,"" she added. Betsi Cadwaladr health board chief executive Gary Doherty said: ""We willÂ continue to work closely with the Countess of Chester Hospital to reinstate referrals and ensure that east Flintshire patients can access the services they need at the most appropriate hospital for them.""

"Prakazrel Michel has been charged with making contributions to a presidential campaign A founding member of hip-hop group The Fugees and a Malaysian businessman have been charged with making illegal contributions in the 2012 US presidential election campaign. Low Taek Jho, known as Jho Low, allegedly transferred more than $21m (Â£16m) to musician Prakazrel Michel to make the payments. Mr Michel has appeared in court and pleaded not guilty to the charges. Mr Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, also denies any involvement. Both men have been charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the US government. Mr Michel has been charged with one count of a scheme to conceal material facts and two counts of making a false entry in a record. Mr Low's payments were allegedly made during June and November 2012. Mr Michel reportedly paid $865,000 to around 20 people so that they could make donations in their names to a presidential joint fundraising committee. He also allegedly made more than $1m in donations to a political committee in his name. Court documents claim that they aimed to ""gain access"" to one of the presidential candidates, named as ""Candidate A"". Mr Michel was known to be a strong supporter of Barack Obama, who was re-elected president in that year. Mr Michel's attorney Barry Pollack said: ""Mr. Michel is extremely disappointed that so many years after the fact the government would bring charges related to the 2012 campaign contributions. Mr Michel is innocent of these charges and looks forward to having the case heard by a jury."" A spokesperson for Mr Low said: ""The allegations against Mr Low have no basis in fact. Mr Low has never made any campaign contributions directly or indirectly in the US and he unequivocally denies any involvement in or knowledge of the alleged activities."" Mr Low is facing separate criminal charges in the US in connection with afinancial scandal in Malaysia. He is accused of being involved in the alleged theft of around $4.5bn from Malaysia's investment fund 1MDB.

"A number of MPs are calling on a drug company to make a ""life-changing"" treatment affordable to UK patients. Citing aBBC Newsnight report, MPs across several parties have written to BioMarin, which markets Kuvan but did not initially discover it. The drug, which helps people who have PKU - a rare inherited disorder - is currently not available to NHS patients, as it costs Â£70,000. BioMarin says the NHS has not accepted its ""very competitive"" offer. People with PKU (phenylketonuria) - which affects between one in 10,000 and one in 14,000 people in England - cannot properly digest the amino acid phenylalanine. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and are broken down by the body to make our own proteins. But in people with PKU the levels build up, and can cause brain damage. Kuvan reduces the levels of phenylalanine in many people who have PKU. 'I helped test a wonder drug - then I was denied it' PKU and Kuvan - the campaign for an affordable drug The MPs, who include Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and shadow chancellor John McDonnell, say that BioMarin did not even discover the drug itself but licensed it from a laboratory in Switzerland. It was then researched, using public money, as a treatment for PKU. ""It seems likely that development costs associated with licensing this treatment have been recouped,"" the MPs said in their letter, adding: ""It is matter of public record that BioMarin has generated substantial revenues from Kuvan."" Louise Moorhouse, 35, knows at first-hand the difference Kuvan can make. In her early 20s she took part in trials while it was being developed by the US biotech company. ""Kuvan allowed me to eat a completely normal diet. It was almost like someone had opened curtains on my life and I could see everything in Technicolor,""she told Newsnight. ""It just freed me up so much."" After the trial, Louise was denied further access to Kuvan, but since Newsnight's investigation, BioMarin has said all ex-trial patients will be treated. This video can not be played PKU and Kuvan - the campaign for an affordable drug However, in their letter, MPs say: ""BioMarin currently has no competition for pharmacological treatments for PKU. This monopoly position carries a particular obligation to have regard to your responsibility to patients. ""BioMarin needs to prioritise making this treatment available at an appropriate price across the UK as soon as possible."" The letter, signed by 17 MPs so far and originated from the office of MP Liz Twist, comes amid growing concern about the prices of drugs for rare illnesses across Europe. Under a European incentive scheme to encourage companies to produce treatments for so-called orphan diseases, companies are granted up to 12 years market exclusivity. This is currently under review. The Dutch government, for example, is looking at issuing compulsory licenses if a company does not make a drug affordable. This means another company will be allowed to make the drug at a cheaper price, even when it doesn't hold the patent. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BioMarin says the ""burden and severity of PKU as a disease in the UK is not recognised by NICE or the NHS"". ""Under current cost-effectiveness criteria, [the] NHS expects discount in the range of 80%, making it very difficult to reach a mutually acceptable agreement,"" the company said in a statement. An NHS England spokesperson said: ""The NHS does not offer a blank cheque to pharmaceutical companies. Instead, the NHS works hard to strike deals which give people access to the most clinically effective and innovative medicines, and at a price which is fair and affordable, which is exactly what our patients and the country's taxpayers would expect us to do.""

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We will abolish the youth rate of the minimum wage"" Labour will extend its plans for a higher Â£10-an-hour minimum wage to include workers under the age of 18, party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said. Currently, under-18s are entitled to a minimum wage of Â£4.35 per hour, compared with Â£8.21 for over-25s. But under a Labour government this ""youth rate"" for the minimum wage would be ended in 2020, Mr Corbyn said. One business group said there was value in having the minimum wage set by an independent group, as it is now. Mr Corbyn hadalready pledged to raise the National Living Wage- a legally binding hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over - to Â£10 an hour next year, if Labour gained power. He said Labour's proposal would see workers aged 16 and 17 paid about Â£2,500 more a year. Mr Corbyn said that young people's work ""should be properly valued"" It is not clear how the proposed changes would impact those on apprenticeship schemes. All UK pupils can leave school at the age of 16. But in England, under-18s must then stay in full-time education, start an apprenticeship or traineeship or spend 20 hours or more a week working or volunteering, while in part-time education or training. How high could the minimum wage go? Minimum wage rates rise, but bills go up too 'Older colleagues are paid more than me' Speaking at a party gathering in Birmingham on Saturday, Mr Corbyn said: ""Equal pay for equal work is hardly a controversial idea, so why are we discriminating against young people? ""You don't get a discount at the shops for being under 18. ""But if the person serving you on the other side of the counter is young, they could be on half the wage of their colleagues. ""It's time to end this discrimination. Young people's work should be properly valued, not exploited by employers to cut their wage bill. If they're doing the job, pay them the wage - the real living wage."" The rates are reviewed each year by the government which is advised by the independent Low Pay Commission. The commission, made up of trade unionists, businesspeople and academics, has previously said different minimum wages have been set for different age groups due to ""evidence that younger workers are more at risk of being priced out of jobs than older workers, with worse consequences if they end up unemployed."" 25 and over: Â£8.21 21-24: Â£7.70 18-20: Â£6.15 Under-18: Â£4.35 Apprentice: Â£3.90 Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the proposals were ""dramatic"" and that they could risk reducing the number of 16 and 17-year-olds in work. That age group would not have much experience and were probably not going to be as productive as more experienced workers, he told Radio 4's Today programme. He added that a lot would be working part time - at the weekends or in the holidays - and that experience would be valuable to them and could include training. Labour said it would use fiscal savings from a reduction in the amount that the Treasury pays out in in-work benefits to provide support for small and medium-sized businesses. Peter Dowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the plans aimed to create fairness, claiming that spending on tax credits to top up low wages had ""ballooned"" from Â£1bn to Â£30bn - a sign wages had to rise. ""We've got to have a system that reflects the needs of small businesses, but also has to reflect the needs of the people they employ, whether they are 16 or 60,"" he said. Mr Johnson added that any compensation scheme would ""need to be very clear, transparent and easy."" Responding to Labour's proposals, the Institute of Directors said there was value in having an independent, evidence-based approach from the Low Pay Commission. ""Politicians directly setting rates will always risk not taking full account of the implications for employers and jobs,"" the business lobby group said. There were an estimated 1.35 million 16 to 17-year-olds in the UK at the end of last year Of those, 6% (81,000) were solely in employment 5% (71,000) were neither in work nor education For those not in full-time education, the employment rate of this group has fallen from 65% in 1993 to 44% in 2018 Source:Low Pay Commission Report 2018,external The young worker Student Neha Gohil began her first job as a tutor in Ealing, west London, aged 16. She says that it ""didn't seem fair"" when she learned she was paid less than her older colleagues. Now 20 and a student at the University of Warwick, she says younger workers can be ""more flexible with their time and can offer a different dynamic"". ""They can offer something different in the workplace: be more creative, more innovative. They might know how to do things with technology that someone who's older might not. ""They can go into a company and offer fresh ideas."" The business owner Businessman Jack Palmer, 27, who owns and runs three hairdressing salons in Hertfordshire said he ""can't see it being affordable"". He employs between 12 to 15 people aged 18 to 25. But, he says, if the Â£10 minimum wage was brought in for all, he might only be able to afford to employ half of them. ""If you've got someone coming straight out of school their skill set is pretty minimal to begin with. ""Of course, they learn on the job and through external training - and it gives us a lot of pleasure nurturing that talent. ""They'll get the opportunity to earn a high wage but to begin with, they're not worth that amount,"" he added. Matthew Percival, head of employment at the Confederation of British Industry, said: ""The minimum wage is an important part of the UK labour market and must not be used as a political football. ""Youth rates play an important role in helping to reduce youth unemployment and should be retained."" Chris Philp MP, Conservative vice-chairman for policy, said: ""Under the Conservatives, we have seen youth unemployment fall by half, the biggest increase in the minimum wage for under-25s in a decade and the economy continue to grow, giving young people the security of a better future.""
