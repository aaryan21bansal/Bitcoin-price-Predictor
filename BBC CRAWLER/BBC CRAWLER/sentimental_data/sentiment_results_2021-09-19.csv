"Opponents of President Vladimir Putin have accused Russian authorities of mass election fraud Russian President Vladimir Putin's party has won a parliamentary majority following an election marred by reports of fraud. With almost all of the votes counted, the United Russia party had won nearly 50% of the vote, marking a slight drop in support from the previous election. Mr Putin's biggest critics were barred from running, and there were reports of ballot stuffing and forced voting. Russia's electoral commission rejected claims of widespread irregularities. With more than 99% of votes counted, United Russia's closest rival, the Communist Party, had about 19% of the vote, according to the election commission. United Russia's victory means it will have more than two-thirds of the 450 seats in the country's parliament, officials say. However, despite easily retaining its majority in parliament, the party did lose some ground. In 2016, the party won 54% of the vote. The Communists, who broadly support Mr Putin's initiatives in the parliament, saw their support grow by about 6%. But their leader, Gennady Zyuganov, has alleged widespread violations, including ballot-stuffing, according to the Associated Press news agency. The final results will be announced on Friday, Russia's Electoral Commission head Ella Pamfilova said. Concerns over living standards and allegations of corruption from jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny have likely affected support for Mr Putin's party. But he remains popular with many Russians who credit him with standing up to the West and restoring national pride. In a TV address on Monday, Mr Putin thanked voters for their trust and said United Russia had confirmed its role as the leading party. Supporters of Mr Navalny have called for protests and condemned the result as illegitimate. For Russia's party of power, it's job done. United Russia is confident that it has retained its parliamentary majority, albeit with a slightly smaller share of the vote than last time round. Judging by last night's celebrations at party headquarters, the party faithful are more than pleased with the result. United Russia insists it won this race fair and square. But even before the first ballots were cast in the marathon vote, this election looked anything but fair. The Kremlin's most vocal critics had been barred from running - among them, supporters of Mr Navalny. Then there was the voting process itself. Over three days of polling there were allegations of widespread electoral fraud, including ballot box stuffing and threats against election observers. Video widely shared online showed people stuffing papers into ballot boxes. Mr Navalny and his allies had called on Russians to vote tactically, in many cases for Communist Party candidates they believed could defeat incumbents from United Russia. But this has not prevented the Kremlin's party from securing a large slice of the new parliament. The election saw a number of cities introduce electronic voting. One such city was the capital, Moscow, where some Communist Party candidates lost leads when electronic votes were declared at the last minute. ""I know that such a result is simply not possible,"" one defeated Communist candidate, Mikhail Lobanov, wrote on Twitter. This video can not be played Footage has emerged which allegedly shows fraud taking place during Russia's election For the first time since 1993, election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were not present due to limitations imposed by Russian authorities. A European Union spokesman said the elections were not properly monitored, nor conducted in a free and fair way. The governments of the UK, Germany and the US echoed this. On Monday, independent vote monitoring group Golos - which the Russian authorities have branded ""a foreign agent"" - said it had received about 5,000 reports of possible voting violations. Russia's interior ministry, meanwhile, told reporters it had not registered any ""significant violations"". During the three-day vote, videos published on social media had shown long queues outside some polling stations. Interfax news agency reported this was especially the case outside police stations. But the Kremlin spokesman rejected claims that it was an indication of people being put under pressure to vote. The vote took place over three days But Golos said it had received""numerous messages"" from people who said they were being forced,externalby their employers to vote, as well as allegations of electoral fraud. In parts of east Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists, residents with Russian citizenship were allowed to vote, with some crossing the border to visit Russian polling stations. There has also been anger after a Smart Voting app, devised by Mr Navalny, wasremoved from Apple and Google stores on the day Russians started voting. Russian authorities had threatened the two companies with big fines if they refused to drop the app, which told users who could unseat ruling party candidates. It is not yet clear whether the app had any impact on how people voted. Opposition crushed ahead of managed polls Russia bans Navalny-linked organisations ""This is truly unbelievable,"" Mr Navalny's spokesperson Kira Yarmysh told AFP. ""I remember the feeling in 2011, when they stole the election. The same is happening right now."" Mr Navalny led mass protests against the government in 2011 following parliamentary elections critics said were riddled with fraud. President Putin thanked voters for putting trust in his party, United Russia One Moscow pensioner, who gave his name only as Anatoly, told Reuters news agency he voted for the ruling party as he appreciated Mr Putin's efforts to restore Russia's influence on the world stage. ""Countries like the United States and Britain more or less respect us now like they respected the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 70s. The Anglo-Saxons only understand the language of force,"" he said. But with official turnout reported to be about 52%, there were signs of widespread indifference. ""I don't see the point in voting,"" said one Moscow hairdresser who gave her name as Irina. ""It's all been decided for us anyway.""

"This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China Australia has defended its decision to scrap a multi-billion dollar submarine purchase from France in favour of a new security pact with the US and UK. Prime Minister Scott Morrison rejected accusations that Australia had lied, saying France should have been aware it was prepared to break the deal. France says the Aukus pact has led to a ""serious crisis"" between the allies. In an unprecedented move, it has recalled its ambassadors from the US and Australia as a sign of protest. Under the Aukus pact, Australia will be given the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines as a way of countering China's influence in the contested South China Sea. The partnership has ended a deal worth $37bn (Â£27bn) signed by Australia in 2016 for France to build 12 conventional submarines. France says it was informed of the pact only hours before the public announcement was made earlier this week. Mr Morrison on Sunday said he understood France's disappointment, but that he had always been clear about Australia's position. The French government ""would have had every reason to know that we had deep and grave concerns"", he said. ANALYSIS:Aukus pact delivers France some hard truths EXPLAINED:Why this pact signals a major shift BACKGROUND:Tensions in the South China Sea ""Ultimately this was a decision about whether the submarines that were being built, at great cost to the Australian taxpayer, were going to be able to do a job that we needed it to do when they went into service and our strategic judgment based on the best possible of intelligence and defence advice was that it would not."" Mr Morrison's comments came after French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France 2 television there had been ""lying, duplicity, a major breach of trust and contempt"" over the deal. He said France's ambassadors to the US and Australia were being recalled to ""re-evaluate the situation"", but that there had been ""no need"" to recall the ambassador to the UK, which he described as a ""third wheel"". US President Joe Biden is expected to hold talks with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in the coming days. ""We want explanations,"" French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Sunday. Meanwhile, newly appointed UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss defended the agreement in an article for The Sunday Telegraph, saying it showed Britain's readiness to be ""hard-headed"" in defence of its interests. The pact means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. It will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies. China has accused the three powers involved in the security pact of having a ""Cold War mentality"". Clumsy diplomacy, heightened emotions and spy-like secrecy: the row over the new security pact between the UK, the US and Australia has it all. But amid the increasingly shrill invective from humiliated French ministers, there is a fundamental truth: the West is struggling to make up its mind about China. Washington has now been joined by Canberra and London in acting together to address the security challenge. Other countries - particularly some in Europe - are less hawkish, still trying to split the difference between economic cooperation and strategic competition with Beijing. France is furious at the breach of contract by Australia and the lack of trust shown by the US and the UK. So there is talk in the French papers of further retaliation, beyond the recall of ambassadors, perhaps involving Nato. Others are speculating this row might finally encourage Europe to agree some greater strategic autonomy. The truth is more straightforward: if the West wishes to protect its interests in the Indo-Pacific, then France and other European powers need to be on the same page as the US and its Anglophone allies. And right now both sides are not even reading the same book.

"This video can not be played Lib Dem conference: Sir Ed Davey angry over Conservatives' handling of social care crisis Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says his party is the ""gathering point"" for everyone ""fed up with the indecency and incompetence"" of government. Addressing the Lib Dem conference, he told delegates they can deprive Boris Johnson of a majority at the next election. He announced a Â£5bn voucher scheme plan to help pupils catch up after the pandemic. And he vowed to fight for a ""fair deal"" for carers, parents and businesses. Lib Dems call for Covid laws to be scrapped Lib Dems: Is Davey sticking to his promises? Lib Dems seize Tory seat in by-election upset Sir Ed's conference speech is the first to a live audience since becoming party leader last year. Most of the event is being held online due to pandemic concerns. Addressing a small audience of about 100 delegates at London's Canary Wharf, he pointed to success in June'sChesham and Amersham by-election-  where the Lib Dems overturned a  a 16,000 Tory majority to win by more than 8,000 votes - as evidence that ""the Tories can be beaten"" in traditional, so-called ""blue wall"" seats. On education, Sir Ed said  a ""massive Covid education catch-up plan is urgent"" as the UK emerges from the pandemic. He said Liberal Democrats would give families a Â£200 voucher per child - paid directly to parents - to spend on activities such as extra tutoring, music or sports clubs. The Â£5bn scheme would make supporting parents and children the ""top priority"" in a ""new fair deal"", he said, and would enable the ""most radical empowering of parents ever"". That extra support ""would be doubled and in some cases tripled"" for children in care, disadvantaged children and those will special educational needs. Sir Ed said his party will fight for a ""fair deal"" and aim to appeal to those who feel ""taken for granted"" by the Conservatives. Referring to the prime minister'sÂ£36bn health and social care levy,Sir Ed said it was ""little more than an unfair tax rise for workers and businesses"". He said as a carer himself for his son he ""felt angry"" at the prime minister's ""claim to have fixed the crisis in social care"", describing it as ""just another of his broken promises"". He criticised the plan for failing to tackle a ""dangerous shortage of care staff"" and said that those workers would be hit with a tax hike and ""heartless universal credit cuts"". He pledged that his party would ""empower carers"" by giving them their own budget and control over care provision such as when the family carer gets a break. Sir Ed said the tax-free allowance against employers, national insurance contributions should be ""raised substantially"" and that the biggest businesses would pay more tax under Lib Dem plans. ""The world's richest bosses might be racing each other to go to Mars, but before lift-off, they can pay their taxes here on Planet Earth"" he added. On the issue of climate action, he said the UK should be leading the world by banning new oil, gas and coal companies from the London Stock Exchange. That would stop ""the flow of money from your pension funds into the dirty industries of the past"" he added. Catch-up vouchers are a clear pitch to parents who the Lib Dems are keen to attract. Post-pandemic the party believes it can capitalise on what many said was the government's mishandling of the impact on education. And it fits with their broader appeal to those they say have been taken for granted or left behind by Boris Johnson's government. But there's a danger it's seen as an expensive giveaway which would put some cautious Conservative voters off. And competence when it comes to the economy will be crucial if the Lib Dem's are to present themselves as a credible alternative. In a pre-speech interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Sir Ed was asked about the party's attitude to trans rights after an activist, Natalie Bird, was banned from standing as an MP for wearing a T-shirt featuring the words ""woman adult human female"". He said all spaces should be open to everyone, regardless of their gender, because the issue was one of human rights. ""A trans woman is a woman, a trans man is a man"" he added. Sir Ed added that transgender people are ""some of the most discriminated against"" and he accused the prime minister of toxifying the debate around rights.

"The UK's sixth largest energy company, Bulb, is seeking a bailout to stay afloat amid surging wholesale gas prices. The company, with 1.7m customers, is working with the investment bank Lazard to try to shore up its balance sheet. It is the latest energy company battling to avoid going bust, with at least four smaller UK firms expected togo out of business next week. High global demand for gas has caused a recent surge in wholesale prices. A bailout for Bulb could come as part of a joint venture or merger with another company, with a further option being a cash injection from investors, according to the Financial Times, who firstreported the story.,external In a statement, Bulb told the BBC: ""From time to time we explore various opportunities to fund our business plans and further our mission to lower bills and lower CO2. ""Like everyone in the industry, we're monitoring wholesale prices and their impact on our business."" US CO2 firm boss flies to UK for crisis gas talks 'UK not seeing risks to supplies right now' Are energy bills going up and what can I do? Industry group Oil & Gas UK said wholesale prices for gas had increased by 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August. The price hike has left some companies unable to provide their customers with the energy they have paid for. However, if a supplier fails, energy regulator Ofgem will ensure supplies continue for affected households, and they will not lose money owed to them. A new energy supplier would be responsible for taking on any credit balances a customer may have. Four small energy companies ceased trading in recent weeks, including Edinburgh-based People's Energy, which supplied gas and electricity to about 350,000 homes and 1,000 businesses, and Dorset-based Utility Point which had 220,000 customers. At the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK, but industry sources have said there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year. The rise in gas prices has not only affected companies supplying energy, but food firms and supermarkets who use gas, in particular carbon dioxide, to deliver and store produce. CO2 is also used to stun animals before slaughter and as a coolant agent in transport. US firm CF Industries, the UK's biggest CO2 producer, stopped production at its Teesside and Cheshire fertiliser plants due to the gas prices, which has sparked concern across the food production industry. Richard Walker, managing director of supermarket Iceland,tweeted,externalthat CO2 was ""essential for a wide range of food and medical uses"". ""Yet 60% of the UK's supply comes from only two sites, owned by one foreign company, who have decided to close due to profitability,"" he added. ""Surely matters of national security should be state-controlled?"" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has held talks over the gas shortages with the boss of the US company, Tony Will, whoflew into the UK on Sunday. Mr Kwarteng said he was ""confident security of supply can be maintained under a wide range of scenarios"". He said he would host further talks with the energy industry and consumer groups on Monday. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive Energy UK, the industry's trade body, said talks with the government focused on how companies got through the current period with as little impact on customers as possible. ""The whole of the energy sector is facing unprecedented prices,"" she told the BBC ""We are reliant on a volatile international commodity in the UK because we are highly dependent on gas both in our own homes where we burn it for heat. ""We do that at a level beyond our European neighbours, but also for our power sector and other uses in the economy, so when we get an unprecedentedly high price there are unprecedented impacts on the market.""

"The boss of a US company that supplies 60% of the UK's food-grade carbon dioxide supply has held crisis talks with the government over shortages. Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, arrived in the UK earlier after the firm stopped production at its two fertiliser plants because of soaring wholesale gas prices. Food firms are warning a shortage of CO2 is threatening produce supplies. High global demand for gas has been blamed for the recent surge in prices. Carbon dioxide is used to stun animals prior to slaughter and in dry ice form to keep food fresh for storage and transport. It is a by-product of fertiliser manufacturing.

One supermarket executive told the BBC the CO2 issue is ""escalating quickly"" and was causing a ""big supply issue"". ""The big meat suppliers are saying they have two to three days' supply and are now having to prioritise how they use what they have,"" he said. He said the problem ""compounds"" supply issues the food, drink and supermarket industries are already facing due to shortages of HGV drivers in the UK, caused partly by the pandemic and Brexit. The British Poultry Council said that the supply chains will ""inevitably slow down"" if CO2 supplies become tighter and more unpredictable in the next five to seven days. A spokeswoman said product types might be reduced as meat companies streamline production to try to cut down the impact of shortages. Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, stressed that the UK was not going to run out of food, but said there would be ""major concerns"" over supply to supermarkets and other food outlets. He suggested the government would need to take an ""innovative"" approach to dealing with the shortage of CO2, such as perhaps subsidising companies who produce the gas over the next four or five weeks.

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?

"This video can not be played Kwasi Kwarteng: Talk of the lights going out is âalarmist, unhelpful and completely misguided"" There is ""no question of the lights going out"" this winter as a result of huge rises in gas prices, the business secretary has said. Kwasi Kwarteng said he does ""not expect supply emergencies"" and described warnings about shortages as ""alarmist"". His statement comes as smaller energy providers battle to stay afloat due to gas price hikes making price promises to customers undeliverable. High demand for gas and reduced supply are behind a surge in wholesale prices. Customers are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which is the maximum price they can be charged on a standard tariff. However, the cap means energy firms are unable to pass on higher wholesale costs to their customers, which is forcing some - mostly smaller companies - to go out of business. So far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. On Sunday, the UK's sixth largest energy company,Bulb, announced it is seeking a bailout. The government has said it is considering offering emergency state-backed loans to surviving energy companies to encourage them to take on customers from bust firms. Mr Kwarteng said the government would ""not be bailing out failed companies"" and said the sector had seen a ""regular entry and exit"" over the past five to 10 years. ""The current global situation may see more suppliers than usual exiting the market but this is not something that should be any cause for alarm or panic,"" he said. ""The taxpayer should not be expected to prop up companies which have poor business models and are not resilient to fluctuations in price."" Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up' How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? 'UK not seeing risks to supplies right now' Are energy bills going up and what can I do? The business secretary said the government wanted to protect customers from ""price spikes"" and that the energy industry should not  return to the ""cosy oligopoly"" of years past where a few large suppliers ""dictated to customers conditions and pricing"". At the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK, but industry sources have said there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year. Mr Kwarteng added the UK benefited from having a ""diverse range of gas supply sources"" and had ""more than sufficient capacity, to meet demand"". Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned that UK families were going to be hit by a ""triple whammy"" of tax rises, fuel costs and the end of the Universal Credit uplift this winter. Industry group Oil & Gas UK has said wholesale prices for gas had increased by 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August. The increase has been blamed on several factors, including a cold winter which left stocks lower than usual, high demand for liquefied natural gas from Asia, and lower supplies from other countries. Low winds meaning less renewable energy is being generated and outages at some nuclear stations have also contributed. It has left some companies unable to provide their customers with the energy they have paid for. However, if a supplier fails, energy regulator Ofgem will ensure supplies continue for affected households, and they will not lose money owed to them. A new energy supplier would be responsible for taking on any credit balances a customer may have, but consumers may end up on more expensive tariffs when they are switched. Aside from gas prices driving up energy bills, millions of households in England, Wales and Scotland are already facing a 12% rise in their energy bills from October when a higher price cap comes into force. Some of the largest energy companies have argued the current price cap on tariff - supported by both Labour and Conservative politicians - has helped trigger the current crisis. ""You can legislate to protect the consumer - but that can bankrupt the supplier,"" said one senior industry source. However, Mr Kwarteng said the energy price cap was ""not going anywhere"". Ofgem will review the price cap in February. There has been speculation that the energy regulator could lift the cap between now and next year to allow firms to charge customers more to cope with rising wholesale gas prices. Stacey Stothard is waiting to see how much more she will have to pay Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity. She saved Â£300 - or so she thought. Her new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year. ""It is just like watching the meter go up and up,"" she says. ""I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record."" Read more about her story here. Earlier on Tuesday, several smaller energy firms wrote an open letter sent to the prime minister, chancellor, business secretary and Ofgem, which stated they felt there ""voice, as suppliers of all different sizes, has not been heard"". Signed by the likes of Green, AMPower, Neon Reef and Tru Energy, it called for a support package for all suppliers, a review of the price cap and for smaller firms to be included in future discussions on the future of the energy market. It was critical of Ofgem, saying it was ""currently unfit to regulate an industry they have appeared to have a vested interest in or turning a blind eye to the market returning to a selective monopoly and a reduction in competition"". In a joint statement on gas prices, Mr Kwarteng and Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley reiterated that the current crisis was ""not an issue of supply"". The pair said there was a consensus among energy suppliers and consumer groups that the ""top priority"" must be support for customers, ""especially the elderly and vulnerable"". ""In the event an energy supplier fails, we are committed that consumers face the least amount of disruption possible - and there are clear and well-established processes in place to ensuring this is the case,"" they added. As a result of gas prices booming, energy intensive fertiliser producers have shut down, which has created a shortage of the by-product of production, carbon dioxide. Food manufacturers and supermarkets have urged action because carbon dioxide is used to stun animals prior to slaughter and to keep food fresh for storage and transport. Supermarket Iceland's managing director Richard Walker told the BBC the carbon dioxide shortage must be prioritised to limit any potential disruption for supermarket supplies, which are also being affected due to a shortage in HGV drivers in the UK, partly caused by the pandemic and Brexit. Supermarket Ocado said it had ""limited stock"" of some frozen items due to gas shortages, while another supermarket told the BBC the situation was ""escalating quickly"". Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here.

"Challis was born in Bristol in 1942 but moved to south-east London with his parents when he was one Tributes have been paid to John Challis, best known for playing Boycie in BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses, who has died at the age of 79. His family said he died ""peacefully in his sleep, after a long battle with cancer"". Co-star Sir David Jason said he was ""a wonderful actor"" and ""a gentleman in the true sense of the word"". Challis's character - unscrupulous second-hand car dealer Terrance Aubrey Boyce - was a firm favourite with fans. Challis starred in the show, alongside Sir David and Nicholas Lyndhurst, throughout its time on air from 1981 right through to the final show in 2003. The character - who was both a long-time former schoolmate and devious rival of Sir David's character Del Boy - was initially due to appear in just one scene, but the part grew in prominence as the series progressed. How John Challis created one of comedy's great characters John Challis on 'unbelievable' Only Fools legacy In fact he was so popular with viewers that, when Only Fools and Horses ended its long run, the BBC developed a spin-off show following the continuing adventures of Boycie and long-suffering wife Marlene. The Green Green Grass ran for four series. Sue Holderness, who played Marlene, also paid tribute to Challis, describing him as her ""beloved friend"". ""Marlene without Boycie - it's unthinkable,"" she said. ""John Challis was my partner on screen and stage for 36 years and my beloved friend. RIP darling John. I will miss you every day."" And Steven Woodcock, who played Jevon in the sitcom, said Challis was a ""fantastic actor and wonderful person, amazing to work with. There is no Del Boy without Boycie. RIP my Peckham pal"". Boycie was usually found at the Nag's Head pub, alongside wife Marlene, with a cigar in one hand and a large cognac in the other In a statement, Challis's family said: ""He will always be loved for being 'Boycie' and leaves a great legacy of work that will continue to bring pleasure and smiles for many years to come. ""Be assured that in the future there will be an occasion to celebrate John's life - when everyone will be welcome to come along."" Jeff Nicholson, the actor playing Boycie in the Only Fools and Horses musical due to reopen next month, said Challis had told him to ""carry the torch for us"" shortly before his death. He said Challis had been supportive of him when they met and given the cast his ""seal of approval"" when the show premiered at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in February, before closing soon after due to the pandemic. Describing Challis as ""a real stand-up actor"", he said the pair had struck up a ""nice relationship"" in lockdown, with Challis always asking for updates on the theatre production. The BBC's chief content officer Charlotte Moore said Challis was ""a wonderful actor who will forever be remembered for playing Boycie in Only Fools and Horses - a character so well loved by millions"". Challis happily played Boycie on screen for decades - and even adopted the persona in appearances in other entertainment shows, fan conventions and evenin a video message this year,externaladvocating the wearing of face-coverings in public places to help fight Covid.

But he also showed his range as a Shakespearean actor when he performed in open-air performances of Richard III and a Midsummer's Night Dream that were staged in Regents Park in London in 1995, right at the height of the popularity of Only Fools and Horses. More recently he played Monty Staines in ITV show Benidorm. Actress Crissy Rock, who appeared alongside Challis in the show, said she was heartbroken. Shetweeted,external: ""John you were a true gentleman and always so loving and supportive towards me. I am thinking of your family and close friends at this hard time. Rest well. Crissy xx"" Earlier this month,Challis cancelled a speaking tourdue to ill health. He was due to appear in 30 scheduled dates, billed as an ""intimate evening with John Challis"", but had to cancel the tour after one date. Others paying tribute ranged fromThe Three Degrees singer Sheila Ferguson,externaltoUS rapper and actor Ice T,external, who wrote: ""He somehow became a Twitter friend... I'm very sad. Although I never met him in person, internet friends can become close."" Former heavyweight champion boxer Frank Brunoalso tweeted his condolences,external. ""(He) used to say to me 'Franklyn my dear boy how the devil are you boxed anybody round the ears recently?' Loved all the TV he did."" Challis recently became an honorary citizen of Serbia, where Only Fools and Horses remains hugely popular. He travelled to the Balkan country as part of a documentary, Boycie In Belgrade, which explored why the show was so well-loved there. Although he was famed for his nasal south London twang as Boycie, he was actually born in Bristol and only moved to London as a young child. In a quirk of fate, much of his career as an on-screen Londoner was spent in Bristol where Only Fools and Horses was largely filmed. Delivering his trademark sneering laugh when he tricks Del Boy and Rodney into bursting into a wake dressed as Batman and Robin, because he'd ""forgotten"" to tell them the man hosting the fancy dress party had in fact died. Revealing his middle name as Aubrey in a sÃ©ance held by Elsie Partridge, but dismissing her skills, saying: ""If Elsie Partridge really could raise the dead, half the money lenders in Peckham would be employing her."" Demonstrating his ""devotion"" to Marlene by rejecting a suggestion that he had murdered her and hidden the body with the retort: ""I have never been so insulted in my life. You know how much I spent on that garden. You think I'm going to dig a hole in it?"" Raising the stakes in a poker game with Del and revealing he has four kings (""un, deux, trois, quatre"") to claim ownership of Del's flat. The smile is wiped off his face by Del's four aces, which he tells Boycie ""came from the same place as your four kings"". Boycie's grudging commentary when helping Del and Rodney escape the Mafia in Miami: ""We were having a lovely holiday and then they turn up. Within 15 seconds, some sod's shooting at us.""

"First Minister Mark Drakeford and Adam Price's groups are still in talks over a co-operation agreement Changing the council tax system could be part of any potential Labour-Plaid deal in the Senedd, according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford said the talks were necessary because Welsh Labour has no overall majority to deal with ""challenging and ambitious issues"". Both parties are continuing to discuss""an ambitious co-operation agreement"". Plaid members are not expected to enter government as a deal is likely to fall short of a formal coalition. BBC Wales has been told a deal would likely includea number of policies that both parties work together on delivering. Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru promised to reform council tax in their manifestos for May's Senedd election. What could Labour and Plaid Cymru work on? Welsh Labour and Plaid in co-operation talks Welsh Parliament 'needs 20-30 more politicians' The last council tax revaluation in Wales was undertaken in 2003 Labour did not commit to any particular proposals beyond""reforming council tax to ensure a fairer system for all"".,external Plaid Cymru's manifesto pledged to ""undertake a revaluation, increase the number of bands at the higher end of house valuations, and ensure that council tax is more proportional to the value of properties"". Thelast council tax revaluation in Wales,externalwas undertaken in 2003. Plaid also promised to ""bring forward proposals for a new and fairer land and property tax... to replace first business rates, and then, council tax"". Labour matched its best ever Senedd result in May's election,winning 30 of the 60 seats in Cardiff Bay. Speaking onBBC Radio Cymru's Dewi Llwydprogramme, First Minister Mark Drakeford explained his party would not be able to ""pass a single piece of legislation with 30 votes, you can't pass a budget through the Senedd either"". Asked for an example of a policy that could be included in any deal with Plaid Cymru, he suggested changes to council tax. ""But it is very difficult to do because some people lose out, a lot of people win,"" Mr Drakeford explained. Speaking on theBBC Politics Walesprogramme, Plaid Cymru Senedd Member Rhys ab Owen saidhe would like to see Senedd reform,a national care system, and the issue of second homes included in any deal.

"The UK's sixth largest energy company, Bulb, is seeking a bailout to stay afloat amid surging wholesale gas prices. The company, with 1.7m customers, is working with the investment bank Lazard to try to shore up its balance sheet. It is the latest energy company battling to avoid going bust, with at least four smaller UK firms expected togo out of business next week. High global demand for gas has caused a recent surge in wholesale prices. A bailout for Bulb could come as part of a joint venture or merger with another company, with a further option being a cash injection from investors, according to the Financial Times, who firstreported the story.,external In a statement, Bulb told the BBC: ""From time to time we explore various opportunities to fund our business plans and further our mission to lower bills and lower CO2.

Industry group Oil & Gas UK said wholesale prices for gas had increased by 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August. The price hike has left some companies unable to provide their customers with the energy they have paid for. However, if a supplier fails, energy regulator Ofgem will ensure supplies continue for affected households, and they will not lose money owed to them. A new energy supplier would be responsible for taking on any credit balances a customer may have. Four small energy companies ceased trading in recent weeks, including Edinburgh-based People's Energy, which supplied gas and electricity to about 350,000 homes and 1,000 businesses, and Dorset-based Utility Point which had 220,000 customers. At the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK, but industry sources have said there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year. The rise in gas prices has not only affected companies supplying energy, but food firms and supermarkets who use gas, in particular carbon dioxide, to deliver and store produce. CO2 is also used to stun animals before slaughter and as a coolant agent in transport.

"The boss of a US company that supplies 60% of the UK's food-grade carbon dioxide supply has held crisis talks with the government over shortages. Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, arrived in the UK earlier after the firm stopped production at its two fertiliser plants because of soaring wholesale gas prices. Food firms are warning a shortage of CO2 is threatening produce supplies. High global demand for gas has been blamed for the recent surge in prices. Carbon dioxide is used to stun animals prior to slaughter and in dry ice form to keep food fresh for storage and transport. It is a by-product of fertiliser manufacturing. Last week, CF Industries, the UK's biggest CO2 producer, stopped production at its Teesside and Cheshire fertiliser plants ""due to high natural gas prices"". Wholesale gas prices have jumped by 250% since January, according to Oil & Gas UK, the industry group. Carbon dioxide 'threatens food security' Gas prices: Are energy bills going up and what can I do? CF Industries said it did not ""have an estimate for when production will resume"". The BBC has also been told that officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy have been ""working with"" the company in recent days. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwartengtweeted,externalthat he had met Mr Will and ""discussed the pressures the business is facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies, including to our food and energy industries"". Food producers and supermarkets have warned of the impact CO2 shortages are having on the industry. Ranjit Singh Boparan, owner of UK poultry giant 2 Sisters Food Group, said the decision by CT Industries to halt operations, was a ""massive body blow"" for the food sector and placed it ""at breaking point"". Adam Couch, the boss of pork producer Cranswick said the industry was ""already at tipping point ahead of the demanding Christmas period"". ""We have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep food on the shelves, but there is a real risk of product shortages across the country if the government does not act immediately to address these issues,"" he added. Supermarket Ocado said it had ""limited stock"" of some frozen items due to gas shortages, while another supermarket told the BBC the situation was ""escalating quickly"". One supermarket executive told the BBC the CO2 issue is ""escalating quickly"" and was causing a ""big supply issue"". ""The big meat suppliers are saying they have two to three days' supply and are now having to prioritise how they use what they have,"" he said. He said the problem ""compounds"" supply issues the food, drink and supermarket industries are already facing due to shortages of HGV drivers in the UK, caused partly by the pandemic and Brexit. The British Poultry Council said that the supply chains will ""inevitably slow down"" if CO2 supplies become tighter and more unpredictable in the next five to seven days. A spokeswoman said product types might be reduced as meat companies streamline production to try to cut down the impact of shortages. Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, stressed that the UK was not going to run out of food, but said there would be ""major concerns"" over supply to supermarkets and other food outlets. He suggested the government would need to take an ""innovative"" approach to dealing with the shortage of CO2, such as perhaps subsidising companies who produce the gas over the next four or five weeks. ""Or the knock-on effects of this may well be felt right the way through to the end of the year and particularly over the key Christmas trading period,"" said Mr Wright. Mr Kwarteng has been in talks with energy suppliers as well as the energy regulator Ofgem over the weekend amid fearsmore small companies could go bust in the coming days. COP26 president Alok Sharma told BBC's Andrew Marr Show that people should not be concerned about the risk to the supply of gas. And he said the energy price cap and warm homes discount - two cost-limiting measures - would protect people. An Ofgem spokesperson said: ""Ofgem continues to work closely with government and industry to ensure consumers continue to be protected while global gas prices are high and will speak further on these issues at the industry roundtable [on Monday].""

"Challis was born in Bristol in 1942 but moved to south-east London with his parents when he was one Tributes have been paid to John Challis, best known for playing Boycie in BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses, who has died at the age of 79. His family said he died ""peacefully in his sleep, after a long battle with cancer"". Co-star Sir David Jason said he was ""a wonderful actor"" and ""a gentleman in the true sense of the word"". Challis's character - unscrupulous second-hand car dealer Terrance Aubrey Boyce - was a firm favourite with fans. Challis starred in the show, alongside Sir David and Nicholas Lyndhurst, throughout its time on air from 1981 right through to the final show in 2003. The character - who was both a long-time former schoolmate and devious rival of Sir David's character Del Boy - was initially due to appear in just one scene, but the part grew in prominence as the series progressed. How John Challis created one of comedy's great characters John Challis on 'unbelievable' Only Fools legacy In fact he was so popular with viewers that, when Only Fools and Horses ended its long run, the BBC developed a spin-off show following the continuing adventures of Boycie and long-suffering wife Marlene. The Green Green Grass ran for four series. Sue Holderness, who played Marlene, also paid tribute to Challis, describing him as her ""beloved friend"". ""Marlene without Boycie - it's unthinkable,"" she said. ""John Challis was my partner on screen and stage for 36 years and my beloved friend. RIP darling John. I will miss you every day."" And Steven Woodcock, who played Jevon in the sitcom, said Challis was a ""fantastic actor and wonderful person, amazing to work with. There is no Del Boy without Boycie. RIP my Peckham pal"". Boycie was usually found at the Nag's Head pub, alongside wife Marlene, with a cigar in one hand and a large cognac in the other In a statement, Challis's family said: ""He will always be loved for being 'Boycie' and leaves a great legacy of work that will continue to bring pleasure and smiles for many years to come. ""Be assured that in the future there will be an occasion to celebrate John's life - when everyone will be welcome to come along."" Jeff Nicholson, the actor playing Boycie in the Only Fools and Horses musical due to reopen next month, said Challis had told him to ""carry the torch for us"" shortly before his death. He said Challis had been supportive of him when they met and given the cast his ""seal of approval"" when the show premiered at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in February, before closing soon after due to the pandemic. Describing Challis as ""a real stand-up actor"", he said the pair had struck up a ""nice relationship"" in lockdown, with Challis always asking for updates on the theatre production. The BBC's chief content officer Charlotte Moore said Challis was ""a wonderful actor who will forever be remembered for playing Boycie in Only Fools and Horses - a character so well loved by millions"". Challis happily played Boycie on screen for decades - and even adopted the persona in appearances in other entertainment shows, fan conventions and evenin a video message this year,externaladvocating the wearing of face-coverings in public places to help fight Covid.

But he also showed his range as a Shakespearean actor when he performed in open-air performances of Richard III and a Midsummer's Night Dream that were staged in Regents Park in London in 1995, right at the height of the popularity of Only Fools and Horses. More recently he played Monty Staines in ITV show Benidorm. Actress Crissy Rock, who appeared alongside Challis in the show, said she was heartbroken. Shetweeted,external: ""John you were a true gentleman and always so loving and supportive towards me. I am thinking of your family and close friends at this hard time. Rest well. Crissy xx"" Earlier this month,Challis cancelled a speaking tourdue to ill health. He was due to appear in 30 scheduled dates, billed as an ""intimate evening with John Challis"", but had to cancel the tour after one date. Others paying tribute ranged fromThe Three Degrees singer Sheila Ferguson,externaltoUS rapper and actor Ice T,external, who wrote: ""He somehow became a Twitter friend... I'm very sad. Although I never met him in person, internet friends can become close."" Former heavyweight champion boxer Frank Brunoalso tweeted his condolences,external. ""(He) used to say to me 'Franklyn my dear boy how the devil are you boxed anybody round the ears recently?' Loved all the TV he did."" Challis recently became an honorary citizen of Serbia, where Only Fools and Horses remains hugely popular. He travelled to the Balkan country as part of a documentary, Boycie In Belgrade, which explored why the show was so well-loved there. Although he was famed for his nasal south London twang as Boycie, he was actually born in Bristol and only moved to London as a young child. In a quirk of fate, much of his career as an on-screen Londoner was spent in Bristol where Only Fools and Horses was largely filmed. Delivering his trademark sneering laugh when he tricks Del Boy and Rodney into bursting into a wake dressed as Batman and Robin, because he'd ""forgotten"" to tell them the man hosting the fancy dress party had in fact died. Revealing his middle name as Aubrey in a sÃ©ance held by Elsie Partridge, but dismissing her skills, saying: ""If Elsie Partridge really could raise the dead, half the money lenders in Peckham would be employing her."" Demonstrating his ""devotion"" to Marlene by rejecting a suggestion that he had murdered her and hidden the body with the retort: ""I have never been so insulted in my life. You know how much I spent on that garden. You think I'm going to dig a hole in it?"" Raising the stakes in a poker game with Del and revealing he has four kings (""un, deux, trois, quatre"") to claim ownership of Del's flat. The smile is wiped off his face by Del's four aces, which he tells Boycie ""came from the same place as your four kings"". Boycie's grudging commentary when helping Del and Rodney escape the Mafia in Miami: ""We were having a lovely holiday and then they turn up. Within 15 seconds, some sod's shooting at us.""

"Households are protected against gas price rises, says Alok Sharma A spike in wholesale gas prices will not result in goods shortages or price hikes for customers in the UK, a climate change minister has said. COP26 president Alok Sharma said: ""We do not see risks of supplies right now and prices are being protected."" He said Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was continuingtalks with energy suppliers over the weekend. High global demand, maintenance issues at some gas sites and lower solar and wind output are blamed for the rise. Supermarkets and food firms say the gas price rise has caused a shortage of carbon dioxide which isthreatening UK supplies of meat and fresh produce. Mr Sharma told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that people should not be concerned about the risks of gas supply. ""Of course, when it comes to prices there will be concern as well,"" he said. ""We have the energy price cap, we have the warm homes discount, to protect people at this particular time."" Gas price rises prompt urgent government talks Soaring gas prices 'will feed into customer bills' Are energy bills going up and what can I do? Industry group Oil & Gas UK said wholesale prices for gas are up 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) reported that in 2020, 60% of the UK's natural gas supply was imported. Mr Sharma said: ""A significant part of our gas supply comes domestically. The imported gas primarily comes from countries like Norway so we are securing that."" He said the situation showed that the UK needed to do ""even more in terms of renewables."" ""That's how we ensure you have a clean energy mix and you have security of supply in our country,"" he said. The gas price hike has caused two large fertiliser plants to shut down - which created knock-on shortages of its by-product CO2. CO2 is used to stun animals before slaughter, as a coolant agent in transport and as a shelf life extending agent in food packaging. BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson said one supermarket boss told her that unless the shortage is resolved the UK could start to seeshortages of meat on shelves by the end of next week. Another retailer said the situation was ""escalating very quickly"" and some poultry suppliers had only two to three days of CO2 supplies left. Ian Wright, from the Food and Drink Federation industry body, said shoppers would notice a shortage of some products in the next two weeks. ""We will see gaps on shelves fairly soon,"" he said. ""We will not run out of food. ""But there are going to be major concerns about the continuing of supply both to supermarkets and convenience stores and restaurants and takeaways."" Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium called for the government to ""urgently sort this problem out"". ""Otherwise we are going to see problems for consumers both immediately and in the run-up to Christmas,"" he said. Greg Jackson, chief executive of Octopus Energy - one of the UK's six largest providers - said this was ""the most extreme energy market in decades"". Small energy companies were ""facing an unprecedented crisis"", he told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme. ""Behind this are millions of customers and thousands of people whose jobs are going to be affected."" But he said energy providers and the government would be doing everything they could to stop household bills from rising. He said: ""The price cap means that the standard variable tariffs are actually way below the cost of supplying energy today."" The energy cap is themaximum price suppliers can charge customerson a standard - or default - tariff. Meanwhile, shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the issue ""should have been foreseen"". He told Sky News's Trevor Phillips on Sunday programme: ""This should act as a spur to get on with the transition to net-zero, more renewable and sustainable supplies because the effect of all this will be rising prices for consumers just when they're being hit with other things too.""

"This is the only photograph Gaynor has of her extended family in Nigeria Fifty-five years ago, Nigeria was locked in a bitter four-year civil war. It would leave over three million people dead, including over a million starved to death in a blockade of the Biafran south-east. Many foreign nationals working on Nigeria's oilfields were also caught up in the fighting, including Gaynor Prior, the mother of reporter Neil Prior. It's Sunday afternoon. After a roast dinner at my mother's home in Swansea, talk turns to our childhoods. Mam, who's usually quite gregarious, suddenly becomes very withdrawn. ""It's 55 years since I left Nigeria,"" she says. I've always known Mam had to flee Nigeria as a ten-year-old in the wake of the 1966 Biafran Coup, but it wasn't something we talked about. Don't get me wrong, she often reminisces about the four highly enjoyable years she spent living in Port Harcourt, but rarely touches on the last few days when she had to abandon all her friends, belongings and her African bush dog, Nero. I ask her if she'd like to talk about it. I meant as a son rather than a journalist, but to my amazement, she says: ""Yes, I want people to read about what it's like, if only so they can better understand what these poor poor Afghani people will be going through right now."" Gaynor enjoyed an ""idyllic"" childhood in Port Harcourt Mam's father, Alan Maggs, was a chemical engineer for British Petroleum (BP). In 1962, just two years after Nigerian independence, he was posted to the newly discovered oilfields of the Niger Delta. My family - my grandparents and their six-year old daughter Gaynor, my mother - arrived in Port Harcourt that year. Mam's elder sister, my Aunty Susan, remained in Swansea to complete her O-Levels. They lived alongside the Igbo people of south-east Nigeria, an area known as Biafra, which was predominantly Christian. The civil war was portrayed in the press as a religious conflict, but many other factors were at play, including oil revenues and historical tensions over the way Britain had amalgamated disparate tribes into one artificial nation. This video can not be played The Biafran war explained Mam describes an idyllic childhood, in which war couldn't have been further from their minds. ""One of my earliest memories is catching an aeroplane from Heathrow to Lagos, then a smaller plane to Port Harcourt,"" she recalls. ""I remember the blistering heat as they opened the plane doors. I thought I'd never be able to survive it, but within weeks I'd got used to it."" She was enrolled at Santa Maria school, and soon became a fixture at the Humkorshe swimming club. Swimming at the Humkorshe Club is one of Gaynor's fondest memories ""Getting up at about 05:00 to catch the minibus twenty miles to school was the worst part, and the nuns who ran the school were very, very strict. But on the up-side, we'd be finished by 12:30 and could spend the best part of the day doing as we pleased. ""For me that was swimming at Humkorshe, doing length after length and diving in the wonderful sunshine."" Mam soon made friends, and acquired an extended Nigerian family. ""We had a gang of five: Two girls, Ezikama and Stella who were my Nigerian friends, then there was Angelo, an Italian lad, and Michael from the north of England, both of those were the sons of oil workers. ""We'd cycle for miles and miles. Once we discovered an abandoned steam engine and made a den there. ""That turned out not to be such a good idea, as I got a poisonous spider in my hair, and had to cycle as fast as I could back to Michael's house, where his servant probably saved my life."" Remembering the war that many prefer to forget How many Afghan refugees are fleeing? What happens to migrants who reach the UK? She speaks with fondness about the people who worked for them, but looking back she reflects on the inequity of the situation. ""It probably sounds wrong nowadays to say that we had servants, but Simon and Sunday weren't just servants, they were part of our family. They were my friends, confidants and fellow mischief-makers. I'd hate for anyone to think we were exploiting them, but in today's terms I suppose we were,"" Mam reflected. ""I still have a photograph of Simon which I sent back to my sister Susan, but so many of them, including all the ones of Sunday, I had to leave behind when we left."" Gaynor was a pupil at Santa Maria School in Port Harcourt Then came the day in 1966 when Alan returned from work with troubling news. Mam says: ""Dad was very quiet. After a while he explained that the Igbo tribe had risen up in an attempt to establish an independent Biafran state. ""I said, 'but that won't affect us though right? Simon and Sunday are Igbo, there's no way they'd hurt usâ¦?'"" What Mam hadn't considered was that Britain had backed the northern-dominated Nigerian army against the Biafran separatists. Meanwhile, France was supporting the Igbo, setting up a proxy war between the two so-called allies for influence over West Africa and its oil reserves. This video can not be played Biafran conflict: A grandmother's perspective on the war Days later my grandmother, Doreen, received a call from Alan at work. They were given hours to flee the country. ""I don't know how close the fighting was to us, but the one thing which sticks with me is the sense of urgency. We had to get out that minute,"" Mam explains. ""I do remember we flew out on a Dakota [military transport aircraft], we had to get in from a ramp underneath."" Only women and children could leave Port Harcourt on the emergency flights. Alan had to travel overland to Malawi, and catch a flight home from there, which took several weeks. Mam adds: ""In the immediate weeks afterwards, I was of course terrified for Dad. Every night I cried myself to sleep about what had happened to Nero, but what I recall more than anything is my sister Susan being so angry that I'd taken all her teddy bears out to Nigeria, and had had to leave them all behind."" It's 55 years since Gaynor Prior left Nigeria In the months and years which followed, Mam became increasingly traumatised by the fate of the extended family she'd left behind. The Igbo people who had assisted British oil workers were persecuted within Biafra for their perceived treachery. The region as a whole was blockaded by the Nigerian army. An estimated one to two million people starved to death before a ceasefire was finally signed in 1970. ""There's barely a day goes by that I don't think about what happened to all of them. ""If there's one thing I can do with this story,"" Mam says, ""if a refugee, say from Afghanistan, ends up in the house next door to you, please please be kind to them. You have no idea what they've been through or who they've had to leave behind.""

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

"This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China Australia has defended its decision to scrap a multi-billion dollar submarine purchase from France in favour of a new security pact with the US and UK. Prime Minister Scott Morrison rejected accusations that Australia had lied, saying France should have been aware it was prepared to break the deal. France says the Aukus pact has led to a ""serious crisis"" between the allies. In an unprecedented move, it has recalled its ambassadors from the US and Australia as a sign of protest. Under the Aukus pact, Australia will be given the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines as a way of countering China's influence in the contested South China Sea. The partnership has ended a deal worth $37bn (Â£27bn) signed by Australia in 2016 for France to build 12 conventional submarines. France says it was informed of the pact only hours before the public announcement was made earlier this week. Mr Morrison on Sunday said he understood France's disappointment, but that he had always been clear about Australia's position. The French government ""would have had every reason to know that we had deep and grave concerns"", he said. ANALYSIS:Aukus pact delivers France some hard truths EXPLAINED:Why this pact signals a major shift BACKGROUND:Tensions in the South China Sea ""Ultimately this was a decision about whether the submarines that were being built, at great cost to the Australian taxpayer, were going to be able to do a job that we needed it to do when they went into service and our strategic judgment based on the best possible of intelligence and defence advice was that it would not."" Mr Morrison's comments came after French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France 2 television there had been ""lying, duplicity, a major breach of trust and contempt"" over the deal. He said France's ambassadors to the US and Australia were being recalled to ""re-evaluate the situation"", but that there had been ""no need"" to recall the ambassador to the UK, which he described as a ""third wheel"". US President Joe Biden is expected to hold talks with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in the coming days. ""We want explanations,"" French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Sunday. Meanwhile, newly appointed UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss defended the agreement in an article for The Sunday Telegraph, saying it showed Britain's readiness to be ""hard-headed"" in defence of its interests. The pact means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. It will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies. China has accused the three powers involved in the security pact of having a ""Cold War mentality"". Clumsy diplomacy, heightened emotions and spy-like secrecy: the row over the new security pact between the UK, the US and Australia has it all. But amid the increasingly shrill invective from humiliated French ministers, there is a fundamental truth: the West is struggling to make up its mind about China. Washington has now been joined by Canberra and London in acting together to address the security challenge. Other countries - particularly some in Europe - are less hawkish, still trying to split the difference between economic cooperation and strategic competition with Beijing. France is furious at the breach of contract by Australia and the lack of trust shown by the US and the UK. So there is talk in the French papers of further retaliation, beyond the recall of ambassadors, perhaps involving Nato. Others are speculating this row might finally encourage Europe to agree some greater strategic autonomy. The truth is more straightforward: if the West wishes to protect its interests in the Indo-Pacific, then France and other European powers need to be on the same page as the US and its Anglophone allies. And right now both sides are not even reading the same book.

"This video can not be played Lib Dem conference: Sir Ed Davey angry over Conservatives' handling of social care crisis Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says his party is the ""gathering point"" for everyone ""fed up with the indecency and incompetence"" of government. Addressing the Lib Dem conference, he told delegates they can deprive Boris Johnson of a majority at the next election. He announced a Â£5bn voucher scheme plan to help pupils catch up after the pandemic. And he vowed to fight for a ""fair deal"" for carers, parents and businesses. Lib Dems call for Covid laws to be scrapped Lib Dems: Is Davey sticking to his promises? Lib Dems seize Tory seat in by-election upset Sir Ed's conference speech is the first to a live audience since becoming party leader last year. Most of the event is being held online due to pandemic concerns. Addressing a small audience of about 100 delegates at London's Canary Wharf, he pointed to success in June'sChesham and Amersham by-election-  where the Lib Dems overturned a  a 16,000 Tory majority to win by more than 8,000 votes - as evidence that ""the Tories can be beaten"" in traditional, so-called ""blue wall"" seats. On education, Sir Ed said  a ""massive Covid education catch-up plan is urgent"" as the UK emerges from the pandemic. He said Liberal Democrats would give families a Â£200 voucher per child - paid directly to parents - to spend on activities such as extra tutoring, music or sports clubs. The Â£5bn scheme would make supporting parents and children the ""top priority"" in a ""new fair deal"", he said, and would enable the ""most radical empowering of parents ever"". That extra support ""would be doubled and in some cases tripled"" for children in care, disadvantaged children and those will special educational needs. Sir Ed said his party will fight for a ""fair deal"" and aim to appeal to those who feel ""taken for granted"" by the Conservatives. Referring to the prime minister'sÂ£36bn health and social care levy,Sir Ed said it was ""little more than an unfair tax rise for workers and businesses"". He said as a carer himself for his son he ""felt angry"" at the prime minister's ""claim to have fixed the crisis in social care"", describing it as ""just another of his broken promises"". He criticised the plan for failing to tackle a ""dangerous shortage of care staff"" and said that those workers would be hit with a tax hike and ""heartless universal credit cuts"". He pledged that his party would ""empower carers"" by giving them their own budget and control over care provision such as when the family carer gets a break. Sir Ed said the tax-free allowance against employers, national insurance contributions should be ""raised substantially"" and that the biggest businesses would pay more tax under Lib Dem plans. ""The world's richest bosses might be racing each other to go to Mars, but before lift-off, they can pay their taxes here on Planet Earth"" he added. On the issue of climate action, he said the UK should be leading the world by banning new oil, gas and coal companies from the London Stock Exchange. That would stop ""the flow of money from your pension funds into the dirty industries of the past"" he added. Catch-up vouchers are a clear pitch to parents who the Lib Dems are keen to attract. Post-pandemic the party believes it can capitalise on what many said was the government's mishandling of the impact on education. And it fits with their broader appeal to those they say have been taken for granted or left behind by Boris Johnson's government. But there's a danger it's seen as an expensive giveaway which would put some cautious Conservative voters off. And competence when it comes to the economy will be crucial if the Lib Dem's are to present themselves as a credible alternative. In a pre-speech interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Sir Ed was asked about the party's attitude to trans rights after an activist, Natalie Bird, was banned from standing as an MP for wearing a T-shirt featuring the words ""woman adult human female"". He said all spaces should be open to everyone, regardless of their gender, because the issue was one of human rights. ""A trans woman is a woman, a trans man is a man"" he added. Sir Ed added that transgender people are ""some of the most discriminated against"" and he accused the prime minister of toxifying the debate around rights.

"This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China The UK's new security agreement with the US and Australia will make it safer and could create hundreds of new jobs, the new foreign secretary has said. The pact, known as Aukus, will see Australia being given the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines. Liz Truss said it showed the UK's readiness to be ""hard-headed"" in defending its interests. But France, whose own submarine deal with Australia was thwarted as a result, has criticised the agreement. It has recalled its ambassadors in the US and Australia for consultations in response, while China has accused the three powers of having a ""Cold War mentality"". Johnson's new cabinet meets for first time Aukus pact could signal power shift in Asia-Pacific The alliance - widely seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea - was announced by US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Ms Truss said the partnership showed the UK's commitment to stability in the Indo-Pacific region. She wrote: ""Freedoms need to be defended, so we are also building strong security ties around the world. ""This is about more than foreign policy in the abstract, but delivering for people across the UK and beyond by partnering with like-minded countries to build coalitions based on shared values and shared interests."" Ms Truss, who was was promoted from international trade secretary to foreign secretary in the reshuffle this week, said the pact ""will not just make us safer at home, it could also create hundreds of new and high-skilled jobs, from the shipyards of Govan to the factories of Tyneside"". Liz Truss became Foreign Secretary in this week's reshuffle The pact, which will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies, was described as showing ""profound strategic shifts"" by the UK's national security adviser Stephen Lovegrove. But some have expressed fears that it could provoke China into a war. This week, former Prime Minister Theresa May asked Mr Johnson about the ""implications"" of the partnership in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, but Beijing has increased pressure on the island which it views as a breakaway province. Mr Johnson told MPs that the Aukus agreement was ""not intended to be adversarial"" to China but the UK was ""determined to defend international law"".

He had paid an undisclosed sum - estimated by Time magazine to be about $200 million (Â£145 million) - to fellow billionaire Elon Musk for all four seats aboard the Crew Dragon. What is the SpaceX Crew Dragon? Mr Isaacman was joined by three strangers he had selected - geoscientist and former Nasa astronaut candidate Sian Proctor, 51; physician assistant and childhood bone cancer survivor Hayley Arceneaux, 29; and aerospace data engineer and Air Force veteran Chris Sembroski, 42. ""That was a heck of a ride for us,"" Mr Isaacman radioed shortly after landing. ""We're just getting started."" The trip marks the third time Elon Musk's company has taken humans to space and back - and another milestone in the space tourism market. ""Congratulations @Inspiration4x !!!"" he tweeted after the quartet's safe return. ""Welcome to the second space age,"" mission director Todd Ericson told a press conference, saying that after this, ""space travel becomes much more accessible to average men and women."" Ultimate selfie: Jared Isaacman, Chris Sembroski, Sian Proctor, and Hayley Arceneaux with Earth in the background Onboard computer systems were in control of the Dragon capsule during its journey, overseen by SpaceX teams on the ground. The Dragon was not scheduled to go near the International Space Station (ISS), instead embarking on a ""free flight"" to a target altitude of 575km (360 miles). The crew, who underwent six months' training, circled the Earth more than 15 times each day. Experts gathered data on their blood oxygen levels, sleep, cognitive abilities and other vital signs during the trip, to study the impact being in space would have on non-professionals. The trip will raise funds for St Jude's Children's Research Hospital, in Tennessee, where crew member Hayley Arceneaux was treated as a child, and now works. The foursome plan to auction objects they took into space with them, including a ukulele.

"This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China The UK's new security agreement with the US and Australia will make it safer and could create hundreds of new jobs, the new foreign secretary has said. The pact, known as Aukus, will see Australia being given the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines. Liz Truss said it showed the UK's readiness to be ""hard-headed"" in defending its interests. But France, whose own submarine deal with Australia was thwarted as a result, has criticised the agreement. It has recalled its ambassadors in the US and Australia for consultations in response, while China has accused the three powers of having a ""Cold War mentality"". Johnson's new cabinet meets for first time Aukus pact could signal power shift in Asia-Pacific The alliance - widely seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea - was announced by US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Ms Truss said the partnership showed the UK's commitment to stability in the Indo-Pacific region. She wrote: ""Freedoms need to be defended, so we are also building strong security ties around the world. ""This is about more than foreign policy in the abstract, but delivering for people across the UK and beyond by partnering with like-minded countries to build coalitions based on shared values and shared interests."" Ms Truss, who was was promoted from international trade secretary to foreign secretary in the reshuffle this week, said the pact ""will not just make us safer at home, it could also create hundreds of new and high-skilled jobs, from the shipyards of Govan to the factories of Tyneside"". Liz Truss became Foreign Secretary in this week's reshuffle The pact, which will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies, was described as showing ""profound strategic shifts"" by the UK's national security adviser Stephen Lovegrove. But some have expressed fears that it could provoke China into a war. This week, former Prime Minister Theresa May asked Mr Johnson about the ""implications"" of the partnership in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, but Beijing has increased pressure on the island which it views as a breakaway province. Mr Johnson told MPs that the Aukus agreement was ""not intended to be adversarial"" to China but the UK was ""determined to defend international law"". Clumsy diplomacy, heightened emotions and spy-like secrecy: the row over the new security pact between the UK, the US and Australia has it all. But amid the increasingly shrill invective from humiliated French ministers, there is a fundamental truth: the West is struggling to make up its mind about China. Washington has now been joined by Canberra and London in acting together to address the security challenge. Other countries - particularly some in Europe - are less hawkish, still trying to split the difference between economic co-operation and strategic competition with Beijing. France is furious at the breach of contract by Australia and the lack of trust shown by the US and the UK. So there is talk in the French papers of further retaliation, beyond the recall of ambassadors, perhaps involving Nato. Others are speculating this row might finally encourage Europe to agree some greater strategic autonomy. The truth is more straightforward: if the West wishes to protect its interests in the Indo-Pacific, then France and other European powers need to be on the same page as the US and its Anglophone allies. And right now both sides are not even reading the same book. Meanwhile, France's foreign minister hasaccused Australia and the US of lying over the deal. Speaking on Saturday, Jean-Yves Le Drian said a ""serious crisis"" was in progress between the allies. ""The fact that for the first time in the history of relations between the United States and France we are recalling our ambassador for consultations is a serious political act, which shows the magnitude of the crisis that exists now between our countries,"" he told France 2. But he said France had seen ""no need"" to recall its ambassador to the UK, accusing the country of ""constant opportunism"". ""Britain in this whole thing is a bit like the third wheel,"" he said. The pact means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement ended a deal worth $37bn (Â£27bn) that France had signed with Australia in 2016 to build 12 conventional submarines.

"Challis was born in Bristol in 1942 but moved to south-east London with his parents when he was one Tributes have been paid to John Challis, best known for playing Boycie in BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses, who has died at the age of 79. His family said he died ""peacefully in his sleep, after a long battle with cancer"". Co-star Sir David Jason said he was ""a wonderful actor"" and ""a gentleman in the true sense of the word"". Challis's character - unscrupulous second-hand car dealer Terrance Aubrey Boyce - was a firm favourite with fans. Challis starred in the show, alongside Sir David and Nicholas Lyndhurst, throughout its time on air from 1981 right through to the final show in 2003. The character - who was both a long-time former schoolmate and devious rival of Sir David's character Del Boy - was initially due to appear in just one scene, but the part grew in prominence as the series progressed. How John Challis created one of comedy's great characters John Challis on 'unbelievable' Only Fools legacy In fact he was so popular with viewers that, when Only Fools and Horses ended its long run, the BBC developed a spin-off show following the continuing adventures of Boycie and long-suffering wife Marlene. The Green Green Grass ran for four series. Sue Holderness, who played Marlene, also paid tribute to Challis, describing him as her ""beloved friend"". ""Marlene without Boycie - it's unthinkable,"" she said. ""John Challis was my partner on screen and stage for 36 years and my beloved friend. RIP darling John. I will miss you every day."" And Steven Woodcock, who played Jevon in the sitcom, said Challis was a ""fantastic actor and wonderful person, amazing to work with. There is no Del Boy without Boycie. RIP my Peckham pal"". Boycie was usually found at the Nag's Head pub, alongside wife Marlene, with a cigar in one hand and a large cognac in the other In a statement, Challis's family said: ""He will always be loved for being 'Boycie' and leaves a great legacy of work that will continue to bring pleasure and smiles for many years to come. ""Be assured that in the future there will be an occasion to celebrate John's life - when everyone will be welcome to come along."" Jeff Nicholson, the actor playing Boycie in the Only Fools and Horses musical due to reopen next month, said Challis had told him to ""carry the torch for us"" shortly before his death. He said Challis had been supportive of him when they met and given the cast his ""seal of approval"" when the show premiered at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in February, before closing soon after due to the pandemic. Describing Challis as ""a real stand-up actor"", he said the pair had struck up a ""nice relationship"" in lockdown, with Challis always asking for updates on the theatre production. The BBC's chief content officer Charlotte Moore said Challis was ""a wonderful actor who will forever be remembered for playing Boycie in Only Fools and Horses - a character so well loved by millions"". Challis happily played Boycie on screen for decades - and even adopted the persona in appearances in other entertainment shows, fan conventions and evenin a video message this year,externaladvocating the wearing of face-coverings in public places to help fight Covid.

But he also showed his range as a Shakespearean actor when he performed in open-air performances of Richard III and a Midsummer's Night Dream that were staged in Regents Park in London in 1995, right at the height of the popularity of Only Fools and Horses. More recently he played Monty Staines in ITV show Benidorm. Actress Crissy Rock, who appeared alongside Challis in the show, said she was heartbroken. Shetweeted,external: ""John you were a true gentleman and always so loving and supportive towards me. I am thinking of your family and close friends at this hard time. Rest well. Crissy xx"" Earlier this month,Challis cancelled a speaking tourdue to ill health. He was due to appear in 30 scheduled dates, billed as an ""intimate evening with John Challis"", but had to cancel the tour after one date. Others paying tribute ranged fromThe Three Degrees singer Sheila Ferguson,externaltoUS rapper and actor Ice T,external, who wrote: ""He somehow became a Twitter friend... I'm very sad. Although I never met him in person, internet friends can become close."" Former heavyweight champion boxer Frank Brunoalso tweeted his condolences,external. ""(He) used to say to me 'Franklyn my dear boy how the devil are you boxed anybody round the ears recently?' Loved all the TV he did."" Challis recently became an honorary citizen of Serbia, where Only Fools and Horses remains hugely popular. He travelled to the Balkan country as part of a documentary, Boycie In Belgrade, which explored why the show was so well-loved there. Although he was famed for his nasal south London twang as Boycie, he was actually born in Bristol and only moved to London as a young child. In a quirk of fate, much of his career as an on-screen Londoner was spent in Bristol where Only Fools and Horses was largely filmed. Delivering his trademark sneering laugh when he tricks Del Boy and Rodney into bursting into a wake dressed as Batman and Robin, because he'd ""forgotten"" to tell them the man hosting the fancy dress party had in fact died. Revealing his middle name as Aubrey in a sÃ©ance held by Elsie Partridge, but dismissing her skills, saying: ""If Elsie Partridge really could raise the dead, half the money lenders in Peckham would be employing her."" Demonstrating his ""devotion"" to Marlene by rejecting a suggestion that he had murdered her and hidden the body with the retort: ""I have never been so insulted in my life. You know how much I spent on that garden. You think I'm going to dig a hole in it?"" Raising the stakes in a poker game with Del and revealing he has four kings (""un, deux, trois, quatre"") to claim ownership of Del's flat. The smile is wiped off his face by Del's four aces, which he tells Boycie ""came from the same place as your four kings"". Boycie's grudging commentary when helping Del and Rodney escape the Mafia in Miami: ""We were having a lovely holiday and then they turn up. Within 15 seconds, some sod's shooting at us.""

"This video can not be played Lib Dem conference: Sir Ed Davey angry over Conservatives' handling of social care crisis Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says his party is the ""gathering point"" for everyone ""fed up with the indecency and incompetence"" of government. Addressing the Lib Dem conference, he told delegates they can deprive Boris Johnson of a majority at the next election. He announced a Â£5bn voucher scheme plan to help pupils catch up after the pandemic. And he vowed to fight for a ""fair deal"" for carers, parents and businesses. Lib Dems call for Covid laws to be scrapped Lib Dems: Is Davey sticking to his promises? Lib Dems seize Tory seat in by-election upset Sir Ed's conference speech is the first to a live audience since becoming party leader last year. Most of the event is being held online due to pandemic concerns. Addressing a small audience of about 100 delegates at London's Canary Wharf, he pointed to success in June'sChesham and Amersham by-election-  where the Lib Dems overturned a  a 16,000 Tory majority to win by more than 8,000 votes - as evidence that ""the Tories can be beaten"" in traditional, so-called ""blue wall"" seats. On education, Sir Ed said  a ""massive Covid education catch-up plan is urgent"" as the UK emerges from the pandemic. He said Liberal Democrats would give families a Â£200 voucher per child - paid directly to parents - to spend on activities such as extra tutoring, music or sports clubs. The Â£5bn scheme would make supporting parents and children the ""top priority"" in a ""new fair deal"", he said, and would enable the ""most radical empowering of parents ever"". That extra support ""would be doubled and in some cases tripled"" for children in care, disadvantaged children and those will special educational needs. Sir Ed said his party will fight for a ""fair deal"" and aim to appeal to those who feel ""taken for granted"" by the Conservatives. Referring to the prime minister'sÂ£36bn health and social care levy,Sir Ed said it was ""little more than an unfair tax rise for workers and businesses"". He said as a carer himself for his son he ""felt angry"" at the prime minister's ""claim to have fixed the crisis in social care"", describing it as ""just another of his broken promises"". He criticised the plan for failing to tackle a ""dangerous shortage of care staff"" and said that those workers would be hit with a tax hike and ""heartless universal credit cuts"". He pledged that his party would ""empower carers"" by giving them their own budget and control over care provision such as when the family carer gets a break. Sir Ed said the tax-free allowance against employers, national insurance contributions should be ""raised substantially"" and that the biggest businesses would pay more tax under Lib Dem plans. ""The world's richest bosses might be racing each other to go to Mars, but before lift-off, they can pay their taxes here on Planet Earth"" he added. On the issue of climate action, he said the UK should be leading the world by banning new oil, gas and coal companies from the London Stock Exchange. That would stop ""the flow of money from your pension funds into the dirty industries of the past"" he added. Catch-up vouchers are a clear pitch to parents who the Lib Dems are keen to attract. Post-pandemic the party believes it can capitalise on what many said was the government's mishandling of the impact on education. And it fits with their broader appeal to those they say have been taken for granted or left behind by Boris Johnson's government. But there's a danger it's seen as an expensive giveaway which would put some cautious Conservative voters off. And competence when it comes to the economy will be crucial if the Lib Dem's are to present themselves as a credible alternative. In a pre-speech interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Sir Ed was asked about the party's attitude to trans rights after an activist, Natalie Bird, was banned from standing as an MP for wearing a T-shirt featuring the words ""woman adult human female"". He said all spaces should be open to everyone, regardless of their gender, because the issue was one of human rights. ""A trans woman is a woman, a trans man is a man"" he added. Sir Ed added that transgender people are ""some of the most discriminated against"" and he accused the prime minister of toxifying the debate around rights.

"This video can not be played Watch the moment the SpaceX capsule splashed back down to Earth Four amateur astronauts have splashed down successfully in the Atlantic Ocean after three days in space. They are the first private, all-civilian team ever to orbit the Earth. The Inspiration4 crew left on a SpaceX capsule from Florida on Wednesday, and landed off the state's coast after 19:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Saturday. Four parachutes slowed the capsule's descent before it landed in the water, where SpaceX boats sped to retrieve it. The Inspiration4 team was led by billionaire Jared Isaacman, 38, chief executive of the e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments Inc, who acted as mission ""commander"". He had paid an undisclosed sum - estimated by Time magazine to be about $200 million (Â£145 million) - to fellow billionaire Elon Musk for all four seats aboard the Crew Dragon.

But France, whose own submarine deal with Australia was thwarted as a result, has criticised the agreement. It has recalled its ambassadors in the US and Australia for consultations in response, while China has accused the three powers of having a ""Cold War mentality"". Johnson's new cabinet meets for first time Aukus pact could signal power shift in Asia-Pacific The alliance - widely seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea - was announced by US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Ms Truss said the partnership showed the UK's commitment to stability in the Indo-Pacific region. She wrote: ""Freedoms need to be defended, so we are also building strong security ties around the world. ""This is about more than foreign policy in the abstract, but delivering for people across the UK and beyond by partnering with like-minded countries to build coalitions based on shared values and shared interests."" Ms Truss, who was was promoted from international trade secretary to foreign secretary in the reshuffle this week, said the pact ""will not just make us safer at home, it could also create hundreds of new and high-skilled jobs, from the shipyards of Govan to the factories of Tyneside"". Liz Truss became Foreign Secretary in this week's reshuffle The pact, which will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies, was described as showing ""profound strategic shifts"" by the UK's national security adviser Stephen Lovegrove. But some have expressed fears that it could provoke China into a war. This week, former Prime Minister Theresa May asked Mr Johnson about the ""implications"" of the partnership in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, but Beijing has increased pressure on the island which it views as a breakaway province. Mr Johnson told MPs that the Aukus agreement was ""not intended to be adversarial"" to China but the UK was ""determined to defend international law"". Clumsy diplomacy, heightened emotions and spy-like secrecy: the row over the new security pact between the UK, the US and Australia has it all. But amid the increasingly shrill invective from humiliated French ministers, there is a fundamental truth: the West is struggling to make up its mind about China. Washington has now been joined by Canberra and London in acting together to address the security challenge. Other countries - particularly some in Europe - are less hawkish, still trying to split the difference between economic co-operation and strategic competition with Beijing. France is furious at the breach of contract by Australia and the lack of trust shown by the US and the UK. So there is talk in the French papers of further retaliation, beyond the recall of ambassadors, perhaps involving Nato. Others are speculating this row might finally encourage Europe to agree some greater strategic autonomy. The truth is more straightforward: if the West wishes to protect its interests in the Indo-Pacific, then France and other European powers need to be on the same page as the US and its Anglophone allies. And right now both sides are not even reading the same book. Meanwhile, France's foreign minister hasaccused Australia and the US of lying over the deal. Speaking on Saturday, Jean-Yves Le Drian said a ""serious crisis"" was in progress between the allies. ""The fact that for the first time in the history of relations between the United States and France we are recalling our ambassador for consultations is a serious political act, which shows the magnitude of the crisis that exists now between our countries,"" he told France 2. But he said France had seen ""no need"" to recall its ambassador to the UK, accusing the country of ""constant opportunism"". ""Britain in this whole thing is a bit like the third wheel,"" he said. The pact means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement ended a deal worth $37bn (Â£27bn) that France had signed with Australia in 2016 to build 12 conventional submarines.

"This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China France's foreign minister has accused Australia and the US of lying over a new security pact that prompted Paris to recall its ambassadors. Jean-Yves Le Drian also accused the countries of ""duplicity, a major breach of trust and contempt"". The pact, known as Aukus, thwarted a multibillion-dollar deal France had signed with Australia. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he had acted in the country's national interests. He insisted the French government ""would have had every reason to know that we had deep and grave concerns"" that the $37bn (Â£27bn) deal signed in 2016 - for France to build 12 conventional submarines - ""was not going to meet our strategic interests"". ""Of course it's a matter of great disappointment to the French government, so I understand their disappointment,"" he said. ""But at the same time, Australia like any sovereign nation must always take decisions that are in our sovereign national defence interest."" The Aukus agreement - which also includes the UK - will see Australia being given the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines as a way of countering China's influence in the contested South China Sea. France was informed only hours before the public announcement was made earlier this week. In an interview with France 2 television on Saturday, Mr Le Drian said a ""serious crisis"" was in progress between the allies.

"China has demonstrated increasing power and influence in the Asia Pacific raising concerns amongst global players A new security partnership in the Asia-Pacific will see the UK and US provide Australia with the technology and capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines. American officials have said the move was not aimed at countering Beijing. However experts say the Aukus agreement signals a paradigm shift in strategy and policy across the region. The timing of the new deal is particularly significant. It comes just a month after the US exit from Afghanistan, when doubts have been raised in multiple quarters about US commitment in the region. Britain too is eager to be more involved in the Asia-Pacific especially after its exit from the European Union and Australia is increasingly concerned about China's influence. ""It is a 'big deal' because this really shows that all three nations are drawing a line in the sand to start and counter the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific,"" Guy Boekenstein, senior director of defence and national security at Australia's Northern Territory government, told the BBC. ""It also publicly demonstrates our combined stance on this and commitment to a stable and secure Indo-Pacific region - one that for the past 70 years has led to the prosperity of all in the region, including China's economic growth."" The agreement involves the sharing of information and technology in a number of areas including intelligence and quantum technology as well as the acquisition of cruise missiles. But the nuclear submarines are key.  They are to be built in Adelaide in South Australia and will involve the US and the UK providing consultation on technology for their production. ""A nuclear submarine has enormous defence capabilities and therefore ramifications for the region. Only six countries in the world have nuclear submarines. They are a really powerful deterrent capability without giving them nuclear weapons,"" Michael Shoebridge, director of defence, strategy and national security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said. UK, US and Australia launch pact to counter China UK to shift foreign policy focus after review China warns UK as carrier strike group approaches Nuclear submarines are much more stealthy than conventional ones - they operate quietly, are able to move easily and are harder to detect. At least eight submarines will be supported, although it's not clear when they will be deployed. The process will take longer due to a lack of nuclear infrastructure in Australia. They will not be nuclear armed, only powered with nuclear reactors. ""Let me be clear: Australia is not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons or establish a civil nuclear capability,"" Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. President Biden added that there would be an initial 18-month consultation period with teams from the three countries to decide how it would work and to ensure compliance with non-proliferation commitments. However, the move does show that the US and UK are willing to take the big step of exporting nuclear technology to a non-nuclear powered nation, according to Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Programme at the Stimson Center. And that is what makes the partnership so unique. This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China ""This technology is extremely sensitive. This is frankly an exception to our policy in many respects, I do not anticipate that this will be undertaken in other circumstances going forward. We view this as a one-off,"" a US official told Reuters, adding that Washington had shared nuclear propulsion technology only once before - with Britain in 1958. In recent years, China has demonstrated increasing power and influence in the region. ""We hear words about co-operation and then we see the threats against Taiwan and events in Hong Kong and the rapid militarisation of the South China Sea. So really when it comes to strategic issues, deterrents seem to be the only thing that makes sense against China,"" Mr Shoebridge said. The US has been investing heavily in other partnerships in the region too with Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, as well as India and Vietnam. This deal could benefit all of them, according to Mr Shoebridge, in the face of concerns about China's growing power. ""The region will appreciate that. This is part of a geopolitical shift which is driven by one big thing. And that is the direction that Xi Jinping is taking. This announcement fits with the growing participation of the world's biggest democracies to deter China from using its power"" Mr Shoebridge added. The response has reportedly been positive, even if it has been a quiet recognition. President Biden will host the first in-person meeting of leaders of the ""Quad"" group of countries next week Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia programme at policy think tank the German Marshall Fund said: ""My understanding from people in the administration - having talked to allies and partners who have an interest in peace and security in the Indo-Pacific - is that there was nothing negative. There is support in the region for deterrence and for having US presence and military presence in the region."" One relationship that will undoubtedly change as a result of the agreement is the one between China and Australia. The two nations have been strong trade partners in the past with a large number of Chinese students choosing to study in Australia. However, political relations deteriorated after Australia backed a global inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus. The pact shows Australia is aligning itself with the US and UK but also signals a vote of confidence in Australia which is looking to play a more active role in Asian security. ""Just because Australia has nuclear submarines doesn't mean it is more powerful than China. It does change the balance of power in the region. If China does face a security situation in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, it will affect the military preparedness or response that China will have to prepare for. It does change the power equilibrium in the region,"" Ms Sun told the BBC. Chinese students 'fear speaking out' in Australia Australia escalates wine dispute with China 'We should unite against China' - Kevin Rudd In response to the deal, China's embassy in Washington said the governments involved ""should shake off their Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice"". However, the reaction on the mainland might be even stronger. ""What's Chinese for apoplectic? One can expect a fiery-hot reaction from Beijingâ¦ This gives Australia and the US another tool in the toolbox to deter China,"" William Choong, senior fellow in regional strategic and political studies at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said.

"MPs said recent events in Afghanistan highlighted ""serious weaknesses"" in the government's approach The government's planning for national security risks is ""unstructured and lacking in central oversight and accountability"", a committee has said. The Joint Committee on National Security Strategy said the pandemic and the fall of Afghanistan showed ""serious weaknesses"" in the current system. The MPs and peers criticised changes that mean the PM will attend fewer National Security Council meetings. No 10 said processes were being strengthened in response to events. How many Afghan refugees are fleeing? Tired and scared, Afghans start new lives in the UK The committee said the lack of preparation for the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan could ""only be described as a systemic failure"". Its report said there was already a ""troubling lack of clarity"" about the role and remit of the NSC, with witnesses describing ""a loose, unstructured cross-government approach, with weak oversight from the centre and unclear prioritisation of risks"". Committee chairman Dame Margaret Beckett, a former foreign secretary, said: ""The whole point of the National Security Council is that it is supposed to prepare for, and act upon, a long-term view of our national security risks. It should be above the hurly-burly of daily concerns. ""But when two events - the Covid-19 pandemic and Afghanistan - demonstrated yet again what a dangerous world we now live in, weaknesses in the structures of the National Security Council were exposed."" The NSC was originally established in 2010 by the then Prime Minister David Cameron, with weekly meetings bringing together senior ministers and defence and intelligence chiefs chaired by the PM. However, the committee said a review by national security adviser Sir Stephen Lovegrove of the way it operated would in future result in Prime Minister Boris Johnson spending roughly 65% less time in the meetings and chairing about half of them. The report said: ""Most concerningly, the new model for the NSC risks becoming a halfway house: It is neither a slower-paced forum for tackling the most fundamental questions facing UK national security, nor a weekly meeting of senior ministers - convened and brokered by the prime minister - to tackle the most pressing issues. ""It is the prime minister's personal investment of time and authority that lends credibility to the NSC and its cross-government structures."" A government spokesman said the national security machinery was being strengthened following its Integrated Review of foreign and defence policy earlier this year.

"This video can not be played Watch the moment the SpaceX capsule splashed back down to Earth Four amateur astronauts have splashed down successfully in the Atlantic Ocean after three days in space. They are the first private, all-civilian team ever to orbit the Earth. The Inspiration4 crew left on a SpaceX capsule from Florida on Wednesday, and landed off the state's coast after 19:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Saturday. Four parachutes slowed the capsule's descent before it landed in the water, where SpaceX boats sped to retrieve it. The Inspiration4 team was led by billionaire Jared Isaacman, 38, chief executive of the e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments Inc, who acted as mission ""commander"". He had paid an undisclosed sum - estimated by Time magazine to be about $200 million (Â£145 million) - to fellow billionaire Elon Musk for all four seats aboard the Crew Dragon. What is the SpaceX Crew Dragon? Mr Isaacman was joined by three strangers he had selected - geoscientist and former Nasa astronaut candidate Sian Proctor, 51; physician assistant and childhood bone cancer survivor Hayley Arceneaux, 29; and aerospace data engineer and Air Force veteran Chris Sembroski, 42. ""That was a heck of a ride for us,"" Mr Isaacman radioed shortly after landing. ""We're just getting started."" The trip marks the third time Elon Musk's company has taken humans to space and back - and another milestone in the space tourism market. ""Congratulations @Inspiration4x !!!"" he tweeted after the quartet's safe return. ""Welcome to the second space age,"" mission director Todd Ericson told a press conference, saying that after this, ""space travel becomes much more accessible to average men and women."" Ultimate selfie: Jared Isaacman, Chris Sembroski, Sian Proctor, and Hayley Arceneaux with Earth in the background Onboard computer systems were in control of the Dragon capsule during its journey, overseen by SpaceX teams on the ground. The Dragon was not scheduled to go near the International Space Station (ISS), instead embarking on a ""free flight"" to a target altitude of 575km (360 miles). The crew, who underwent six months' training, circled the Earth more than 15 times each day. Experts gathered data on their blood oxygen levels, sleep, cognitive abilities and other vital signs during the trip, to study the impact being in space would have on non-professionals. The trip will raise funds for St Jude's Children's Research Hospital, in Tennessee, where crew member Hayley Arceneaux was treated as a child, and now works. The foursome plan to auction objects they took into space with them, including a ukulele.

"At least four of the smaller UK energy companies are expected to go bust next week amid soaring wholesale gas prices. Industry sources have told the BBC that four firms have asked larger players to bid to take over the supply to one million customers. The price rise has left some companies unable to provide their customers with the energy they have paid for. Industry rules mean supplies will continue for affected customers, and they will not lose money owed to them. The new company is also responsible for taking on any credit balances the customer may have. But paying that credit out to customers is a further disincentive for companies to take on new business. Gas price rises prompt urgent government talks Why is my energy bill going up and how can I save money? Soaring gas prices 'will feed into customer bills' Business Secretary Kwasi Kwartengtweeted:,external""Some energy companies are facing pressure. Ofgem has robust measures in place to ensure that customers do not need to worry, their needs are met, and their gas and electricity supply will continue uninterrupted if a supplier fails."" The government added that if the company is not taken over there were processes in place to appoint a special administrator to temporarily run the suppliers. It came after thegovernment held talks with representatives from the energy industryamid growing concern about the impact of the spike in wholesale gas prices on households and businesses, including food manufacturers. The government said the business secretary was reassured that security of supply was not a cause for immediate concern within the industry. ""The UK benefits from having a diverse range of gas supply sources, with sufficient capacity to more than meet demand... the UK's gas system continues to operate reliably and we do not anticipate any increased risk of supply emergencies this winter."" Mr Kwarteng said: ""Our largest single source of gas is from domestic production, and the vast majority of imports come from reliable suppliers such as Norway... ""However, our exposure to volatile global gas prices underscores the importance of our plan to build a strong, home-grown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."" The business secretary said he will have further talks with Ofgem on Sunday to discuss the issues raised by the industry, and on Monday he will seek a further meeting with industry figures ""to plan a way forward"". Four small suppliers ceased trading in recent weeks, including Edinburgh-based People's Energy, which supplied gas and electricity to about 350,000 homes and 1,000 businesses, and Dorset-based Utility Point which had 220,000 domestic customers. At the beginning of 2021 there were 70 energy suppliers in the UK. Industry sources say there may be as few as 10 left by the end of the year. Government sources have said the impact on small energy companies that might be the most exposed was being monitored. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit on your account, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back. The new supplier should contact you to arrange a payment plan Once you have been informed of your new supplier, make sure you're on the best tariff for you. You can switch if you're not happy with your new supplier or tariff without any penalties, but don't do this until the account has been moved over. Source: Citizens Advice Many smaller companies have not insured - or hedged - their exposure to rapidly rising prices and some of the ones that have are cashing in that insurance now to survive - leaving them vulnerable to further shocks. The end of summer is the time of year when credit balances are at their highest as customers have been paying their usual monthly amount but not using much energy for heating their homes. Ofgem may have to allow the cost of those balances to be spread across the industry - adding hundreds of millions of pounds to energy bills through industry-wide levies. Under normal circumstances there is a competitive auction process with the company offering the lowest energy price being rewarded with the additional customers. That is not the case in current market conditions. As one industry executive put it: ""With energy prices having rocketed, and the energy price cap [the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard tariff] already having been set for this year, no-one is that keen to take on new business. The cap is now the cheapest price in the market."" When this has happened in the past, the companies involved have failed and Ofgem has asked larger players to bid to take on the new customers. Industry group Oil & Gas UK said wholesale prices for gas are up 250% since January - with a 70% rise since August. High global demand, maintenance issues at some gas sites and lower solar and wind output are blamed for the rise. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of trade association Energy UK, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""There is a longer conversation to be had about our retail market design and how we make sure we are not vulnerable to volatile, international commodity prices again.""

"China has demonstrated increasing power and influence in the Asia Pacific raising concerns amongst global players A new security partnership in the Asia-Pacific will see the UK and US provide Australia with the technology and capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines. American officials have said the move was not aimed at countering Beijing. However experts say the Aukus agreement signals a paradigm shift in strategy and policy across the region. The timing of the new deal is particularly significant. It comes just a month after the US exit from Afghanistan, when doubts have been raised in multiple quarters about US commitment in the region. Britain too is eager to be more involved in the Asia-Pacific especially after its exit from the European Union and Australia is increasingly concerned about China's influence. ""It is a 'big deal' because this really shows that all three nations are drawing a line in the sand to start and counter the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific,"" Guy Boekenstein, senior director of defence and national security at Australia's Northern Territory government, told the BBC. ""It also publicly demonstrates our combined stance on this and commitment to a stable and secure Indo-Pacific region - one that for the past 70 years has led to the prosperity of all in the region, including China's economic growth."" The agreement involves the sharing of information and technology in a number of areas including intelligence and quantum technology as well as the acquisition of cruise missiles. But the nuclear submarines are key.  They are to be built in Adelaide in South Australia and will involve the US and the UK providing consultation on technology for their production. ""A nuclear submarine has enormous defence capabilities and therefore ramifications for the region. Only six countries in the world have nuclear submarines. They are a really powerful deterrent capability without giving them nuclear weapons,"" Michael Shoebridge, director of defence, strategy and national security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said. UK, US and Australia launch pact to counter China UK to shift foreign policy focus after review China warns UK as carrier strike group approaches Nuclear submarines are much more stealthy than conventional ones - they operate quietly, are able to move easily and are harder to detect. At least eight submarines will be supported, although it's not clear when they will be deployed. The process will take longer due to a lack of nuclear infrastructure in Australia. They will not be nuclear armed, only powered with nuclear reactors. ""Let me be clear: Australia is not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons or establish a civil nuclear capability,"" Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. President Biden added that there would be an initial 18-month consultation period with teams from the three countries to decide how it would work and to ensure compliance with non-proliferation commitments. However, the move does show that the US and UK are willing to take the big step of exporting nuclear technology to a non-nuclear powered nation, according to Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Programme at the Stimson Center. And that is what makes the partnership so unique. This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China ""This technology is extremely sensitive. This is frankly an exception to our policy in many respects, I do not anticipate that this will be undertaken in other circumstances going forward. We view this as a one-off,"" a US official told Reuters, adding that Washington had shared nuclear propulsion technology only once before - with Britain in 1958. In recent years, China has demonstrated increasing power and influence in the region. ""We hear words about co-operation and then we see the threats against Taiwan and events in Hong Kong and the rapid militarisation of the South China Sea. So really when it comes to strategic issues, deterrents seem to be the only thing that makes sense against China,"" Mr Shoebridge said. The US has been investing heavily in other partnerships in the region too with Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, as well as India and Vietnam. This deal could benefit all of them, according to Mr Shoebridge, in the face of concerns about China's growing power. ""The region will appreciate that. This is part of a geopolitical shift which is driven by one big thing. And that is the direction that Xi Jinping is taking. This announcement fits with the growing participation of the world's biggest democracies to deter China from using its power"" Mr Shoebridge added. The response has reportedly been positive, even if it has been a quiet recognition. President Biden will host the first in-person meeting of leaders of the ""Quad"" group of countries next week Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia programme at policy think tank the German Marshall Fund said: ""My understanding from people in the administration - having talked to allies and partners who have an interest in peace and security in the Indo-Pacific - is that there was nothing negative. There is support in the region for deterrence and for having US presence and military presence in the region."" One relationship that will undoubtedly change as a result of the agreement is the one between China and Australia. The two nations have been strong trade partners in the past with a large number of Chinese students choosing to study in Australia. However, political relations deteriorated after Australia backed a global inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus. The pact shows Australia is aligning itself with the US and UK but also signals a vote of confidence in Australia which is looking to play a more active role in Asian security. ""Just because Australia has nuclear submarines doesn't mean it is more powerful than China. It does change the balance of power in the region. If China does face a security situation in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, it will affect the military preparedness or response that China will have to prepare for. It does change the power equilibrium in the region,"" Ms Sun told the BBC. Chinese students 'fear speaking out' in Australia Australia escalates wine dispute with China 'We should unite against China' - Kevin Rudd In response to the deal, China's embassy in Washington said the governments involved ""should shake off their Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice"". However, the reaction on the mainland might be even stronger. ""What's Chinese for apoplectic? One can expect a fiery-hot reaction from Beijingâ¦ This gives Australia and the US another tool in the toolbox to deter China,"" William Choong, senior fellow in regional strategic and political studies at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said.

"This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China The UK's new security agreement with the US and Australia will make it safer and could create hundreds of new jobs, the new foreign secretary has said. The pact, known as Aukus, will see Australia being given the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines. Liz Truss said it showed the UK's readiness to be ""hard-headed"" in defending its interests. But France, whose own submarine deal with Australia was thwarted as a result, has criticised the agreement. It has recalled its ambassadors in the US and Australia for consultations in response, while China has accused the three powers of having a ""Cold War mentality"". Johnson's new cabinet meets for first time Aukus pact could signal power shift in Asia-Pacific The alliance - widely seen as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea - was announced by US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Ms Truss said the partnership showed the UK's commitment to stability in the Indo-Pacific region. She wrote: ""Freedoms need to be defended, so we are also building strong security ties around the world. ""This is about more than foreign policy in the abstract, but delivering for people across the UK and beyond by partnering with like-minded countries to build coalitions based on shared values and shared interests."" Ms Truss, who was was promoted from international trade secretary to foreign secretary in the reshuffle this week, said the pact ""will not just make us safer at home, it could also create hundreds of new and high-skilled jobs, from the shipyards of Govan to the factories of Tyneside"". Liz Truss became Foreign Secretary in this week's reshuffle The pact, which will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies, was described as showing ""profound strategic shifts"" by the UK's national security adviser Stephen Lovegrove. But some have expressed fears that it could provoke China into a war. This week, former Prime Minister Theresa May asked Mr Johnson about the ""implications"" of the partnership in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, but Beijing has increased pressure on the island which it views as a breakaway province. Mr Johnson told MPs that the Aukus agreement was ""not intended to be adversarial"" to China but the UK was ""determined to defend international law"". Clumsy diplomacy, heightened emotions and spy-like secrecy: the row over the new security pact between the UK, the US and Australia has it all. But amid the increasingly shrill invective from humiliated French ministers, there is a fundamental truth: the West is struggling to make up its mind about China. Washington has now been joined by Canberra and London in acting together to address the security challenge. Other countries - particularly some in Europe - are less hawkish, still trying to split the difference between economic co-operation and strategic competition with Beijing. France is furious at the breach of contract by Australia and the lack of trust shown by the US and the UK. So there is talk in the French papers of further retaliation, beyond the recall of ambassadors, perhaps involving Nato. Others are speculating this row might finally encourage Europe to agree some greater strategic autonomy. The truth is more straightforward: if the West wishes to protect its interests in the Indo-Pacific, then France and other European powers need to be on the same page as the US and its Anglophone allies. And right now both sides are not even reading the same book. Meanwhile, France's foreign minister hasaccused Australia and the US of lying over the deal. Speaking on Saturday, Jean-Yves Le Drian said a ""serious crisis"" was in progress between the allies. ""The fact that for the first time in the history of relations between the United States and France we are recalling our ambassador for consultations is a serious political act, which shows the magnitude of the crisis that exists now between our countries,"" he told France 2. But he said France had seen ""no need"" to recall its ambassador to the UK, accusing the country of ""constant opportunism"". ""Britain in this whole thing is a bit like the third wheel,"" he said. The pact means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement ended a deal worth $37bn (Â£27bn) that France had signed with Australia in 2016 to build 12 conventional submarines.

"Customers have been advised not to panic after two energy suppliers announced they had ceased trading. One of the firms is Edinburgh-based People's Energy, which supplies gas and electricity to about 350,000 homes and 1,000 businesses. The other is Dorset-based Utility Point, which has 220,000 domestic customers. National advice service Advice Direct Scotland said energy supplies would continue for those affected. It also said customers would not lose any money owed to them. Consumers have also been advised not to immediately switch to a new supplier as a new company will be chosen by regulator Ofgem. People's Energy was formed in 2017 by East Lothian couple David Pike and Karin Sode following a crowdfunding campaign. The firmpromised to return profits to its customersin a transparent, ethical way of working. In August last year, it announcedplans to create 100 new jobswith an expansion into the Borders. People's Energy was co-founded in 2017 by Karin Sode and David Pike In a statement on its website,external, People's Energy said: ""Please rest assured that your energy supply is secure and all account credit balances are protected for our domestic customers. ""This includes any recent top-ups that were made as part of the seasonal weighting initiative."" It added: ""We are truly sad that we weren't able to make this community-focused approach to energy supply work. ""Thank you to those of you who supported our mission from early on. We are very sorry about the inconvenience and disruption this will cause our customers."" In a similarannouncement on its website,external, Utility Point said customers ""need not worry, their supplies are secure and domestic credit balances are protected"". Advice Direct Scotland, which runs the nationalenergyadvice.scot,externalservice, said customers affected ""should not panic"". Spokesman Colin Mathieson said: ""While this news can be worrying for consumers, it's important to remember that you won't be cut off if your energy supplier has gone out of business - so you don't need to do anything right now. ""The gas and electricity regulator Ofgem will arrange for your account to be transferred to a new supplier. ""There won't be a break in your supply when it's transferred over, although the price you pay for your energy might go up - and that's when you can consider switching supplier, and you won't be charged an exit fee to do so.""
