"Travellers arriving in the UK from Poland, Turkey and three Caribbean islands will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 on Saturday. Poland's infection rate has risen, while the UK government said it removed Turkey over concerns about the way the country reports its data. There will also be tougher fines for those who fail to self-isolate - up to a maximum of Â£10,000 in England. One airport group says it is a ""further blow"" to a ""struggling"" sector. The UK reported a further 6,914 coronavirus cases and 59 deaths on Thursday, and stricter measures have been announced to control a spikein areas of northern England. Announcing the changes to the quarantine list, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said data from Poland showed that ""test positivity has nearly doubled increasing from 3.9% to 5.8% alongside a rapid increase in weekly cases"". Poland is reporting 25.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people, up from 15.6. Arrivals from the Caribbean islands of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba will also have to quarantine from Saturday, he added. Those islands reported 142.4 new cases per 100,000, unchanged from 142.4 the previous week. Which countries are on the UK's quarantine list? Sun, sea and sanitiser: What your holiday will be like Quarantine breakers: 'It was selfish but I've no regrets' Poland and Turkey added to Scots quarantine list Meanwhile, the Scottish Government announced that those arriving from the Portuguese islands of the Azores and Madeira will no longer need to quarantine in Scotland ""due to the low number of cases"". The Azores and Madeira were already on the ""exempt"" list for the rest of the UK. The Scottish government's statement added that it was ""clear that case numbers in Turkey have been under-reported"". Turkey's reported infection rate has dropped to 12.9 cases per 100,000, down from 14.2 in the week prior. It has also been announced that in England, fines for the first offence of failing to self-isolate when required will start at Â£1,000, before increasing to Â£2,000, then Â£4,000 up to a maximum of Â£10,000. The upper limit for repeat offences was previously Â£3,200. The increase in fines will come into force from Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Since the introduction of the travel quarantine regime in the summer, police officers have investigated more than 4,000 alleged breaches of the rules. More than 200 people were found to be ignoring the quarantine requirement, but escaped a fine because they listened to the officer on their doorstep. Overall there were just 38 penalties for breaching holiday quarantine. If you look at the official data coming out of Turkey then it sits comfortably below the UK's benchmark for applying the quarantine of 20 cases for every 100,000 people. But revelations that the number of cases in Turkey has been under-reported has put the country onto the ""red"" list. Turkey and Poland are key destinations for airlines and airports so it's another blow for the travel sector. The Department for Transport is still looking at whether testing can be used at airports to reduce the quarantine period from 14 to seven days. It is almost impossible for the police to enforce quarantine rules so it is hoped heavier fines for repeat offenders will mean fewer people will break the rules. The Manchester Airports Group, which owns and operates Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports, said Poland and Turkey's removal from the travel safe list ""means that a large proportion of the markets our passengers usually travel to are now effectively closed-off, despite many of them having much lower infection rates than the UK"". The announcement ""is a further blow to the already struggling aviation sector"", a statement said. The group said it was ""vital"" for the government to establish a testing regime ""which would allow for a safe reduction in quarantine periods for passengers arriving from abroad"". Tim Alderslade, from Airlines UK, the trade body for UK registered airlines, said a testing regime was ""the only way we can reopen international travel"". ""Without testing aviation cannot recover and we will miss the opportunity to get the economy moving again,"" he said. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) also said it was a ""massive blow for the travel industry"". ""This coupled with popular winter-sun destinations, like the Canary Islands - still on the quarantine list - only piles the pressure on a struggling sector,"" the travel industry trade body said. ""Many travel businesses are in precarious position and will find it difficult to survive unless the government acts now with tailored support to assist the travel industry."" Concert pianist Tomasz Lis has cancelled a performance in Poland on Sunday because of the rules Tomasz Lis, who lives in London after moving to the UK from Poland 23 years ago, runs a travel company offering tailored trips to his home country. He says the new rule will cost him thousands of pounds. The 43-year-old said: ""It's been an impossible year already and the government would do much better by checking temperatures at the airports, for instance, and test people who may have it rather than introduce those absurd rules."" Mr Lis is also a concert pianist and has cancelled a performance in Poland on Sunday because of the rules - meaning he will lose Â£3,000 and the cost of his flights.

"No events that would attract a gathering or crowd will take place this year Edinburgh's Christmas festivals for 2020 have been cancelled because of the Covid-19 outbreak. City of Edinburgh Council and event producers Underbelly said the decision followed the ""latest advice"" from public health experts. Any event which could attract a gathering or crowd - including market stalls and rides - will now not happen. The council said the focus would move to celebrating Edinburgh's Christmas online this year. Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party was called off in Julybecause of the pandemic, but organisers had hoped that other events could take place with access controlled to ensure social distancing. However, the council said it was now clear the ""best place"" to experience Edinburgh's Christmas and Hogmanay would be from home. Cases of Covid-19 are on the increase across Scotland and new measures designed to stem the rise came into force on 22 September, including a 22:00 curfew for bars and restaurants. Adam McVey, leader of City of Edinburgh Council, said: ""Whilst we understand the absence of popular events will bring some disappointment, we want to be clear that Edinburgh's Christmas isn't cancelled and our businesses right across the city will be offering their usual festive cheer for us to take advantage of. ""We look forward to announcing details of an innovative digital 2020 programme soon to help in these celebrations."" Events in Edinburgh over Christmas and New Year have traditionally included markets, fairground rides and a fire parade which starts the city's Hogmanay festival. The city would have also marked its 28th Hogmanay street party, which has had a capacity of 75,000 in recent years. Charlie Wood, director of Underbelly, said: ""We very much wanted to bring some festive cheer and light to Edinburgh this Christmas and to support local makers and producers, at the end of what has been a challenging year for everyone. ""Public health is our absolute number one priority, and with the ongoing uncertainty concerning Covid-19 and the possibility of further restrictions, we have taken the collective and very sad decision with the council, NHS Lothian and Scottish government not to proceed with this year's Edinburgh's Christmas sites in the city centre. ""There will be no public events which might encourage gatherings of people at either Edinburgh's Christmas or Edinburgh's Hogmanay."" The festival is a boost to local businesses in the run up to Christmas Russell Imrie, from the Edinburgh Hotels Association, said the cancellation of the festival would be ""devastating"" for businesses in the city. ""To put an event on of some sort, with Christmas markets dispersed through the city centre, at least it was something you could market for people to come to Edinburgh and it would be something for them to do with a festive feel about it,"" he toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. ""To now hear that everything is cancelled, it almost removes the reason for people to come to Edinburgh during the festive period because they'll just be coming to a city like any other normal day over the winter period. ""At least when there was a festival on it really did feel like a special occasion to visit the city."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Margaret and Lucy on Lucy's wedding day Lockdown, social distancing and local anti-virus restrictions have made seeing loved ones difficult if not impossible for many since Covid-19 hit the UK. For elderly relatives, care home residents and those shielding, the situation has been even more heartbreaking and lonely. But 26-year-old Lucy Mein from Edinburgh has managed to find a unique way of staying in touch with her 86-year-old grandmother who lives hundreds of miles away in Northampton. It has even brought them closer as they share an old-fashioned way of communicating. Lucy's gran Margaret is 86 years old and deaf. Lucy shared one of her paintings on social media and attracted dozens of compliments for the sweet gesture for her grandmother During lockdown the family tried Zoom calls but they frustrated Margaret as she couldn't hear them. She was also not able to have visitors. Lucy started painting her gran a picture every Sunday and writing up her weekly news. Margaret would then send  letter back by the following Friday and the pair became pen-pals. Lucy toldBBC 5 Live's Drive programme: ""It's like sending love in an envelope."" Lucy now treasures her letters from Margaret The idea started with a birthday card at the end of the summer. Lucy said: ""I sent my grandma a birthday card, and she sent me a 'thank you' letter. ""She lives with my grandpa and has struggled in lockdown. ""I always felt connected to her by writing. She writes really well and it's lovely to receive those letters. I just wanted to send her something that would cheer her up."" Margaret loves handmade things and the pair have always made and sent handmade birthday cards to each other. Lucy's husband suggested she keep it up. She said: ""So now I just send her a letter and draw something every week. ""There's a massive geographical gap between us with me in Scotland, her in Northampton. So it's really important for me to keep in touch somehow because I haven't seen her since Christmas."" One of Lucy's paintings for her grandmother Lucy is training to be an architect and she started painting for the first time since high school during lockdown, mainly to get away from her computer. She says she has fallen back in love with it. She paints with watercolours and has sent Margaret, landscapes, nature scenes, bible verses and anything that pops into her head. And she thinks anyone can do the same to create a special bond with a loved one. She said: ""I have loved getting those letters. I keep them in a drawer and feel properly connected and like I can share my life with her and it has deepened our relationship. ""I can't recommend doing this enough to people. It has been a lovely thing to do at such a difficult time.""

"Elvington Airfield, pictured in 2017, is a former RAF base near York A driver has died during a British land speed record attempt. The fatal accident occurred at Elvington Airfield, a former RAF base near York, governing body Motorsport UK said. It said the driver's family had been informed and an investigation into the circumstances had begun. North Yorkshire Police said it was called to reports of a ""serious collision"" at the scene shortly after 16:30 BST. Elvington was an RAF station until 1992, and has become a popular motorsports venue since entering private ownership. It has hosted dozens of world record attempts, and is also used as a filming location. On Sunday, Jason Liversidge, who has motor neurone disease, set a world speed record in hiscustom-made electric wheelchair.

"The Gender Identity Service is based at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust Doctors at a child gender clinic raised concerns about the use of puberty blockers 15 years ago - an issue that was also discussed by staff last year. An internal review conducted in 2005, obtained by BBC Newsnight, says some clinicians felt pressured to refer patients for the treatment too quickly. Staff at the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS)raised serious safeguarding issueslast year. The Trust which runs the clinic said the report was ""no longer relevant"". GIDS, which is run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, is a specialised unit for young people who have difficulties with their gender identity. What does transgender mean and what does the law say? In 2005, the Trust's then medical director, adult psychiatrist Dr David Taylor, conducted a review into the service - then called the Gender Identity Development Unit. He reported that colleagues at the Trust were working hard to provide good care for patients, but highlighted concerns about some aspects of their treatment. The document details concerns raised by some clinicians at that time about alleged pressure on staff to refer patients for treatment with puberty blockers, a lack of a robust evidence base underpinning this treatment, and the apparently troubled backgrounds of some young people referred. These included past sexual abuse and trauma. Staff concerns 'shut down' at child gender clinic NHS gender clinic 'should have challenged me more' Newsnight obtained the 2005 review via the Freedom of Information Act, a move which the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust resisted. It argued disclosure of the document would ""adversely impact on the Trust's ability to provide effective and safe services to its patients"". But theInformation Commissioner's Office ruled,externalthat the document's publication was in the public interest. In his 2005 report Dr Taylor, who left in 2011 after 30 years, made a series of recommendations for improvements to the service - which in 2005 was much smaller, receiving tens of referrals per year rather than thousands. Dr Taylor called for the service to monitor patients after leaving, for more research into this area of healthcare, and for staff to be supported if faced with pressure to refer for treatments when they thought it was inappropriate. In his report, which was published in 2006, he said puberty blockers might be the best course of action for some, but added that in his view young people needed a period of explorative therapy first. The document also detailed concerns from some staff about the speed at which some young people were being referred for treatment with puberty blockers. These drugs stop a young person's body developing, with the aim of helping to relieve gender dysphoria - distress caused when a person's gender identity does not match their biological sex. The NHSnow recognises,externalthat little is known about their long term side effects. Concerns about the use of puberty blockers were subsequently raised by other staff in the internal 2019 review of the service. It is unclear why some recommendations made in 2005 were not implemented, but Dr Taylor told Newsnight there may be several reasons, and said the demand for the service was ""greater than the capacity of the unit to cope."" Society's shifting attitudes towards gender identity, and the underfunding of other adolescent mental health services are also important, he told the BBC. Last month the NHSannounced an independent review,externalinto gender identity services for young people. In a statement the Trust said: ""This report from 2006 is not relevant to the circumstances and issues faced by the GIDS service today. The service had been nationally commissioned since 2009, with NHS England (NHSE) taking responsibility for it in 2013. The service specifications were reviewed in 2016 and are currently under review again, as scheduled. ""Some of the young people we see in the service experience difficulties which may or may not be related to gender dysphoria. GIDS is a specialist service and relies on an integrated care model in which it works closely with local CAMHS to support ongoing difficulties. ""It is important to recognise that not all co-occurring difficulties will be resolved by accessing specialist psychosocial exploration of gender identity and related issues."" The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust welcomed the NHS review of gender services, to be conducted by Dr Hilary Cass, the former President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. ""We welcome this and hope this will lead to better and quicker access to support for these young people.""

"This video can not be played EC president Ursula von der Leyen said the bill breached the UK's previous commitments. The EU has begun legal proceedings against the UK after it refused to ditch plans to override sections of its Brexit divorce deal. An EU deadline for the government to remove sections of the Internal Market Bill expired on Wednesday. The ""letter of formal notice"" could eventually lead to a court case against the UK at the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court. But the EU has not walked away from talks over a post-Brexit trade deal. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the UK would have until the end of November to respond to the EU's concerns over the draft legislation. UK-EU trade talks are continuing in Brussels this week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said both sides should ""move on"" if a deal was not reached by mid-October. Government's Brexit plan gets MPs' final backing EU ultimatum to UK over Brexit talks What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? In a brief statement, Mrs von der Leyen said the bill was a ""full contradiction"" of previous UK commitments over how a hard border on the island of Ireland should be avoided. She added that the bill was by its ""very nature a breach of the obligation of good faith"" contained in the withdrawal agreement that took the UK out of the EU in January. A spokesperson for the UK government said the bill was a necessary ""safety net"" to protect trade between different parts of the UK. They added the government would respond the EU's letter ""in due course"". Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte appeared to play down the importance of the Commission's letter, calling the move ""more administrative than political"". Analysis by Nick Beake, BBC Brussels Correspondent Although the headline is dramatic, this was the EU's next logical step. When it fired the UK an ultimatum to scrap the most controversial parts of the Internal Market Bill by the end of September, it knew it would likely have to follow up on its threat. And now it has. But any legal path is long and unpredictable - with no resolution likely to come before the UK's transition period ends on 31 December. The legal advice given to the EU member states has been that for any alleged breach of the withdrawal agreement committed in 2020, they would have a further four years to pursue the UK. For any alleged breach committed after the transition period, the EU could use the dispute settlement mechanism (which both sides agreed to in the agreement) to penalise and fine the UK. Or, it could ask the European Court of Justice to do the same. But this is drawn out legal territory. It seems the latest legal development will not torpedo the ongoing trade talks - for now. Both sides insist they do want a deal within the coming weeks, but the EU says it won't sign one off, as long as the UK's bill remains as it is. The EU and the UK are now trying to walk two tightropes. And it's precarious balancing act. One route leads to a trade deal, the other to an ugly court battle. But both sides are looking dead ahead, and neither want to blink first. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for both the UK and EU to work together over trade differences, adding: ""A deal can be done here"". ""It's absurd that with weeks to go, the focus and the energy is not on their negotiations, it's on threatened court proceedings,"" he added. MPsgave their final backingto the Internal Market Bill earlier this week. However, it will have to be approved by the House of Lords before it becomes law. In a bid to head off a potential rebellion from Tory backbenchers, ministers have granted the Commons a say before powers to override the Brexit divorce deal could be used. Boris Johnson reached a deal with Tory MPs to amend the bill earlier this month. The letter sent to the UK is the first stage in the process the Commission uses against countries it believes have broken EU law. It can end with the Commission taking governments to court at the European Court of Justice. The ECJ continues to have powers over the UK during the transition period, including over the interpretation and implementation of the withdrawal agreement. The court has powers to force countries to comply with its rulings, including imposing financial penalties. However, most cases are settled before then - and it can take many years for a case to move through the court. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses. The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail.

"The rolls used in Subway's hot sandwiches contain too much sugar to be considered bread, according to Ireland's Supreme Court. Ireland's highest court made the ruling in a case about how the bread is taxed. An Irish franchisee of the US company had claimed it should not pay VAT on the rolls it uses in heated sandwiches. But the court ruled that because of the level of sugar in the rolls they cannot be taxed as bread, which is classed as a ""staple product"" with zero VAT. Under Ireland's VAT Act of 1972, ingredients in bread such as sugar and fat should not exceed 2% of the weight of flour in the dough. Are there good and bad sugars? The five judges, who were considering an appeal by Bookfinders Ltd, a Subway franchisee based near Galway, concluded that in Subway sandwiches the sugar content is around 10% of the flour in the dough for both white and wholegrain rolls. ""Subway's bread is, of course, bread,"" said a spokesperson for Subway. ""We have been baking fresh bread in our stores for more than three decades and our guests return each day for sandwiches made on bread that smells as good as it tastes."" In Irish law, bread is considered a staple food and has a zero rate of VAT. Following the ruling, the rolls are subject to tax at 13.5%. The case stems from a decision by Ireland's tax authority in 2006 to refuse Bookfinders' request for a refund on VAT payments made between 2004 and 2005. After an appeal commissioner upheld the tax authority's refusal of a refund, Bookfinders took its case to the High Court which it lost before going to the Court of Appeal, where it was also unsuccessful. It is not the first time Subway's bread has been in the spotlight. In 2014, the company announced it was removing azodicarbonamide - the so-called ""yoga mat"" chemical - from its rolls. Subway stopped using the so-called ""yoga mat"" chemical - azodicarbonamide - in its bread in 2014 The chemical is used to whiten flour and improve the condition of dough. It is also used to make vinyl foam products such as yoga mats and the underlay for carpets.

The inquiry has heard of ""missed opportunities"" prior to the attack. Police personnel patrolling Manchester Arena were also absent from patrol for more than two hours, the inquiry heard. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? Four British Transport Police (BTP) operatives were present on the night of the attack, one PC and three PCSOs, patrolling in pairs, the hearing in Manchester was told. It heard PC Jessica Bullough and PCSO Mark Renshaw took a break at about 19:30 BST, leaving Manchester Arena to buy food, as the Ariana Grande concert began on 22 May 2017. They returned 45 minutes later and resumed patrolling two hours and 10 minutes after they first departed to buy food, the inquiry heard. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured in the explosion Two more PCSOs, Jon Morrey and Lewis Brown, took an hour's break from 21:15. Between 21:15 and 21:37, it appeared no BTP officer was patrolling the railway station, when Abedi took up his position at 21:33 in the foyer of the venue, the inquiry heard. Earlier, the two PCSOs had conducted a routine check on toilets at Victoria Station at 20:49, less than a minute after Abedi left there. Both police and Showsec security workers later received reports of suspicions from members of the public about Abedi, the inquiry was told. The inquiry continues.

"Stricter measures on social mixing announced for Liverpool, Warrington, Halton, Hartlepool and Middlesbrough Restrictions include a ban on mixing between households in any indoor setting from 00:01 BST on Saturday The mayor of Middlesbrough says he does not accept the restrictions and intends to defy them Paris could be placed under full lockdown as soon as Monday, amid soaring virus cases Poland and Turkey among countries newly added to UK travel quarantine list The growth in cases in England may be slowing since measures including the ""rule of six"" were introduced - study The government plans to implement a three-tier regionalised lockdown system in England, BBC learns A row has erupted over a lockdown in the Spanish capital Madrid after a sharp rise in coronavirus cases Madrid's regional government did not vote in favour of the restrictions and questions their legality Edited by Mal Siret and Martha Buckley We're closing this coronavirus live page now until Friday. Thanks for joining us. Today's updates have been written by Penny Spiller, Ashitha Nagesh, Alex Therrien and Lauren Turner. The editors have been Mal Siret and Martha Buckley. There have been quite a few developments in the UK today. So here's a round-up to bring you up to speed as we prepare to close our live coverage shortly.  It's evening here in the UK, where our team of reporters has been bringing you the latest coronavirus news. A lot has happened today. To summarise, here are the main global headlines. Officials could place Paris under a new lockdown as early as Monday, French Health Minister Olivier Veran told reporters today. The capital and surrounding suburbs already appear to have breached the thresholds for being placed on maximum virus alert, he said, adding that if this was confirmed they would ""have no choice"" but to do so. ""That would imply that people in Paris and suburbs would have to drastically limit their social interactions,"" he said. ""No more family gatherings, no more evenings out, and a total closure of bars."" So far in France, only Marseille and the Caribbean territory of Guadeloupe have been placed on maximum alert. We reported earlier that SNP MP Margaret Ferrier had travelled on the train to London and back with Covid symptoms, and later tested positive for the virus. Now, SNP Westminster group leader Ian Blackford tweets that he's suspended the whip. ""I have spoken with@MargaretFerrier,externalthis evening who fully accepts that what she did was wrong,"" he writes. ""Margaret will be referring herself to the parliamentary standards commissioner as well as the police. I am tonight suspending the whip from Margaret."" Others have been reacting to the news, too. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted: ""Margaret, all the issues surrounding transmission of Covid-19, how infectious it is, how much pain and suffering it has caused to so many. ""You are an elected Member of Parliament making laws to protect citizens from Covid, it wasn't one mistake but multiple ones. So disappointing."" You can read our full story on this here. Does it matter if you wear your face covering wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. If it's not kept clean, your mask will be contaminated and will not work as well. It may put you more at risk of catching Covid-19. In the video below, BBC journalist Laura Foster explains the correct way to wear your homemade mask or face covering. This video can not be played Separately in Scotland, those arriving from the Azores and Madeira will no longer need to quarantine due to the low number of cases there. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""Although we are lifting quarantine restrictions on those travelling from the Azores or Madeira, in line with the public health data we have received, people should think long and hard before choosing to travel abroad, particularly during the forthcoming October break. ""At present all foreign travel carries a risk. Quarantine requirements could be imposed on those arriving on holiday abroad, just as we may make the decision to impose the same in Scotland. âPeople should think very hard before committing to non-essential foreign travel."" One Warrington dad has spoken about his frustration over the new tightening of restrictions. Contract commercial manager Colm Buteux said: ""So as a family of four, we cannot see our parents, or our friends as a family group. ""But I'm allowed on my own to go to the pub with five others from different households? ""My children are facing another six months of not being able to see our closest friends even though that is the only family we mix with."" ""I do get why the government is doing this but they should let people have access to a support bubble,"" he told the BBC. ""Everywhere I go I see people disobeying the rules - they need to be sorted out.Why should I suffer and they donât? ""The kids have been at home for four months. Now they can go to school and do sports. Iâm pleased they can do that. ""I donât care if they close every pub, I want my children to go to school and do exercise. Trying to keep everything together is stressful.â Schools will be made to offer pupils at home the same lessons remotely as those they're teaching in person. The government, which is using powers under the Coronavirus Act, says it's formalising pupils' right to remote learning. Ministers also insist that schools will only close as a last resort. Instead, where areas are high, schools may switch to a rota system of two weeks on and two weeks off. But teachers' unions say it's a ""grave error"" to reach for legal powers when schools are already preparing for all eventualities, and that ministers should focus on ""support not sanction"". ""By reaching for legal powers, the government risks sending an unequivocal message to the profession and parents that they do not trust school leaders to act in the interests of young people in this country,"" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT head teachers' union, says. The owners of a bar in Bolton say they feel the hospitality sector has been blamed for a rise in coronavirus cases. Rebecca Brayshaw, who runs Little Bolton Town Hall bar and events space, said it had been shut for the past three weeks. But with Bolton now set to fall into line with the rest of Greater Manchester, the bar can reopen from Saturday. ""Our plight, our voice has been heard,"" she says. She and husband Chris are now waiting to hear the finer details of whether customers will have to be from a single household, or if the rule of six will apply. The regulations have been ""devastating in a lot of ways, financially and emotionally"" she tells he BBC. ""It's exhausting to wake up every day and wonder what, if any, part of your business will survive. ""We want people to be safe. That's the key everyone is striving for. The issue potentially is if hospitality is being blamed, which it very much feels like it has been recently, that ongoing negative effect continues."" That means people don't go out as much and are fearful, ""through no fault of our own"", despite the bar's Covid security measures, adds Mrs Brayshaw, adding: ""We need people to come and visit us."" Mr Brayshaw said today's news was a step in the right direction - but that it is part of a bigger battle.   Jumping on a plane and going on holiday looks and feels very different to how it did at the start of 2020. Airports and airlines have both been making changes to the way they work to get passengers flying again - including measures that help reduce the chances of the virus being spread. In this video, BBC journalist Laura Foster goes toSouthend Airport,externalto show you what you need to do if you're thinking of catching a flight. This video can not be played Hundreds of millions of people in China are celebrating the National Day holiday today, marking the founding of the People's Republic of China, with large gatherings and quick getaways. It's estimated that about 550 million people will travel within the country during the eight-day holiday known as ""Golden Week"". It's also thought that 13 million passenger trips were made today - the highest figure since February,according to state media,external. Although coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the country appears to have largely stopped the spread of the virus, and most restrictions have been lifted. Images of China today are worlds apart from a nation that was under lockdown earlier this year. You can see our full gallery here. The Manchester Airports Group said Poland and Turkey's removal from the travel exemptions list ""means that a large proportion of the markets our passengers usually travel to are now effectively closed off, despite many of them having much lower infection rates than the UK"". The announcement ""is a further blow to the already struggling aviation sector"", said the group, which owns and operates Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports. It is ""vital"" for the government to establish a testing regime ""which would allow for a safe reduction in quarantine periods for passengers arriving from abroad"", it added. This week 170 workers at a pork meat processing plant in Cornwall tested positive for Covid-19. Most of those who tested positive were unaware they had Covid-19 and were not displaying symptoms. This is just the latest in a long line of meat processing plants across the world that have experienced outbreaks, including in Germany, France, Spain and the US. So what makes them so vulnerable? ""Factories and, in particular, indoor areas which are cold and damp, are perfect environments for coronavirus to linger and spread,"" according to Lawrence Young, Professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick. Read more about how Covid spreads in meat processing plantshere. SNP MP Margaret Ferrier has apologised for breaching Covid rules by travelling to and from London while she had coronavirus symptoms. Ferrier says her symptoms were ""mild"", and that by the time she took the train to London to attend Parliament she was ""feeling much better"". She later tested positive for the virus. She says she's notified the police. ""Despite feeling well, I should have self-isolated while waiting for my test result, and I deeply regret my actions,"" she says. She tweeted her full statement, below. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But Labour's Ian Murray, the shadow secretary of state for Scotland, tweeted: ""It can't be one rule for Margaret Ferrier, and one rule for everyone else.
""Nicola Sturgeon must condemn her MP's actions and tell the Scottish people what disciplinary action she will be taking."" We've been hearing today about further restrictions being brought in for parts of north-east and north-west England. A bit more information has come through, confirming the measures are being made law in the Liverpool City Region, Halton, Warrington, Hartlepool and Middlesbrough. It means people living there won't be able to mix with those outside their own household, in any indoor setting. Meanwhile, stricter measures in Bolton are being eased, so it will be in line with the rest of Greater Manchester. The move follows pleas from local leaders to allow hospitality venues to open under the same conditions as the rest of the region - like having table service, and closing at 10pm. It also means bowling alleys, indoor skating rinks, casinos, indoor play, including soft play and conference centres and exhibit halls will also be able to reopen in Bolton. And rules on weddings, wedding receptions and funerals will be the same as the rest of the country. All the latest - including the areas now on the government's watchlist - can be foundhere,external. As part of that, Sheffield has been moved from an ""area of concern"" to an ""area of enhanced support"", which means more resources - which could mean more testing - for the city.  Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent ""Shambolic"" is how one journalist in The Hague described
the Dutch position on masks. Faced with one of the most rapidly spreading infection rates in
Europe, last night Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, under pressure from
parliament and the public, issued ""urgent and immediate advice"" for people to
wear face masks in indoor spaces. It's been an awkward but unavoidable U-turn for Mr Rutte, who
initially stood out as one of the world's most mask-sceptic leaders. While neighbouring countries locked down and brought in
wide-reaching restrictions and compulsory mask-wearing in public places, Mr
Rutte said he was ""not a dictator"" and congratulated the Dutch for being
capable of following social distancing rules without being ""treated like
children"". Six months since the start of the pandemic, the Dutch are breaking
their own records for the daily number of new cases, while neighbouring nations
are easing their rules. From what I witnessed in The Hague today, there are still more
people exercising their right not to mask up than taking responsibility to do
what the widely accepted science suggests could help to protect themselves and
others. Students should be allowed to leave university and study online if they want to, according to unions representing academics and students. The National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union are calling for the government to take urgent action. It comes after university campuses have been hit by outbreaks of the virus, with many students in self isolation. Larissa Kennedy, NUS president, said students had been left ""trapped in halls"" and were struggling to access food and wellbeing resources. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said students will be allowed to be with their families at Christmas if they choose to. But the education unions are calling for a move to online learning wherever possible - and they say students should be given a safe way to leave campus now if they want to. Students should not face any financial detriment for giving up accommodation, or choosing to defer or leave university, they say. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on the government to provide a ""support package"" to those university students currently self-isolating. He said: ""There should have been serious consideration to delay going back. There certainly should have been some thought as to testing."" Read more here. Krakow Old Town in Poland Grant Shapps, announcing the new quarantine rules, also took the opportunity to remind people of the rules. ""You MUST self-isolate if you enter the UK from a non-exempt country - from tomorrow, weâre increasing the penalties for people who refuse to do so to a maximum of Â£10,000 for repeat offenders,"" he wrote on Twitter. Those fines apply to England, rather than the whole of the UK. He added a message saying: ""REMINDER: If you do travel, you must complete a Passenger Locator Form before returning to the UK. Do your bit to help keep everyone safe."" Mr Shapps added that data from Poland showed that positive tests had nearly doubled - increasing from 3.9% to 5.8% - and there had been ""a rapid increase in weekly cases"" there. Read all the latest on the new rules here. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent The maximum fine for repeatedly breaching the travel quarantine in England is set to rise from Â£3,200 to Â£10,000.  The fine for a single offence will remain at Â£1,000.However in the case of someone committing a second offence it would rise to Â£2,000, or Â£4,000 for a third offence.For a fourth or subsequent offence, the fine would be Â£10,000.

"Executive ministers confirmed that a circuit breaker lockdown across Northern Ireland is not being considered yet Pubs, cafes, restaurants and hotels in the Derry and Strabane council area are to be placed under new restrictions to try and curb the spread of Covid-19. They will only be able to open for takeaway, delivery and outdoor dining, First Minister Arlene Foster said. It is part of a series of measures due to come into force next week, which will last for at least a fortnight. But Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill urged residents to comply immediately with the new rules. Meanwhile, Londonderry's Altnagelvin Hospital has suspended some services to manage Covid-19 patients. The Western Trust says elective orthopaedic inpatient services have been suspended and it has implemented its surge plan and re-designated the ward to cope with the expected surge. The Trust says the decision will be kept under review. It has also warned that it is facing increased staff pressures, as rising levels of Covid-19 in the community mean more and more staff are being asked to self-isolate. In a statement, the trust's Director of Acute Services, Geraldine McKay, said red flag cancer and emergency surgery were continuing, alongside some face-to-face and virtual outpatient clinics. On Thursday afternoon, the executive agreed to impose the measures on hospitality businesses in Derry and Strabane because it has one of the highest Covid-19 rates in the UK. Where residents can, work from home Avoid unnecessary travel within the council area and to and from it Where journeys are necessary, advice is to walk, cycle or use private transport Hotels will only be allowed to provide service to overnight guests No spectators can attend sporting events All museums, galleries and cultural attractions in the council area are to remain closed No organised indoor gatherings in community halls Libraries can only operate a ""call and collect"" service Indoor sports limited to individual training only, no exercise classes permitted Schools and other educational settings will stay open. Church services will continue, and weddings and funerals will still be permitted, in line with current executive guidance. Mrs Foster said it was ""by no means"" a return to lockdown for the area, but she told a Stormont press briefing she recognised the news would come as a ""hammer-blow"" for businesses. She said ministers had commenced work on how financial support measures could be drawn up. Ms O'Neill said she recognised many people would be ""sad and worried"", but added that the executive would try to provide as much clarity as possible. ""This is about everyone doing their bit to keep everybody safe - just because you don't have symptoms doesn't mean you're not spreading the virus,"" she said. Foyle MP and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood urged people to abide by the new restrictions, but said it was ""a two-way street"". ""Government cannot restrict trading opportunities in the north west without additional support for businesses that will close and workers forced to be at home,"" he said. He added that he would seek a support package for those affected. On Thursday, the Department of Health announced a further 259 cases of Covid-19, down from 424 on Wednesday. Two further Covid-related deaths were confirmed, bringing the Department of Health's total to 581. The Department of Health mostly records fatalities in a hospital setting. Northern Ireland is currently recording an average of 250 new cases a day and the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital is doubling every 13 days. In the Republic of Ireland, 442 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed on Thursday with four more deaths, bringing the overall death toll to 1,806. A so-called two week ""circuit breaker"" lockdown is not being considered yet, but on Wednesday Health Minister Robin Swann said it could be brought in around the Halloween break at the end of this month, if not earlier. Asked why the executive did not opt to introduce the move across Northern Ireland now, Mrs Foster said they did not believe it was appropriate yet. The Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said it was ""crucial we don't introduce measures if they're not necessary"". Mrs Foster also said returning to a wider lockdown would require significant financial support for businesses. ""We are very much aware if you are asking people to stay at home, not go to work and keep children at home there are huge financial burdens from that,"" she added. While Ms O'Neill said there were ""natural breaks"" with the half-term holidays coming up, and it made sense to align that with potential NI-wide lockdowns. ""If we were going to move forward with this concept it would be much better if it was done across the two islands together,"" she added. ""We haven't discussed this at length in the executive yet... but if we were to get to the point we were moving in that direction, we need to give people advance notice and understanding so we get that buy-in."" The first and deputy first ministers also warned that tougher penalties were on the way for those who breach the Covid-19 regulations. Mrs Foster said the Justice Minister Naomi Long was carrying out a ""rapid review"" of fines, and Ms O'Neill said the executive had ""concerns around compliance"" that it hopes to address in the coming days. Restrictions on pub opening times have been put in place On Thursday, the Department of Health announced that travellers from Turkey and Poland will soon have to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival into Northern Ireland. The measure will take effect from 04:00 BST on Saturday and also includes travellers arriving in NI from the regions of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba. Meanwhile, from Thursday pubs and restaurants must close their doors at 23:00 BSTunder new rules designed to help stem the spread of the virus. It means no food or alcohol can be served after 22:30 BST and all customers must be off the premises 30 minutes after that. The rules also apply to hotel bars, weddings and other social events, with no late licences permitted. No more than six people from two households may sit at the same indoor or outdoor table at a pub or restaurant here, and live music and dancing are banned. The only exception is a couple's first dance at a wedding.

"There are currently different rules across local areas of England The government is to push ahead with a new ""three-tier"" approach to coronavirus restrictions in local areas of England, the BBC understands. The Department of Health confirmed last month the system was being considered - but it has now been signed off by government officials and politicians. An announcement is expected next week, with the roll-out of the new tiers expected in mid-October. The Department of Health said there were ""no imminent changes"" expected. A spokesman for No 10 added: ""We keep all of the measures which we put in place under review - if there is anything further to set out then we will do so to the House"". According to amemo seen by the BBC,external, public health officials will receive precise proposals later on Thursday. The government's aim is to replace the patchwork of existing Covid-19 restrictions across the country. Northern England Covid rules on households tighten Growth in Covid cases may be slowing New rules at-a-glance: More face coverings and fines Areas that fall into tier one will have fewer than 100 cases per 100,000 of population and will need to adhere to national restrictions - such as the ""rule of six"" and social distancing. Tier two would kick in where cases are above 100 per 100,000. Restrictions for these areas would be similar to those currently in place in large parts of northern England, such as bans on household meetings. And tier three areas would have significantly higher rates and would face full lockdowns - excluding schools and essential businesses, like supermarkets, as well as places of worship. The memo seen by the BBC shows plans for additional money for local authorities placed into tiers two or three. Local authorities would get Â£1 per head of population if placed into tier two and Â£2 per head for tier three. When all areas are ""mapped"" onto the new system, it is not believed any areas will be moved to level three at this stage. The BBC understands some within Public Health England are concerned at the speed of the transition. But there is also an acknowledgement the new system could ""simplify and rationalise the current set up"".

Thanks for joining us. Today's updates have been written by Penny Spiller, Ashitha Nagesh, Alex Therrien and Lauren Turner. The editors have been Mal Siret and Martha Buckley. There have been quite a few developments in the UK today. So here's a round-up to bring you up to speed as we prepare to close our live coverage shortly.  It's evening here in the UK, where our team of reporters has been bringing you the latest coronavirus news. A lot has happened today. To summarise, here are the main global headlines. Officials could place Paris under a new lockdown as early as Monday, French Health Minister Olivier Veran told reporters today. The capital and surrounding suburbs already appear to have breached the thresholds for being placed on maximum virus alert, he said, adding that if this was confirmed they would ""have no choice"" but to do so. ""That would imply that people in Paris and suburbs would have to drastically limit their social interactions,"" he said. ""No more family gatherings, no more evenings out, and a total closure of bars."" So far in France, only Marseille and the Caribbean territory of Guadeloupe have been placed on maximum alert. We reported earlier that SNP MP Margaret Ferrier had travelled on the train to London and back with Covid symptoms, and later tested positive for the virus. Now, SNP Westminster group leader Ian Blackford tweets that he's suspended the whip. ""I have spoken with@MargaretFerrier,externalthis evening who fully accepts that what she did was wrong,"" he writes. ""Margaret will be referring herself to the parliamentary standards commissioner as well as the police. I am tonight suspending the whip from Margaret."" Others have been reacting to the news, too. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted: ""Margaret, all the issues surrounding transmission of Covid-19, how infectious it is, how much pain and suffering it has caused to so many. ""You are an elected Member of Parliament making laws to protect citizens from Covid, it wasn't one mistake but multiple ones. So disappointing."" You can read our full story on this here. Does it matter if you wear your face covering wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. If it's not kept clean, your mask will be contaminated and will not work as well. It may put you more at risk of catching Covid-19. In the video below, BBC journalist Laura Foster explains the correct way to wear your homemade mask or face covering. This video can not be played Separately in Scotland, those arriving from the Azores and Madeira will no longer need to quarantine due to the low number of cases there. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""Although we are lifting quarantine restrictions on those travelling from the Azores or Madeira, in line with the public health data we have received, people should think long and hard before choosing to travel abroad, particularly during the forthcoming October break. ""At present all foreign travel carries a risk. Quarantine requirements could be imposed on those arriving on holiday abroad, just as we may make the decision to impose the same in Scotland. âPeople should think very hard before committing to non-essential foreign travel."" One Warrington dad has spoken about his frustration over the new tightening of restrictions. Contract commercial manager Colm Buteux said: ""So as a family of four, we cannot see our parents, or our friends as a family group. ""But I'm allowed on my own to go to the pub with five others from different households? ""My children are facing another six months of not being able to see our closest friends even though that is the only family we mix with."" ""I do get why the government is doing this but they should let people have access to a support bubble,"" he told the BBC. ""Everywhere I go I see people disobeying the rules - they need to be sorted out.Why should I suffer and they donât? ""The kids have been at home for four months.

Trying to keep everything together is stressful.â Schools will be made to offer pupils at home the same lessons remotely as those they're teaching in person. The government, which is using powers under the Coronavirus Act, says it's formalising pupils' right to remote learning. Ministers also insist that schools will only close as a last resort. Instead, where areas are high, schools may switch to a rota system of two weeks on and two weeks off. But teachers' unions say it's a ""grave error"" to reach for legal powers when schools are already preparing for all eventualities, and that ministers should focus on ""support not sanction"". ""By reaching for legal powers, the government risks sending an unequivocal message to the profession and parents that they do not trust school leaders to act in the interests of young people in this country,"" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT head teachers' union, says. The owners of a bar in Bolton say they feel the hospitality sector has been blamed for a rise in coronavirus cases. Rebecca Brayshaw, who runs Little Bolton Town Hall bar and events space, said it had been shut for the past three weeks. But with Bolton now set to fall into line with the rest of Greater Manchester, the bar can reopen from Saturday. ""Our plight, our voice has been heard,"" she says. She and husband Chris are now waiting to hear the finer details of whether customers will have to be from a single household, or if the rule of six will apply. The regulations have been ""devastating in a lot of ways, financially and emotionally"" she tells he BBC. ""It's exhausting to wake up every day and wonder what, if any, part of your business will survive. ""We want people to be safe. That's the key everyone is striving for. The issue potentially is if hospitality is being blamed, which it very much feels like it has been recently, that ongoing negative effect continues."" That means people don't go out as much and are fearful, ""through no fault of our own"", despite the bar's Covid security measures, adds Mrs Brayshaw, adding: ""We need people to come and visit us."" Mr Brayshaw said today's news was a step in the right direction - but that it is part of a bigger battle.   Jumping on a plane and going on holiday looks and feels very different to how it did at the start of 2020. Airports and airlines have both been making changes to the way they work to get passengers flying again - including measures that help reduce the chances of the virus being spread. In this video, BBC journalist Laura Foster goes toSouthend Airport,externalto show you what you need to do if you're thinking of catching a flight. This video can not be played Hundreds of millions of people in China are celebrating the National Day holiday today, marking the founding of the People's Republic of China, with large gatherings and quick getaways. It's estimated that about 550 million people will travel within the country during the eight-day holiday known as ""Golden Week"". It's also thought that 13 million passenger trips were made today - the highest figure since February,according to state media,external. Although coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the country appears to have largely stopped the spread of the virus, and most restrictions have been lifted. Images of China today are worlds apart from a nation that was under lockdown earlier this year. You can see our full gallery here. The Manchester Airports Group said Poland and Turkey's removal from the travel exemptions list ""means that a large proportion of the markets our passengers usually travel to are now effectively closed off, despite many of them having much lower infection rates than the UK"". The announcement ""is a further blow to the already struggling aviation sector"", said the group, which owns and operates Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports. It is ""vital"" for the government to establish a testing regime ""which would allow for a safe reduction in quarantine periods for passengers arriving from abroad"", it added. This week 170 workers at a pork meat processing plant in Cornwall tested positive for Covid-19. Most of those who tested positive were unaware they had Covid-19 and were not displaying symptoms. This is just the latest in a long line of meat processing plants across the world that have experienced outbreaks, including in Germany, France, Spain and the US. So what makes them so vulnerable? ""Factories and, in particular, indoor areas which are cold and damp, are perfect environments for coronavirus to linger and spread,"" according to Lawrence Young, Professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick. Read more about how Covid spreads in meat processing plantshere. SNP MP Margaret Ferrier has apologised for breaching Covid rules by travelling to and from London while she had coronavirus symptoms. Ferrier says her symptoms were ""mild"", and that by the time she took the train to London to attend Parliament she was ""feeling much better"". She later tested positive for the virus. She says she's notified the police. ""Despite feeling well, I should have self-isolated while waiting for my test result, and I deeply regret my actions,"" she says.

But Labour's Ian Murray, the shadow secretary of state for Scotland, tweeted: ""It can't be one rule for Margaret Ferrier, and one rule for everyone else.
""Nicola Sturgeon must condemn her MP's actions and tell the Scottish people what disciplinary action she will be taking."" We've been hearing today about further restrictions being brought in for parts of north-east and north-west England. A bit more information has come through, confirming the measures are being made law in the Liverpool City Region, Halton, Warrington, Hartlepool and Middlesbrough. It means people living there won't be able to mix with those outside their own household, in any indoor setting. Meanwhile, stricter measures in Bolton are being eased, so it will be in line with the rest of Greater Manchester. The move follows pleas from local leaders to allow hospitality venues to open under the same conditions as the rest of the region - like having table service, and closing at 10pm. It also means bowling alleys, indoor skating rinks, casinos, indoor play, including soft play and conference centres and exhibit halls will also be able to reopen in Bolton. And rules on weddings, wedding receptions and funerals will be the same as the rest of the country. All the latest - including the areas now on the government's watchlist - can be foundhere,external. As part of that, Sheffield has been moved from an ""area of concern"" to an ""area of enhanced support"", which means more resources - which could mean more testing - for the city.  Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent ""Shambolic"" is how one journalist in The Hague described
the Dutch position on masks. Faced with one of the most rapidly spreading infection rates in
Europe, last night Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, under pressure from
parliament and the public, issued ""urgent and immediate advice"" for people to
wear face masks in indoor spaces. It's been an awkward but unavoidable U-turn for Mr Rutte, who
initially stood out as one of the world's most mask-sceptic leaders. While neighbouring countries locked down and brought in
wide-reaching restrictions and compulsory mask-wearing in public places, Mr
Rutte said he was ""not a dictator"" and congratulated the Dutch for being
capable of following social distancing rules without being ""treated like
children"". Six months since the start of the pandemic, the Dutch are breaking
their own records for the daily number of new cases, while neighbouring nations
are easing their rules. From what I witnessed in The Hague today, there are still more
people exercising their right not to mask up than taking responsibility to do
what the widely accepted science suggests could help to protect themselves and
others. Students should be allowed to leave university and study online if they want to, according to unions representing academics and students. The National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union are calling for the government to take urgent action. It comes after university campuses have been hit by outbreaks of the virus, with many students in self isolation. Larissa Kennedy, NUS president, said students had been left ""trapped in halls"" and were struggling to access food and wellbeing resources. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said students will be allowed to be with their families at Christmas if they choose to. But the education unions are calling for a move to online learning wherever possible - and they say students should be given a safe way to leave campus now if they want to. Students should not face any financial detriment for giving up accommodation, or choosing to defer or leave university, they say. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on the government to provide a ""support package"" to those university students currently self-isolating. He said: ""There should have been serious consideration to delay going back. There certainly should have been some thought as to testing."" Read more here. Krakow Old Town in Poland Grant Shapps, announcing the new quarantine rules, also took the opportunity to remind people of the rules. ""You MUST self-isolate if you enter the UK from a non-exempt country - from tomorrow, weâre increasing the penalties for people who refuse to do so to a maximum of Â£10,000 for repeat offenders,"" he wrote on Twitter. Those fines apply to England, rather than the whole of the UK. He added a message saying: ""REMINDER: If you do travel, you must complete a Passenger Locator Form before returning to the UK. Do your bit to help keep everyone safe."" Mr Shapps added that data from Poland showed that positive tests had nearly doubled - increasing from 3.9% to 5.8% - and there had been ""a rapid increase in weekly cases"" there. Read all the latest on the new rules here. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent The maximum fine for repeatedly breaching the travel quarantine in England is set to rise from Â£3,200 to Â£10,000.  The fine for a single offence will remain at Â£1,000.However in the case of someone committing a second offence it would rise to Â£2,000, or Â£4,000 for a third offence.For a fourth or subsequent offence, the fine would be Â£10,000.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have called for the end of ""structural racism"" in a piece written for a newspaper for Black History Month. Prince Harry and Meghan said there had been changes in the UK in the past 30 years but ""sufficient progress had not been achieved"". They were writing in theLondon Evening Standard,externalas they highlighted leaders in the UK's black community. The couple recently urged voters in the US electionto ""reject hate"".

Harry and Meghan to make shows with Netflix Harry and Meghan: 'Past has to be acknowledged' Prince Harry repays cottage renovation cost In the piece they said that ""if you are white and British, the world you see often looks just like you"" and spoke of the importance for young people of seeing role models and leaders who share the same skin colour as them. ""For as long as structural racism exists, there will be generations of young people of colour who do not start their lives with the same equality of opportunity as their white peers. And for as long as that continues, untapped potential will never get to be realised,"" they warned. The duke and duchess concluded the article by saying: ""We cannot change history, nor can we edit our past. But we can define our future as one that is inclusive, as one that is equal, and one that is colourful."" Race equality think tank Runnymede describes structural racism as ""the set of circumstances artificially created over generations, through European colonialism, which holds 'whiteness' to be superior."" After the article was published, a spokesman for Prince Harry told the BBC: ""The Duke believes structural racism exists in the UK and I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who disagrees with that. ""He is not saying that Britain itself is structurally racist or that Britain is racist."" The spokesman said the Duke was referring to parts of institutions in Britain. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex during their tour of South Africa In anaccompanying interview,externalMeghan said she understood that the Black Lives Matter protests followingGeorge Floyd's deathin the US had been ""inflammatory for a lot of people"" but said when there is peaceful protest with the intention of wanting community and equality, ""that is a beautiful thing"". She added: ""While it has been challenging for a lot of people certainly having to make this reckoning of historical significance that has got people to the place that they are, that is uncomfortable for people. We recognise that. It is uncomfortable for us."" Prince Harry told the paper he accepted some of their views may be seen as ""controversial"" but said it was an important time to use their platform. He said it was not about ""pointing the finger"" but was an important time in British and world culture ""that we should be grasping and actually celebrating"". They also discussed their son, who Meghan said keeps them on their toes and dance groupDiversity's performance on Britain's Got Talent, which the duke said was ""the most amazing display"". The list of""Next Gen Trailblazers"",externalwas selected by BAME celebrities including rugby player Maro Itoje, Booker-prize winner Bernadine Evaristo and Baroness Doreen Lawrence.

"This video can not be played An attempt was made on Thursday to move the whales out to sea Boats are being used to herd whales from a Scottish loch into the open sea ahead of a huge military exercise in the region. Experts have been monitoring the northern bottlenose whales in Gare Loch in Argyll for the last month. An operation began at 10:30 on Thursday to move the whales from the sea loch over fears sonar used by warships could distress the animals. There are also concerns that one of the whales is looking ""skinny"". Europe's largest military exercise - Joint Warrior - begins on Saturday and its headquarters will be at Faslane, the naval base next to Gare Loch. The operation to move the mammals is being led by the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR). It said five whales have been spotted in the Loch Long area and some have entered some of the smaller lochs nearby. ""It is very unusual for them to be in coastal waters,"" said a charity spokesman. ""However, we have had similar incidents in recent years where animals of the same species have entered lochs, including Loch Long, that have subsequently left of their own accord without intervention, and presumably have succeeded in returning to their proper habitat. ""We recently became aware that a significant military exercise is due to begin next week, and as whales are particularly sensitive to underwater sound, have been concerned about the effect it may have on the animals."" It added that attempting to move them ""of course does come with risks of its own and there is no guarantee it will be successful given the depth of water and distance that needs to be covered, so will be undertaken with as much care as possible. ""We will of course reassess our actions and options if the whales decide that they will not go."" Gavin Lemon, a volunteer with the charity, said the animals would be herded from Gare Loch using a number of boats in formation. He said it was important to move the animals while they were healthy and in good condition. ""We've been monitoring them - they are feeding on local fish,"" he said. ""They usually like squid and the like, diving up to 1,000m (3,000ft). ""Gare Loch is about 25m (80ft) deep. So they've not been having their normal diet, but it has been sustaining them. ""However, one of them looks skinny which is not a good sign with a whale."" Jamie Munro has been photographing the whales while they have been in the area between the naval base and the top of the loch. He told BBC Scotland: ""At first we thought it a real novelty with the three of them tail slapping and breaching. We thought they were fishing."" But he said concern grew and whale watchers have expressed concern that the animals were in distress. ""I've been watching them now from our house for six days and every morning I go out early hoping not to see them and that they have made it out, but sure enough they pop up and so it goes."" Warships, aircraft, marines and troops from the UK, Nato and allied forces will take part in the military exercise, which is due to run until 15 October. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ""The Royal Navy takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously and continues to work with the relevant UK authorities to ensure all practical measures required to reduce environmental risk and comply with legislation are taken. ""A necessary series of safety checks is observed and an environmental risk assessment is carried out before any underwater task is undertaken by MoD, to minimise any potential risk to marine life."" He added that members of the armed forces who are involved in the Exercise Joint Warrior training in the area will be made aware of the presence of the whales and the latest sightings. ""All participants are aware that environmental protection remains a priority for the exercise and we are prepared to amend the programme if these whales remain in an atypical situation,"" he added.

Airports and airlines have both been making changes to the way they work to get passengers flying again - including measures that help reduce the chances of the virus being spread.

It's estimated that about 550 million people will travel within the country during the eight-day holiday known as ""Golden Week"". It's also thought that 13 million passenger trips were made today - the highest figure since February,according to state media,external. Although coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the country appears to have largely stopped the spread of the virus, and most restrictions have been lifted. Images of China today are worlds apart from a nation that was under lockdown earlier this year. You can see our full gallery here. The Manchester Airports Group said Poland and Turkey's removal from the travel exemptions list ""means that a large proportion of the markets our passengers usually travel to are now effectively closed off, despite many of them having much lower infection rates than the UK"". The announcement ""is a further blow to the already struggling aviation sector"", said the group, which owns and operates Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports. It is ""vital"" for the government to establish a testing regime ""which would allow for a safe reduction in quarantine periods for passengers arriving from abroad"", it added. This week 170 workers at a pork meat processing plant in Cornwall tested positive for Covid-19. Most of those who tested positive were unaware they had Covid-19 and were not displaying symptoms. This is just the latest in a long line of meat processing plants across the world that have experienced outbreaks, including in Germany, France, Spain and the US. So what makes them so vulnerable? ""Factories and, in particular, indoor areas which are cold and damp, are perfect environments for coronavirus to linger and spread,"" according to Lawrence Young, Professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick.

Ferrier says her symptoms were ""mild"", and that by the time she took the train to London to attend Parliament she was ""feeling much better"". She later tested positive for the virus. She says she's notified the police. ""Despite feeling well, I should have self-isolated while waiting for my test result, and I deeply regret my actions,"" she says.

""Nicola Sturgeon must condemn her MP's actions and tell the Scottish people what disciplinary action she will be taking."" We've been hearing today about further restrictions being brought in for parts of north-east and north-west England. A bit more information has come through, confirming the measures are being made law in the Liverpool City Region, Halton, Warrington, Hartlepool and Middlesbrough. It means people living there won't be able to mix with those outside their own household, in any indoor setting. Meanwhile, stricter measures in Bolton are being eased, so it will be in line with the rest of Greater Manchester. The move follows pleas from local leaders to allow hospitality venues to open under the same conditions as the rest of the region - like having table service, and closing at 10pm. It also means bowling alleys, indoor skating rinks, casinos, indoor play, including soft play and conference centres and exhibit halls will also be able to reopen in Bolton. And rules on weddings, wedding receptions and funerals will be the same as the rest of the country. All the latest - including the areas now on the government's watchlist - can be foundhere,external. As part of that, Sheffield has been moved from an ""area of concern"" to an ""area of enhanced support"", which means more resources - which could mean more testing - for the city.  Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent ""Shambolic"" is how one journalist in The Hague described
the Dutch position on masks. Faced with one of the most rapidly spreading infection rates in
Europe, last night Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, under pressure from
parliament and the public, issued ""urgent and immediate advice"" for people to
wear face masks in indoor spaces. It's been an awkward but unavoidable U-turn for Mr Rutte, who
initially stood out as one of the world's most mask-sceptic leaders. While neighbouring countries locked down and brought in
wide-reaching restrictions and compulsory mask-wearing in public places, Mr
Rutte said he was ""not a dictator"" and congratulated the Dutch for being
capable of following social distancing rules without being ""treated like
children"". Six months since the start of the pandemic, the Dutch are breaking
their own records for the daily number of new cases, while neighbouring nations
are easing their rules. From what I witnessed in The Hague today, there are still more
people exercising their right not to mask up than taking responsibility to do
what the widely accepted science suggests could help to protect themselves and
others. Students should be allowed to leave university and study online if they want to, according to unions representing academics and students. The National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union are calling for the government to take urgent action. It comes after university campuses have been hit by outbreaks of the virus, with many students in self isolation. Larissa Kennedy, NUS president, said students had been left ""trapped in halls"" and were struggling to access food and wellbeing resources. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said students will be allowed to be with their families at Christmas if they choose to. But the education unions are calling for a move to online learning wherever possible - and they say students should be given a safe way to leave campus now if they want to. Students should not face any financial detriment for giving up accommodation, or choosing to defer or leave university, they say. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on the government to provide a ""support package"" to those university students currently self-isolating. He said: ""There should have been serious consideration to delay going back. There certainly should have been some thought as to testing."" Read more here. Krakow Old Town in Poland Grant Shapps, announcing the new quarantine rules, also took the opportunity to remind people of the rules. ""You MUST self-isolate if you enter the UK from a non-exempt country - from tomorrow, weâre increasing the penalties for people who refuse to do so to a maximum of Â£10,000 for repeat offenders,"" he wrote on Twitter. Those fines apply to England, rather than the whole of the UK. He added a message saying: ""REMINDER: If you do travel, you must complete a Passenger Locator Form before returning to the UK. Do your bit to help keep everyone safe."" Mr Shapps added that data from Poland showed that positive tests had nearly doubled - increasing from 3.9% to 5.8% - and there had been ""a rapid increase in weekly cases"" there. Read all the latest on the new rules here. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent The maximum fine for repeatedly breaching the travel quarantine in England is set to rise from Â£3,200 to Â£10,000.  The fine for a single offence will remain at Â£1,000.However in the case of someone committing a second offence it would rise to Â£2,000, or Â£4,000 for a third offence.For a fourth or subsequent offence, the fine would be Â£10,000.

Thanks for joining us. Today's updates have been written by Penny Spiller, Ashitha Nagesh, Alex Therrien and Lauren Turner. The editors have been Mal Siret and Martha Buckley. There have been quite a few developments in the UK today. So here's a round-up to bring you up to speed as we prepare to close our live coverage shortly.  It's evening here in the UK, where our team of reporters has been bringing you the latest coronavirus news. A lot has happened today. To summarise, here are the main global headlines. Officials could place Paris under a new lockdown as early as Monday, French Health Minister Olivier Veran told reporters today. The capital and surrounding suburbs already appear to have breached the thresholds for being placed on maximum virus alert, he said, adding that if this was confirmed they would ""have no choice"" but to do so. ""That would imply that people in Paris and suburbs would have to drastically limit their social interactions,"" he said. ""No more family gatherings, no more evenings out, and a total closure of bars."" So far in France, only Marseille and the Caribbean territory of Guadeloupe have been placed on maximum alert. We reported earlier that SNP MP Margaret Ferrier had travelled on the train to London and back with Covid symptoms, and later tested positive for the virus. Now, SNP Westminster group leader Ian Blackford tweets that he's suspended the whip. ""I have spoken with@MargaretFerrier,externalthis evening who fully accepts that what she did was wrong,"" he writes. ""Margaret will be referring herself to the parliamentary standards commissioner as well as the police. I am tonight suspending the whip from Margaret."" Others have been reacting to the news, too. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted: ""Margaret, all the issues surrounding transmission of Covid-19, how infectious it is, how much pain and suffering it has caused to so many. ""You are an elected Member of Parliament making laws to protect citizens from Covid, it wasn't one mistake but multiple ones. So disappointing."" You can read our full story on this here. Does it matter if you wear your face covering wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. If it's not kept clean, your mask will be contaminated and will not work as well. It may put you more at risk of catching Covid-19. In the video below, BBC journalist Laura Foster explains the correct way to wear your homemade mask or face covering. This video can not be played Separately in Scotland, those arriving from the Azores and Madeira will no longer need to quarantine due to the low number of cases there. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""Although we are lifting quarantine restrictions on those travelling from the Azores or Madeira, in line with the public health data we have received, people should think long and hard before choosing to travel abroad, particularly during the forthcoming October break. ""At present all foreign travel carries a risk. Quarantine requirements could be imposed on those arriving on holiday abroad, just as we may make the decision to impose the same in Scotland. âPeople should think very hard before committing to non-essential foreign travel."" One Warrington dad has spoken about his frustration over the new tightening of restrictions. Contract commercial manager Colm Buteux said: ""So as a family of four, we cannot see our parents, or our friends as a family group. ""But I'm allowed on my own to go to the pub with five others from different households? ""My children are facing another six months of not being able to see our closest friends even though that is the only family we mix with."" ""I do get why the government is doing this but they should let people have access to a support bubble,"" he told the BBC. ""Everywhere I go I see people disobeying the rules - they need to be sorted out.Why should I suffer and they donât? ""The kids have been at home for four months. Now they can go to school and do sports. Iâm pleased they can do that. ""I donât care if they close every pub, I want my children to go to school and do exercise. Trying to keep everything together is stressful.â Schools will be made to offer pupils at home the same lessons remotely as those they're teaching in person. The government, which is using powers under the Coronavirus Act, says it's formalising pupils' right to remote learning. Ministers also insist that schools will only close as a last resort. Instead, where areas are high, schools may switch to a rota system of two weeks on and two weeks off. But teachers' unions say it's a ""grave error"" to reach for legal powers when schools are already preparing for all eventualities, and that ministers should focus on ""support not sanction"". ""By reaching for legal powers, the government risks sending an unequivocal message to the profession and parents that they do not trust school leaders to act in the interests of young people in this country,"" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT head teachers' union, says. The owners of a bar in Bolton say they feel the hospitality sector has been blamed for a rise in coronavirus cases. Rebecca Brayshaw, who runs Little Bolton Town Hall bar and events space, said it had been shut for the past three weeks. But with Bolton now set to fall into line with the rest of Greater Manchester, the bar can reopen from Saturday. ""Our plight, our voice has been heard,"" she says. She and husband Chris are now waiting to hear the finer details of whether customers will have to be from a single household, or if the rule of six will apply. The regulations have been ""devastating in a lot of ways, financially and emotionally"" she tells he BBC. ""It's exhausting to wake up every day and wonder what, if any, part of your business will survive. ""We want people to be safe. That's the key everyone is striving for. The issue potentially is if hospitality is being blamed, which it very much feels like it has been recently, that ongoing negative effect continues."" That means people don't go out as much and are fearful, ""through no fault of our own"", despite the bar's Covid security measures, adds Mrs Brayshaw, adding: ""We need people to come and visit us."" Mr Brayshaw said today's news was a step in the right direction - but that it is part of a bigger battle.

the Dutch position on masks. Faced with one of the most rapidly spreading infection rates in
Europe, last night Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, under pressure from
parliament and the public, issued ""urgent and immediate advice"" for people to
wear face masks in indoor spaces. It's been an awkward but unavoidable U-turn for Mr Rutte, who
initially stood out as one of the world's most mask-sceptic leaders. While neighbouring countries locked down and brought in
wide-reaching restrictions and compulsory mask-wearing in public places, Mr
Rutte said he was ""not a dictator"" and congratulated the Dutch for being
capable of following social distancing rules without being ""treated like
children"". Six months since the start of the pandemic, the Dutch are breaking
their own records for the daily number of new cases, while neighbouring nations
are easing their rules. From what I witnessed in The Hague today, there are still more
people exercising their right not to mask up than taking responsibility to do
what the widely accepted science suggests could help to protect themselves and
others. Students should be allowed to leave university and study online if they want to, according to unions representing academics and students. The National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union are calling for the government to take urgent action. It comes after university campuses have been hit by outbreaks of the virus, with many students in self isolation. Larissa Kennedy, NUS president, said students had been left ""trapped in halls"" and were struggling to access food and wellbeing resources. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said students will be allowed to be with their families at Christmas if they choose to. But the education unions are calling for a move to online learning wherever possible - and they say students should be given a safe way to leave campus now if they want to. Students should not face any financial detriment for giving up accommodation, or choosing to defer or leave university, they say. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on the government to provide a ""support package"" to those university students currently self-isolating. He said: ""There should have been serious consideration to delay going back. There certainly should have been some thought as to testing."" Read more here. Krakow Old Town in Poland Grant Shapps, announcing the new quarantine rules, also took the opportunity to remind people of the rules. ""You MUST self-isolate if you enter the UK from a non-exempt country - from tomorrow, weâre increasing the penalties for people who refuse to do so to a maximum of Â£10,000 for repeat offenders,"" he wrote on Twitter. Those fines apply to England, rather than the whole of the UK. He added a message saying: ""REMINDER: If you do travel, you must complete a Passenger Locator Form before returning to the UK. Do your bit to help keep everyone safe."" Mr Shapps added that data from Poland showed that positive tests had nearly doubled - increasing from 3.9% to 5.8% - and there had been ""a rapid increase in weekly cases"" there. Read all the latest on the new rules here. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent The maximum fine for repeatedly breaching the travel quarantine in England is set to rise from Â£3,200 to Â£10,000.  The fine for a single offence will remain at Â£1,000.However in the case of someone committing a second offence it would rise to Â£2,000, or Â£4,000 for a third offence.For a fourth or subsequent offence, the fine would be Â£10,000.

"Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston said the government needed to ""understand local knowledge and expertise"" A ban on households mixing anywhere indoors in Hartlepool and Middlesbrough is ""unacceptable"", a mayor has said. It follows Health Secretary Matt Hancock's announcement of stricter rules inparts of the north of Englandto combat a rise in Covid-19 cases. Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston said the rules would ""damage mental health"" and ""we defy the government and we do not accept the measures"". Be he said he ""won't condone"" anyone disobeying the new regulations. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached for a comment. Thenew restrictionsmean that from one minute past midnight on Saturday households can no longer mix in homes and gardens and indoor settings such as pubs and restaurants. Mr Hancock said the measures, affecting 250,000 people in Hartlepool and Middlesbrough, would bring both towns in line withother parts of the North East. Earlier this week, Mr Preston had put in a request to the government for a ban on household mixing, but without a change to the current ""rule of six"" for meeting others outside of homes in Covid-secure venues such as cafes, restaurants and pubs. The new rules will affect about 250,000 people in Hartlepool and Middlesbrough Following the announcement, the elected independent mayor said: ""I think this measure has been introduced based on... a monstrous lack of communication and ignorance. ""They will destroy viable jobs and damage mental health. ""The government needs to understand our local knowledge and expertise and ability to get things done and preserve jobs and wellbeing."" He said the town had some ""astonishingly well-run"" cafes and restaurants which were capable of hosting people, socially distanced. ""That being denied is a monstrous barrier to returning to normality and protecting mental health and our culture and our society,"" he said. He added: ""Of course I won't disobey the law and absolutely won't condone anyone else disobeying it, but as things stand today with this announcement, I'm saying to the government 'no, it's not acceptable, it's not good enough, come and talk to us'."" What are the new rules? Live updates on new North East restrictions  Simon Clarke, Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, described the measures in a tweet as ""very regrettable"", but added: ""We are where we are and must now focus on obeying the rules, bringing the infection rate down and getting back to normal as quickly as possible."" Mike Hill, Labour MP for Hartlepool, said it was an ""absolutely disgraceful one size fits all"" approach that was made ""without consulting local MPs and leaders"". Hartlepool council leader Shane Moore accused the government of reneging on assurances that enhanced restrictions would not be introduced until the authority had confirmed in writing it was happy with what was being proposed. The Hartlepool Independent Union councillor said the new rules would have a ""devastating impact"" on local businesses. However, Labour MP for Middlesbrough Andy McDonald, described the move as ""inevitable"". He said: ""It's only 13 miles from Middlesbrough to Sedgefield in County Durham and the virus is clearly in circulation right across the region at levels that are concerning, and the virus pays no heed to the local authority borders between County Durham and the Tees Valley local authority areas."" The new measures come into force one minute past midnight on Saturday In Middlesbrough, Toni Cook, owner of the Sticky Fingers Cafe and Rock bar, said the new rules would hit trade. ""We are not going to see the year out,"" she said. ""I understand there's a virus and I understand it's rampant but we all need to act and conform to certain ways, but a lot of us are and we are bending over backwards to do this but we are still punished."" Tim Cave, who was enjoying a drink on his day off from work, added: ""If you've got no symptoms, does it matter if you're sat with a mate who you haven't seen for so long? ""It's just going to affect people's mental wellbeing, people need that someone they don't see every day to be able to go and sound off at."" Andrew Quinn, a student at Teesside University, said: ""I've been looking forward to coming here for a year or so and then we can't even meet up with other households in our accommodation building either, so we can't see our families or our friends in the building."" Fellow fresher Amy Hardy added: ""I've got friends in other halls of residences and even though we all go to university together and we're in the same lectures, we see each other every day, we're not allowed to pop to the bar for a drink, pop to the pub for a pint, it's madness really."" The Reverend Gemma Sampson, the curate of two churches in Hartlepool, expressed concerns about the effects of the restrictions. ""One of my congregation said to me 'I'd rather die of coronavirus than loneliness',"" she said. ""And I feel like both those things are an equal threat and the risk of loneliness is so great in the worst possible way."" The boss of Middlesbrough FC said the public should fully appreciate the seriousness of coronavirus, havingrecently recovered from it. Neil Warnock, 71, said: ""It's life and death with this horrible virus."" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the government is ""lurching from one ridiculous proposition to another"" Proposals to process asylum seekers in disused ferries are ""inhuman"", Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said. He accused the government of ""lurching from one ridiculous proposition to the next"". According to Refugee Action, 35,566 asylum applications were made in 2019 down from a peak of 84,000 in 2002. Top Home Office civil servant Matthew Rycroft said ""everything is on the table"" when it comes to ""improving"" the UK's asylum system. And Downing Street said it was looking at what other countries do ""to inform a plan for the UK"". But the Labour leader fiercely criticised the plan, telling reporters: ""This isn't creative thinking... these suggestions are inhuman and the government shouldn't be pursuing them. Patel considered asylum centre on Atlantic island Fleeing the Syrian war for Belfast What happens to migrants who reach the UK? Asylum seekers criticise military camp housing ""Everybody knows that the biggest problem with asylum seekers' claims is that it takes a long time for the Home Office to process them, that's the problem, it's been there for years. ""Get your house in order, get that sorted out instead of lurching from one ridiculous proposition to another."" He called for better international cooperation, adding: ""There is of course an issue with people trying to get to the United Kingdom, but people are fleeing often from persecution."" Home Secretary Priti Patelasked officials to look at policies, including housing people who are seeking asylum offshore. On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported the Foreign Office hadcarried out an assessment for Ascension Island, a remote UK territory in the Atlantic Ocean  - which included the practicalities of transferring migrants thousands of miles - and decided not to proceed. Nowthe Times has reported that the government is giving ""serious consideration"",externalto the idea of buying retired ferries and converting them into processing centres, but it says the Home Office rejected a proposal to use decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea. The newspaper also says processing migrants on an island off the coast of Scotland had been considered, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted,externalthat ""any proposal to treat human beings like cattle in a holding pen will be met with the strongest possible opposition from me"". Appearing before the Public Affairs Committee, Home Office Permanent Secretary Mr Rycroft said he would not comment on leaks to newspapers, but that the department was ""brainstorming"" ideas. He said: ""No decisions have been taken.  No final proposals have been put to ministers."" Mr Rycroft said the UK would ""always comply with all of our international obligations"" and civil servants would ""assess all of the various different possible ideas out there to see which are legal and which make operational senseâ¦ so that ministers can ultimately make decisions"". How does the government tempt fewer people to attempt a perilous crossing of the Channel to reach the south coast? Well, one idea is to make it clear that even a successful crossing won't mean getting to stay in the UK - at least in the short term. The government is exploring ""all sorts of options"" - not my words, but those of the most senior civil servant in the Home Office. Hence the recent headlines about transferring asylum seekers to a lump of British rock in the middle of the South Atlantic - Ascension Island, or buying an old ferry to house them. But remember, although the numbers coming over the Channel in boatsare at a record high, they are still a small proportion of overall asylum seekers coming to the UK. And rows about asylum are far from new. Twenty years ago, it was the then-Home Secretary, Jack Straw,found himself in a row with his own party,externalabout what the Labour government should do about the issue. So this is an historic problem for parties of both colours. The SNP's home affairs spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, said the leaked plans showed ""the callousness at the core"" of the government, and the plans would ""treat vulnerable asylum seekers as cattle rather than human beings"". But Conservative MP for Gravesham in Kent, Adam Holloway, said the Home Office was ""completely right"" to be looking at other options that were ""some sort of deterrent"" for asylum seekers. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to break the link in people's minds that if you get to Britain you're going to stay in Britain, you're going to stay in a hotel and you're going to be accommodated."" He added that the UK needed to find a ""civilised version"" of the model used by Australia, which hascontroversially used offshore processing and detention centres for asylum seekerssince the 1980s. The discussion comes as record numbers of people are crossingthe Channel to the UK, with 400 arriving in one day in September. Ascension Island is more than 4,000 miles (6,000km) from the UK Nearly7,000 people have reached the UKin more than 500 small boats this year - by 23 September, 1,892 migrants had arrived during the month, more than in all of 2019. But they are still a small proportion of the asylum seekers coming to the UK. To be eligible for asylum in the UK, applicants must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation. A caseworker decides if they have a valid claim by taking into account factors such as the country of origin of the asylum seeker or evidence of discrimination. This is supposed to be done in six months but delays in processing claims have increased significantly in the last year. While waiting for a decision to be made, asylum seekers are usually not allowed to work and are initially placed in hostel-type accommodation before longer-term housing is arranged.

"There are currently different rules across local areas of England The government is to push ahead with a new ""three-tier"" approach to coronavirus restrictions in local areas of England, the BBC understands. The Department of Health confirmed last month the system was being considered - but it has now been signed off by government officials and politicians. An announcement is expected next week, with the roll-out of the new tiers expected in mid-October. The Department of Health said there were ""no imminent changes"" expected. A spokesman for No 10 added: ""We keep all of the measures which we put in place under review - if there is anything further to set out then we will do so to the House"". According to amemo seen by the BBC,external, public health officials will receive precise proposals later on Thursday. The government's aim is to replace the patchwork of existing Covid-19 restrictions across the country. Northern England Covid rules on households tighten Growth in Covid cases may be slowing New rules at-a-glance: More face coverings and fines Areas that fall into tier one will have fewer than 100 cases per 100,000 of population and will need to adhere to national restrictions - such as the ""rule of six"" and social distancing. Tier two would kick in where cases are above 100 per 100,000. Restrictions for these areas would be similar to those currently in place in large parts of northern England, such as bans on household meetings. And tier three areas would have significantly higher rates and would face full lockdowns - excluding schools and essential businesses, like supermarkets, as well as places of worship. The memo seen by the BBC shows plans for additional money for local authorities placed into tiers two or three. Local authorities would get Â£1 per head of population if placed into tier two and Â£2 per head for tier three. When all areas are ""mapped"" onto the new system, it is not believed any areas will be moved to level three at this stage. The BBC understands some within Public Health England are concerned at the speed of the transition. But there is also an acknowledgement the new system could ""simplify and rationalise the current set up"".

"Executive ministers confirmed that a circuit breaker lockdown across Northern Ireland is not being considered yet Pubs, cafes, restaurants and hotels in the Derry and Strabane council area are to be placed under new restrictions to try and curb the spread of Covid-19. They will only be able to open for takeaway, delivery and outdoor dining, First Minister Arlene Foster said. It is part of a series of measures due to come into force next week, which will last for at least a fortnight. But Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill urged residents to comply immediately with the new rules. Meanwhile, Londonderry's Altnagelvin Hospital has suspended some services to manage Covid-19 patients. The Western Trust says elective orthopaedic inpatient services have been suspended and it has implemented its surge plan and re-designated the ward to cope with the expected surge. The Trust says the decision will be kept under review. It has also warned that it is facing increased staff pressures, as rising levels of Covid-19 in the community mean more and more staff are being asked to self-isolate. In a statement, the trust's Director of Acute Services, Geraldine McKay, said red flag cancer and emergency surgery were continuing, alongside some face-to-face and virtual outpatient clinics. On Thursday afternoon, the executive agreed to impose the measures on hospitality businesses in Derry and Strabane because it has one of the highest Covid-19 rates in the UK. Where residents can, work from home Avoid unnecessary travel within the council area and to and from it Where journeys are necessary, advice is to walk, cycle or use private transport Hotels will only be allowed to provide service to overnight guests No spectators can attend sporting events All museums, galleries and cultural attractions in the council area are to remain closed No organised indoor gatherings in community halls Libraries can only operate a ""call and collect"" service Indoor sports limited to individual training only, no exercise classes permitted Schools and other educational settings will stay open. Church services will continue, and weddings and funerals will still be permitted, in line with current executive guidance. Mrs Foster said it was ""by no means"" a return to lockdown for the area, but she told a Stormont press briefing she recognised the news would come as a ""hammer-blow"" for businesses. She said ministers had commenced work on how financial support measures could be drawn up. Ms O'Neill said she recognised many people would be ""sad and worried"", but added that the executive would try to provide as much clarity as possible. ""This is about everyone doing their bit to keep everybody safe - just because you don't have symptoms doesn't mean you're not spreading the virus,"" she said. Foyle MP and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood urged people to abide by the new restrictions, but said it was ""a two-way street"". ""Government cannot restrict trading opportunities in the north west without additional support for businesses that will close and workers forced to be at home,"" he said. He added that he would seek a support package for those affected. On Thursday, the Department of Health announced a further 259 cases of Covid-19, down from 424 on Wednesday. Two further Covid-related deaths were confirmed, bringing the Department of Health's total to 581. The Department of Health mostly records fatalities in a hospital setting. Northern Ireland is currently recording an average of 250 new cases a day and the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital is doubling every 13 days. In the Republic of Ireland, 442 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed on Thursday with four more deaths, bringing the overall death toll to 1,806. A so-called two week ""circuit breaker"" lockdown is not being considered yet, but on Wednesday Health Minister Robin Swann said it could be brought in around the Halloween break at the end of this month, if not earlier. Asked why the executive did not opt to introduce the move across Northern Ireland now, Mrs Foster said they did not believe it was appropriate yet. The Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said it was ""crucial we don't introduce measures if they're not necessary"". Mrs Foster also said returning to a wider lockdown would require significant financial support for businesses. ""We are very much aware if you are asking people to stay at home, not go to work and keep children at home there are huge financial burdens from that,"" she added. While Ms O'Neill said there were ""natural breaks"" with the half-term holidays coming up, and it made sense to align that with potential NI-wide lockdowns. ""If we were going to move forward with this concept it would be much better if it was done across the two islands together,"" she added. ""We haven't discussed this at length in the executive yet... but if we were to get to the point we were moving in that direction, we need to give people advance notice and understanding so we get that buy-in."" The first and deputy first ministers also warned that tougher penalties were on the way for those who breach the Covid-19 regulations. Mrs Foster said the Justice Minister Naomi Long was carrying out a ""rapid review"" of fines, and Ms O'Neill said the executive had ""concerns around compliance"" that it hopes to address in the coming days. Restrictions on pub opening times have been put in place On Thursday, the Department of Health announced that travellers from Turkey and Poland will soon have to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival into Northern Ireland. The measure will take effect from 04:00 BST on Saturday and also includes travellers arriving in NI from the regions of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba. Meanwhile, from Thursday pubs and restaurants must close their doors at 23:00 BSTunder new rules designed to help stem the spread of the virus. It means no food or alcohol can be served after 22:30 BST and all customers must be off the premises 30 minutes after that. The rules also apply to hotel bars, weddings and other social events, with no late licences permitted. No more than six people from two households may sit at the same indoor or outdoor table at a pub or restaurant here, and live music and dancing are banned. The only exception is a couple's first dance at a wedding.

"This video can not be played An attempt was made on Thursday to move the whales out to sea Boats are being used to herd whales from a Scottish loch into the open sea ahead of a huge military exercise in the region. Experts have been monitoring the northern bottlenose whales in Gare Loch in Argyll for the last month. An operation began at 10:30 on Thursday to move the whales from the sea loch over fears sonar used by warships could distress the animals. There are also concerns that one of the whales is looking ""skinny"". Europe's largest military exercise - Joint Warrior - begins on Saturday and its headquarters will be at Faslane, the naval base next to Gare Loch. The operation to move the mammals is being led by the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR). It said five whales have been spotted in the Loch Long area and some have entered some of the smaller lochs nearby. ""It is very unusual for them to be in coastal waters,"" said a charity spokesman. ""However, we have had similar incidents in recent years where animals of the same species have entered lochs, including Loch Long, that have subsequently left of their own accord without intervention, and presumably have succeeded in returning to their proper habitat. ""We recently became aware that a significant military exercise is due to begin next week, and as whales are particularly sensitive to underwater sound, have been concerned about the effect it may have on the animals."" It added that attempting to move them ""of course does come with risks of its own and there is no guarantee it will be successful given the depth of water and distance that needs to be covered, so will be undertaken with as much care as possible. ""We will of course reassess our actions and options if the whales decide that they will not go."" Gavin Lemon, a volunteer with the charity, said the animals would be herded from Gare Loch using a number of boats in formation. He said it was important to move the animals while they were healthy and in good condition. ""We've been monitoring them - they are feeding on local fish,"" he said. ""They usually like squid and the like, diving up to 1,000m (3,000ft). ""Gare Loch is about 25m (80ft) deep. So they've not been having their normal diet, but it has been sustaining them. ""However, one of them looks skinny which is not a good sign with a whale."" Jamie Munro has been photographing the whales while they have been in the area between the naval base and the top of the loch. He told BBC Scotland: ""At first we thought it a real novelty with the three of them tail slapping and breaching. We thought they were fishing."" But he said concern grew and whale watchers have expressed concern that the animals were in distress. ""I've been watching them now from our house for six days and every morning I go out early hoping not to see them and that they have made it out, but sure enough they pop up and so it goes."" Warships, aircraft, marines and troops from the UK, Nato and allied forces will take part in the military exercise, which is due to run until 15 October. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ""The Royal Navy takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously and continues to work with the relevant UK authorities to ensure all practical measures required to reduce environmental risk and comply with legislation are taken. ""A necessary series of safety checks is observed and an environmental risk assessment is carried out before any underwater task is undertaken by MoD, to minimise any potential risk to marine life."" He added that members of the armed forces who are involved in the Exercise Joint Warrior training in the area will be made aware of the presence of the whales and the latest sightings. ""All participants are aware that environmental protection remains a priority for the exercise and we are prepared to amend the programme if these whales remain in an atypical situation,"" he added.

"Travellers arriving in the UK from Poland, Turkey and three Caribbean islands will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 on Saturday. Poland's infection rate has risen, while the UK government said it removed Turkey over concerns about the way the country reports its data. There will also be tougher fines for those who fail to self-isolate - up to a maximum of Â£10,000 in England. One airport group says it is a ""further blow"" to a ""struggling"" sector. The UK reported a further 6,914 coronavirus cases and 59 deaths on Thursday, and stricter measures have been announced to control a spikein areas of northern England. Announcing the changes to the quarantine list, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said data from Poland showed that ""test positivity has nearly doubled increasing from 3.9% to 5.8% alongside a rapid increase in weekly cases"". Poland is reporting 25.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people, up from 15.6. Arrivals from the Caribbean islands of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba will also have to quarantine from Saturday, he added. Those islands reported 142.4 new cases per 100,000, unchanged from 142.4 the previous week. Which countries are on the UK's quarantine list? Sun, sea and sanitiser: What your holiday will be like Quarantine breakers: 'It was selfish but I've no regrets' Poland and Turkey added to Scots quarantine list Meanwhile, the Scottish Government announced that those arriving from the Portuguese islands of the Azores and Madeira will no longer need to quarantine in Scotland ""due to the low number of cases"". The Azores and Madeira were already on the ""exempt"" list for the rest of the UK. The Scottish government's statement added that it was ""clear that case numbers in Turkey have been under-reported"". Turkey's reported infection rate has dropped to 12.9 cases per 100,000, down from 14.2 in the week prior. It has also been announced that in England, fines for the first offence of failing to self-isolate when required will start at Â£1,000, before increasing to Â£2,000, then Â£4,000 up to a maximum of Â£10,000. The upper limit for repeat offences was previously Â£3,200. The increase in fines will come into force from Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Since the introduction of the travel quarantine regime in the summer, police officers have investigated more than 4,000 alleged breaches of the rules. More than 200 people were found to be ignoring the quarantine requirement, but escaped a fine because they listened to the officer on their doorstep. Overall there were just 38 penalties for breaching holiday quarantine. If you look at the official data coming out of Turkey then it sits comfortably below the UK's benchmark for applying the quarantine of 20 cases for every 100,000 people. But revelations that the number of cases in Turkey has been under-reported has put the country onto the ""red"" list. Turkey and Poland are key destinations for airlines and airports so it's another blow for the travel sector. The Department for Transport is still looking at whether testing can be used at airports to reduce the quarantine period from 14 to seven days. It is almost impossible for the police to enforce quarantine rules so it is hoped heavier fines for repeat offenders will mean fewer people will break the rules. The Manchester Airports Group, which owns and operates Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports, said Poland and Turkey's removal from the travel safe list ""means that a large proportion of the markets our passengers usually travel to are now effectively closed-off, despite many of them having much lower infection rates than the UK"". The announcement ""is a further blow to the already struggling aviation sector"", a statement said. The group said it was ""vital"" for the government to establish a testing regime ""which would allow for a safe reduction in quarantine periods for passengers arriving from abroad"". Tim Alderslade, from Airlines UK, the trade body for UK registered airlines, said a testing regime was ""the only way we can reopen international travel"". ""Without testing aviation cannot recover and we will miss the opportunity to get the economy moving again,"" he said. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) also said it was a ""massive blow for the travel industry"". ""This coupled with popular winter-sun destinations, like the Canary Islands - still on the quarantine list - only piles the pressure on a struggling sector,"" the travel industry trade body said. ""Many travel businesses are in precarious position and will find it difficult to survive unless the government acts now with tailored support to assist the travel industry."" Concert pianist Tomasz Lis has cancelled a performance in Poland on Sunday because of the rules Tomasz Lis, who lives in London after moving to the UK from Poland 23 years ago, runs a travel company offering tailored trips to his home country. He says the new rule will cost him thousands of pounds. The 43-year-old said: ""It's been an impossible year already and the government would do much better by checking temperatures at the airports, for instance, and test people who may have it rather than introduce those absurd rules."" Mr Lis is also a concert pianist and has cancelled a performance in Poland on Sunday because of the rules - meaning he will lose Â£3,000 and the cost of his flights.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the government is ""lurching from one ridiculous proposition to another"" Proposals to process asylum seekers in disused ferries are ""inhuman"", Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said. He accused the government of ""lurching from one ridiculous proposition to the next"". According to Refugee Action, 35,566 asylum applications were made in 2019 down from a peak of 84,000 in 2002. Top Home Office civil servant Matthew Rycroft said ""everything is on the table"" when it comes to ""improving"" the UK's asylum system. And Downing Street said it was looking at what other countries do ""to inform a plan for the UK"". But the Labour leader fiercely criticised the plan, telling reporters: ""This isn't creative thinking... these suggestions are inhuman and the government shouldn't be pursuing them. Patel considered asylum centre on Atlantic island Fleeing the Syrian war for Belfast What happens to migrants who reach the UK? Asylum seekers criticise military camp housing ""Everybody knows that the biggest problem with asylum seekers' claims is that it takes a long time for the Home Office to process them, that's the problem, it's been there for years. ""Get your house in order, get that sorted out instead of lurching from one ridiculous proposition to another."" He called for better international cooperation, adding: ""There is of course an issue with people trying to get to the United Kingdom, but people are fleeing often from persecution."" Home Secretary Priti Patelasked officials to look at policies, including housing people who are seeking asylum offshore. On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported the Foreign Office hadcarried out an assessment for Ascension Island, a remote UK territory in the Atlantic Ocean  - which included the practicalities of transferring migrants thousands of miles - and decided not to proceed. Nowthe Times has reported that the government is giving ""serious consideration"",externalto the idea of buying retired ferries and converting them into processing centres, but it says the Home Office rejected a proposal to use decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea. The newspaper also says processing migrants on an island off the coast of Scotland had been considered, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted,externalthat ""any proposal to treat human beings like cattle in a holding pen will be met with the strongest possible opposition from me"". Appearing before the Public Affairs Committee, Home Office Permanent Secretary Mr Rycroft said he would not comment on leaks to newspapers, but that the department was ""brainstorming"" ideas. He said: ""No decisions have been taken.  No final proposals have been put to ministers."" Mr Rycroft said the UK would ""always comply with all of our international obligations"" and civil servants would ""assess all of the various different possible ideas out there to see which are legal and which make operational senseâ¦ so that ministers can ultimately make decisions"". How does the government tempt fewer people to attempt a perilous crossing of the Channel to reach the south coast? Well, one idea is to make it clear that even a successful crossing won't mean getting to stay in the UK - at least in the short term. The government is exploring ""all sorts of options"" - not my words, but those of the most senior civil servant in the Home Office. Hence the recent headlines about transferring asylum seekers to a lump of British rock in the middle of the South Atlantic - Ascension Island, or buying an old ferry to house them. But remember, although the numbers coming over the Channel in boatsare at a record high, they are still a small proportion of overall asylum seekers coming to the UK. And rows about asylum are far from new. Twenty years ago, it was the then-Home Secretary, Jack Straw,found himself in a row with his own party,externalabout what the Labour government should do about the issue. So this is an historic problem for parties of both colours. The SNP's home affairs spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, said the leaked plans showed ""the callousness at the core"" of the government, and the plans would ""treat vulnerable asylum seekers as cattle rather than human beings"". But Conservative MP for Gravesham in Kent, Adam Holloway, said the Home Office was ""completely right"" to be looking at other options that were ""some sort of deterrent"" for asylum seekers. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to break the link in people's minds that if you get to Britain you're going to stay in Britain, you're going to stay in a hotel and you're going to be accommodated."" He added that the UK needed to find a ""civilised version"" of the model used by Australia, which hascontroversially used offshore processing and detention centres for asylum seekerssince the 1980s. The discussion comes as record numbers of people are crossingthe Channel to the UK, with 400 arriving in one day in September. Ascension Island is more than 4,000 miles (6,000km) from the UK Nearly7,000 people have reached the UKin more than 500 small boats this year - by 23 September, 1,892 migrants had arrived during the month, more than in all of 2019. But they are still a small proportion of the asylum seekers coming to the UK. To be eligible for asylum in the UK, applicants must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation. A caseworker decides if they have a valid claim by taking into account factors such as the country of origin of the asylum seeker or evidence of discrimination. This is supposed to be done in six months but delays in processing claims have increased significantly in the last year. While waiting for a decision to be made, asylum seekers are usually not allowed to work and are initially placed in hostel-type accommodation before longer-term housing is arranged.

"Executive ministers confirmed that a circuit breaker lockdown across Northern Ireland is not being considered yet Pubs, cafes, restaurants and hotels in the Derry and Strabane council area are to be placed under new restrictions to try and curb the spread of Covid-19. They will only be able to open for takeaway, delivery and outdoor dining, First Minister Arlene Foster said. It is part of a series of measures due to come into force next week, which will last for at least a fortnight. But Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill urged residents to comply immediately with the new rules. Meanwhile, Londonderry's Altnagelvin Hospital has suspended some services to manage Covid-19 patients. The Western Trust says elective orthopaedic inpatient services have been suspended and it has implemented its surge plan and re-designated the ward to cope with the expected surge. The Trust says the decision will be kept under review. It has also warned that it is facing increased staff pressures, as rising levels of Covid-19 in the community mean more and more staff are being asked to self-isolate. In a statement, the trust's Director of Acute Services, Geraldine McKay, said red flag cancer and emergency surgery were continuing, alongside some face-to-face and virtual outpatient clinics. On Thursday afternoon, the executive agreed to impose the measures on hospitality businesses in Derry and Strabane because it has one of the highest Covid-19 rates in the UK. Where residents can, work from home Avoid unnecessary travel within the council area and to and from it Where journeys are necessary, advice is to walk, cycle or use private transport Hotels will only be allowed to provide service to overnight guests No spectators can attend sporting events All museums, galleries and cultural attractions in the council area are to remain closed No organised indoor gatherings in community halls Libraries can only operate a ""call and collect"" service Indoor sports limited to individual training only, no exercise classes permitted Schools and other educational settings will stay open. Church services will continue, and weddings and funerals will still be permitted, in line with current executive guidance. Mrs Foster said it was ""by no means"" a return to lockdown for the area, but she told a Stormont press briefing she recognised the news would come as a ""hammer-blow"" for businesses. She said ministers had commenced work on how financial support measures could be drawn up. Ms O'Neill said she recognised many people would be ""sad and worried"", but added that the executive would try to provide as much clarity as possible. ""This is about everyone doing their bit to keep everybody safe - just because you don't have symptoms doesn't mean you're not spreading the virus,"" she said. Foyle MP and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood urged people to abide by the new restrictions, but said it was ""a two-way street"". ""Government cannot restrict trading opportunities in the north west without additional support for businesses that will close and workers forced to be at home,"" he said. He added that he would seek a support package for those affected. On Thursday, the Department of Health announced a further 259 cases of Covid-19, down from 424 on Wednesday. Two further Covid-related deaths were confirmed, bringing the Department of Health's total to 581. The Department of Health mostly records fatalities in a hospital setting. Northern Ireland is currently recording an average of 250 new cases a day and the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital is doubling every 13 days. In the Republic of Ireland, 442 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed on Thursday with four more deaths, bringing the overall death toll to 1,806. A so-called two week ""circuit breaker"" lockdown is not being considered yet, but on Wednesday Health Minister Robin Swann said it could be brought in around the Halloween break at the end of this month, if not earlier. Asked why the executive did not opt to introduce the move across Northern Ireland now, Mrs Foster said they did not believe it was appropriate yet. The Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said it was ""crucial we don't introduce measures if they're not necessary"". Mrs Foster also said returning to a wider lockdown would require significant financial support for businesses. ""We are very much aware if you are asking people to stay at home, not go to work and keep children at home there are huge financial burdens from that,"" she added. While Ms O'Neill said there were ""natural breaks"" with the half-term holidays coming up, and it made sense to align that with potential NI-wide lockdowns. ""If we were going to move forward with this concept it would be much better if it was done across the two islands together,"" she added. ""We haven't discussed this at length in the executive yet... but if we were to get to the point we were moving in that direction, we need to give people advance notice and understanding so we get that buy-in."" The first and deputy first ministers also warned that tougher penalties were on the way for those who breach the Covid-19 regulations. Mrs Foster said the Justice Minister Naomi Long was carrying out a ""rapid review"" of fines, and Ms O'Neill said the executive had ""concerns around compliance"" that it hopes to address in the coming days. Restrictions on pub opening times have been put in place On Thursday, the Department of Health announced that travellers from Turkey and Poland will soon have to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival into Northern Ireland. The measure will take effect from 04:00 BST on Saturday and also includes travellers arriving in NI from the regions of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba. Meanwhile, from Thursday pubs and restaurants must close their doors at 23:00 BSTunder new rules designed to help stem the spread of the virus. It means no food or alcohol can be served after 22:30 BST and all customers must be off the premises 30 minutes after that. The rules also apply to hotel bars, weddings and other social events, with no late licences permitted. No more than six people from two households may sit at the same indoor or outdoor table at a pub or restaurant here, and live music and dancing are banned. The only exception is a couple's first dance at a wedding.

"This video can not be played EC president Ursula von der Leyen said the bill breached the UK's previous commitments. The EU has begun legal proceedings against the UK after it refused to ditch plans to override sections of its Brexit divorce deal. An EU deadline for the government to remove sections of the Internal Market Bill expired on Wednesday. The ""letter of formal notice"" could eventually lead to a court case against the UK at the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court. But the EU has not walked away from talks over a post-Brexit trade deal. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the UK would have until the end of November to respond to the EU's concerns over the draft legislation. UK-EU trade talks are continuing in Brussels this week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said both sides should ""move on"" if a deal was not reached by mid-October. Government's Brexit plan gets MPs' final backing EU ultimatum to UK over Brexit talks What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? In a brief statement, Mrs von der Leyen said the bill was a ""full contradiction"" of previous UK commitments over how a hard border on the island of Ireland should be avoided. She added that the bill was by its ""very nature a breach of the obligation of good faith"" contained in the withdrawal agreement that took the UK out of the EU in January. A spokesperson for the UK government said the bill was a necessary ""safety net"" to protect trade between different parts of the UK. They added the government would respond the EU's letter ""in due course"". Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte appeared to play down the importance of the Commission's letter, calling the move ""more administrative than political"". Analysis by Nick Beake, BBC Brussels Correspondent Although the headline is dramatic, this was the EU's next logical step. When it fired the UK an ultimatum to scrap the most controversial parts of the Internal Market Bill by the end of September, it knew it would likely have to follow up on its threat. And now it has. But any legal path is long and unpredictable - with no resolution likely to come before the UK's transition period ends on 31 December. The legal advice given to the EU member states has been that for any alleged breach of the withdrawal agreement committed in 2020, they would have a further four years to pursue the UK. For any alleged breach committed after the transition period, the EU could use the dispute settlement mechanism (which both sides agreed to in the agreement) to penalise and fine the UK. Or, it could ask the European Court of Justice to do the same. But this is drawn out legal territory. It seems the latest legal development will not torpedo the ongoing trade talks - for now. Both sides insist they do want a deal within the coming weeks, but the EU says it won't sign one off, as long as the UK's bill remains as it is. The EU and the UK are now trying to walk two tightropes. And it's precarious balancing act. One route leads to a trade deal, the other to an ugly court battle. But both sides are looking dead ahead, and neither want to blink first. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for both the UK and EU to work together over trade differences, adding: ""A deal can be done here"". ""It's absurd that with weeks to go, the focus and the energy is not on their negotiations, it's on threatened court proceedings,"" he added. MPsgave their final backingto the Internal Market Bill earlier this week. However, it will have to be approved by the House of Lords before it becomes law. In a bid to head off a potential rebellion from Tory backbenchers, ministers have granted the Commons a say before powers to override the Brexit divorce deal could be used. Boris Johnson reached a deal with Tory MPs to amend the bill earlier this month. The letter sent to the UK is the first stage in the process the Commission uses against countries it believes have broken EU law. It can end with the Commission taking governments to court at the European Court of Justice. The ECJ continues to have powers over the UK during the transition period, including over the interpretation and implementation of the withdrawal agreement. The court has powers to force countries to comply with its rulings, including imposing financial penalties. However, most cases are settled before then - and it can take many years for a case to move through the court. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses. The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail.

"Executive ministers confirmed that a circuit breaker lockdown across Northern Ireland is not being considered yet Pubs, cafes, restaurants and hotels in the Derry and Strabane council area are to be placed under new restrictions to try and curb the spread of Covid-19. They will only be able to open for takeaway, delivery and outdoor dining, First Minister Arlene Foster said. It is part of a series of measures due to come into force next week, which will last for at least a fortnight. But Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill urged residents to comply immediately with the new rules. Meanwhile, Londonderry's Altnagelvin Hospital has suspended some services to manage Covid-19 patients. The Western Trust says elective orthopaedic inpatient services have been suspended and it has implemented its surge plan and re-designated the ward to cope with the expected surge. The Trust says the decision will be kept under review. It has also warned that it is facing increased staff pressures, as rising levels of Covid-19 in the community mean more and more staff are being asked to self-isolate. In a statement, the trust's Director of Acute Services, Geraldine McKay, said red flag cancer and emergency surgery were continuing, alongside some face-to-face and virtual outpatient clinics. On Thursday afternoon, the executive agreed to impose the measures on hospitality businesses in Derry and Strabane because it has one of the highest Covid-19 rates in the UK. Where residents can, work from home Avoid unnecessary travel within the council area and to and from it Where journeys are necessary, advice is to walk, cycle or use private transport Hotels will only be allowed to provide service to overnight guests No spectators can attend sporting events All museums, galleries and cultural attractions in the council area are to remain closed No organised indoor gatherings in community halls Libraries can only operate a ""call and collect"" service Indoor sports limited to individual training only, no exercise classes permitted Schools and other educational settings will stay open. Church services will continue, and weddings and funerals will still be permitted, in line with current executive guidance. Mrs Foster said it was ""by no means"" a return to lockdown for the area, but she told a Stormont press briefing she recognised the news would come as a ""hammer-blow"" for businesses. She said ministers had commenced work on how financial support measures could be drawn up. Ms O'Neill said she recognised many people would be ""sad and worried"", but added that the executive would try to provide as much clarity as possible. ""This is about everyone doing their bit to keep everybody safe - just because you don't have symptoms doesn't mean you're not spreading the virus,"" she said. Foyle MP and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood urged people to abide by the new restrictions, but said it was ""a two-way street"". ""Government cannot restrict trading opportunities in the north west without additional support for businesses that will close and workers forced to be at home,"" he said. He added that he would seek a support package for those affected. On Thursday, the Department of Health announced a further 259 cases of Covid-19, down from 424 on Wednesday. Two further Covid-related deaths were confirmed, bringing the Department of Health's total to 581. The Department of Health mostly records fatalities in a hospital setting. Northern Ireland is currently recording an average of 250 new cases a day and the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital is doubling every 13 days. In the Republic of Ireland, 442 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed on Thursday with four more deaths, bringing the overall death toll to 1,806. A so-called two week ""circuit breaker"" lockdown is not being considered yet, but on Wednesday Health Minister Robin Swann said it could be brought in around the Halloween break at the end of this month, if not earlier. Asked why the executive did not opt to introduce the move across Northern Ireland now, Mrs Foster said they did not believe it was appropriate yet. The Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said it was ""crucial we don't introduce measures if they're not necessary"". Mrs Foster also said returning to a wider lockdown would require significant financial support for businesses. ""We are very much aware if you are asking people to stay at home, not go to work and keep children at home there are huge financial burdens from that,"" she added. While Ms O'Neill said there were ""natural breaks"" with the half-term holidays coming up, and it made sense to align that with potential NI-wide lockdowns. ""If we were going to move forward with this concept it would be much better if it was done across the two islands together,"" she added. ""We haven't discussed this at length in the executive yet... but if we were to get to the point we were moving in that direction, we need to give people advance notice and understanding so we get that buy-in."" The first and deputy first ministers also warned that tougher penalties were on the way for those who breach the Covid-19 regulations. Mrs Foster said the Justice Minister Naomi Long was carrying out a ""rapid review"" of fines, and Ms O'Neill said the executive had ""concerns around compliance"" that it hopes to address in the coming days. Restrictions on pub opening times have been put in place On Thursday, the Department of Health announced that travellers from Turkey and Poland will soon have to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival into Northern Ireland. The measure will take effect from 04:00 BST on Saturday and also includes travellers arriving in NI from the regions of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba. Meanwhile, from Thursday pubs and restaurants must close their doors at 23:00 BSTunder new rules designed to help stem the spread of the virus. It means no food or alcohol can be served after 22:30 BST and all customers must be off the premises 30 minutes after that. The rules also apply to hotel bars, weddings and other social events, with no late licences permitted. No more than six people from two households may sit at the same indoor or outdoor table at a pub or restaurant here, and live music and dancing are banned. The only exception is a couple's first dance at a wedding.

"This video can not be played Dame Jenni closes her last programme with Helen Reddy Dame Jenni Murray ended her final episode of Woman's Hour with Helen Reddy's feminist anthem, I Am Woman. The Australian singer died this week aged 78. The outgoing presenter said it was ""very strange"" to be hosting the BBC Radio 4 show for the last time, as she prepared to leave after 33 years. She added she was ""much cheered"" by receiving the gift of a farewell chocolate cake from celebrity chef and fellow broadcaster, Mary Berry. I Am Woman singer Helen Reddy dies aged 78 Dame Jenni Murray to leave Woman's Hour Dame Jenni, 70, is the 74-year-old programme's longest-serving presenter. She announced in July that it was ""time to move on"". One of her final guests on Thursday, MP Harriet Harman, praised her ""tremendous legacy"". Dame Jenni was given a farewell cake, courtesy of Mary Berry Her finale celebrated the success of the show, which ""offers female perspectives on the world"", including how it had helped in ""changing the conversation"" about domestic violence and marital rape. It also looked back at some of her most memorable interviews, with figures as varied as US actress Bette Davis, former UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher, and her favourite singer Joan Baez - ""the peak of my career"", Dame Jenni said. Opening her final time in the hot-seat, she declared: ""Good morning and welcome to Woman's Hour. ""And yes, it does feel very strange to be saying that for the last time after 33 years!"" Paying tribute in a special radio package, the programme's former editor and producer Sally Feldman said the celebrated interviewer ""almost hypnotised people into replying to her"". ""The experience of being interviewed by Jenni is quite something else, because you get her warm voice and penetrating gaze,"" she said. ""She just didn't have any fear at all about asking people things and they always found themselves replying."" Novelist and poet Jackie Kay saluted Dame Jenni for ""holding up a mirror to the real world and everything that's been going on in it."" She signed off by thanking all of the listeners, who she described as ""a vital part of the Woman's Hour family"". She also thanked ""the three men in my family - David, Ed and Charlie"", who she added had ""given endless support"", before playing Reddy's ode to female empowerment to finish. Departing Woman's Hour presenters Jenni Murray (left) and Jane Garvey, in 2016 Dame Jenni received her damehood in 2011, in recognition of her Sony Award-winning broadcasting contributions. During a three decade-career on the show, the departing Woman's Hour host also interviewed fellow Dame, Judi Dench, and Saoirse Ronan; as well as Margaret Atwood and Kate McCann. In 2006, she announced on-air that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. On her return to work the following year, Dame Jenni spoke about her hair loss and the importance of hair in defining femininity. Mohit Bakaya, controller of Radio 4, praised her for tackling ""important issues"" and having ""difficult conversations about the experiences of women"". ""I want to thank her for her wonderful commitment to Woman's Hour, to Radio 4 in general, and for the passion she has shown for the topics explored during her time on the programme,"" said Bakaya, around the news of her departure this summer. The corporation's outgoing director general, Tony Hall, added that ""the radio airwaves won't be the same without her"". This video can not be played The broadcaster thanked her 5 Live audience for making the show 'such a wonderful place' Earlier this month, it was announced that Emma Barnett will be the new presenter of Woman's Hour.

"Blackbaud's software is used by non-profit organisations to help obtain donations Bank account information and users' passwords are among details feared stolen by hackers in a security breach at a service used to raise donations from millions of people. Many UK universities and charities, as well as hundreds of other organisations worldwide, use the software involved. Its developer Blackbaudmade the admission in a regulatory filing,external. The firm previously said the theft had been limitedto other personal data - but not payment details. It added it was contacting affected clients. They, in turn, will need to send follow-up alerts to at least some of the donors they had already contacted about the incident. ""We have informed the small subset of Blackbaud customers who were part of this development,"" the company told the BBC. ""We apologise that this happened and will continue to do our very best to supply help and support as we and our customers jointly navigate this cyber-crime incident."" The BBC has learned that some of the organisations believed to have been impacted by the latest development include: the University of Birmingham the National Trust ""We are aware that some financial data may have been accessed as a result of the data breach and are working with Blackbaud to determine if this affects us,"" said a spokesman for the National Trust. The National Trust is a charity that looks after places of historic interest and natural beauty Millions of people worldwide have been warned they could have been affected in the original alerts sent out about the attack over recent months. A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC: ""Our investigation is ongoing and we will be making further enquiries regarding the latest developments."" The ICO said it knew of 166 UK organisations that had been affected by the security breach. They include dozens of universities as well as health-related charities, schools and trusts set up to care for historic buildings. International clients who were affected also included hospitals, human rights organisations, non-profit radio stations and food banks. South Carolina-based Blackbaud said the new findings did not apply to all clients affected by the hack, but acknowledged that, in some cases, the payment information involved had not been digitally scrambled, as might have been expected. ""Further forensic investigation found that for some of the notified customers, the cyber-criminal may have accessed some unencrypted fields intended for bank account information, social security numbers, user names and/or passwords,"" its filing said. Dozens of universities have sent emails and other alerts to current students and alumni about the attack ""In most cases, fields intended for sensitive information were encrypted and not accessible."" An updated security notice on the firm's site addedthat the firm did not believe credit card details had been exposed,external. One cyber-security expert said it was essential that affected donors be told as soon as possible. ""It's simply not acceptable to store financial data, and passwords, in an unencrypted form,"" said Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey. ""This latest revelation means that whereas their customers relied upon their initial statements to reassure people that banking information was not affected, that has now to be potentially reversed."" The hack occurred in May and was first disclosed to the public in July. At the time, Blackbaud said it had paid the attackers a ransom and believed the thieves had subsequently destroyed the stolen data. Paying a ransom in such circumstances is not illegal, but goes against the advice of numerous law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, NCA and Europol. A banking security news site reported last week that Blackbaudfaces at least 10 lawsuits in the US over the matter,external.

"Helen Hancock and Martin Griffiths were found by police on New Year's Day A man has been jailed for life for murdering his wife and her new partner on New Year's Day. Derby Crown Court heard Helen Hancock, 39, and Martin Griffiths, 48, suffered 103 injuries when they were stabbed at her home in Duffield, Derbyshire. A paramedic said it was the ""most violent incident he had ever seen"", the court was told. Rhys Hancock, who admitted both murders when found at the scene, was jailed for a minimum of 31 years. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The court heard how 40-year-old Hancock, of Etwall, called 999 himself at 04:26 to report his double murder, saying: ""I have just stabbed them... there is blood everywhere"". Judge Nirmal Shant described it as a ""brutal attack"" which had ""deprived two families of the people they loved"". The prosecution described how, after coming back from the pub, Hancock had told his mother he ""felt like he wanted to kill"" the pair. He told her he knew he would be sentenced to 25 to 30 years for what he was about to do but still shared a cup of tea with her before leaving. He took her emergency buzzer and landline phones so she could not call the police and then drove to Ms Hancock's house with two knives from his mother's kitchen. The court was told Hancock had found out about his wife's new relationship on 26 December Once there he entered through the backdoor and attacked the pair in the bedroom. He stabbed mother-of-three Ms Hancock 66 times and father-of-two Mr Griffiths 37 times. The court heard how one paramedic described the scene as a ""blood bath"". Helen Hancock and Martin Griffiths were found at her and Mr Hancock's former marital home in New Zealand Lane, Duffield Officers, alerted by his mother after she found her mobile phone, found him outside the property covered in blood. He told them: ""I'm hardly going to deny it - look at me."" Prosecutor Michael Auty QC said: ""There is no escaping these murders were premeditated, they were savage, the attack was merciless, there were elements of sadism and the intention was always... and only to kill. ""Perhaps, above all else, they were committed in the coldest of blood."" But Judge Shant concluded she ""could not be sure"" this was ""sadistic or sexual"" and would not be handing out a whole life term, although she accepted it was a ""borderline"" case. She added: ""No sentence I impose will seem adequate to [the victims' families] and nothing I do can fill the undoubted void that the deaths of Helen Hancock and Martin Griffiths have left."" Ms Hancock, who had been using her maiden name Almey, worked as a PE teacher at Fountains High School in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire. In a statement read to the court her family described her as a ""beautiful, vibrant and outgoing person who loved and lived life to the full"". Her sister added Mr Hancock's actions had left their children without either a mother or a father. Mr Griffiths' family said his death was ""like losing a precious piece of a jigsaw and so never being able to see the full picture again"". Helen Hancock and Martin Griffiths climbed Mount Snowdon together a few days before they both died The case was referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) due to contact between Derbyshire Police and Ms Hancock in the period leading up to the murders. An IOPC spokesperson said: ""We are close to finalising our investigation and we will consider releasing our findings when all associated proceedings, including coronial, have been concluded."" They previously told the BBC the police contact related to ""a number of domestic incidents over a period of time"".

"Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston said the government needed to ""understand local knowledge and expertise"" A ban on households mixing anywhere indoors in Hartlepool and Middlesbrough is ""unacceptable"", a mayor has said. It follows Health Secretary Matt Hancock's announcement of stricter rules inparts of the north of Englandto combat a rise in Covid-19 cases. Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston said the rules would ""damage mental health"" and ""we defy the government and we do not accept the measures"". Be he said he ""won't condone"" anyone disobeying the new regulations. The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached for a comment. Thenew restrictionsmean that from one minute past midnight on Saturday households can no longer mix in homes and gardens and indoor settings such as pubs and restaurants. Mr Hancock said the measures, affecting 250,000 people in Hartlepool and Middlesbrough, would bring both towns in line withother parts of the North East. Earlier this week, Mr Preston had put in a request to the government for a ban on household mixing, but without a change to the current ""rule of six"" for meeting others outside of homes in Covid-secure venues such as cafes, restaurants and pubs. The new rules will affect about 250,000 people in Hartlepool and Middlesbrough Following the announcement, the elected independent mayor said: ""I think this measure has been introduced based on... a monstrous lack of communication and ignorance. ""They will destroy viable jobs and damage mental health. ""The government needs to understand our local knowledge and expertise and ability to get things done and preserve jobs and wellbeing."" He said the town had some ""astonishingly well-run"" cafes and restaurants which were capable of hosting people, socially distanced. ""That being denied is a monstrous barrier to returning to normality and protecting mental health and our culture and our society,"" he said. He added: ""Of course I won't disobey the law and absolutely won't condone anyone else disobeying it, but as things stand today with this announcement, I'm saying to the government 'no, it's not acceptable, it's not good enough, come and talk to us'."" What are the new rules? Live updates on new North East restrictions  Simon Clarke, Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, described the measures in a tweet as ""very regrettable"", but added: ""We are where we are and must now focus on obeying the rules, bringing the infection rate down and getting back to normal as quickly as possible."" Mike Hill, Labour MP for Hartlepool, said it was an ""absolutely disgraceful one size fits all"" approach that was made ""without consulting local MPs and leaders"". Hartlepool council leader Shane Moore accused the government of reneging on assurances that enhanced restrictions would not be introduced until the authority had confirmed in writing it was happy with what was being proposed. The Hartlepool Independent Union councillor said the new rules would have a ""devastating impact"" on local businesses. However, Labour MP for Middlesbrough Andy McDonald, described the move as ""inevitable"". He said: ""It's only 13 miles from Middlesbrough to Sedgefield in County Durham and the virus is clearly in circulation right across the region at levels that are concerning, and the virus pays no heed to the local authority borders between County Durham and the Tees Valley local authority areas."" The new measures come into force one minute past midnight on Saturday In Middlesbrough, Toni Cook, owner of the Sticky Fingers Cafe and Rock bar, said the new rules would hit trade. ""We are not going to see the year out,"" she said. ""I understand there's a virus and I understand it's rampant but we all need to act and conform to certain ways, but a lot of us are and we are bending over backwards to do this but we are still punished."" Tim Cave, who was enjoying a drink on his day off from work, added: ""If you've got no symptoms, does it matter if you're sat with a mate who you haven't seen for so long? ""It's just going to affect people's mental wellbeing, people need that someone they don't see every day to be able to go and sound off at."" Andrew Quinn, a student at Teesside University, said: ""I've been looking forward to coming here for a year or so and then we can't even meet up with other households in our accommodation building either, so we can't see our families or our friends in the building."" Fellow fresher Amy Hardy added: ""I've got friends in other halls of residences and even though we all go to university together and we're in the same lectures, we see each other every day, we're not allowed to pop to the bar for a drink, pop to the pub for a pint, it's madness really."" The Reverend Gemma Sampson, the curate of two churches in Hartlepool, expressed concerns about the effects of the restrictions. ""One of my congregation said to me 'I'd rather die of coronavirus than loneliness',"" she said. ""And I feel like both those things are an equal threat and the risk of loneliness is so great in the worst possible way."" The boss of Middlesbrough FC said the public should fully appreciate the seriousness of coronavirus, havingrecently recovered from it.

She added she was ""much cheered"" by receiving the gift of a farewell chocolate cake from celebrity chef and fellow broadcaster, Mary Berry. I Am Woman singer Helen Reddy dies aged 78 Dame Jenni Murray to leave Woman's Hour Dame Jenni, 70, is the 74-year-old programme's longest-serving presenter. She announced in July that it was ""time to move on"". One of her final guests on Thursday, MP Harriet Harman, praised her ""tremendous legacy"". Dame Jenni was given a farewell cake, courtesy of Mary Berry Her finale celebrated the success of the show, which ""offers female perspectives on the world"", including how it had helped in ""changing the conversation"" about domestic violence and marital rape. It also looked back at some of her most memorable interviews, with figures as varied as US actress Bette Davis, former UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher, and her favourite singer Joan Baez - ""the peak of my career"", Dame Jenni said. Opening her final time in the hot-seat, she declared: ""Good morning and welcome to Woman's Hour. ""And yes, it does feel very strange to be saying that for the last time after 33 years!"" Paying tribute in a special radio package, the programme's former editor and producer Sally Feldman said the celebrated interviewer ""almost hypnotised people into replying to her"". ""The experience of being interviewed by Jenni is quite something else, because you get her warm voice and penetrating gaze,"" she said. ""She just didn't have any fear at all about asking people things and they always found themselves replying."" Novelist and poet Jackie Kay saluted Dame Jenni for ""holding up a mirror to the real world and everything that's been going on in it."" She signed off by thanking all of the listeners, who she described as ""a vital part of the Woman's Hour family"". She also thanked ""the three men in my family - David, Ed and Charlie"", who she added had ""given endless support"", before playing Reddy's ode to female empowerment to finish. Departing Woman's Hour presenters Jenni Murray (left) and Jane Garvey, in 2016 Dame Jenni received her damehood in 2011, in recognition of her Sony Award-winning broadcasting contributions. During a three decade-career on the show, the departing Woman's Hour host also interviewed fellow Dame, Judi Dench, and Saoirse Ronan; as well as Margaret Atwood and Kate McCann. In 2006, she announced on-air that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. On her return to work the following year, Dame Jenni spoke about her hair loss and the importance of hair in defining femininity. Mohit Bakaya, controller of Radio 4, praised her for tackling ""important issues"" and having ""difficult conversations about the experiences of women"". ""I want to thank her for her wonderful commitment to Woman's Hour, to Radio 4 in general, and for the passion she has shown for the topics explored during her time on the programme,"" said Bakaya, around the news of her departure this summer. The corporation's outgoing director general, Tony Hall, added that ""the radio airwaves won't be the same without her"". This video can not be played The broadcaster thanked her 5 Live audience for making the show 'such a wonderful place' Earlier this month, it was announced that Emma Barnett will be the new presenter of Woman's Hour. The 5 Live and Newsnight presenter will fill the shoes of Dame Jenni, and her co-host Jane Garvey - who has also decided to step down from the end of the year. Emma Barnett to present Radio 4's Woman's Hour Jane Garvey to leave Woman's Hour Unlike the current arrangement, where Garvey and Dame Jenni share presenting duties, Barnett will be the main host from Monday to Thursday each week. An additional presenter will be appointed to host the Friday and Saturday editions in due course. Barnett is already associated with the Radio 4 programme, presenting its late-night spin-off and regularly chairing the Woman's Hour Power List.

"The BBC revealed how criminal gangs had set up fake companies to claim loans. The government was warned in May that its flagship loan scheme to help small firms affected by Covid was at ""very high risk of fraud"" from ""organised crime"", it has emerged. The state-owned British Business Bank (BBB) which supervises the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, twice raised concerns. A BBC report revealed that criminals were setting up fake firms to get loans worth tens of thousands of pounds. The Bounce Back Loan Scheme has already paid out more than Â£38bn. In early May, just two days before the scheme launched, the chief executive of the BBB, Keith Morgan, wrote of the ""very significant fraud and credit risks"", adding that it was ""vulnerable to abuse by individuals and organised crime"". The bank, he said in a letter to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, could not guarantee ""robust controls"". Other concerns included an ""extensive reliance on customer self-certification"" and ""potential for market distortion"". He said that the BBB had commissioned a review of the scheme by accountants PwC, which had classified its fraud risk as ""very high"". In his letter, dated 2 May and which followed a email warning the day before, Mr Morgan also raised concerns that the quick introduction of the scheme had ""created huge operational challenges"". However, Mr Sharma said the scheme should go ahead despite the risks, because of what he called the ""unprecedented situation facing the country"". 'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan' Arrest over Â£110k Covid small business loan fraud UK banks get 100,000 loan applications on first day Bounce Back Loans are 100% government-backed loans of up to Â£50,000, and were introduced to mitigate the huge pressure on small businesses after the economy went into coronavirus lockdown. They do not have to be paid off for six years, and are interest-free for the first 12 months. According to latest Treasury figures,external, there have been 1.55 million applications, with 1.26 million approvals and Â£38.02b paid out. At the weekend, the BBC's Angus Crawford revealed how fraudsters were targeting the loan system. One bogus company, Tellings Home Made Furniture, ""borrowed"" Â£50,000 by stealing the personal details of a man called Mark Telling. This video can not be played Watch the moment Mark Telling finds out he's been a victim of fraud The revelations come after the head of the National Audit Officetold the Guardian,externalBounce Back Loans were the ""riskiest"" of all the bailout measures. But a government spokesman told the BBC the loan scheme had been vital for many businesses and that fraudsters would be pursued. He said: ""Our loan schemes have provided a lifeline to thousands of businesses across the UK - helping them survive the outbreak and protecting millions of jobs. ""Our support has been targeted to ensure we help those who need it most as quickly as possible and we won't apologise for this."" He said the government worked with agencies to minimise fraud, ""with lenders implementing a range of protections including anti-money laundering and customer checks, as well as transaction monitoring controls. Any fraudulent applications can be criminally prosecuted for which penalties include imprisonment or a fine or both"".

"This video can not be played An attempt was made on Thursday to move the whales out to sea Boats are being used to herd whales from a Scottish loch into the open sea ahead of a huge military exercise in the region. Experts have been monitoring the northern bottlenose whales in Gare Loch in Argyll for the last month. An operation began at 10:30 on Thursday to move the whales from the sea loch over fears sonar used by warships could distress the animals. There are also concerns that one of the whales is looking ""skinny"". Europe's largest military exercise - Joint Warrior - begins on Saturday and its headquarters will be at Faslane, the naval base next to Gare Loch. The operation to move the mammals is being led by the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR). It said five whales have been spotted in the Loch Long area and some have entered some of the smaller lochs nearby. ""It is very unusual for them to be in coastal waters,"" said a charity spokesman. ""However, we have had similar incidents in recent years where animals of the same species have entered lochs, including Loch Long, that have subsequently left of their own accord without intervention, and presumably have succeeded in returning to their proper habitat. ""We recently became aware that a significant military exercise is due to begin next week, and as whales are particularly sensitive to underwater sound, have been concerned about the effect it may have on the animals."" It added that attempting to move them ""of course does come with risks of its own and there is no guarantee it will be successful given the depth of water and distance that needs to be covered, so will be undertaken with as much care as possible. ""We will of course reassess our actions and options if the whales decide that they will not go."" Gavin Lemon, a volunteer with the charity, said the animals would be herded from Gare Loch using a number of boats in formation. He said it was important to move the animals while they were healthy and in good condition. ""We've been monitoring them - they are feeding on local fish,"" he said. ""They usually like squid and the like, diving up to 1,000m (3,000ft). ""Gare Loch is about 25m (80ft) deep. So they've not been having their normal diet, but it has been sustaining them. ""However, one of them looks skinny which is not a good sign with a whale."" Jamie Munro has been photographing the whales while they have been in the area between the naval base and the top of the loch. He told BBC Scotland: ""At first we thought it a real novelty with the three of them tail slapping and breaching. We thought they were fishing."" But he said concern grew and whale watchers have expressed concern that the animals were in distress. ""I've been watching them now from our house for six days and every morning I go out early hoping not to see them and that they have made it out, but sure enough they pop up and so it goes."" Warships, aircraft, marines and troops from the UK, Nato and allied forces will take part in the military exercise, which is due to run until 15 October. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ""The Royal Navy takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously and continues to work with the relevant UK authorities to ensure all practical measures required to reduce environmental risk and comply with legislation are taken. ""A necessary series of safety checks is observed and an environmental risk assessment is carried out before any underwater task is undertaken by MoD, to minimise any potential risk to marine life."" He added that members of the armed forces who are involved in the Exercise Joint Warrior training in the area will be made aware of the presence of the whales and the latest sightings. ""All participants are aware that environmental protection remains a priority for the exercise and we are prepared to amend the programme if these whales remain in an atypical situation,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Covid: Lockdown a 'huge worry' for business owners Businesses across north Wales say they fear local lockdowns could lead to job losses or even closures. New restrictions came into force for Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham on Thursday evening. It means those living in these areas cannot leave or enter without a ""reasonable excuse"" such as work or education. Businesses reliant on tourists said they were facing confusion over the rules and financial uncertainty. The restrictions - the same as those seen in most of south Wales - mean another 500,000 people are now living under tougher restrictions than at the start of September. Jim Jones of North Wales Tourism questioned whether visitors into north Wales were responsible for the spread - saying he had not seen any evidence they were. ""Business are extremely and understandably frustrated, it's another dark day,""he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""They have invested so much time and gone to extraordinary measures to be Covid-compliant and make everybody safe and then all of a sudden they've got to cancel bookings and tell visitors to go home."" Mr Jones called for outbreaks to be ""micro-managed"" by contact tracers - with local lockdowns covering much smaller areas. ""Our businesses are yet again about to be decimated. The lockdowns in north Wales at this moment in time are an overreaction... a knee-jerk reaction. ""To decimate the entire tourism and hospitality industry for cases that are still relatively low in the scale of things... Our economy is tourism."" What can I do in local lockdown? Tackling Covid is 'down to all of us' 'Leisure travel from lockdown areas must stop' Conwy council leader Sam Rowlands said he was ""disappointed and frustrated"" the Welsh Government did not take measures to protect tourism which would lose out again. Among those braced for another hit is the SeaQuarium in Rhyl which relies on day trippers and visitors from outside Denbighshire for as much as 90% of its business. ""It's a real struggle,"" said director Colette Macdonald. ""We were hoping we had a lifeline when we were able to reopen but we're 40% down on last year and my fear is that we will lose the October school half-term as well. ""It's also very difficult for attractions with animals. We can't just pull down the shutters and come back six months later. ""We have constant bills such as vets, heating and food for the animals. Our electricity bill alone is Â£5,500 every month - and we are almost entirely reliant upon visitors for revenue. Animal venues face costs to look after animals, whether they are open or not ""We'll have to reduce staff hours and possibly make redundancies if the lockdown continues. It's tough and very deflating. ""Zoos and aquariums in England get special help but in Wales we are regarded as part of the hospitality sector. We need more help from the Welsh Government."" The Welsh Government said: ""Earlier this year we wrote to zoos in Wales with details of existing schemes which they may be eligible for funding, as well as issuing a questionnaire to identify key animal welfare concerns and whether any funding gaps exist."" Businesses have also complained the difference between rules in Wales and England over travel for holidays has caused ""mass confusion"". First Minister Mark Drakeford has called for Boris Johnson toban people in locked-down parts of England from travelling to Waleson holiday.

""The differences in the rules are very confusing,"" said Venessa Warrington, 44. ""People are ringing and at times we don't know what to tell them. We're just going along with the advice given by Visit Wales."" The family-run campsite, like so many businesses in the tourism sector, is facing an uncertain future. ""My heart sank when we heard the latest lockdown announcement,"" said Mrs Warrington. ""It has been a very difficult year. I worked out to the penny how long we could go before we would have to sell the family business. ""We've extended the season longer than usual to make up for lost months but our financial problems will only get worse if we're forced to close again."" Founder of the Zipworld attractions Shaun Taylor has put 100 staff on furlough from Thursday evening and said: ""It's challenging. It's emotionally challenging, it's financially challenging."" National Trust sites in lockdown areas, such as Erddig in Wrexham county, will remain open to local residents only The National Trust said lockdown offered local residents a chance to enjoy its sites across the region, such as Bodnant Gardens, Erddig and Chirk Castle, without bustling crowds. However visitors must still book in advance. ""Over the past few months it's become clear just how much we all need fresh air and open space, so we're keeping our places open for local residents to get closer to nature and watch the season unfold,"" a spokeswoman said.

"Liverpool's infection rate has risen 13 fold in a month Further restrictions are expected to be announced for Merseyside later after a spike in coronavirus cases. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said rules could be ""even stricter"" than in the North East as there were ""serious concerns"" about managing the virus. He said financial support needed to follow any new restrictions. Liverpool's weekly infection rate rose to 258 per 100,000 on 28 September. Knowsley has the second highest rate in the country at 262 in the same week. St Helens had 212 per 100,000 and Halton had 206, while Burnley in Lancashire has the highest rate at 327 per 100,000. Restrictions on households mixing,with a ban on people meeting in homes and gardens and pubs being told to shut early, were brought in across Merseyside earlier in September. During that time, Liverpool's infection rate has risen 13 fold. Mr Anderson said he thought this was due to an increase of people moving around the city, with schools and students returning and people going back to work. He said: ""There are more people in the city we didn't have before and they are now moving freely around the city...spreading human contact is spreading the disease and virus which is what it thrives on."" Possible new measures for Merseyside could include restricting pubs to only serving alcohol with food or making pubs and restaurants takeaway only. The government is also considering whether people who had already been shielding should start to shield again, Mr Anderson said. People in Merseyside were already advised only to use public transport for ""essential purposes"" He told BBC Breakfast he had discussed the situation with Health Secretary Matt Hancock last night after infection rates were shown to be doubling every six or seven days. If stricter measures are brought in, Mr Anderson said some kind of ""local furlough"" was needed because the area ""relies very heavily"" on the hospitality sector which would be ""hit hard"".

"This video can not be played EC president Ursula von der Leyen said the bill breached the UK's previous commitments. The EU has begun legal proceedings against the UK after it refused to ditch plans to override sections of its Brexit divorce deal. An EU deadline for the government to remove sections of the Internal Market Bill expired on Wednesday. The ""letter of formal notice"" could eventually lead to a court case against the UK at the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court. But the EU has not walked away from talks over a post-Brexit trade deal. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the UK would have until the end of November to respond to the EU's concerns over the draft legislation. UK-EU trade talks are continuing in Brussels this week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said both sides should ""move on"" if a deal was not reached by mid-October. Government's Brexit plan gets MPs' final backing EU ultimatum to UK over Brexit talks What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? In a brief statement, Mrs von der Leyen said the bill was a ""full contradiction"" of previous UK commitments over how a hard border on the island of Ireland should be avoided. She added that the bill was by its ""very nature a breach of the obligation of good faith"" contained in the withdrawal agreement that took the UK out of the EU in January. A spokesperson for the UK government said the bill was a necessary ""safety net"" to protect trade between different parts of the UK. They added the government would respond the EU's letter ""in due course"". Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte appeared to play down the importance of the Commission's letter, calling the move ""more administrative than political"". Analysis by Nick Beake, BBC Brussels Correspondent Although the headline is dramatic, this was the EU's next logical step. When it fired the UK an ultimatum to scrap the most controversial parts of the Internal Market Bill by the end of September, it knew it would likely have to follow up on its threat. And now it has. But any legal path is long and unpredictable - with no resolution likely to come before the UK's transition period ends on 31 December. The legal advice given to the EU member states has been that for any alleged breach of the withdrawal agreement committed in 2020, they would have a further four years to pursue the UK. For any alleged breach committed after the transition period, the EU could use the dispute settlement mechanism (which both sides agreed to in the agreement) to penalise and fine the UK. Or, it could ask the European Court of Justice to do the same. But this is drawn out legal territory. It seems the latest legal development will not torpedo the ongoing trade talks - for now. Both sides insist they do want a deal within the coming weeks, but the EU says it won't sign one off, as long as the UK's bill remains as it is. The EU and the UK are now trying to walk two tightropes. And it's precarious balancing act. One route leads to a trade deal, the other to an ugly court battle. But both sides are looking dead ahead, and neither want to blink first. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for both the UK and EU to work together over trade differences, adding: ""A deal can be done here"". ""It's absurd that with weeks to go, the focus and the energy is not on their negotiations, it's on threatened court proceedings,"" he added. MPsgave their final backingto the Internal Market Bill earlier this week. However, it will have to be approved by the House of Lords before it becomes law. In a bid to head off a potential rebellion from Tory backbenchers, ministers have granted the Commons a say before powers to override the Brexit divorce deal could be used. Boris Johnson reached a deal with Tory MPs to amend the bill earlier this month. The letter sent to the UK is the first stage in the process the Commission uses against countries it believes have broken EU law. It can end with the Commission taking governments to court at the European Court of Justice. The ECJ continues to have powers over the UK during the transition period, including over the interpretation and implementation of the withdrawal agreement. The court has powers to force countries to comply with its rulings, including imposing financial penalties. However, most cases are settled before then - and it can take many years for a case to move through the court. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses. The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail.

"Ministers are considering converting disused ferries moored off the coast to process people seeking asylum in the UK. According to Refugee Action, 35,566 asylum applications were made in the UK in 2019 - down from a peak of 84,000 in 2002. Downing Street said it was looking at what other countries do ""to inform a plan for the UK."" Labour called the proposal to process people on ferries ""unconscionable"". The most senior civil servant at the Home Office, Matthew Rycroft, said ""everything is on the table"" when it comes to ""improving"" the UK's asylum system. Patel considered asylum centre on Atlantic island Fleeing the Syrian war for Belfast What happens to migrants who reach the UK? Asylum seekers criticise military camp housing Home Secretary Priti Patelasked officials to look at policies, including housing people who are seeking asylum offshore. On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported the Foreign Office hadcarried out an assessment for Ascension Island, a remote UK territory in the Atlantic Ocean  - which included the practicalities of transferring migrants thousands of miles - and decided not to proceed. Nowthe Times reports that the government is giving ""serious consideration"",externalto the idea of buying retired ferries and converting them into processing centres, but it says the Home Office rejected a proposal to use decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea. The paper also says processing migrants on an island off the coast of Scotland had been considered, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted,externalthat ""any proposal to treat human beings like cattle in a holding pen will be met with the strongest possible opposition from me"". Appearing before the Public Affairs Committee, Permanent Secretary Mr Rycroft said he would not comment on leaks to newspapers, but that the department was ""brainstorming"" ideas. He said: ""We've been looking at what a whole host of other countries do in order to bring innovation into our own system. ""No decisions have been taken.  No final proposals have been put to ministers... this is in the realm of the brainstorming stage of a future policy."" Mr Rycroft said the UK would ""always comply with all of our international obligations"" and civil servants would ""assess all of the various different possible ideas out there to see which are legal and which make operational senseâ¦ so that ministers can ultimately make decisions"". How does the government tempt fewer people to attempt a perilous crossing of the Channel to reach the south coast? Well, one idea is to make it clear that even a successful crossing won't mean getting to stay in the UK - at least in the short term. The government is exploring ""all sorts of options"" - not my words, but those of the most senior civil servant in the Home Office. Hence the recent headlines about transferring asylum seekers to a lump of British rock in the middle of the South Atlantic - Ascension Island, or buying an old ferry to house them. But remember, although the numbers coming over the Channel in boatsare at a record high, they are still a small proportion of overall asylum seekers coming to the UK. And rows about asylum are far from new. Twenty years ago, it was the then-Home Secretary, Jack Straw,found himself in a row with his own party,externalabout what the Labour government should do about the issue. So this is an historic problem for parties of both colours. Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour would oppose any move to use ferries, adding: ""Even considering this is appalling."" He accused the government of ""lurching from one inhumane and impractical idea to another"" and claimed it had ""lost control and all sense of compassion"". The SNP's home affairs spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, said the leaked plans showed ""the callousness at the core"" of the government, and the plans would ""treat vulnerable asylum seekers as cattle rather than human beings"". But Conservative MP for Gravesham in Kent, Adam Holloway, said the Home Office was ""completely right"" to be looking at other options that were ""some sort of deterrent"" for asylum seekers. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to break the link in people's minds that if you get to Britain you're going to stay in Britain, you're going to stay in a hotel and you're going to be accommodated."" He added that the UK needed to find a ""civilised version"" of the model used by Australia, which hascontroversially used offshore processing and detention centres for asylum seekerssince the 1980s. The discussion comes as record numbers of people are crossingthe Channel to the UK, with 400 arriving in one day in September. Ascension Island is more than 4,000 miles (6,000km) from the UK A Home Office source said this week that ministers were looking at ""every option that can stop small boat crossings and fix the asylum system"", but no final decisions had been made. Nearly7,000 people have reached the UKin more than 500 small boats this year - by 23 September, 1,892 migrants had arrived during the month, more than in all of 2019. But they are still a small proportion of the asylum seekers coming to the UK. Tory MP Natalie Elphicke, who represents Dover, said the government had been ""clear they are going to take whatever action is necessary to put a stop to these small boat crossings"". She told the BBC No 10 and the Home Office were looking at a ""whole range of things"" to address the ""draw factor"" of the UK, ""from cruise ships and ferries through to offshore fast track assessment centres, through to changing the immigration law"". Earlier in the Commons, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told Parliament the government was ""actively looking at the steps that we can take"" to stop illegal crossings in the English Channel so the UK can ""maintain our commitment to providing a safe haven"" but also ""safeguard our borders"". To be eligible for asylum in the UK, applicants must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation. A caseworker decides if they have a valid claim by taking into account factors such as the country of origin of the asylum seeker or evidence of discrimination. This is supposed to be done in six months but delays in processing claims have increased significantly in the last year. While waiting for a decision to be made, asylum seekers are usually not allowed to work and are initially placed in hostel-type accommodation before longer-term housing is arranged.

"Liverpool's infection rate has risen 13 fold in a month Further restrictions are expected to be announced for Merseyside later after a spike in coronavirus cases. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said rules could be ""even stricter"" than in the North East as there were ""serious concerns"" about managing the virus. He said financial support needed to follow any new restrictions. Liverpool's weekly infection rate rose to 258 per 100,000 on 28 September. Knowsley has the second highest rate in the country at 262 in the same week. St Helens had 212 per 100,000 and Halton had 206, while Burnley in Lancashire has the highest rate at 327 per 100,000. Restrictions on households mixing,with a ban on people meeting in homes and gardens and pubs being told to shut early, were brought in across Merseyside earlier in September. During that time, Liverpool's infection rate has risen 13 fold. Mr Anderson said he thought this was due to an increase of people moving around the city, with schools and students returning and people going back to work. He said: ""There are more people in the city we didn't have before and they are now moving freely around the city...spreading human contact is spreading the disease and virus which is what it thrives on."" Possible new measures for Merseyside could include restricting pubs to only serving alcohol with food or making pubs and restaurants takeaway only. The government is also considering whether people who had already been shielding should start to shield again, Mr Anderson said. People in Merseyside were already advised only to use public transport for ""essential purposes"" He told BBC Breakfast he had discussed the situation with Health Secretary Matt Hancock last night after infection rates were shown to be doubling every six or seven days. If stricter measures are brought in, Mr Anderson said some kind of ""local furlough"" was needed because the area ""relies very heavily"" on the hospitality sector which would be ""hit hard"". ""I think we're gong to have to have [stricter measures] in order to arrest and supress the virus but we need that financial support too."" It is nowillegal for two million people in several parts of north-east England to mix in any indoor setting, including pubs and restaurants. Peter Kinsella, who owns Spanish restaurant Lunya in Liverpool said a short term lockdown could be ""catastrophic"" without targeted support. ""Just as we were starting to recover our income will be taken away again. Expenses, costs, don't go away. ""We are a viable business here...we paid Â£8m in taxes over the last ten years.

"This video can not be played An attempt was made on Thursday to move the whales out to sea Boats are being used to herd whales from a Scottish loch into the open sea ahead of a huge military exercise in the region. Experts have been monitoring the northern bottlenose whales in Gare Loch in Argyll for the last month. An operation began at 10:30 on Thursday to move the whales from the sea loch over fears sonar used by warships could distress the animals. There are also concerns that one of the whales is looking ""skinny"". Europe's largest military exercise - Joint Warrior - begins on Saturday and its headquarters will be at Faslane, the naval base next to Gare Loch. The operation to move the mammals is being led by the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR). It said five whales have been spotted in the Loch Long area and some have entered some of the smaller lochs nearby. ""It is very unusual for them to be in coastal waters,"" said a charity spokesman. ""However, we have had similar incidents in recent years where animals of the same species have entered lochs, including Loch Long, that have subsequently left of their own accord without intervention, and presumably have succeeded in returning to their proper habitat. ""We recently became aware that a significant military exercise is due to begin next week, and as whales are particularly sensitive to underwater sound, have been concerned about the effect it may have on the animals."" It added that attempting to move them ""of course does come with risks of its own and there is no guarantee it will be successful given the depth of water and distance that needs to be covered, so will be undertaken with as much care as possible. ""We will of course reassess our actions and options if the whales decide that they will not go."" Gavin Lemon, a volunteer with the charity, said the animals would be herded from Gare Loch using a number of boats in formation. He said it was important to move the animals while they were healthy and in good condition. ""We've been monitoring them - they are feeding on local fish,"" he said. ""They usually like squid and the like, diving up to 1,000m (3,000ft). ""Gare Loch is about 25m (80ft) deep. So they've not been having their normal diet, but it has been sustaining them. ""However, one of them looks skinny which is not a good sign with a whale."" Jamie Munro has been photographing the whales while they have been in the area between the naval base and the top of the loch. He told BBC Scotland: ""At first we thought it a real novelty with the three of them tail slapping and breaching. We thought they were fishing."" But he said concern grew and whale watchers have expressed concern that the animals were in distress. ""I've been watching them now from our house for six days and every morning I go out early hoping not to see them and that they have made it out, but sure enough they pop up and so it goes."" Warships, aircraft, marines and troops from the UK, Nato and allied forces will take part in the military exercise, which is due to run until 15 October. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ""The Royal Navy takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously and continues to work with the relevant UK authorities to ensure all practical measures required to reduce environmental risk and comply with legislation are taken. ""A necessary series of safety checks is observed and an environmental risk assessment is carried out before any underwater task is undertaken by MoD, to minimise any potential risk to marine life."" He added that members of the armed forces who are involved in the Exercise Joint Warrior training in the area will be made aware of the presence of the whales and the latest sightings.

Thanks for joining us. Today's updates have been written by Penny Spiller, Ashitha Nagesh, Alex Therrien and Lauren Turner. The editors have been Mal Siret and Martha Buckley. There have been quite a few developments in the UK today. So here's a round-up to bring you up to speed as we prepare to close our live coverage shortly.  It's evening here in the UK, where our team of reporters has been bringing you the latest coronavirus news. A lot has happened today. To summarise, here are the main global headlines. Officials could place Paris under a new lockdown as early as Monday, French Health Minister Olivier Veran told reporters today. The capital and surrounding suburbs already appear to have breached the thresholds for being placed on maximum virus alert, he said, adding that if this was confirmed they would ""have no choice"" but to do so. ""That would imply that people in Paris and suburbs would have to drastically limit their social interactions,"" he said. ""No more family gatherings, no more evenings out, and a total closure of bars."" So far in France, only Marseille and the Caribbean territory of Guadeloupe have been placed on maximum alert. We reported earlier that SNP MP Margaret Ferrier had travelled on the train to London and back with Covid symptoms, and later tested positive for the virus. Now, SNP Westminster group leader Ian Blackford tweets that he's suspended the whip. ""I have spoken with@MargaretFerrier,externalthis evening who fully accepts that what she did was wrong,"" he writes. ""Margaret will be referring herself to the parliamentary standards commissioner as well as the police. I am tonight suspending the whip from Margaret."" Others have been reacting to the news, too. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted: ""Margaret, all the issues surrounding transmission of Covid-19, how infectious it is, how much pain and suffering it has caused to so many. ""You are an elected Member of Parliament making laws to protect citizens from Covid, it wasn't one mistake but multiple ones. So disappointing."" You can read our full story on this here. Does it matter if you wear your face covering wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. If it's not kept clean, your mask will be contaminated and will not work as well. It may put you more at risk of catching Covid-19. In the video below, BBC journalist Laura Foster explains the correct way to wear your homemade mask or face covering. This video can not be played Separately in Scotland, those arriving from the Azores and Madeira will no longer need to quarantine due to the low number of cases there. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""Although we are lifting quarantine restrictions on those travelling from the Azores or Madeira, in line with the public health data we have received, people should think long and hard before choosing to travel abroad, particularly during the forthcoming October break. ""At present all foreign travel carries a risk. Quarantine requirements could be imposed on those arriving on holiday abroad, just as we may make the decision to impose the same in Scotland. âPeople should think very hard before committing to non-essential foreign travel."" One Warrington dad has spoken about his frustration over the new tightening of restrictions. Contract commercial manager Colm Buteux said: ""So as a family of four, we cannot see our parents, or our friends as a family group. ""But I'm allowed on my own to go to the pub with five others from different households? ""My children are facing another six months of not being able to see our closest friends even though that is the only family we mix with."" ""I do get why the government is doing this but they should let people have access to a support bubble,"" he told the BBC. ""Everywhere I go I see people disobeying the rules - they need to be sorted out.Why should I suffer and they donât? ""The kids have been at home for four months. Now they can go to school and do sports. Iâm pleased they can do that. ""I donât care if they close every pub, I want my children to go to school and do exercise. Trying to keep everything together is stressful.â Schools will be made to offer pupils at home the same lessons remotely as those they're teaching in person. The government, which is using powers under the Coronavirus Act, says it's formalising pupils' right to remote learning. Ministers also insist that schools will only close as a last resort. Instead, where areas are high, schools may switch to a rota system of two weeks on and two weeks off. But teachers' unions say it's a ""grave error"" to reach for legal powers when schools are already preparing for all eventualities, and that ministers should focus on ""support not sanction"". ""By reaching for legal powers, the government risks sending an unequivocal message to the profession and parents that they do not trust school leaders to act in the interests of young people in this country,"" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT head teachers' union, says. The owners of a bar in Bolton say they feel the hospitality sector has been blamed for a rise in coronavirus cases. Rebecca Brayshaw, who runs Little Bolton Town Hall bar and events space, said it had been shut for the past three weeks. But with Bolton now set to fall into line with the rest of Greater Manchester, the bar can reopen from Saturday. ""Our plight, our voice has been heard,"" she says. She and husband Chris are now waiting to hear the finer details of whether customers will have to be from a single household, or if the rule of six will apply. The regulations have been ""devastating in a lot of ways, financially and emotionally"" she tells he BBC. ""It's exhausting to wake up every day and wonder what, if any, part of your business will survive. ""We want people to be safe. That's the key everyone is striving for. The issue potentially is if hospitality is being blamed, which it very much feels like it has been recently, that ongoing negative effect continues."" That means people don't go out as much and are fearful, ""through no fault of our own"", despite the bar's Covid security measures, adds Mrs Brayshaw, adding: ""We need people to come and visit us."" Mr Brayshaw said today's news was a step in the right direction - but that it is part of a bigger battle.   Jumping on a plane and going on holiday looks and feels very different to how it did at the start of 2020. Airports and airlines have both been making changes to the way they work to get passengers flying again - including measures that help reduce the chances of the virus being spread. In this video, BBC journalist Laura Foster goes toSouthend Airport,externalto show you what you need to do if you're thinking of catching a flight. This video can not be played Hundreds of millions of people in China are celebrating the National Day holiday today, marking the founding of the People's Republic of China, with large gatherings and quick getaways. It's estimated that about 550 million people will travel within the country during the eight-day holiday known as ""Golden Week"". It's also thought that 13 million passenger trips were made today - the highest figure since February,according to state media,external. Although coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the country appears to have largely stopped the spread of the virus, and most restrictions have been lifted. Images of China today are worlds apart from a nation that was under lockdown earlier this year. You can see our full gallery here. The Manchester Airports Group said Poland and Turkey's removal from the travel exemptions list ""means that a large proportion of the markets our passengers usually travel to are now effectively closed off, despite many of them having much lower infection rates than the UK"". The announcement ""is a further blow to the already struggling aviation sector"", said the group, which owns and operates Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports. It is ""vital"" for the government to establish a testing regime ""which would allow for a safe reduction in quarantine periods for passengers arriving from abroad"", it added. This week 170 workers at a pork meat processing plant in Cornwall tested positive for Covid-19. Most of those who tested positive were unaware they had Covid-19 and were not displaying symptoms. This is just the latest in a long line of meat processing plants across the world that have experienced outbreaks, including in Germany, France, Spain and the US. So what makes them so vulnerable? ""Factories and, in particular, indoor areas which are cold and damp, are perfect environments for coronavirus to linger and spread,"" according to Lawrence Young, Professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick. Read more about how Covid spreads in meat processing plantshere. SNP MP Margaret Ferrier has apologised for breaching Covid rules by travelling to and from London while she had coronavirus symptoms. Ferrier says her symptoms were ""mild"", and that by the time she took the train to London to attend Parliament she was ""feeling much better"". She later tested positive for the virus. She says she's notified the police. ""Despite feeling well, I should have self-isolated while waiting for my test result, and I deeply regret my actions,"" she says. She tweeted her full statement, below. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But Labour's Ian Murray, the shadow secretary of state for Scotland, tweeted: ""It can't be one rule for Margaret Ferrier, and one rule for everyone else.
""Nicola Sturgeon must condemn her MP's actions and tell the Scottish people what disciplinary action she will be taking."" We've been hearing today about further restrictions being brought in for parts of north-east and north-west England. A bit more information has come through, confirming the measures are being made law in the Liverpool City Region, Halton, Warrington, Hartlepool and Middlesbrough. It means people living there won't be able to mix with those outside their own household, in any indoor setting. Meanwhile, stricter measures in Bolton are being eased, so it will be in line with the rest of Greater Manchester. The move follows pleas from local leaders to allow hospitality venues to open under the same conditions as the rest of the region - like having table service, and closing at 10pm. It also means bowling alleys, indoor skating rinks, casinos, indoor play, including soft play and conference centres and exhibit halls will also be able to reopen in Bolton. And rules on weddings, wedding receptions and funerals will be the same as the rest of the country. All the latest - including the areas now on the government's watchlist - can be foundhere,external. As part of that, Sheffield has been moved from an ""area of concern"" to an ""area of enhanced support"", which means more resources - which could mean more testing - for the city.  Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent ""Shambolic"" is how one journalist in The Hague described
the Dutch position on masks. Faced with one of the most rapidly spreading infection rates in
Europe, last night Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, under pressure from
parliament and the public, issued ""urgent and immediate advice"" for people to
wear face masks in indoor spaces. It's been an awkward but unavoidable U-turn for Mr Rutte, who
initially stood out as one of the world's most mask-sceptic leaders. While neighbouring countries locked down and brought in
wide-reaching restrictions and compulsory mask-wearing in public places, Mr
Rutte said he was ""not a dictator"" and congratulated the Dutch for being
capable of following social distancing rules without being ""treated like
children"". Six months since the start of the pandemic, the Dutch are breaking
their own records for the daily number of new cases, while neighbouring nations
are easing their rules. From what I witnessed in The Hague today, there are still more
people exercising their right not to mask up than taking responsibility to do
what the widely accepted science suggests could help to protect themselves and
others. Students should be allowed to leave university and study online if they want to, according to unions representing academics and students. The National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union are calling for the government to take urgent action. It comes after university campuses have been hit by outbreaks of the virus, with many students in self isolation. Larissa Kennedy, NUS president, said students had been left ""trapped in halls"" and were struggling to access food and wellbeing resources. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said students will be allowed to be with their families at Christmas if they choose to. But the education unions are calling for a move to online learning wherever possible - and they say students should be given a safe way to leave campus now if they want to. Students should not face any financial detriment for giving up accommodation, or choosing to defer or leave university, they say. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on the government to provide a ""support package"" to those university students currently self-isolating. He said: ""There should have been serious consideration to delay going back. There certainly should have been some thought as to testing."" Read more here. Krakow Old Town in Poland Grant Shapps, announcing the new quarantine rules, also took the opportunity to remind people of the rules. ""You MUST self-isolate if you enter the UK from a non-exempt country - from tomorrow, weâre increasing the penalties for people who refuse to do so to a maximum of Â£10,000 for repeat offenders,"" he wrote on Twitter. Those fines apply to England, rather than the whole of the UK. He added a message saying: ""REMINDER: If you do travel, you must complete a Passenger Locator Form before returning to the UK. Do your bit to help keep everyone safe."" Mr Shapps added that data from Poland showed that positive tests had nearly doubled - increasing from 3.9% to 5.8% - and there had been ""a rapid increase in weekly cases"" there. Read all the latest on the new rules here. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent The maximum fine for repeatedly breaching the travel quarantine in England is set to rise from Â£3,200 to Â£10,000.  The fine for a single offence will remain at Â£1,000.However in the case of someone committing a second offence it would rise to Â£2,000, or Â£4,000 for a third offence.For a fourth or subsequent offence, the fine would be Â£10,000.

"This video can not be played Odds of redundancy ""very frightening"" The countdown to the end of the furlough financial lifeline has begun, with employers facing increased costs amid a warning that millions of jobs now hang in the balance. From Thursday, the government's contribution to furloughed workers' wages falls. It is also the deadline for some firms to issue redundancy notices before the furlough scheme ends on 31 October. The current scheme is being replaced by a less generous jobs support package. Labour claims that as a result of the government's ""flawed"" support, almost three million people working for small businesses are at risk of losing their jobs. New analysis from the party says that at the start of September an estimated 2.8 million workers in small and medium size firms (SMEs) were furloughed under the current Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS). Since then new Covid restrictions have been imposed that mean 133,055 SMEs - including in the hospitality and events sectors - cannot operate or are trading at reduced capacity, it says. More than a million SMEs are still suffering a fall in turnover, with about 310,000 making less than half the amount they did over the same period last year, the analysis claims. Changes coming into effect on Thursday,along with other cost increases for employers, were announced in July.,external The government's contribution towards furlough wages is dropping from 70% to 60%, up to a cap of Â£1,875 a month. And employers have to pay a minimum of 20% of wages, bringing monthly earnings to at least 80% of salary. How is furlough changing? Sunak defends emergency jobs scheme 'We have next to no income. There is no help for us' In August, employers were required to meet the cost of pension contributions and National Insurance for employees placed on the scheme. There are also fears that the winding down of the furlough scheme could trigger a new wave of redundancies. Thursday is the deadline for employers to issue redundancy notices if they are planning to lay off between 20 and 99 workers before the scheme ends. The replacement jobs support scheme shifts more of the financial burden away from the taxpayer and on to employers. But the aim is to subsidise staff to work reduced hours so that employers resist mass redundancies. Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned last week he could not save every firm and every job Critics say it will be more expensive to bring back furloughed workers. Sonia Hawkins, who runs Disco Equipment Hire, a music and lightening rental service for the entertainment industry, told the BBC the numbers just do not add up. She said: ""We have next to no income. We've got people on furlough. We would have to bring them back and pay them just to get a subsidy. It's nuts."" Employment lawyer Merrill April, from CM Murray, acknowledged that the new jobs support scheme would not make much financial sense for some employers. She told the BBC: ""One of the condition is that employees have to work 33% of their normal hours so, in short, employers will have to pay at least 55% of an employees usual wage where the employee only works 33% of their usual hours."" However, she said that many firms supported the new scheme and would not rush to cut jobs. Redundancy is expensive, she said, adding that many firms would want to retain people and skills for as long as possible. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was a critical time for employers, with its members facing cash flow difficulties ahead of what was likely to be a challenging winter. BCC co-executive director Claire Walker said further support may be needed. ""As the Jobs Support Scheme replaces the furlough scheme, and employers are asked to pay more towards staffing costs, the government must stand ready to offer further support to businesses who may be unable to cover their contribution due to continued restrictions and reduced demand."" Christmas and New Year celebrations are an important time for the hospitality industry Events manager Lisa, on furlough since March, was optimistic about returning to work over the next few weeks as Christmas festivities are always good for business. But the further restrictions on hospitality and imminent changes to the furlough scheme give Lisa's employer no incentive to bring her back, she told the BBC. ""Work has all but vanished since Covid. We have gone through a consultation period for redundancies.  I've just no idea what is going to happen,"" said Lisa, who did not want to disclose her surname nor employer for fear of saying anything to jeopardise future work. ""The latest jobs support scheme does nothing to help those of us on furlough. I have been brought back one day a week, but what is happening now gives my employer no incentive to give me more days,"" Lisa adds. She has asked her employer to take unpaid leave until March, but there has been no decision. ""I have a lot of experience and have been applying for other jobs. I have searched and searched for different jobs since March. But there's nothing."" ""I can understand what Mr Sunak is trying to do [to help the economy]. But it is so difficult for us. He doesn't seem to have done anything that will help people like me."" Read more:'We have next to no income. There is no help.' ChancellorRishi Sunak's latest support measures announced this monthhave nevertheless received significant support, and were broadly welcomed by the CBI employers' group and union leaders at the TUC. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) singled out for praise the pay-as-you-go scheme that allows firms more time to repay loans, saying it should give confidence to invest and hire. Business leaders also welcomed new tax cuts and deferrals. However, FSB chairman Mike Cherry said: ""It's important to remember that small firms have already spent thousands on putting safety measures in place but received no funding to support their efforts to do the right thing."" The women who started businesses in lockdown Plea not to axe Â£20 a week benefits âlifelineâ New job support plans 'leave nightclubs behind' And Mr Cherry remains worried about the plight of the newly-self employed and company directors, who he said have received no income support whatsoever. He told the BBC: ""We are concerned that the chancellor had said nothing on support for those who were left out of the first round of support measures. The government urgently needs to come forward with an emergency relief package for these groups which have dutifully paid their taxes and deserve help too."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the government had a ""sink or swim"" mentality. ""Millions of jobs are at risk because he's forcing small businesses to choose which staff to keep and which to fire. These are viable businesses that just need support to cope with the restrictions the government has imposed on them."" Anneliese Dodds said viable businesses are going to the wall She said the chancellor's job support changes were ""pulling up the drawbridge at the worst possible time"". A Treasury spokesman said the support has reached, and continue to reach, millions of firms and people - citing loan schemes, VAT deferrals, business rates holidays, bans of tenant evictions, and sick pay rebates. ""The [new] Job Support Scheme is designed to protect jobs in businesses facing lower demand over the winter due to Covid, and is just one form of support on offer to employers during this difficult period. ""We're also continuing to innovate in supporting incomes and employment through our Plan for Jobs announced in July, helping employees get back to work through a Â£1,000 retention bonus and creating new roles for young people with our Kickstart scheme,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Police described video of the incident which shows a figure approach the officers' car, before opening fire Investigators in Los Angeles have charged a man with the attempted murder of two police officers who were shot as they sat in their patrol car. Deonte Lee Murray, 36, was already in custody for unrelated carjacking charges, prosecutors said. At a court appearance on Wednesday he pleaded not guilty to the charges in both cases, AP News reported. Widely shared video of the shooting showed a figure approach the police car, open fire and then run away. The officers were seriously injured but have since been released from hospital. Footage of the 12 September attack, described by police as an ambush, caused a national outcry and both candidates in the presidential race - President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden - called for the perpetrator to be severely dealt with. In a statement, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said Deonte Lee Murray had been charged with two counts of attempted murder and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He had been in custody since his arrest on 15 September for the carjacking charges, the statement said. Following Wednesday's court appearance, Mr Murray was remanded in prison with bail set at $6.15m (Â£4.7m) and is due back in court in November. Police guarded the hospital where the wounded officers were taken Prosecutors have not suggested a possible motive for the shooting of the officers, which happened in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton. They were not named but were described as a 31-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man. The female officer was shot in the jaw and arms while the male officer was hit in the forehead, an arm and a hand. It later emerged that, despite her injuries, the female deputy helped her partner to safety and applied a tourniquet to his wounded arm. With law and order a key issue in next month's presidential election, both candidates strongly condemned the attack at the time. President Donald Trump shared footage of the incident and tweeted: ""Animals that must be hit hard."" Mr Biden, meanwhile, said that the ""cold-blooded"" shooting was unconscionable and ""the perpetrator must be brought to justice"".

One Warrington dad has spoken about his frustration over the new tightening of restrictions. Contract commercial manager Colm Buteux said: ""So as a family of four, we cannot see our parents, or our friends as a family group. ""But I'm allowed on my own to go to the pub with five others from different households? ""My children are facing another six months of not being able to see our closest friends even though that is the only family we mix with."" ""I do get why the government is doing this but they should let people have access to a support bubble,"" he told the BBC. ""Everywhere I go I see people disobeying the rules - they need to be sorted out.Why should I suffer and they donât? ""The kids have been at home for four months. Now they can go to school and do sports. Iâm pleased they can do that. ""I donât care if they close every pub, I want my children to go to school and do exercise. Trying to keep everything together is stressful.â Schools will be made to offer pupils at home the same lessons remotely as those they're teaching in person. The government, which is using powers under the Coronavirus Act, says it's formalising pupils' right to remote learning. Ministers also insist that schools will only close as a last resort. Instead, where areas are high, schools may switch to a rota system of two weeks on and two weeks off. But teachers' unions say it's a ""grave error"" to reach for legal powers when schools are already preparing for all eventualities, and that ministers should focus on ""support not sanction"". ""By reaching for legal powers, the government risks sending an unequivocal message to the profession and parents that they do not trust school leaders to act in the interests of young people in this country,"" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT head teachers' union, says. The owners of a bar in Bolton say they feel the hospitality sector has been blamed for a rise in coronavirus cases. Rebecca Brayshaw, who runs Little Bolton Town Hall bar and events space, said it had been shut for the past three weeks. But with Bolton now set to fall into line with the rest of Greater Manchester, the bar can reopen from Saturday. ""Our plight, our voice has been heard,"" she says. She and husband Chris are now waiting to hear the finer details of whether customers will have to be from a single household, or if the rule of six will apply. The regulations have been ""devastating in a lot of ways, financially and emotionally"" she tells he BBC. ""It's exhausting to wake up every day and wonder what, if any, part of your business will survive. ""We want people to be safe. That's the key everyone is striving for. The issue potentially is if hospitality is being blamed, which it very much feels like it has been recently, that ongoing negative effect continues."" That means people don't go out as much and are fearful, ""through no fault of our own"", despite the bar's Covid security measures, adds Mrs Brayshaw, adding: ""We need people to come and visit us."" Mr Brayshaw said today's news was a step in the right direction - but that it is part of a bigger battle.   Jumping on a plane and going on holiday looks and feels very different to how it did at the start of 2020. Airports and airlines have both been making changes to the way they work to get passengers flying again - including measures that help reduce the chances of the virus being spread. In this video, BBC journalist Laura Foster goes toSouthend Airport,externalto show you what you need to do if you're thinking of catching a flight. This video can not be played Hundreds of millions of people in China are celebrating the National Day holiday today, marking the founding of the People's Republic of China, with large gatherings and quick getaways. It's estimated that about 550 million people will travel within the country during the eight-day holiday known as ""Golden Week"". It's also thought that 13 million passenger trips were made today - the highest figure since February,according to state media,external. Although coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the country appears to have largely stopped the spread of the virus, and most restrictions have been lifted. Images of China today are worlds apart from a nation that was under lockdown earlier this year. You can see our full gallery here. The Manchester Airports Group said Poland and Turkey's removal from the travel exemptions list ""means that a large proportion of the markets our passengers usually travel to are now effectively closed off, despite many of them having much lower infection rates than the UK"". The announcement ""is a further blow to the already struggling aviation sector"", said the group, which owns and operates Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports. It is ""vital"" for the government to establish a testing regime ""which would allow for a safe reduction in quarantine periods for passengers arriving from abroad"", it added. This week 170 workers at a pork meat processing plant in Cornwall tested positive for Covid-19. Most of those who tested positive were unaware they had Covid-19 and were not displaying symptoms. This is just the latest in a long line of meat processing plants across the world that have experienced outbreaks, including in Germany, France, Spain and the US. So what makes them so vulnerable? ""Factories and, in particular, indoor areas which are cold and damp, are perfect environments for coronavirus to linger and spread,"" according to Lawrence Young, Professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick. Read more about how Covid spreads in meat processing plantshere. SNP MP Margaret Ferrier has apologised for breaching Covid rules by travelling to and from London while she had coronavirus symptoms. Ferrier says her symptoms were ""mild"", and that by the time she took the train to London to attend Parliament she was ""feeling much better"". She later tested positive for the virus. She says she's notified the police. ""Despite feeling well, I should have self-isolated while waiting for my test result, and I deeply regret my actions,"" she says.

""Nicola Sturgeon must condemn her MP's actions and tell the Scottish people what disciplinary action she will be taking."" We've been hearing today about further restrictions being brought in for parts of north-east and north-west England. A bit more information has come through, confirming the measures are being made law in the Liverpool City Region, Halton, Warrington, Hartlepool and Middlesbrough. It means people living there won't be able to mix with those outside their own household, in any indoor setting. Meanwhile, stricter measures in Bolton are being eased, so it will be in line with the rest of Greater Manchester. The move follows pleas from local leaders to allow hospitality venues to open under the same conditions as the rest of the region - like having table service, and closing at 10pm. It also means bowling alleys, indoor skating rinks, casinos, indoor play, including soft play and conference centres and exhibit halls will also be able to reopen in Bolton. And rules on weddings, wedding receptions and funerals will be the same as the rest of the country. All the latest - including the areas now on the government's watchlist - can be foundhere,external. As part of that, Sheffield has been moved from an ""area of concern"" to an ""area of enhanced support"", which means more resources - which could mean more testing - for the city.  Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent ""Shambolic"" is how one journalist in The Hague described
the Dutch position on masks. Faced with one of the most rapidly spreading infection rates in
Europe, last night Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, under pressure from
parliament and the public, issued ""urgent and immediate advice"" for people to
wear face masks in indoor spaces. It's been an awkward but unavoidable U-turn for Mr Rutte, who
initially stood out as one of the world's most mask-sceptic leaders. While neighbouring countries locked down and brought in
wide-reaching restrictions and compulsory mask-wearing in public places, Mr
Rutte said he was ""not a dictator"" and congratulated the Dutch for being
capable of following social distancing rules without being ""treated like
children"". Six months since the start of the pandemic, the Dutch are breaking
their own records for the daily number of new cases, while neighbouring nations
are easing their rules. From what I witnessed in The Hague today, there are still more
people exercising their right not to mask up than taking responsibility to do
what the widely accepted science suggests could help to protect themselves and
others. Students should be allowed to leave university and study online if they want to, according to unions representing academics and students. The National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union are calling for the government to take urgent action. It comes after university campuses have been hit by outbreaks of the virus, with many students in self isolation. Larissa Kennedy, NUS president, said students had been left ""trapped in halls"" and were struggling to access food and wellbeing resources. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said students will be allowed to be with their families at Christmas if they choose to. But the education unions are calling for a move to online learning wherever possible - and they say students should be given a safe way to leave campus now if they want to. Students should not face any financial detriment for giving up accommodation, or choosing to defer or leave university, they say. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on the government to provide a ""support package"" to those university students currently self-isolating. He said: ""There should have been serious consideration to delay going back. There certainly should have been some thought as to testing."" Read more here. Krakow Old Town in Poland Grant Shapps, announcing the new quarantine rules, also took the opportunity to remind people of the rules. ""You MUST self-isolate if you enter the UK from a non-exempt country - from tomorrow, weâre increasing the penalties for people who refuse to do so to a maximum of Â£10,000 for repeat offenders,"" he wrote on Twitter. Those fines apply to England, rather than the whole of the UK. He added a message saying: ""REMINDER: If you do travel, you must complete a Passenger Locator Form before returning to the UK. Do your bit to help keep everyone safe."" Mr Shapps added that data from Poland showed that positive tests had nearly doubled - increasing from 3.9% to 5.8% - and there had been ""a rapid increase in weekly cases"" there. Read all the latest on the new rules here. Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent The maximum fine for repeatedly breaching the travel quarantine in England is set to rise from Â£3,200 to Â£10,000.  The fine for a single offence will remain at Â£1,000.However in the case of someone committing a second offence it would rise to Â£2,000, or Â£4,000 for a third offence.For a fourth or subsequent offence, the fine would be Â£10,000.

"Ministers are considering converting disused ferries moored off the coast to process people seeking asylum in the UK. According to Refugee Action, 35,566 asylum applications were made in the UK in 2019 - down from a peak of 84,000 in 2002. Downing Street said it was looking at what other countries do ""to inform a plan for the UK."" Labour called the proposal to process people on ferries ""unconscionable"". The most senior civil servant at the Home Office, Matthew Rycroft, said ""everything is on the table"" when it comes to ""improving"" the UK's asylum system. Patel considered asylum centre on Atlantic island Fleeing the Syrian war for Belfast What happens to migrants who reach the UK? Asylum seekers criticise military camp housing Home Secretary Priti Patelasked officials to look at policies, including housing people who are seeking asylum offshore. On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported the Foreign Office hadcarried out an assessment for Ascension Island, a remote UK territory in the Atlantic Ocean  - which included the practicalities of transferring migrants thousands of miles - and decided not to proceed. Nowthe Times reports that the government is giving ""serious consideration"",externalto the idea of buying retired ferries and converting them into processing centres, but it says the Home Office rejected a proposal to use decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea. The paper also says processing migrants on an island off the coast of Scotland had been considered, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted,externalthat ""any proposal to treat human beings like cattle in a holding pen will be met with the strongest possible opposition from me"". Appearing before the Public Affairs Committee, Permanent Secretary Mr Rycroft said he would not comment on leaks to newspapers, but that the department was ""brainstorming"" ideas. He said: ""We've been looking at what a whole host of other countries do in order to bring innovation into our own system. ""No decisions have been taken.  No final proposals have been put to ministers... this is in the realm of the brainstorming stage of a future policy."" Mr Rycroft said the UK would ""always comply with all of our international obligations"" and civil servants would ""assess all of the various different possible ideas out there to see which are legal and which make operational senseâ¦ so that ministers can ultimately make decisions"". How does the government tempt fewer people to attempt a perilous crossing of the Channel to reach the south coast? Well, one idea is to make it clear that even a successful crossing won't mean getting to stay in the UK - at least in the short term. The government is exploring ""all sorts of options"" - not my words, but those of the most senior civil servant in the Home Office. Hence the recent headlines about transferring asylum seekers to a lump of British rock in the middle of the South Atlantic - Ascension Island, or buying an old ferry to house them. But remember, although the numbers coming over the Channel in boatsare at a record high, they are still a small proportion of overall asylum seekers coming to the UK. And rows about asylum are far from new. Twenty years ago, it was the then-Home Secretary, Jack Straw,found himself in a row with his own party,externalabout what the Labour government should do about the issue. So this is an historic problem for parties of both colours. Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour would oppose any move to use ferries, adding: ""Even considering this is appalling."" He accused the government of ""lurching from one inhumane and impractical idea to another"" and claimed it had ""lost control and all sense of compassion"". The SNP's home affairs spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, said the leaked plans showed ""the callousness at the core"" of the government, and the plans would ""treat vulnerable asylum seekers as cattle rather than human beings"". But Conservative MP for Gravesham in Kent, Adam Holloway, said the Home Office was ""completely right"" to be looking at other options that were ""some sort of deterrent"" for asylum seekers. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to break the link in people's minds that if you get to Britain you're going to stay in Britain, you're going to stay in a hotel and you're going to be accommodated."" He added that the UK needed to find a ""civilised version"" of the model used by Australia, which hascontroversially used offshore processing and detention centres for asylum seekerssince the 1980s. The discussion comes as record numbers of people are crossingthe Channel to the UK, with 400 arriving in one day in September. Ascension Island is more than 4,000 miles (6,000km) from the UK A Home Office source said this week that ministers were looking at ""every option that can stop small boat crossings and fix the asylum system"", but no final decisions had been made. Nearly7,000 people have reached the UKin more than 500 small boats this year - by 23 September, 1,892 migrants had arrived during the month, more than in all of 2019. But they are still a small proportion of the asylum seekers coming to the UK. Tory MP Natalie Elphicke, who represents Dover, said the government had been ""clear they are going to take whatever action is necessary to put a stop to these small boat crossings"". She told the BBC No 10 and the Home Office were looking at a ""whole range of things"" to address the ""draw factor"" of the UK, ""from cruise ships and ferries through to offshore fast track assessment centres, through to changing the immigration law"". Earlier in the Commons, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told Parliament the government was ""actively looking at the steps that we can take"" to stop illegal crossings in the English Channel so the UK can ""maintain our commitment to providing a safe haven"" but also ""safeguard our borders"". To be eligible for asylum in the UK, applicants must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation. A caseworker decides if they have a valid claim by taking into account factors such as the country of origin of the asylum seeker or evidence of discrimination. This is supposed to be done in six months but delays in processing claims have increased significantly in the last year. While waiting for a decision to be made, asylum seekers are usually not allowed to work and are initially placed in hostel-type accommodation before longer-term housing is arranged.

"This video can not be played Odds of redundancy ""very frightening"" The countdown to the end of the furlough financial lifeline has begun, with employers facing increased costs amid a warning that millions of jobs now hang in the balance. From Thursday, the government's contribution to furloughed workers' wages falls. It is also the deadline for some firms to issue redundancy notices before the furlough scheme ends on 31 October. The current scheme is being replaced by a less generous jobs support package. Labour claims that as a result of the government's ""flawed"" support, almost three million people working for small businesses are at risk of losing their jobs. New analysis from the party says that at the start of September an estimated 2.8 million workers in small and medium size firms (SMEs) were furloughed under the current Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS). Since then new Covid restrictions have been imposed that mean 133,055 SMEs - including in the hospitality and events sectors - cannot operate or are trading at reduced capacity, it says. More than a million SMEs are still suffering a fall in turnover, with about 310,000 making less than half the amount they did over the same period last year, the analysis claims. Changes coming into effect on Thursday,along with other cost increases for employers, were announced in July.,external The government's contribution towards furlough wages is dropping from 70% to 60%, up to a cap of Â£1,875 a month. And employers have to pay a minimum of 20% of wages, bringing monthly earnings to at least 80% of salary. How is furlough changing? Sunak defends emergency jobs scheme 'We have next to no income. There is no help for us' In August, employers were required to meet the cost of pension contributions and National Insurance for employees placed on the scheme. There are also fears that the winding down of the furlough scheme could trigger a new wave of redundancies. Thursday is the deadline for employers to issue redundancy notices if they are planning to lay off between 20 and 99 workers before the scheme ends. The replacement jobs support scheme shifts more of the financial burden away from the taxpayer and on to employers. But the aim is to subsidise staff to work reduced hours so that employers resist mass redundancies. Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned last week he could not save every firm and every job Critics say it will be more expensive to bring back furloughed workers. Sonia Hawkins, who runs Disco Equipment Hire, a music and lightening rental service for the entertainment industry, told the BBC the numbers just do not add up. She said: ""We have next to no income. We've got people on furlough. We would have to bring them back and pay them just to get a subsidy. It's nuts."" Employment lawyer Merrill April, from CM Murray, acknowledged that the new jobs support scheme would not make much financial sense for some employers. She told the BBC: ""One of the condition is that employees have to work 33% of their normal hours so, in short, employers will have to pay at least 55% of an employees usual wage where the employee only works 33% of their usual hours."" However, she said that many firms supported the new scheme and would not rush to cut jobs. Redundancy is expensive, she said, adding that many firms would want to retain people and skills for as long as possible. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was a critical time for employers, with its members facing cash flow difficulties ahead of what was likely to be a challenging winter. BCC co-executive director Claire Walker said further support may be needed. ""As the Jobs Support Scheme replaces the furlough scheme, and employers are asked to pay more towards staffing costs, the government must stand ready to offer further support to businesses who may be unable to cover their contribution due to continued restrictions and reduced demand."" Christmas and New Year celebrations are an important time for the hospitality industry Events manager Lisa, on furlough since March, was optimistic about returning to work over the next few weeks as Christmas festivities are always good for business. But the further restrictions on hospitality and imminent changes to the furlough scheme give Lisa's employer no incentive to bring her back, she told the BBC. ""Work has all but vanished since Covid. We have gone through a consultation period for redundancies.  I've just no idea what is going to happen,"" said Lisa, who did not want to disclose her surname nor employer for fear of saying anything to jeopardise future work. ""The latest jobs support scheme does nothing to help those of us on furlough. I have been brought back one day a week, but what is happening now gives my employer no incentive to give me more days,"" Lisa adds. She has asked her employer to take unpaid leave until March, but there has been no decision. ""I have a lot of experience and have been applying for other jobs. I have searched and searched for different jobs since March. But there's nothing."" ""I can understand what Mr Sunak is trying to do [to help the economy]. But it is so difficult for us. He doesn't seem to have done anything that will help people like me."" Read more:'We have next to no income. There is no help.' ChancellorRishi Sunak's latest support measures announced this monthhave nevertheless received significant support, and were broadly welcomed by the CBI employers' group and union leaders at the TUC. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) singled out for praise the pay-as-you-go scheme that allows firms more time to repay loans, saying it should give confidence to invest and hire. Business leaders also welcomed new tax cuts and deferrals. However, FSB chairman Mike Cherry said: ""It's important to remember that small firms have already spent thousands on putting safety measures in place but received no funding to support their efforts to do the right thing."" The women who started businesses in lockdown Plea not to axe Â£20 a week benefits âlifelineâ New job support plans 'leave nightclubs behind' And Mr Cherry remains worried about the plight of the newly-self employed and company directors, who he said have received no income support whatsoever. He told the BBC: ""We are concerned that the chancellor had said nothing on support for those who were left out of the first round of support measures. The government urgently needs to come forward with an emergency relief package for these groups which have dutifully paid their taxes and deserve help too."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the government had a ""sink or swim"" mentality. ""Millions of jobs are at risk because he's forcing small businesses to choose which staff to keep and which to fire. These are viable businesses that just need support to cope with the restrictions the government has imposed on them."" Anneliese Dodds said viable businesses are going to the wall She said the chancellor's job support changes were ""pulling up the drawbridge at the worst possible time"". A Treasury spokesman said the support has reached, and continue to reach, millions of firms and people - citing loan schemes, VAT deferrals, business rates holidays, bans of tenant evictions, and sick pay rebates. ""The [new] Job Support Scheme is designed to protect jobs in businesses facing lower demand over the winter due to Covid, and is just one form of support on offer to employers during this difficult period. ""We're also continuing to innovate in supporting incomes and employment through our Plan for Jobs announced in July, helping employees get back to work through a Â£1,000 retention bonus and creating new roles for young people with our Kickstart scheme,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Covid: Lockdown a 'huge worry' for business owners Businesses across north Wales say they fear local lockdowns could lead to job losses or even closures. New restrictions came into force for Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham on Thursday evening. It means those living in these areas cannot leave or enter without a ""reasonable excuse"" such as work or education. Businesses reliant on tourists said they were facing confusion over the rules and financial uncertainty. The restrictions - the same as those seen in most of south Wales - mean another 500,000 people are now living under tougher restrictions than at the start of September. Jim Jones of North Wales Tourism questioned whether visitors into north Wales were responsible for the spread - saying he had not seen any evidence they were. ""Business are extremely and understandably frustrated, it's another dark day,""he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""They have invested so much time and gone to extraordinary measures to be Covid-compliant and make everybody safe and then all of a sudden they've got to cancel bookings and tell visitors to go home."" Mr Jones called for outbreaks to be ""micro-managed"" by contact tracers - with local lockdowns covering much smaller areas. ""Our businesses are yet again about to be decimated. The lockdowns in north Wales at this moment in time are an overreaction... a knee-jerk reaction. ""To decimate the entire tourism and hospitality industry for cases that are still relatively low in the scale of things... Our economy is tourism."" What can I do in local lockdown? Tackling Covid is 'down to all of us' 'Leisure travel from lockdown areas must stop' Conwy council leader Sam Rowlands said he was ""disappointed and frustrated"" the Welsh Government did not take measures to protect tourism which would lose out again. Among those braced for another hit is the SeaQuarium in Rhyl which relies on day trippers and visitors from outside Denbighshire for as much as 90% of its business. ""It's a real struggle,"" said director Colette Macdonald. ""We were hoping we had a lifeline when we were able to reopen but we're 40% down on last year and my fear is that we will lose the October school half-term as well. ""It's also very difficult for attractions with animals. We can't just pull down the shutters and come back six months later. ""We have constant bills such as vets, heating and food for the animals. Our electricity bill alone is Â£5,500 every month - and we are almost entirely reliant upon visitors for revenue. Animal venues face costs to look after animals, whether they are open or not ""We'll have to reduce staff hours and possibly make redundancies if the lockdown continues. It's tough and very deflating. ""Zoos and aquariums in England get special help but in Wales we are regarded as part of the hospitality sector. We need more help from the Welsh Government."" The Welsh Government said: ""Earlier this year we wrote to zoos in Wales with details of existing schemes which they may be eligible for funding, as well as issuing a questionnaire to identify key animal welfare concerns and whether any funding gaps exist."" Businesses have also complained the difference between rules in Wales and England over travel for holidays has caused ""mass confusion"". First Minister Mark Drakeford has called for Boris Johnson toban people in locked-down parts of England from travelling to Waleson holiday. ""Wales is doing everything possible to safeguard England and I don't feel England is doing the same for us here in Wales,"" was the view of Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi. Lockdown offers local residents a chance to enjoy sites as Bodnant Gardens without the crowds The owners of Halkyn Castle Wood campsite, near Holywell in Flintshire, rely on visitors from across the border. ""The differences in the rules are very confusing,"" said Venessa Warrington, 44. ""People are ringing and at times we don't know what to tell them. We're just going along with the advice given by Visit Wales."" The family-run campsite, like so many businesses in the tourism sector, is facing an uncertain future. ""My heart sank when we heard the latest lockdown announcement,"" said Mrs Warrington. ""It has been a very difficult year. I worked out to the penny how long we could go before we would have to sell the family business. ""We've extended the season longer than usual to make up for lost months but our financial problems will only get worse if we're forced to close again."" Founder of the Zipworld attractions Shaun Taylor has put 100 staff on furlough from Thursday evening and said: ""It's challenging. It's emotionally challenging, it's financially challenging."" National Trust sites in lockdown areas, such as Erddig in Wrexham county, will remain open to local residents only The National Trust said lockdown offered local residents a chance to enjoy its sites across the region, such as Bodnant Gardens, Erddig and Chirk Castle, without bustling crowds. However visitors must still book in advance. ""Over the past few months it's become clear just how much we all need fresh air and open space, so we're keeping our places open for local residents to get closer to nature and watch the season unfold,"" a spokeswoman said. Under the restrictions no-one can leave or enter a lockdown areaexcept for a limited set of reasons, including: to work, if you cannot work from home to provide care travelling to education elite athletic training and competitions to provide or receive emergency assistance to meet a legal obligation, and to access or receive public services to avoid injury or illness or escape a risk of harm It is permitted to travel through the areas concerned, so motorists can continue to use the A55 to get to or out of Gwynedd and Anglesey.

"Google's hardware chief has said its new flagship smartphone was designed to go on sale during an economic downturn. As a result, the Pixel 5 has abandoned some of its predecessor's headline features and runs on a slower chip in order to be sold at a lower price. However, it does gain 5G connectivity and some new photography capabilities. Experts say it will face tough competition from other mid-range Android handsets, but the included bundle of Google services could help. ""To not bring to market a true flagship demonstrates Google is now thinking about the market in a very different way than it was last year,"" commented Ben Stanton from the tech consultancy Canalys. ""And on a price-specs basis alone, Google will probably lose to Samsung and Chinese competitors. ""Its key selling point, however, remains that it offers a stock Android experience with superfast updates."" This is a reference to the fact that many other Android device-makers layer their own proprietary user interfaces on top of Google's operating system, and typically take longer to offer software updates. The Pixel 5 will cost $699/Â£599, and has a 6in (15.2cm) display and 128 gigabytes of storage. That compares to the $999/Â£929 price of last year's top-end 6.3in Pixel 4XL. Google also unveiled a 5G-enabled version of its existing Pixel 4a, which will cost Â£499. Smartphone designs are typically locked in place many months before the products go on sale, in order to secure the required components and carry out tests. Google's senior vice president of devices and services acknowledged that the Pixel 5's features had been decided upon before the coronavirus pandemic began. But he said a deliberate choice had been taken to offer a 5G-capable phone at ""an affordable price"". The Pixel 5 can wirelessly charge some accessories placed on its back ""What the world doesn't seem like it needs right now is another $1,000 phone,"" said Rick Osterloh. ""Obviously nobody anticipated the pandemic, but we actually did think that the world was possibly headed for an economic downturn... and it only further emphasised our point of view that this is the right thing."" Tech jettisoned from the Pixel 4 includes the Soli radar chip, which Google had taken five years to develop. It automatically turned on the older phone's screen when its owner approached and allowed gesture controls. Last year's face-unlock sensors have also been ditched, with a return to the Pixel 3's fingerprint sensor on the back of the Pixel 5. ""These technologies will be used in the future, but they're very expensive,"" Mr Osterloh said. The Pixel 5's Snapdragon 765G chip is also rated as beingslower and having lower graphics-processing performance,externalthan last year's Snapdragon 855, although Mr Osterloh said he did not believe consumers would notice. Mr Osterloh has been Google's hardware chief since 2016 The device does benefit from some improvements, including being able to produce a shallow-focus effect in ""super low-light conditions"". One of its rear cameras now has a wider angle lens than before. And there are a choice of new video stabilisation modes. In addition, the RAM memory has been boosted to 8GB, which should help the phone switch from task-to-task more quickly. And Google is bundling some of its subscription services including three months of its games-streaming platform Stadia and 100 gigabytes of online storage. ""Bundling three months of Stadia Pro cloud gaming with 5G Pixel phones is smart, because gamers benefit in particular from the 5G experience,"" commented Ian Fogg from OpenSignal. ""But cloud gaming is still 'early' tech for mobile."" Google hopes the phone will help attract more users to its cloud gaming service Stadia The Pixel 5's competition will includeSamsung's Galaxy S20FE and the forthcoming OnePlus 8T,external- which are also being targeted at the ""mid-market"". Google shipped 4.6 million Pixel smartphones over the 12 months leading up to July 2020, according to research firm IDC. That marked a 37% drop over the same period a year earlier. However, a wider fall in demand for smartphones meant the brand still rose from being ranked 16th to 12th in terms of market share for the final quarter of each period. Other products unveiled at Google's virtual event included Nest Audio - a redesigned version of its Google Home smart speaker, which now promises more bass and louder volumes. The Google Nest Audio is covered in a fabric made out of recycled material Google is the second best-selling smart speaker brand in Western markets. But it is still forecast to sell about a third of the number of Amazon's Echo speakers in the UK this year, according to research firm eMarketer. Google also showed off a new version of its television-streaming dongle, which is now called Chromecast with Google TV. Unlike its predecessors, the device comes with its own remote control, which allows users to control their TV and soundbar via its buttons or voice commands as an alternative to using a smartphone app. The latest Chromecast dongle now comes with its own remote It also brings together movies and TV shows from the various apps each user subscribes to in order to make its own recommendations.

"The BBC revealed how criminal gangs had set up fake companies to claim loans. The government was warned in May that its flagship loan scheme to help small firms affected by Covid was at ""very high risk of fraud"" from ""organised crime"", it has emerged. The state-owned British Business Bank (BBB) which supervises the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, twice raised concerns. A BBC report revealed that criminals were setting up fake firms to get loans worth tens of thousands of pounds. The Bounce Back Loan Scheme has already paid out more than Â£38bn. In early May, just two days before the scheme launched, the chief executive of the BBB, Keith Morgan, wrote of the ""very significant fraud and credit risks"", adding that it was ""vulnerable to abuse by individuals and organised crime"". The bank, he said in a letter to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, could not guarantee ""robust controls"". Other concerns included an ""extensive reliance on customer self-certification"" and ""potential for market distortion"". He said that the BBB had commissioned a review of the scheme by accountants PwC, which had classified its fraud risk as ""very high"". In his letter, dated 2 May and which followed a email warning the day before, Mr Morgan also raised concerns that the quick introduction of the scheme had ""created huge operational challenges"". However, Mr Sharma said the scheme should go ahead despite the risks, because of what he called the ""unprecedented situation facing the country"". 'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan' Arrest over Â£110k Covid small business loan fraud UK banks get 100,000 loan applications on first day Bounce Back Loans are 100% government-backed loans of up to Â£50,000, and were introduced to mitigate the huge pressure on small businesses after the economy went into coronavirus lockdown. They do not have to be paid off for six years, and are interest-free for the first 12 months. According to latest Treasury figures,external, there have been 1.55 million applications, with 1.26 million approvals and Â£38.02b paid out. At the weekend, the BBC's Angus Crawford revealed how fraudsters were targeting the loan system.

This video can not be played Watch the moment Mark Telling finds out he's been a victim of fraud The revelations come after the head of the National Audit Officetold the Guardian,externalBounce Back Loans were the ""riskiest"" of all the bailout measures. But a government spokesman told the BBC the loan scheme had been vital for many businesses and that fraudsters would be pursued. He said: ""Our loan schemes have provided a lifeline to thousands of businesses across the UK - helping them survive the outbreak and protecting millions of jobs. ""Our support has been targeted to ensure we help those who need it most as quickly as possible and we won't apologise for this."" He said the government worked with agencies to minimise fraud, ""with lenders implementing a range of protections including anti-money laundering and customer checks, as well as transaction monitoring controls. Any fraudulent applications can be criminally prosecuted for which penalties include imprisonment or a fine or both"".

"At Whipsnade Zoo, a male southern white rhino called Sizzle has been introduced to new female rhinos, in the hope that they will breed Zoos' vital conservation work is being put at risk by a Covid-related funding crisis. Breeding programmes to rescue rare species may have to be cancelled, with many zoos facing the biggest cash crisis in their history. The body that represents British zoos says a government rescue package is inaccessible for most of its members. Only one zoo has claimed successfully, the BBC has learned. Zoos face huge income losses due to lockdown and reduced visitor numbers. Ultimately, this will impact on their ability to care for species which are the last of their kind on Earth, and now found only in zoos. UK zoos at risk of closure Extinction: A million species at risk, so what is saved? Elephant shrew rediscovered in Africa after 50 years. ""The extinct-in-the-wild species are absolutely dependent on human care,"" said Dr John Ewen of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). ""It's our decision about which way to go forward that determines extinction or recovery."" The scimitar-horned oryx is regarded as a conservation success story BBC News has discovered that just one zoo out of around 300 in England has successfully made a claim from a Â£100m government recovery fund. The trade body that represents Britain's zoos and aquariums, Biaza, says the way the government's bailout fund is structured means it is virtually impossible for most of its members to claim. They need to be 12 weeks from bankruptcy to qualify and by that time any responsible animal park would already be trying to find new homes for its residents, the association says. It warns that many international breeding programmes, designed to ensure the survival of rare species, may have to be cancelled and without government help some big UK zoos face closure. The government says its rescue package was designed to provide a safety net if zoos got into really serious financial difficulties. Polynesian tree snails are being saved from extinction Zoos are one of the largest funders of conservation work around the world, particularly large, successful zoos in Europe, North America and Australia. Dr Alexandra Zimmermann is a senior research fellow at Oxford University and former head of conservation at Chester Zoo. She told BBC News: ""Zoos contribute hundreds of millions of support all over the world for conservation in the wild so if we lose a lot of that support from the effects of Covid, then that has really detrimental effects on conservation everywhere."" At least 77 species of plants and animals are classified as extinct in the wild by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which compiles data on endangered species. The Guam kingfisher is one such bird, disappearing in the 1980s from the island of Guam, a US territory in the western Pacific. A stowaway snake was accidently brought in on military equipment, where it wreaked havoc on the ecosystem. With no natural predator, the snake species rapidly multiplied, eventually growing to such a number that it ate most of the island's native bird species. All 100 or so Guam kingfishers live in human care The last few kingfishers on Earth were rescued and taken into captivity. There are now 100 or so birds in breeding programs at US zoos, with plans to reintroduce them to Guam and other suitable islands, if a safe habitat can be found. Many of the zoos were already under strain to breed enough birds to keep the population going, even before the pandemic, said Dr Ewen. ""Covid's come along and put incredible pressure on all of the institutions that care for them,"" he added. Guam has more than 2 million snakes, which have wreaked havoc with the ecosystem Since many of the ""last stand"" species have gone extinct in the wild due to human actions, we have a responsibility to save them, said Dr Amanda Trask of ZSL. ""It's crazy not to take that chance and try and bring them back,"" she said. Lockdown has placed many zoos around the world in a precarious financial situation. While many institutions have reopened, reduced visitor capacities due to social distancing are adding to the financial pressures. Zoos face huge bills from caring for animals; ZSL's monthly running costs were Â£2.3 million at the height of lockdown and it stands to lose Â£20 million this financial year. Some small zoos have already closed down while others are reducing conservation work. Pere David's deer: Breeding at Whipsnade Zoo after becoming extinct in the wild Dr Matyas Liptovszky, honorary assistant professor of zoo animal medicine at the University of Nottingham, said species kept alive in zoos and botanical gardens are ""the last safeguards of irreplaceable parts of our worlds"". The UK spends hundreds of millions annually on museums to preserve cultural and historic relics, but not in keeping extinct animals alive, he said, describing this as ""bizarre"" for a nature and animal-loving nation. ""One of the biggest differences between a great UK museum, which preserves remnants of already extinct animals, and a great UK zoo, which fights to keep alive another one on the way to extinction, is the complete lack of government funding for the latter one,"" he said. ""Their visitor revenue is directly funding vital conservation and scientific work, but with no or reduced number of visitors, they deserve and desperately need external help"".

"The plug in question had a design flaw, found Which? A smart plug for sale on Amazon poses a fire risk and people should immediately stop using it, an investigation by consumer watchdog Which? suggests. Amazon said it had removed the Hictkon smart plug with dual USB ports from sale, pending investigation. Its live connection was too close to an energy-monitoring chip, Which? found. And this could cause an electrical discharge between two electrodes, posing a fire risk particularly in homes with older wiring. The investigators also said the product's CE mark, normally associated with having passed rigorous European safety standards, was misleading. Some Chinese companies use a similar CE mark to designate ""China export"". Others simply fake the safety mark because there is no central database to check whether it has been verified and it can be self-declared by companies. ""Companies get away with it until they don't,"" said Clever Compliance chief executive Max Stralin. ""The same issue arose with the burning hoverboards back in 2015."" Amazon said customers concerned about purchases should contact its customer-service team. ""We monitor the products sold in our stores for product-safety concerns,"" it said. ""When appropriate, we remove a product from the store, reach out to sellers, manufacturers and government agencies for additional information or take other actions."" But Which? Computing editor Kate Bevan said: ""Too often we've seen dangerous products being sold on online marketplaces from unknown brands - in many cases originating from China's electronics capital, Shenzhen - that appear to have little accountability and are virtually impossible to contact. ""This raises big concerns around safety checks and monitoring carried out by online marketplaces like Amazon. ""Currently, consumers face a lottery regarding the safety of the products they buy from online marketplaces and whether they meet required safety standards in the UK. ""That's why it's vitally important that the government gives online marketplaces more legal responsibility for preventing unsafe products from being sold on their sites."" She called for government legislation and an ""enforcement body with teeth"" to crack down on rogue devices. Hictkon products, which include muscle massagers, ultraviolet lamps, touchscreen monitors and Hallow-e'en masks, are available only on Amazon, according to Which? Many of the top 10,000 UK sellers on online marketplaces were also based in China, it said: 36% on Amazon Marketplace 30% on eBay 95% on Wish But Amazon allows some sellers to ship products to its UK-based fulfilment centres, so they are packed and distributed by it, rather than directly from China.

"A technical problem forced a full-day trading halt on Japan's stock exchanges, including the popular Nikkei 225 index on Thursday. The shutdown happened when a backup system failed to kick in after a hardware malfunction, according to the Japan Exchange Group. It was quick to point out the halt wasn't connected to cyber-attackers. Trading was suspended at the main Tokyo stock exchange along with connected bourses in Nagoya, Fukuoka and Sapporo. Japan Exchange Group apologised for the one-day shutdown and said it aimed to resume trading as normal on Friday. Tokyo's roughly $6tn (Â£4.6tn) stock market is the world's third largest, after New York and Shanghai, according to data from the World Federation of Exchanges. The trading halt closed one of Asia's few major regional markets on Thursday, with exchanges in Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea and Taipei all closed for holidays. The suspension soured the mood of some investors, who were expecting the market to rebound after an acrimonious US presidential debate pushed the Nikkei 225 1.5% lower on Wednesday. New Zealand stock exchange halted by cyber-attack The trading halt was the exchange's first significant glitch since 2018, when a trading system problem left some securities firms unable to make orders. The Nikkei 225 index includes the shares of many of Japan's biggest companies including Honda, Nissan, Hitachi and Canon. Many stock markets have been hit with temporary glitches in the past. In August, the New Zealand Exchange was hit by cyber-attacks that forced it to halt trading over the course of one week. Over the past decade, the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, the Singapore stock exchange and Bombay's Sensex have all faced technical glitches that have delayed trading.

"Talks are ongoing over new Wylfa nuclear plans, it has been confirmed Plans for a new nuclear power station on Anglesey may not be over, letters to the UK government have revealed. Japanese firm Hitachipulled the plug on the Â£20bn scheme at Wylfaon Anglesey two weeks ago. But developer Horizon Nuclear Powerhas sent two letters to ministers,externalstating talks with other ""third parties"" are continuing. A decision on planning consent was due to be made on Wednesday, but will now be delayed until 31 December. The chief executive of Horizon Nuclear wrote to the UK government's Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary Alok Sharma on 22 September and 28 September. In the letters, Horizon's Duncan Hawthorne asked for a ""short extension"" on the deadline to announce the government's decision on whether it would allow planning permission for the original Hitachi plans for Anglesey. The Development Consent Order (DCO) process, which is the name given to planning applications for major UK infrastructure projects such as Wylfa,has been under consideration since June 2018,external. Wylfa Newydd and the energy gap What's Wylfa - and why is it so important? Mr Hawthorne's second letter to the energy secretary said: ""Since Hitachi Ltd's announcement to cease development activities associated with the Wylfa Newydd DCO Project, Horizon has been engaged in discussions with third parties that have expressed an interest in progressing with the development of new nuclear generation at the Wylfa Newydd site. ""These discussions are still at an early stage and it is felt that a short deferral would allow time for Horizon and those interested parties to determine whether, and if so how, the Wylfa Newydd DCO Project could be taken forward in Hitachi Ltd's absence."" Wylfa Newydd was being developed for Hitachi in the UK by its subsidiary Horizon Nuclear Power The nuclear boss said he could not reveal any more details about the talks, or who was involved, due to discussions being ""commercially sensitive"". But, he added: ""My team and I will be working hard over the coming months to bring these to a positive conclusion at which point we will be able to provide you with a more comprehensive update, including the extent to which this could materially impact on the development consent order currently before you for determination."" Work on the Wylfa Newydd project on Angleseywas suspended in January 2019because of rising costs after Hitachi failed to reach a funding agreement with the UK government. Last day of old Wylfa plant arrives 50 years of Wylfa in pictures On 16 September, Hitachi finally announced it was halting its involvement in Wylfa and its project at Oldbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire - despite describing both sites as ""highly desirable"" for new nuclear plants. It said it made the decision given 20 months had passed since the project had paused ""and the investment environment has become increasingly severe due to the impact of Covid-19"". The Anglesey project would have seen 9,000 jobs created in the construction phase. The new Wylfa power station would have been built next to the old power plant on Anglesey The UK government responded to the decision by stating it remained willing to discuss a replacement for the original Wylfa plant, which shut in 2015 after 44 years of service, with viable companies. It said the UK remained committed to nuclear power and recognised the Hitachi announcement was ""very disappointing news"" for people in north Wales. Writing to Horizon Nuclear on Wednesday, the energy secretary said he had considered the request to delay the planning consent decision while talks continued,. ""In the circumstances, it is appropriate to reset the decision deadline for the application to 31 December 2020,"" said Mr Sharma.
