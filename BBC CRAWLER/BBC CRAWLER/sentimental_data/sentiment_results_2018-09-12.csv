"Sam Oliver, 23, from Newcastle Sam Oliver should have spent the last six months backpacking around Australia. But after a drunken late-night fight in Sydney, he found himself at the centre of a media storm and being accused of knocking out former Rugby Sevens captain James Stannard. On Wednesday, after his lawyers argued he acted in self-defence, he wasfound not guilty of assault. The 23-year-old, from Newcastle, told Radio 1 Newsbeat he wishes none of it had happened. ""To go back now, I would take the black eye and still go away. I wish I could avoid the whole thing,"" he said. ""It's not something that you would ever think that would happen to you."" The kebab shop in Sydney where the altercation happened It all began in March, after he'd been out for drinks with friends. Sam Oliver and his lawyers said he had been waiting outside a kebab shop when James Stannard had sworn at him and used an anti-British expletive. ""It was a bit weird, I didn't know who said it,"" said Sam. ""I just said something back being a bit cheeky rather than aggressive really."" It was then he says James Stannard threw the first punch, giving him a black eye. ""I was punched so I reacted pretty much instantly and instinctively and hit him back and then I tried to get away from there,"" he said. It wasn't until after his arrest Sam Oliver was told who he had punched. British tourist Sam Oliver was cleared of assaulting Australian Rugby Sevens star James Stannard ""They said, 'Do you know who it is that you've hit?' And I said, 'no'. ""And he just said, 'Oh it's the captain of our Australian rugby team and you've put him out for the Commonwealth Games'. ""I was just like, what?"" After that, there was a flurry of Australian media attention, with the media camped outside both the police station and the place he was living at the time. ""It was tough to deal with, seeing my name get dragged through the mud, really, and seeing that I was made out to be a thug, which I'm not,"" he said. ""Everybody who's ever known us knows that's not the case."" James Stannard says he still suffers from vertigo after the incident James Stannard had a fractured skull after the fight and retired from rugby in June. He told the media following the case that he still suffered from vertigo after the altercation and was unhappy with the verdict - maintaining he didn't throw a punch on the night. Sam Oliver says he hopes both of them can move on with their lives. ""I just wish him all the best in his life. ""He was drunk, it won't reflect who he is as a person when he's sober, so I wish him all the best. He wants to move on with his life and I want to move on with mine. That's it."" The 23-year-old is coming back to the UK at the end of this week - and is not keen on a return to Australia. ""I think I just want to stay home for a while,"" he says.

"Grenfell Tower is now covered in a white sheeting Five people who lost relatives in the Grenfell Tower fire are to sit on a commission to decide the long-term future of the west London site. Survivors of the June 2017 blaze and local residents will also help devise ""the most fitting and appropriate way"" to memorialise the 72 victims. The panel's 10 representatives will be led by an independent chairperson. Among their tasks will be to decide on the design of any memorial and how the site should be owned and managed. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission has been structured ""to ensure the voice of the bereaved carries the most weight"". Views of people in the local area will also be sought through a consultation process. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? The government says the purpose of the community panel is to decide ""what happens to the Grenfell Tower site in the future, assumed to be a fitting memorial to remember those who lost their lives"". Adel Chaoui from survivor's group Grenfell United said: ""Creating a fitting memorial on the Grenfell tower site is a momentous task"". He said the panel would need to remember the ""lives lost, ensure what happened is never forgotten and be something this community can hold in their hearts for generations to come"". The announcement on who would be included came as it was revealed that more than 1,200 people affected by the Grenfell Tower fire received mental health treatment in the year following the fire. Central and North West London NHS Trust said a total of 1,108 people had therapy for trauma-related conditions or complex grief, while another 126 people with long-term mental health problems reported worsened condition. The ""vast majority"" of patients are still receiving help, while a further 200 people with complex psychological and social issues are receiving support ahead of therapy. Meanwhile, at theGrenfell Tower public inquiry,,externala fire commander became emotional as he recalled the dedication of the rescue crews on the night. Patrick Goldbourne, who helped marshal missions up the block, explained that, from experience of other blazes, firefighters often find people shutting themselves away in small spaces to escape the flames - so rescue crews cannot overlook any possibility. He said: ""Crews rescue people in fridges, cupboards, all kinds of places they find survivable. We would not stop until we searched every single room, every single cupboard, every single door, until we're satisfied we've got everybody."" He paused for several moments and wiped a tear from his eye before adding: ""It's painful we lost 72 people that evening but we were never going to give up on them."" What happened at Grenfell Tower?

"A study commissioned by the Catholic Church in Germany says clerics abused thousands of children over a 70-year period More than 3,600 children in Germany were assaulted by Roman Catholic priests between 1946 and 2014, a leaked report has revealed. The study was commissioned by the Church itself, and was due to be published on 25 September. According to the report,some 1,670 clergymen in Germany committed some form of sex attack on 3,677 minors, German outlet Spiegel Online reported,external. A Church spokesman said it was ""dismayed and ashamed"" by the findings. The report is the latest in a long series of revelations that have uncovered decades of sex abuse by Roman Catholic priests around the world. Sex abuse and the Catholic Church explained According to the new study, only 38% of the alleged perpetrators were prosecuted with most facing only minor disciplinary procedures, German media said. About one in six cases involved rape. Most of the victims were boys, and more than half were aged 13 or younger. Predatory clerics were often moved to new communities, where no warning was issued about their actions. The study was compiled by three German universities, using 38,000 documents from 27 German dioceses. Its authors said the true extent of the abuse may be even greater, as some records were ""destroyed or manipulated"". ""We know the extent of the sexual abuse that has been demonstrated by the study. We are dismayed and ashamed by it,"" said Bishop Stephan Ackermann, a spokesman for the German Bishops' Conference which commissioned the report. He said the aim of the study was to shed light on ""this dark side of our Church, for the sake of those affected, but also for us ourselves to see the errors and to do everything to prevent them from being repeated"". ""I stress that the study is a measure that we owe not only to the Church but first and foremost, to those affected,"" the bishop added. This video can not be played Pope Francis and Irish PM Leo Varadkar spoke out on the abuse last month Bishop Ackermann said the report had been leaked to the press before the Church itself had seen it. He said the Church had planned to provide counselling helplines for people affected by its contents. The Vatican did not immediately respond to Spiegel's account of the report. But elsewhere on Wednesday, Pope Francis summoned Catholic bishops to the Vatican for a discussion on how to protect children in February next year. The damning German study is the latest in a series of blows to the Roman Catholic Church. Claims of clerical sex abuse have been levelled around the world, and with them allegations that Church leaders hushed up or ignored the wrongdoing. Pope faces twin battle in Church split over sexual abuse Pope keeps silent on abuse claim letter Pope Francis was caught up in the scandal last month, after a former Vatican diplomat accused him of ignoring allegations against a US cardinal for five years. The Pope's supporters vehemently question the credibility of this accusation, which the pontiff has refused to respond to. In August, the Pope condemned the ""atrocities"" of child sex abuse in a letterto the world's 1.2bn Roman Catholics. It came after a grand jury report detailed seven decades of abuse in the US state of Pennsylvania. The investigation found more than 1,000 children had been abused by 300 priests there. It found evidence of systematic cover-ups by the Church.

"Aysha Frade was described as ""a highly regarded and loved"" member of staff at DLD College A victim of the 2017 Westminster terror attack was ""completely unaware"" of the vehicle speeding towards her, an inquest into the attack has heard. Khalid Masood ran down and killed four people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a policeman to death. Mother-of-two Aysha Frade was thrown 17m into the path of an oncoming bus after being hit by Masood. The court heard Ms Frade, on her way to pick up her children from school, was looking at her phone when she was hit. Those killed in the attack on 22 March last year were Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Ms Frade, 44, Andreea Cristea, 31, and Keith Palmer, 48. Masood was shot dead at the scene by armed police officers. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Westminster attack: What happened Westminster inquest: Day two CCTV footage of the moment the car hit Ms Frade, who worked as a PA at independent sixth-form DLD College London, was shown during the third day of the inquest. It showed her being thrown into the air and propelled forwards under the rear side of the bus. Ms Frade's husband and two sisters closed their eyes as the footage was played. Ms Frade, who did not turn around before being hit, was seen falling under the rear wheel of the bus, which was seen to brake. The footage subsequently captured a man banging on the side of the bus and someone else getting off it and approaching Ms Frade. The court heard Ms Frade's husband called her phone shortly after she had been hit. A bystander answered. ""There's been a terrible accident,"" he told him. Witness Rob Lyon had been in London for an interview and was crossing the bridge with two colleagues. He told the court one colleague had shouted ""get out of the way"" and how he then ""heard a crunch sound"" and ""very high revving of an engine"". He described seeing ""three people being hit by the car"" before hearing ""noises, bangs, shouts and next thing I remember is being in the road"". He went on: ""Initially I was frozen. I just remember trying to slow the bus down because I could see it was going to run over Aysha. ""I was just completely in shock."" Ms Frade was on her phone when Masood's car hit her from behind One man stood over Ms Frade until a paramedic arrived on a motorcycle around five minutes after she was first hit. The paramedic, who told the court he arrived at the scene two minutes after receiving the relevant call, knew instantly Ms Frade was dead as her condition was ""unequivocal, incompatible with life"". The lawyer for the family said graphic photos and videos had been posted on the internet of her body by those on the bridge, causing ""real distress to the family"". In a 999 call played to the Old Bailey, a man described the aftermath of the attack, saying: ""There's been a serious accident on Westminster Bridge. About four or five people have been run over."" He went on to say there were ""six or seven"" casualties, adding: ""There's actually a woman underneath a bus. ""I think she's dead. I think she's dead."" A police officer broke down in tears as she gave evidence about the incident. PC Kirsty Bambrough had been deployed to the bridge that day and was involved in securing the scene around Ms Frade. She went through the victim's bag and found a letter from her children's school. She contacted the school to tell them what happened. When it was put to PC Bambrough that she had seen ""horrific injuries"" suffered by Ms Frade, she agreed and started crying. Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives The inquest also watched CCTV footage of Ms Cristea, an interior designer from Romania, walking towards the bridge with her boyfriend. She took a photo on the bridge moments before the attack. Footage showed Masood's Hyundai hitting pedestrians, including Ms Cristea. The impact threw her over the wall of the bridge into the river below, the court heard. A 999 call was played to the court, in which a man was heard saying there was ""a woman in the water drowning"". By Helena Lee, BBC News correspondent, at the Old Bailey There were more tears in court on day three of the inquest as last year's events were relived. Ms Frade's husband John and her two sisters decided to stay in court for the graphic footage of her death - but they didn't watch. Instead, with bowed heads and eyes closed, often wiping away tears, they listened as the hearing was taken through the moment she was killed. Ms Frade's family also listened to evidence from those who tried to help her. PC Kirsty Bambrough came to court in her police uniform to give evidence. She spoke quietly in the witness box and then broke down in tears as she remembered seeing Ms Frade's injuries. After giving her evidence, she walked past Ms Frade's family. They smiled at her and mouthed: ""Thank you."" Earlier, the inquest heard how Mr Rhodes was taken in an ambulance to Kings College Hospital in south London after also being hit during the attack. Consultant Dr Simon Calvert told the inquest he considered surgery for Mr Rhodes but concluded that his injuries were ""likely to be unsurvivable"". The retired window cleaner was transferred to intensive care and died the following evening. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows Kurt and Melissa Cochran moments before Westminster attack The inquest is set to last about five weeks. A separate inquest into the death of Masood will be held but only once the one into his victims' deaths has concluded. The coroner is expected to examine Masood's background, police records, and look into the fact that he briefly featured in MI5 investigations in 2009 and 2010. The absence of armed officers at the scene will also be examined.

"The drawing dates back 73,000 years Scientists say they have discovered humanity's oldest known drawing on a small fragment of rock in South Africa. The drawing is about 73,000 years old, and shows cross-hatch lines sketched onto stone with red ochre pigment. Scientists discovered the small fragment of the drawing - which some say looks a bit like a hashtag - in Blombos Cave on the southern coast. The find is ""a prime indicator of modern cognition"" in our species, the report says. While scientists have found older engravings around the world,research published on Wednesday in the journal Nature,externalsays the lines on this stone mark the first abstract drawing. The article says the ancient artist used an ""ochre crayon"" to etch it onto the stone. Scientists found the stone fragment in Blombos Cave, 300 kilometres (185 miles) east of Cape Town Humanity has used ochre, a clay earth pigment, for at least 285,000 years. The drawing was ""probably more complex"" in its entirety, archaeologist Christopher Henshilwood told Reuters. ""The abrupt termination of all lines on the fragment edges indicates that the pattern originally extended over a larger surface,"" he said. Ancient 'paint factory' unearthed Neanderthals were capable of making art Traces found of 'world's oldest cheese' Egyptian mummification 'recipe' revealed Mr Henshilwood works at Norway's University of Bergen and South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand and led the research into the drawing. He told Reuters that while the team would be ""hesitant to call it art"", it almost definitely had ""some meaning to the maker"". There have been numerous other artefacts found in Blombos Cave, 300 kilometres (185 miles) east of Cape Town, including beads covered in red ochre, engraved ochre fragments, and a paint-making kit dating back around 100,000 years. Modern man, known as homo sapiens, is first known to have appeared more than 315,000 years ago in what is now Africa.

"The future management of the Irish border is one of three main priorities in UK-EU Brexit talks A hard border on the island of Ireland can be avoided by using ""established"" technology and ""modifying"" existing arrangements, Brexiteer Tory MPs say. The European Research Group called for streamlined customs checks and closer working between Belfast and Dublin to allay compliance and smuggling fears. The Democratic Unionist Party welcomed the ""positive and timely"" report but Sinn Fein said it was ""pure fantasy"". The EU has insisted on a ""backstop"" to ensure the single market is protected. Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a return to physical checks at the Northern Ireland border, but have yet to agree how this can be achieved. Downing Street said it had looked at the border issue for nearly two years and the prime minister's Chequers blueprint - which envisages a free trade zone for goods moving between the UK and the EU backed up by a ""facilitated customs arrangement"" - was the ""only credible and negotiable option"". And Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney said the proposals were an ""unworkable distraction"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The ERG's answer to the problem of the Irish border seemed to be that ""there isn't really a problem"", the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said. John Campbell: Assessing the border plan Reality Check: A plan to unlock the Irish border problem Brexiteers discuss leadership challenge The group was citing the example of the ""invisible border"" between Norway and Sweden as a precedent for how post-Brexit arrangements might work, he added. Speaking at the launch of the ERG's report in London, former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Patterson said he and other MPs were trying to help the European Union and Theresa May by ""giving an answer"" to a problem which has risked derailing the Brexit process. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? He insisted there was ""absolutely nothing new"" in what the group was proposing because the solutions already exist to deliver ""an ordered border"". There was already, he argued, a tax, VAT, excise and currency border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland which was policed effectively by ""administrative and technical tools"". Please upgrade your browser Read the full glossary here This should continue after Brexit, he said, supplemented by a range of mechanisms to ensure new customs checks are conducted away from the border, such as trusted trader schemes. ""We absolutely believe there is no need for new physical infrastructure at the border and it can be handled by current means,"" he said. Reality Check: How open are EU borders for trade? At-a-glance: The UK Brexit plan The report acknowledges a range of new checks will be needed on goods passing across the 310 mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit, including extra customs declarations and declarations of origin as well as sanitary, phytosanitary and product compliance procedures. Among the proposals put forward in the document to deal with these are: Extra customs declarations should be incorporated into existing online system of VAT returns Simplified customs procedures to deal with the majority of cross-border trade Trusted trader-type schemes for large companies Equivalence of UK and EU regulations for agricultural produce Declaring the island of Ireland a Common Biosecurity Zone The report concluded: ""The proposals can be realised within the existing legal and operational frameworks of the UK and EU, based on the mutual trust on which regular trade depends. ""They do nothing to alter the constitutional position of Northern Ireland and do not violate the principle of consent of the enshrined in the Belfast Agreement."" Are Tory MPs set to move against Theresa May? There is massive frustration with her leadership, her position on Chequers and the way her proposals tuck the UK closely into the EU in perpetuity. And yes, there are some MPs who want to see her gone immediately. However senior voices in the European Research Group - yes them - are adamant that it is not the time to try to oust the PM. It would be ""stupid"", one told me last night. Imagine in these critical weeks of the Brexit negotiations if the UK started to try to change the prime minister. Right now those jostling to remove her know they don't have any guarantees they would have the numbers to force her out, even though they may well be able to pull together enough MPs to submit letters to the chair of 1922 committee to trigger a contest. Read Laura's blog John Campbell, the BBC's Northern Ireland business and economics editor, said the document offered more detail than before and put forward a number of ""plausible technocratic solutions"". But he said they placed a lot of store on the EU agreeing to mutual recognition of standards and the UK having access to its VAT system - which was far from guaranteed. The Democratic Unionist Party, whose support Theresa May relies on for her majority in Westminster, said the proposals were ""positive and timely"" and the issue should not be an impediment to a wider Brexit deal. Two former Northern Ireland secretaries were among Tory MPs endorsing the proposals But Sinn Fein said there was no reference to the civil rights of those living on both sides of the border nor any recognition of the fact that Northern Ireland had voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum. ""These proposals are a rehash of the unacceptable and already rejected and failed notion that a technological border can be put imposed post Brexit,"" said South Down MP Chris Hazzard. The CBI said the proposals were ""superficial"", while shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said what was needed was a UK-wide solution, which would see the whole country stay in some form of customs union. ""Ireland cannot pay the price of Theresa May's failed negotiating strategy,"" he said on a visit to Belfast. ""The solemn commitment to no hard border in Northern Ireland is really important and no-one should be casual about that."" At the event, Tory MPs opposed to Theresa May's Chequers blueprint have denied plotting against her, after it emerged the issue of her future was discussed openly by Tory MPs at a meeting on Tuesday night. ""We've got a very good prime minister,"" former Brexit Secretary David Davis said. ""I disagree with her on one issue, it's this issue. She should stay in place because we need stability, and we need decent government as the backdrop for what we're doing in the coming next six months.""

Witness Rob Lyon had been in London for an interview and was crossing the bridge with two colleagues. He told the court one colleague had shouted ""get out of the way"" and how he then ""heard a crunch sound"" and ""very high revving of an engine"". He described seeing ""three people being hit by the car"" before hearing ""noises, bangs, shouts and next thing I remember is being in the road"". He went on: ""Initially I was frozen. I just remember trying to slow the bus down because I could see it was going to run over Aysha. ""I was just completely in shock."" Ms Frade was on her phone when Masood's car hit her from behind One man stood over Ms Frade until a paramedic arrived on a motorcycle around five minutes after she was first hit. The paramedic, who told the court he arrived at the scene two minutes after receiving the relevant call, knew instantly Ms Frade was dead as her condition was ""unequivocal, incompatible with life"". The lawyer for the family said graphic photos and videos had been posted on the internet of her body by those on the bridge, causing ""real distress to the family"". In a 999 call played to the Old Bailey, a man described the aftermath of the attack, saying: ""There's been a serious accident on Westminster Bridge. About four or five people have been run over."" He went on to say there were ""six or seven"" casualties, adding: ""There's actually a woman underneath a bus. ""I think she's dead. I think she's dead."" A police officer broke down in tears as she gave evidence about the incident. PC Kirsty Bambrough had been deployed to the bridge that day and was involved in securing the scene around Ms Frade. She went through the victim's bag and found a letter from her children's school. She contacted the school to tell them what happened. When it was put to PC Bambrough that she had seen ""horrific injuries"" suffered by Ms Frade, she agreed and started crying. Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives The inquest also watched CCTV footage of Ms Cristea, an interior designer from Romania, walking towards the bridge with her boyfriend. She took a photo on the bridge moments before the attack. Footage showed Masood's Hyundai hitting pedestrians, including Ms Cristea. The impact threw her over the wall of the bridge into the river below, the court heard. A 999 call was played to the court, in which a man was heard saying there was ""a woman in the water drowning"". By Helena Lee, BBC News correspondent, at the Old Bailey There were more tears in court on day three of the inquest as last year's events were relived. Ms Frade's husband John and her two sisters decided to stay in court for the graphic footage of her death - but they didn't watch. Instead, with bowed heads and eyes closed, often wiping away tears, they listened as the hearing was taken through the moment she was killed. Ms Frade's family also listened to evidence from those who tried to help her. PC Kirsty Bambrough came to court in her police uniform to give evidence. She spoke quietly in the witness box and then broke down in tears as she remembered seeing Ms Frade's injuries. After giving her evidence, she walked past Ms Frade's family. They smiled at her and mouthed: ""Thank you."" Earlier, the inquest heard how Mr Rhodes was taken in an ambulance to Kings College Hospital in south London after also being hit during the attack. Consultant Dr Simon Calvert told the inquest he considered surgery for Mr Rhodes but concluded that his injuries were ""likely to be unsurvivable"". The retired window cleaner was transferred to intensive care and died the following evening. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows Kurt and Melissa Cochran moments before Westminster attack The inquest is set to last about five weeks. A separate inquest into the death of Masood will be held but only once the one into his victims' deaths has concluded. The coroner is expected to examine Masood's background, police records, and look into the fact that he briefly featured in MI5 investigations in 2009 and 2010. The absence of armed officers at the scene will also be examined.

"Land's End now has an officially recognised apostrophe. Cornwall Council has voted to add an official apostrophe to ""Land's End"". Clarification on the punctuation was needed because of proposed changes to electoral boundaries that left some council ward areas needing new names. A debate on ward names lasted 90 minutes, and included grammatical input from a Cornish history expert. Councillors heard Land's End has been spelled with the apostrophe in two different places or not at all, which has led to the uncertainty. More on this story and other news from around Devon and Cornwall Businesses in the area are currently using apostrophes in two different places, or not at all. The vote to officially add the apostrophe was proposed by Councillor Sue James, and received unanimous support from the council, said theLocal Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Land's End is the most westerly point in England, and a popular tourist attraction. If you type ""Land's End"" into Google, it currently asks: ""Did you mean Lands End"", and businesses in the area have a variety of spellings, including ""Lands' End"". Ms James, who represents St Just in Penwith, said she was not an expert on apostrophes but had consulted with Craig Weatherhill, a historian who has published books on west Cornwall. She explained he had agreed that Land's End should have an apostrophe and asked for the new divisions for the area to have one.

"Royal Bank of Scotland's chairman has admitted it is ""unlikely"" the government will get back all the Â£45.5bn pumped in to the bank. Sir Howard Davies said restructuring costs, losses on loans and selling businesses meant RBS was valued at less than taxpayers paid for their stake. ""The focus on survival over a decade has had a cost,"" Sir Howard said. ""The bank was rescued to save the UK financial system from collapse, not as a financial investment,"" he said. He said in a lecture looking back on the decade since the financial crisis that the government is ""unlikely to recoup its investment in full"". Explaining why, he said the bank had lost Â£130bn over the 10 years since it was rescued - about four-and-a-half times the bank's current stock market value - and incurred restructuring costs of Â£15bn. The bank had been required to meet state aid requirements from the European Commission by selling off businesses which ""materially reduced RBS's market value"", Sir Howard said. Workers are Â£800 a year poorer post-crisis Carney warns against complacency Lehman gamble paid out for brave investors Hammond: Financial crisis 'shock' continues It sold commodities business Sempra, a stake in payments system Worldpay, and insurance company Direct Line. It was also required to sell a 5% share of small business lending by spinning off bank branches, but last year, the Commissionaccepted a plan to free the bank from its obligation to sell its Williams & Glyn divisionin return for alternative remedies. ""It seems clear that, in aggregate, the cost of these remedies to the bank and its shareholders was very much greater than could reasonably have been forecast at the time,"" said Sir Howard. The Â£45,5bn of public money was a ""massive commitment"", he said, and RBS had now gone from being the biggest bank in the world to the 29th largest as it scaled back its business. The taxpayer stake has been cut from just over 80% to 62.4% RBS reports first profit in 10 years RBS to pay first dividend in 10 years The bank's shares are trading at about 245p and Sir Howard said the government's stake could fall further if the bank was able to use some of its surplus capital to buy back shares. ""A smaller, less risky bank does not need the size of capital base it had in the past,"" said Sir Howard. In November 2017, the government said it aimed to sell Â£15bn of RBS shares by 2023, selling off Â£3bn a year over five years. A stake was sold in June this year at 271p a share, while in 2015, a 5.4% stake was sold at a price of 330p a share.

"Chikayzea Flanders was told he would have to cut off his dreadlocks or face suspension A 12-year-old boy who was banned from a west London school because of his dreadlocks has been told he can return without having to cut his hair. Former Fulham Boys School pupil Chikayzea Flanders was told he would have to cut off his dreadlocks or face suspensionlast year. His mother, Tuesday Flanders, took the school to court, calling the demand an attack on her Rastafarian religion. The family have now reached an agreement with Fulham Boys School. Chikayzea, who has since moved to a new school, is welcome to return ""provided that his dreadlocks are tied up so that they do not touch the top of his collar, or covered with a cloth of colour to be agreed by the school"". Ms Flanders said: ""As parents we place our trust in schools and teachers to help mould our children's lives through education. ""But that should never place restrictions on their identity or their ability to express their religious beliefs."" Fulham Boys School's ban on dreadlocks lead to protests last year Fulham Boys School head teacher Alun Ebenezer said the school ""had dealt with the complaint through our published complaints procedure"". The school's strict uniform and appearance policy ""remains in place as it protects the distinctive ethos of the Fulham Boys School,"" he added. Mr Ebenezer said: ""Nearly 20% of our boys come from private schools and rub shoulders with the 40% of boys from socially deprived backgrounds. ""Our uniform policy means you don't know whose parents earn millions of pounds and who comes from an area with real social deprivation. It shows that only character matters and raises aspiration."" A Governors' Complaints Resolution Committee recommended that the school should review its uniform and appearance policy against applicable legislation. David Isaac, chair at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, who helped fund legal action against Fulham Boys School, said: ""We are pleased that the school has acknowledged their failings in this instance and has agreed to revise its policies."" The County Court ordered the school to pay Chikayzea and his mother a settlement and cover the litigation costs, following the agreement.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Hands on with new iPhone XS and XS Max Apple has updated its iPhone X handset with three more powerful models, two of which are larger than before. The iPhone XS Max has a 6.5in (16.5cm) display. The iPhone XS has the same 5.8in-sized component as the original. The iPhone XR's screen is 6.1in but is lower quality. A new smartwatch was also launched with an added fall-detection function. There had been concerns that the relatively high Â£999 entry price of iPhone X would limit its appeal. But Applesaid it had consistently proven more popular than either of the lower-priced iPhone 8 models,external. Market research firms suggest it also outsold rival companies' flagship devices. This video can not be played WATCH: Apple's event in 90 seconds That helped propel Apple to become the world's first company with a market capitalisation above $1tn (Â£768bn). However, China's Huawei still managed to overtake it in terms of overall smartphone market share in the April-to-June quarter, putting Apple into third place. ""Huawei was able to overtake it because Apple is not playing in the mid and low ends of the market,"" commented Francisco Jeronimo from IDC. ""But Apple is very well positioned in the premium segment, and we don't expect that to change over the next 18 months."" The iPhone XS and XS Max go on sale on 21 September, while the XR will follow in October The XS Max will become the most expensive handset Apple has sold to date, with its price ranging from Â£1,099 to Â£1,449 depending on its amount of storage. The XS will match the original X's Â£999-Â£1,349 cost, while the XR will be Â£749-Â£899. Apple has not, however, included a headphone dongle this time round, so owners of wired headphones will need to factor in an additional Â£9 charge to add one. Apple highlighted that the iPhone XS Max's display was significantly larger than the 5.5in display of the old iPhone 8 Plus despite the two handsets being similar in size. ""Even if the screen on the iPhone X last year was larger some people who were on the Plus models missed the feel of a larger device which is exactly what the Max is addressing,"" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at the consultancy Creative Strategies. The iPhone XR also has a bigger screen but uses LCD (liquid crystal display) rather than the OLED (organic light-emitting diode) technology found in the more expensive models. This will mean black appears less deep and its colours appear to have less contrast. The iPhone XR is offered in a range of colours In addition, its chassis is made from aluminium rather than steel, which means it is likely to be less damage-resistant. However, unlike the more expensive models it comes in six different colours. Analysts suggest the wider range may help encourage iPhone owners who did not upgrade last year to do so this generation. ""Retention has become very high for both Android and iOS - switching is largely a thing of the past,"" suggested analysts at UBS. ""Put simply, the replacement for iPhone is iPhone, the only question is when - and the when is driven in large part by form factor, namely the screen."" Apple launch: Bigger! Faster! Pricier! Innovative? Apple removes apps that harvested data Apple self-driving car in minor crash The latest phones feature a fresh processor - the A12 Bionic. It is the firm's first to feature seven nanometre transistor technology, which should aid energy efficiency and computation speeds. Its inclusion means the iPhone XS will last about 30 minutes longer on a battery charge than the X, Apple suggested. The firm also said that its Face ID system would now work faster than before and it demoed several apps, showing off its augmented reality prowess. Allow Twitter content?

Analysts, though, think sales are in the region of 50 million. Minuscule compared to the iPhone, but this is a device that's clearly on the up. It began life as a fitness device, but this update will, and this isn't marketing puff, help people stay alive. Fall detection, and the ability to conduct an ECG to measure heart health, are both major new features that the healthcare industry is tremendously excited about. I haven't had a chance to try it yet, and one concern for me would be false positives - it thinking I've fallen over when I'm perfectly fine. And, if this is going to be marketed at elderly consumers, Apple's boast of packing the interface with more ""complications"" will make it, well, more complicated. But make no mistake. With US regulator approval - the first device of its kind to be given that clearance - insurance companies will be ordering these by the bucketload. The world is aging, and access to health is getting more expensive. It's not often a Silicon Valley company creates a product with the over-60s firmly in mind.

"Sam Oliver, 23, from Newcastle Sam Oliver should have spent the last six months backpacking around Australia. But after a drunken late-night fight in Sydney, he found himself at the centre of a media storm and being accused of knocking out former Rugby Sevens captain James Stannard. On Wednesday, after his lawyers argued he acted in self-defence, he wasfound not guilty of assault. The 23-year-old, from Newcastle, told Radio 1 Newsbeat he wishes none of it had happened. ""To go back now, I would take the black eye and still go away. I wish I could avoid the whole thing,"" he said. ""It's not something that you would ever think that would happen to you."" The kebab shop in Sydney where the altercation happened It all began in March, after he'd been out for drinks with friends. Sam Oliver and his lawyers said he had been waiting outside a kebab shop when James Stannard had sworn at him and used an anti-British expletive. ""It was a bit weird, I didn't know who said it,"" said Sam. ""I just said something back being a bit cheeky rather than aggressive really."" It was then he says James Stannard threw the first punch, giving him a black eye. ""I was punched so I reacted pretty much instantly and instinctively and hit him back and then I tried to get away from there,"" he said. It wasn't until after his arrest Sam Oliver was told who he had punched. British tourist Sam Oliver was cleared of assaulting Australian Rugby Sevens star James Stannard ""They said, 'Do you know who it is that you've hit?' And I said, 'no'. ""And he just said, 'Oh it's the captain of our Australian rugby team and you've put him out for the Commonwealth Games'. ""I was just like, what?"" After that, there was a flurry of Australian media attention, with the media camped outside both the police station and the place he was living at the time. ""It was tough to deal with, seeing my name get dragged through the mud, really, and seeing that I was made out to be a thug, which I'm not,"" he said. ""Everybody who's ever known us knows that's not the case."" James Stannard says he still suffers from vertigo after the incident James Stannard had a fractured skull after the fight and retired from rugby in June. He told the media following the case that he still suffered from vertigo after the altercation and was unhappy with the verdict - maintaining he didn't throw a punch on the night. Sam Oliver says he hopes both of them can move on with their lives. ""I just wish him all the best in his life. ""He was drunk, it won't reflect who he is as a person when he's sober, so I wish him all the best. He wants to move on with his life and I want to move on with mine. That's it."" The 23-year-old is coming back to the UK at the end of this week - and is not keen on a return to Australia. ""I think I just want to stay home for a while,"" he says.

"British and French boats collided in the English Channel Talks between the UK and France to end a dispute over scallop fishing in the English Channel have ended without agreement, fishing leaders have said. Crews clashed last month over laws that allow British boats to gather scallops year-round, but place restrictions on French vessels. Both sides had initially agreed on the principles of a deal. The Scottish White Fish Producers Association (SWFPA) said vessels were now free to return to the area. French and UK boats clash in 'scallop war' Scallop wars: Could Brexit calm troubled waters? Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops? Tensions rose over scallop fishing in the Baie de Seine in August when 35 French boats confronted five British craft off the coast of northern France. There were reports of stones and smoke bombs being hurled at UK fishing crews. The SWFPA said on Wednesday evening: ""So disappointing for everyone; so near but yet so far. ""A period of understanding and acceptance is required at this time. No-one wants to see conflict on the high seas. Hopefully lessons learned by all."" Allow Twitter content?

"Tesco mothballed its Chatteris store three years ago Tesco is expected to reveal a new brand next week at a store in Cambridgeshire that was mothballed three years ago. Some ""exciting news"" has been promised by the UK's biggest supermarket chain next Wednesday at a media event in Chatteris. The outlet is expected to be named Jack's, the first of a new chain of discount stores aimed at countering the rise of Lidl and Aldi. The two German chains now have just over 13% of the UK grocery market. That is less than half the share claimed by Tesco, but it continues to be outpaced by double-digit growth at both Aldi and Lidl. Chatteris may have been chosen as the location for the first Jack's as it has an empty Tesco store waiting to be brought back to life. Half the building is now a Poundstretcher store, leaving the remaining 26,500 sq ft ready for Tesco's second foray into the discount darkness after a failed attempt in the 1980s with its Victor Value brand. Creating a new brand is a very bold move and not without its risks, says Natalie Berg of NBK Retail: ""It's no easy feat to establish in a crowded and cut-throat market, but it's now so competitive that retailers are being forced to think outside the box. ""The only way to compete with the discounters is by becoming one."" Setting up Jack's - said to be named after Jack Cohen, who founded a grocer in 1919 that later became Tesco - is also an admission that the discounters are now credible competitors, Ms Berg says. Aldi and Lidl have also shown consumers that they do not have to sacrifice quality in their search for low prices, she adds - and are willing to put up with less product choice and worse service. The ghost Tesco stores Tesco buys Booker for Â£3.7bn It remains unclear how many Jack's stores Tesco plans to open. Clive Black at Shore Capital says the company may want to rebrand between 50 and 100 of its ""problem"" Metro stores, which are smaller than out-of-town supermarkets but larger than its Express convenience chain. ""Quite where Jack's end up though, across Tesco's network, remains to be seen; it would be a lot of effort for 100 small stores,"" he notes. ""Jack's, if we are correct, also represents Tesco firmly moving on, coming out of 'fix' mode and being more creative, innovative and ... on the front foot."" Lidl's sales growth is outpacing that of Tesco Analysts at Bernstein think Tesco will not directly copy the Aldi/Lidl model but opt for a ""cross over between a cash and carry and a discounter"", with at least 20 stores to be announced initially. ""Tesco has about 3,400 stores in the UK: we would expect some unused sites, a collection of Metro stores and some smaller supermarkets to be converted,"" they said. ""If successful, this new retail format is likely to put material pressure on all other UK retailers."" Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein adds that Tesco is perhaps unique in having ""the scale and power to develop such an innovation"". The arrival of Jack's is just one of several tectonic shifts taking place in Britain's ultra-competitive grocery market. Sainsbury's, the second-largest supermarket chain, shocked the industry in late April byannouncing a merger with the struggling Walmart-owned Asda. Combining the two chains would give it just over 30% of the market - more than Tesco's - but the competition watchdog is yet to give its approval. Sainsbury closed its 16 Netto stores in the UK two years ago Sainsbury's had already bolstered its position by buying the Argos chain in 2016 and the ""Sasda"" merger was partly a reaction toTesco's Â£3.7bn takeover of Booker, the UK's largest food wholesaler which also owns the Premier, Budgens and Londis convenience store brands. That combination got the final nod from the Competition and Markets Authority in December 2017. Lest we forget Sainsbury's dipped its toe in the discount pool four years ago in a joint venture with Denmark's Dansk Supermarked to revive the Netto discount brand. The difficulty and cost of expanding was blamed for the closure of its 16 stores in 2016. Morrisons, the smallest of the ""big four"" supermarkets, struck a deal in February 2016 tosupply groceries to Amazon's UK customers. That relationship has sparked speculation that the US online giant could buy the Bradford-based grocer, whose market value is Â£6.3bn - something of a rounding error for a company whose value recently rose just above $1 trillion. However, Ms Berg thinks Jeff Bezos's company could have its eyes on a far bigger prize in the form of Tesco - even if it is worth almost four times as much as Morrisons. She is convinced Amazon will have acquired a UK supermarket within two years to make it a real player in UK food and apply what it has learned following the company's$13.7bn takeover of upmarket US retailer Whole Foods last year. If Amazon does decide to wade into the UK grocery war, it may take more than the launch of a discount chain to save the likes of Tesco.

"This video can not be played Labour's deputy leader tells Today how he lost seven stone (44.5kg) Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has revealed he was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes but has ""reversed"" the condition through diet and exercise. He has now come off medication after losing seven stone (44.5kg) since last summer. He cut out junk food, starchy carbohydrates and refined sugar and took up cycling and running. The MP has vowed to launch a crusade against diabetes if Labour wins power at the next election. ""I feel great. I feel absolutely fantastic. Chilled out, I feel like my IQ has gone up. I feel younger. It's a great feeling,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. England facing 'changing health needs' Heart disease and strokes 'set to surge' Rise in type 2 diabetes in under-25s He said he developed diabetes through being ""overweight, deeply unfit, [and] addicted to sugar and fast foods,"" and explained how he had ""reversed"" the condition, inan article for the Daily Express,external. The West Bromwich MP - once nicknamed ""Tommy two dinners"" - told Today he had ""battled weight since my early 20s"". ""I kept putting on pounds and then I was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes. Like a lot of middle-aged men, I immediately went into denial. My condition was so frightening, I didn't begin to understand it. I just pretended I didn't have it. ""And then I hit 22 stone - and I have a young daughter. I kept reading biographies of Labour politicians who died in their 50s and I knew I had to sort it out"". Mr Watson says he reached 22 stone before he began his diet After researching the subject, he started a diet by ""giving up sugar"" and cut out beer and curry. He then began to exercise, starting with walking then cycling, running, boxing and weight-training. About four million people in the UK have diabetes, with the condition accounting for 10% of all NHS spending. Poor diet and a lack of exercise mean it's possible a million more people in this country could be diagnosed with diabetes over the next 20 years,according to a report by Public Health England. The large majority of cases - 90% - are caused by type-2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity and poor health choices. The other 10% are type-1 diabetes, a disease of the immune system that has nothing to do with lifestyle choices and is neither preventable nor reversible. Type-2 diabetes is a chronic condition associated with obesity and family history and is more likely to be diagnosed in older people. It's more common than type-1 diabetes. It is caused by problems with controlling blood sugar levels - either because the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or if a body's cells do not react to insulin as they should. The condition is treated by medication or controlling a person's diet. Diabetes UK offers advice,externalon preventing and coping with type-2 diabetes. The changes that could prevent diabetes Mr Watson has vowed to set up an independent, cross-party commission to investigate ways of preventing the condition if Labour wins power, with the aim of eliminating the estimated rise in cases within five years. ""I think a lot of people feel shame when they are diagnosed with it because you kind of know, you get warning signs,"" he told Today. ""But for many millions of people, it's an entirely preventable and reversible condition"" with ""the right nutrition and exercise"". ""It is a public health scandal that so many millions of people are having to suffer this condition when they don't have to,"" he added. According to a World Health Organization report, the UK is the third fattest among 53 countries in Europe, with heavy drinking a key cause. The United Nations body found 27.8% of adults in the UK are obese compared with 32.1% of people in Turkey and 28.9% in Malta. Those whose body mass index is at least 30 are deemed to be obese.

"Viktor Orban launched an impassioned defence on Tuesday - but it was not enough The European Parliament has voted to pursue unprecedented disciplinary action against Hungary over alleged breaches of the EU's core values. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government has been accused of attacks on the media, minorities, and the rule of law - charges which he denies. More than two-thirds of MEPs backed the censure motion - the first such vote against a member state under EU rules. If also approved by national leaders, Hungary could face punitive measures. The ultimate sanction, the suspension of Hungary's voting rights, is unlikely as Poland is likely to veto any such move. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest says Mr Orban appears increasingly isolated among European conservatives but is being applauded by nationalist parties. Since coming to power, Mr Orban's government has taken a hardline stance against immigration. It introduced a law which made it a criminal offence for lawyers and activists to help asylum seekers, under the banner of ""facilitating illegal immigration"". What sanctions can the EU impose on Hungary? In depth - Viktor Orban's Hungary Nationalism in heart of Europe needles EU But there have also been reports of pressure being put on the courts and the electoral system, and of widespread corruption. After the vote, the European Parliament said it was also concerned about: The constitutional and electoral system Privacy and data protection Freedom of expression and religion Academic freedom and freedom of association Equal rights, particularly for refugees and minorities such as Roma and Jews Mr Orban addressed the parliament on Tuesday in defence of his government, labelling the threat of censure as a form of ""blackmail"" and an insult to Hungary. Judith Sargentini, author of the report on Hungary, was applauded by many MEPs after the vote He claimed a report by Dutch Greens MEP Judith Sargentini was an ""abuse of power"", and included ""serious factual misrepresentations"". Ms Sargentini's report into Hungary's ruling Fidesz party alleged such actions were ""a clear breach of the values of our union"". Analysis by BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming The opposition to Viktor Orban received a boost last night when Manfred Weber, leader of the European Parliament's centre-right group the European People's Party (EPP), lost patience with his erstwhile ally and announced he would vote to trigger Article 7. But it has created a split within the EPP because Forza Italia, some Bulgarians, a few Germans and assorted others gave their backing to Budapest. Most British Conservative MEPs supported the Hungarian government, arguing that the EU had intruded into purely national matters. They strongly deny it was to secure Hungary's support in the Brexit process or out of admiration for the country's leader. However, this episode might not bother Mr Orban at all, as it boosts his image back home as a scourge of the European establishment. Under an EU rule called Article 7, breaching the union's founding principles can lead to the suspension of a member state's rights as a punitive measure. However, Hungary is currently facing ""preventative"" measures, which the parliament says are designed to avoid sanctions entirely. The BBC Reality Check team has explained the Article 7 process in detail. Broadly, the decision on Hungary will now be referred to the heads of the 28 EU member states to consider. However, because this step has never been taken before, it is not clear what will happen next, or when. Suspension of Hungary's voting rights is the most serious possible consequence - but is considered unlikely. Poland is also facing disciplinary proceedings, launched by the European Commission in December last year. The case has yet to reach the European Parliament. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto reacted angrily to the vote, calling it the ""petty revenge"" of ""pro-immigration"" politicians. Some politicians from other countries also defended Mr Orban's government. Britain's Nigel Farage, a pro-Brexit MEP, wrote that the decision demonstrated ""the authoritarian grip of the EU"".

Anti-Islam Dutch populist Geert Wilders tweeted: ""Hungary is the example for all EU countries and Orban is a hero and deserves the Nobel Prize."" But Ms Sargentini, who wrote the report on Mr Orban's government, said the decision sent an important message that the EU would stand up for citizens' rights. ""Viktor Orban's government has been leading the charge against European values by silencing independent media, replacing critical judges, and putting academia on a leash,"" she said. ""Individuals close to the government have been enriching themselves, their friends and family members at the expense of Hungarian and European taxpayers. The Hungarian people deserve better."" Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto reacted angrily to the vote Amnesty International's expert on human rights in the EU, Berber Biala-Hettinga, hailed the vote as ""historic"". ""The European Parliament rightly stood up for the Hungarian people and for the EU. They made it clear that human rights, the rule of law and democratic values are not up for negotiation,"" she said. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said that he would have voted for the measure if he was an MEP. ""The European Commission is using the tools we have, launching infringement procedures against countries that don't respect EU law.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it did not have any information yet about where and when a post-mortem examination would be carried out. John and Susan Cooper died on Tuesday 21 August Following the deaths, Thomas Cook said it was removing all its customersand flew some holidaymakers back to the UK""as a precaution"".

Egypt couple 'killed by something in room' 'I thought Mum would survive' She said the ""level of hygiene was a disgrace"", with dirty cups, plates, knives and forks. Ms Cope, who was among those who decided to fly home, said her two-week holiday at the hotel had been ""a nightmare"" and five out of seven of her family members were ill during their stay. ""My sister was getting very ill. Finding it hard to breathe, coughing up fluid, very weak and we just thought something's going on here and so contacted Thomas Cook many times."" She said ""about 40 people"" at the hotel were complaining of illness including ""projectile vomiting and diarrhoea"". The couple's daughter has insisted a strange odour in her parents' room had something to do with their deaths Other holidaymakers have told the BBC about theirexperiences with illness during stays at the hotel. Janine Traviss, from Oldham, said she and her partner fell ill with a stomach bug and were ""still recovering"". Chief executive of Thomas Cook, Peter Fankhauser, confirmed 13 customers had food poisoning but were not in a serious condition. Dieter Geiger, general manager at Aqua Magic, said there was no evidence to support an ""increased incidence of illness"" at the hotel, which he dismissed as ""rash speculations"". The couple's daughter, Kelly Ormerod, has insisted a strange odour in her parents' room had something to do with their deaths. However, Egyptian investigatorssaid on Saturday no traces of toxic gas had been detected. Public prosecutor Nabil Sadeq confirmed all the installations were safe and the equipment was functioning without fault. The tourism ministry said a medical examination showed Mr Cooper ""experienced an extreme drop in the blood circulation and a sudden stop of the heart muscle"".

"This video can not be played Protesters shout at Jacob Rees-Mogg's children during protest Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has brushed off a demonstration outside his Westminster home where a protester shouted at his children. A video on the Facebook page of the Class War group shows a man telling one of the Tory MP's children ""your daddy is a horrible person"". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Downing Street and many MPs have strongly criticised the stunt. But Mr Rees-Mogg told LBC: ""I wouldn't get too excited about it."" He added: ""It was a few anarchists who turned up and it wasn't very well organised. It wasn't terribly serious. ""We are a free country. They weren't violent. They aren't admirers of mine. I am in public life and not everybody is going to like me. That is a reality of public life. ""I'd have preferred it if it hadn't happened but I don't want to get it out of perspective. I think much worse things happen to many other people."" Police officers stood between the protesters and the MP during the incident outside his Westminster home. Downing Street said the ""intimidation"" was ""completely unacceptable"". ""No elected member or their family should be subjected to intimidation or abuse in that way,"" said the prime minister's spokesman. On Twitter, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said it was a ""shameful and disgraceful"" episode. ""We are - and must be - better than this,"" he said, adding that he would be praying for Mr Rees-Mogg's family that evening. Also writing on Twitter, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said the children of high-profile politicians should never be regarded as ""fair game"". Allow Twitter content?

Labour's shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman told the BBC's Politics Live the protesters' behaviour was ""abhorrent"". In the Class War video, a protester asked Mr Rees-Mogg how much he paid his family's nanny, and when she too came out on to the street, demanded to know her salary and told her she had ""Stockholm Syndrome"". A subsequent Class War Facebook post said people were getting their ""knickers in a twist"" over the footage, saying the MP's family had come outside after the protesters arrived. The protest is believed to have been staged by veteran anarchist Ian Bone, who has taken part in similar stunts in the past.

"Sakine Cihan was crossing Kingsland High Street in Dalston when she was struck A pedestrian who was knocked down by a cyclist in a suspected hit-and-run last month has died. Sakine Cihan, 56, was crossing Kingsland High Street in Dalston, east London, at about 17:00 BST on 28 August, when she was struck. Police believe Ms Cihan is the first pedestrian in London to die after being hit by an electric bike. The male cyclist initially stopped after falling off his bike, but then fled the scene, police said. A man has been arrested in connection with the investigation and released while inquiries continue. The Met Police said a Specialized electric-assisted mountain bike was found abandoned nearby in Approach Close, Stoke Newington. Police believe Ms Cihan is the first pedestrian in London to die after being hit by an electric bike In August the Department for Transport launched a consultationlooking at whether new offences such as ""death by dangerous cycling"" should be introduced. The proposed changes followed the conviction of cyclist Charlie Alliston who was jailed for 18 months for killing mother-of-two Kim Briggs while riding an illegal racing bike which had no front brakes. Alliston was cleared of manslaughter butfound guilty of causing bodily harm by ""wanton and furious driving"". Under the current law, the offence is the closest thing to dangerous driving a cyclist can be charged with. Department for Transport figures show that 29 pedestrians were killed in collisions involving cyclists between 2007 and 2016 - 0.6% of total pedestrian casualties on UK roads. Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns at national charity Cycling UK, said the statistics showed people who use electric and conventional bikes ""present a minimal danger to others"". ""Given the limitations and current laws governing e-bikes, Cycling UK does not believe there is any reason to suggest their use poses any greater risk to the public than a normal pedal cycle,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Labour's deputy leader tells Today how he lost seven stone (44.5kg) Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has revealed he was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes but has ""reversed"" the condition through diet and exercise. He has now come off medication after losing seven stone (44.5kg) since last summer. He cut out junk food, starchy carbohydrates and refined sugar and took up cycling and running. The MP has vowed to launch a crusade against diabetes if Labour wins power at the next election. ""I feel great. I feel absolutely fantastic. Chilled out, I feel like my IQ has gone up. I feel younger. It's a great feeling,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. England facing 'changing health needs' Heart disease and strokes 'set to surge' Rise in type 2 diabetes in under-25s He said he developed diabetes through being ""overweight, deeply unfit, [and] addicted to sugar and fast foods,"" and explained how he had ""reversed"" the condition, inan article for the Daily Express,external. The West Bromwich MP - once nicknamed ""Tommy two dinners"" - told Today he had ""battled weight since my early 20s"". ""I kept putting on pounds and then I was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes. Like a lot of middle-aged men, I immediately went into denial. My condition was so frightening, I didn't begin to understand it. I just pretended I didn't have it. ""And then I hit 22 stone - and I have a young daughter. I kept reading biographies of Labour politicians who died in their 50s and I knew I had to sort it out"". Mr Watson says he reached 22 stone before he began his diet After researching the subject, he started a diet by ""giving up sugar"" and cut out beer and curry. He then began to exercise, starting with walking then cycling, running, boxing and weight-training. About four million people in the UK have diabetes, with the condition accounting for 10% of all NHS spending. Poor diet and a lack of exercise mean it's possible a million more people in this country could be diagnosed with diabetes over the next 20 years,according to a report by Public Health England. The large majority of cases - 90% - are caused by type-2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity and poor health choices. The other 10% are type-1 diabetes, a disease of the immune system that has nothing to do with lifestyle choices and is neither preventable nor reversible. Type-2 diabetes is a chronic condition associated with obesity and family history and is more likely to be diagnosed in older people. It's more common than type-1 diabetes. It is caused by problems with controlling blood sugar levels - either because the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or if a body's cells do not react to insulin as they should. The condition is treated by medication or controlling a person's diet. Diabetes UK offers advice,externalon preventing and coping with type-2 diabetes. The changes that could prevent diabetes Mr Watson has vowed to set up an independent, cross-party commission to investigate ways of preventing the condition if Labour wins power, with the aim of eliminating the estimated rise in cases within five years. ""I think a lot of people feel shame when they are diagnosed with it because you kind of know, you get warning signs,"" he told Today. ""But for many millions of people, it's an entirely preventable and reversible condition"" with ""the right nutrition and exercise"". ""It is a public health scandal that so many millions of people are having to suffer this condition when they don't have to,"" he added. According to a World Health Organization report, the UK is the third fattest among 53 countries in Europe, with heavy drinking a key cause. The United Nations body found 27.8% of adults in the UK are obese compared with 32.1% of people in Turkey and 28.9% in Malta. Those whose body mass index is at least 30 are deemed to be obese.

"This video can not be played Gleneagles jewel heist caught on CCTV A man has been convicted of a Â£500,000 armed jewellery heist at Gleneagles Hotel. Richard Fleming, 42, used hammers, a pistol and a machete during the raid last June. A jury at the High Court in Edinburgh found Fleming, from London, guilty of assault and armed robbery at the five-star Perthshire resort. Another man - Liam Richardson, 30, admitted his involvement in the robbery at an earlier hearing. Fleming and Richardson were part of a three-man team that stole 50 Rolex watches from the Mappin & Webb boutique at the luxury hotel. Richard Fleming (left) and Liam Richardson (right) stole more than Â£500,000 worth of Rolex watches from the hotel The High Court in Edinburgh heard how staff at the hotel thought the gang were carrying out a ""terrorist attack"". The trial was told that the trio was dressed in black. Fleming personally threatened employees Louis Hutchison, 48, and Euan Wishart, 36, with a gun, a machete and hammers. The robbery was carried out at the Gleneagles resort in Perthshire After a raid that lasted approximately two minutes, Fleming and his accomplices escaped from the scene in a high-powered Audi sports car, which they dumped nearby. They had taken 50 out of 51 Rolex watches that were on display at the boutique. The watches had a total value of Â£516,750 and have never been recovered. The robbers then drove to Glasgow in a Range Rover Evoque, which had been stolen earlier from London. It was later found burned out in a cemetery in the city's east end. After finding the car, detectives analysed ""tens of thousands of hours"" worth of CCTV recordings and studied mobile phone records, which placed Fleming and Richardson at the crime scene. Fleming maintained he was innocent of any wrong doing and had claimed that at the time of the robbery he was buying drugs in Parkhead, Glasgow. Richardson, of London, pleaded guilty to armed robbery at the start of his accomplice's trial last month. Prosecution lawyer Jane Farquharson told judge Lady Carmichael that Fleming's criminal career started in 1994. In February 2007, he was convicted at the Old Bailey in London and given a nine-year sentence for possessing a firearm. Richardson's offending began in 2008 and has convictions for dishonesty and violence. Judge Lady Carmichael deferred sentence for the court to obtain background reports on the men.

The Tottenham and France goalkeeper was charged following a routine patrol stop in Gloucester Place, Marylebone, in the early hours of 24 August. The 31-year-old, of East Finchley, pleaded guilty when he appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court. He was fined Â£50,000 and banned from driving for 20 months. The court heard police in an unmarked car spotted Lloris' Porsche Panamera driving at 15mph (24kph) in a 30mph (48kph) zone. He veered his car ""towards parked vehicles"" before correcting himself and went through a red light, prosecutor Henry Fitch said. When officers stopped the vehicle, they found vomit and said Lloris had to be helped from the car. Lloris was the captain of France's 2018 World Cup-winning side Magistrate Amanda Barron said it was ""pure luck"" Lloris ""did not cause damage to other vehicles or pedestrians"", and his actions had put his and his passenger's lives at risk. The court was told the Spurs goalkeeper provided a sample containing 80 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit in England and Wales is 35 micrograms. David Sonn, defending, said Lloris had been dining in a restaurant with two friends where he was showered with drinks from fellow diners and ""by 2am he was completely drunk"". He said a taxi which had booked cancelled so Lloris made ""the first of a number of unwise decisions"" and decided to drive home. ""On July 15 he was arguably the proudest man on the planet [having captained France to the World Cup victory],"" Mr Sonn said. ""Just 40 days later, he was arrested. He experienced the indignity of being handcuffed and put in a police station overnight. ""The spectacular fall from grace is not lost on Mr Lloris,"" he said. When sentencing, the magistrate said the fine represented the seriousness of the offence as well as the goalkeeper's financial means. The Spurs captain has been with the club since 2012.

"Viktor Orban launched an impassioned defence on Tuesday - but it was not enough The European Parliament has voted to pursue unprecedented disciplinary action against Hungary over alleged breaches of the EU's core values. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government has been accused of attacks on the media, minorities, and the rule of law - charges which he denies. More than two-thirds of MEPs backed the censure motion - the first such vote against a member state under EU rules. If also approved by national leaders, Hungary could face punitive measures. The ultimate sanction, the suspension of Hungary's voting rights, is unlikely as Poland is likely to veto any such move. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest says Mr Orban appears increasingly isolated among European conservatives but is being applauded by nationalist parties. Since coming to power, Mr Orban's government has taken a hardline stance against immigration. It introduced a law which made it a criminal offence for lawyers and activists to help asylum seekers, under the banner of ""facilitating illegal immigration"". What sanctions can the EU impose on Hungary? In depth - Viktor Orban's Hungary Nationalism in heart of Europe needles EU But there have also been reports of pressure being put on the courts and the electoral system, and of widespread corruption. After the vote, the European Parliament said it was also concerned about: The constitutional and electoral system Privacy and data protection Freedom of expression and religion Academic freedom and freedom of association Equal rights, particularly for refugees and minorities such as Roma and Jews Mr Orban addressed the parliament on Tuesday in defence of his government, labelling the threat of censure as a form of ""blackmail"" and an insult to Hungary. Judith Sargentini, author of the report on Hungary, was applauded by many MEPs after the vote He claimed a report by Dutch Greens MEP Judith Sargentini was an ""abuse of power"", and included ""serious factual misrepresentations"". Ms Sargentini's report into Hungary's ruling Fidesz party alleged such actions were ""a clear breach of the values of our union"". Analysis by BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming The opposition to Viktor Orban received a boost last night when Manfred Weber, leader of the European Parliament's centre-right group the European People's Party (EPP), lost patience with his erstwhile ally and announced he would vote to trigger Article 7. But it has created a split within the EPP because Forza Italia, some Bulgarians, a few Germans and assorted others gave their backing to Budapest. Most British Conservative MEPs supported the Hungarian government, arguing that the EU had intruded into purely national matters. They strongly deny it was to secure Hungary's support in the Brexit process or out of admiration for the country's leader. However, this episode might not bother Mr Orban at all, as it boosts his image back home as a scourge of the European establishment. Under an EU rule called Article 7, breaching the union's founding principles can lead to the suspension of a member state's rights as a punitive measure. However, Hungary is currently facing ""preventative"" measures, which the parliament says are designed to avoid sanctions entirely. The BBC Reality Check team has explained the Article 7 process in detail. Broadly, the decision on Hungary will now be referred to the heads of the 28 EU member states to consider. However, because this step has never been taken before, it is not clear what will happen next, or when. Suspension of Hungary's voting rights is the most serious possible consequence - but is considered unlikely. Poland is also facing disciplinary proceedings, launched by the European Commission in December last year. The case has yet to reach the European Parliament. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto reacted angrily to the vote, calling it the ""petty revenge"" of ""pro-immigration"" politicians. Some politicians from other countries also defended Mr Orban's government. Britain's Nigel Farage, a pro-Brexit MEP, wrote that the decision demonstrated ""the authoritarian grip of the EU"".

Anti-Islam Dutch populist Geert Wilders tweeted: ""Hungary is the example for all EU countries and Orban is a hero and deserves the Nobel Prize."" But Ms Sargentini, who wrote the report on Mr Orban's government, said the decision sent an important message that the EU would stand up for citizens' rights. ""Viktor Orban's government has been leading the charge against European values by silencing independent media, replacing critical judges, and putting academia on a leash,"" she said. ""Individuals close to the government have been enriching themselves, their friends and family members at the expense of Hungarian and European taxpayers. The Hungarian people deserve better."" Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto reacted angrily to the vote Amnesty International's expert on human rights in the EU, Berber Biala-Hettinga, hailed the vote as ""historic"". ""The European Parliament rightly stood up for the Hungarian people and for the EU. They made it clear that human rights, the rule of law and democratic values are not up for negotiation,"" she said. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said that he would have voted for the measure if he was an MEP. ""The European Commission is using the tools we have, launching infringement procedures against countries that don't respect EU law. [I] am in harmony with today's decision,"" he said through a spokeswoman's Twitter account.

"This video can not be played Lisa Hardin had to wait two months for an appointment to fit a contraceptive implant Doctors are warning that contraceptive access is at a ""crossroads"", with services being cut across England. Figures seen exclusively by the BBC show half of councils have cut, or plan to cut, services, particularly affecting long-acting contraception. Leading reproductive health consultant Dr Asha Kasliwal has warned this may be a factor in rising abortion rates in older women. The Department of Health says local councils allocate their health budgets. Through Freedom of Information requests, the Advisory Group on Contraception obtained data suggesting that almost half of all councils in England have closed, or plan to cut, the number of sites providing contraception services between 2015 and 2019. The AGC contacted all 152 local authorities in England, with 74 (49%) saying they have reduced, or plan to reduce, the number of sites commissioned to deliver contraceptive services in at least one year between 2015/16 and 2018/19. While the most widely accessible form of contraception is condoms, and the most commonly prescribed the contraceptive pill, increasing numbers of women are asking for long-acting forms of contraception - like the coil and implants. These are more effective than the pill and the most popular form of contraception for older women - and recommended by the NHS. Between 2014 and 2016, three-quarters of councils in England had reductions in long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) being fitted by GPs and walk-in clinics because fewer GPs had the time or training to fit them, leading to women increasingly having to seek appointments at sexual health clinics. Dr Louise Skioldebrand is one of only a handful of GPs still carrying out fittings in Stowmarket, Suffolk. She said: ""There are only a certain number of GPs who are trained to fit coils and implants. We have a six-week waiting time. I think there's a real risk that unplanned pregnancies will go up. I would guess in a year's time, we will have more."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""It's extremely concerning to hear of such large-scale cuts, or plans to cut, contraceptive services, across England - actions that will potentially affect millions of women. Access to long-acting contraception - like implants - is particularly affected. ""It seems bizarre when there is strong evidence that investing in good contraception services is one of the most cost-effective healthcare interventions available."" She added: ""It's also incredibly frustrating, because we've actually had years of improvement in the quality of sexual and reproductive healthcare in the UK; we've seen teenage pregnancy rates halved; we've seen take up of LARCs increasing. ""But the most recent data shows prescriptions for LARCs - reliable, cost-effective contraception - decreasing. ""We're at a crossroads, whereby all the progress we've made is under serious threat, and we fear it will be some of our most vulnerable patients who are affected most."" Prof Lampard said the way sexual and reproductive health services were organised was too fragmented. And she said the college was aware of GPs who had been running LARC-fitting clinics, but not being adequately funded to do so. Dr Kasliwal, president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare which represents 15,000 doctors and clinicians, added: ""My concern is that the unmet need (for contraception) might get translated into unplanned pregnancies and possibly the increased abortion rates that we are seeing today.' Lisa Hardin from Northampton had an unplanned pregnancy while taking the contraceptive pill last year. After her daughter's birth, she wanted to get an implant, but her GP had stopped fitting them so she had to go to a clinic. ""I had to wait another two months until I actually got my implant in - but no-one thinks, for three months, what are you supposed to do in the meantime? I was so worried about getting pregnant."" The Department of Health and Social Care says it is up to local councils to allocate the public health budget - including funding for contraception services. ""We have a strong track record on sexual health - sexually transmitted infections continue to fall and teenage pregnancies are at an all-time low. ""A wide range of contraceptive choices are available free of charge from most GP surgeries, community contraceptive clinics and sexual health clinics."" Are women turning their back on the pill?

" Earl Marchan, of Gorse Hill, Manchester, had never heard of Dick Fuld. And Dick Fuld, of New York City, had never heard of Earl Marchan. Mr Fuld was the chief executive of Lehman Brothers, the giant 150-year-old Americanbank that collapsedon 15 September 2008. It was an event which placed rocket boosters on an already gathering global financial crisis, the damaging waves of which are still being felt today. Now, if he’s honest, Mr Marchan didn’t notice very much when Lehman’s fell apart with billions of dollars of losses. The collapse saw 25,000 bankers dumped on the street with cardboard boxes full of their belongings - 4,500 left their jobs at its European headquarters in Canary Wharf, London. The world - or the part of it which was slowly realising what all this could mean - looked on aghast as a once golden goose of the globally interconnected, hyper-financial system turned to dust. High finance - that multi-trillion pound cloud that swirled around the world every day - was built on confidence and trust. What was to happen when that trust broke down? Earl Marchan just got on with his job, like millions of other people unaware of the fire beginning to rage. “If it doesn’t directly affect you, you’re oblivious to it,” he says, looking back now, 10 years on. “Which makes me feel a bit naive. “I didn’t see it coming and I don’t think anyone would’ve thought it would have had that big an effect. “But saying that - once you’re in a recession you’ve got to be in a recession for at least 10 years, haven't you? “There is no quick fix in a recession, with every growth, you peak and then boom, you've got to plummet haven’t you?” And, boy, did the world plummet. Earl Marchan had never heard of Fred Goodwin. And Fred Goodwin had never heard of Earl Marchan. Mr Goodwin was the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which collapsed on 8 October 2008. It was only saved from oblivion by the injection of tens of billions of pounds provided by millions of taxpayers - one of whom was Mr Marchan. Fred Goodwin, former chief executive of RBS He had never heard of collateralised mortgage obligations or any of the other fancy banking products that kept traders hunched over flickering computer screens, earning their millions in salaries and bonuses. Nor could he have known why the collapse in the value of houses in Sarasota District, Florida, or indeed across the southern states of the US, would matter for his bank account in Britain. And his job. And his income. For years and years. Earl Marchan lost his job shortly after the financial crisis hit and the amount he earns every year now - £20,000 - is only just back to where it was in 2008. That of course means he is earning less in real terms than he was a decade ago, because prices have gone up. Making ends meet is more expensive. Earl Marchan is the living embodiment of the “incomes squeeze”, one of the most economically debilitating effects of the financial crisis. And for Mr Marchan, read millions of other people in Britain who over the past decade have hardly seen their incomes rise at all. Or the savers who have seen the returns on what they put away dwindle to almost nothing as central banks slashed interest rates to save the economy. Or the public services which, after the hefty rises of the New Labour years, were suddenly pared back as the government sought to repair its own balance sheet. The first alarms sounded well over a year before RBS collapsed - the first death rattles for a system built on straw foundations. Bear Stearns, another US bank,had hit difficultiesservicing mortgage loans early in 2007 as the housing market - including that shaky Florida market - turned down and the American economy stuttered. Unemployment across America was rising and house prices which once may have appeared affordable, but only just, suddenly were not. “Forced sale” notices started appearing on front lawns across the US as millions of sub-prime homeowners (code for risky borrowers with a high chance of default) fell behind on their payments. It was often easier for them just to walk into their real estate broker and hand back the door keys, abandoning debts that were then left as “distressed assets” for the banks to deal with. The US government-backed Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as Fannie Mae,was in crisisover the money that had been lent to those struggling homeowners. Its close cousin, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, commonly known as Freddie Mac, was on its knees. Both lost billions of dollars. It is often said that when America sneezes, the world catches a cold. Well, this was more than a sneeze. America had influenza. The rest of the Western world was about to catch pneumonia. British banks were closely entwined with the wheezy US economy, billions of pounds worth of assets reliant on the performance of Uncle Sam. The UK economy started softening. Just as in America, house prices stuttered. There had already been warning signs. The Northern Rock bank had run into trouble in 2007 andwas nationalised early in 2008. Its short-term funding model - for issuing mortgagesabovethe value of the homes they were for - broke down. That had been inevitable as soon as house prices started falling in the UK, mirroring the US experience. Economic cycles - prices going up and then going down - had not been eliminated. Northern Rock used the “overnight money markets” to fund its ever-growing loan book which had seen 23 years of record profits. But that market dried up as the value of the bank’s loans started to cause concern among twitchy lenders. Overnight interest rates that banks use to lend to each other rose to the highest levels for nine years. Northern Rock’s business model crumbled and the share price fell by 30%. Customers, worried about their cash, queued outside branches. Images reminiscent of a 1930s bank “run” flashed around the world. Commercial property values across the UK fell, calling into question the financial health of almost every bank in the country. Bank loans to overstretched developers became liabilities, not assets. RBS had a balance sheet, the total stock of assets and liabilities, of more than £2.4tn. It had been on a global spree - buying not just property but also other banks, like ABN Amro,  which were similarly exposed. On paper RBS was bigger than the economies of many countries. But its real strength was on a par with a South American banana republic from the 1970s. Its defence against a downturn - what’s called the capital buffer - was tissue-thin because no one believed the money markets would ever dry up. Not the bank. Not the regulators. Not the politicians. But they did - just as Northern Rock had found - and the problems went critical. In August 2008, RBSreported a loss of £691m- the second biggest in British banking history. A year earlier it had wowed the City by announcing profits of £10.3bn, the highest ever for a Scottish company, and working out at more than £1m an hour. In financial markets, the money moves that quickly. RBS started desperately selling assets but it was a downward spiral. These fire sales forced down prices, prompting more fire sales. A few weeks later - with its share price at 11p (down from £6) - contact was made with the government. The bank told astonished Treasury officials there was a danger RBS would be unable to open its cash machines and allow customers access to their own money. “The severity of the recession was certainly much greater than anyone anticipated,” says Karen Ward, former economic adviser to Chancellor Philip Hammond and now chief market strategist for JP Morgan, a bank that itself used the US government’s Troubled Asset Relief Programme in 2008. “And that is because the global financial system, how it was inter-connected, how the problems passed, and were magnified through the system, was beyond most people’s understanding.” Alistair Darling, the then chancellor, said that he was amazed that when he asked the banks in Britain for a full inventory of the risks they faced, it was not available. Alastair Darling, former chancellor of the exchequer Everything had grown so fast - RBS (which bought 26 banks and other firms in just seven years), Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche, Lehman, Merrill Lynch, ABN Amro, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JP Morgan - it was out of control. Hundreds of banks worldwide either went bust, were bailed out or were bought as distressed assets. Trillions of pounds worth of wealth was destroyed. “Never before, not even in the 1930s, had such a large and interconnected system come so close to total implosion,” wrote Adam Tooze in his new book How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World. In the dock were the regulators whose “light touch” approach had allowed unsustainable lending to go unchecked and complication and obfuscation in financial products to flourish. Bad behaviour went unpunished. Rule books were non-existent. The old saying - that the job of central banks (the key financial rule makers) was to take away the punch bowl before the party gets into full swing - had been discarded. Politicians convinced themselves growth was never-ending and that boom and bust was merely economic history. The shareholders who craved short-term profits urged bank executives onwards, building bigger businesses through aggressive buyout deals and ever more exotic and risky lending. At the heart of it all there were the bankers themselves, the financial market men and women who borrowed money short-term, often only for a few days, bought assets, packaged them up and sold them on in an ever more complex series of transactions. It was all so labyrinthine that not even the bankers really knew where those “golden threads” started. Or cared very much, as long as they were making a margin on every sale and the money kept rolling in. And when those underlying assets started losing value - like the houses in America that were mortgaged to people who could not afford the repayments - the banks started haemorrhaging money. Other banks across the world became nervous and started charging more for that lending. Some stopped lending altogether. That meant “liquidity” dried up, the essential oil of the interconnected system - readily available finance to support the multi-trillion pound cloud of money. Banks realised that a decade of being nimble  - but with very little actual cash on the balance sheet - and voracious for growth, left them naked. And whether it was Lehman or the Royal Bank of Scotland or Halifax Bank of Scotland or Lloyds Banking Group or Bradford and Bingley, the dominoes started to fall. One bank brought down another. “Back in the 2000s, there was too much easy money, credit flowing across the US to people who had never had access to credit before,” says Karen Ward. “There was quite simply a problem of over-leverage - people taking on loans that ultimately they couldn’t afford. “The global capital markets now are incredibly inter-connected, so a problem in the US banking sector very quickly spread to a much broader problem across the world.” Lehman revealed something a lot of people in power didn’t appear to realise - a bank’s collapse was not a singular affair. “Like any bubble, when it lasts for a long time you tend to rationalise it,” says Ms Ward. “Households who hadn’t had access to credit before were now getting it, and this was sustainable because the economy was much more stable now - we had expressions like the end of boom and bust around at that time. “A large part of it was over-optimism about quite how much leverage the system could sustain.” In 2009 the UK economy fell into recession, its first since 1991. Unemployment rose and suddenly this all became very relevant for millions of people like Earl Marchan who ran shops which served consumers who were starting to feel the pain of contraction. You check your sales every day and year on year, you notice the decline. “With the banking issue, it did affect us - in distribution and buying power,” he says. “Approaching the recession - it affects your sales on a day-to-day basis. You notice the decline.” With the banking industry on the verge of collapse, finance suddenly disappeared. And companies which  employed millions started to struggle. You may not be able to draw a direct line between the collapse of the banking sector and the failure of a single business. But a recession of this particular, financial type - very different from the industrial recessions of the 1980s - certainly exposed the weak spots. And one of those was a High Street chain called Woolworths. Earl Marchan started as a Saturday worker for Woolworths when he was 15. He earned £2.52 an hour. It was 1993 and Britain was just coming out of two years of recession. He liked it as a career and was good, rising up through the ranks to full-time staff member, then team leader, assistant manager and manager. Earl worked for Woolworths for 15 years The autumn of 2008 seemed to be just like any other. There was the Christmas conference to pick the best-selling toys and ensure the right amount of stock was ready for delivery. Across the country, 25,000 staff were preparing for the busiest time of the year. Marchan went home feeling pretty good about the weeks ahead. But then texts from anxious colleagues started arriving. There were television news reports that Woolworths, carrying £385m of debts built up in the good times, could be going out of business. Woolworths was in trouble. The share price had been sinking for a year and as the financial crisis hit, any companies that looked less than 100% solid were quickly washed up in the sense of panic. 2007: Woolworths in Clapham, south London Consumer confidence fell. Sales fell. Business models soon turned sour. And in a leveraged, over-borrowed world, problems are magnified and feed through the system very quickly. Trust and faith in a company is built up over decades. But where finance is involved it can drain away at blinding speed. Suppliers demanded up-front payments in cash. Woolworths struggled to get insurance on the stock it was buying. Woolworths in Dorking closes for the last time On 26 November 2008, the shop chain that had opened its first store in Liverpool in 1909went into administration, unable to pay its ongoing bills and with no willing buyers for the whole company. In January 2009 the last of its 815 stores closed. Earl Marchan, who had stayed on after Christmas to clear the shop of the last bits of pick and mix and stuffed bears, was out of a job for the first time in his life. He wouldn’t find another one for a year and eight months. “It was grim, I'm not going to lie,” he says. “It was a very family-orientated store. People were gutted.” Trips away stopped for Marchan, his wife and two children. They had to ask for a mortgage “holiday” and hung onto their house by swapping to interest-only - paying off just the interest, not the loan itself. “I've got three sisters luckily, and all had jobs. So, you know there was a lot of relying on family, and it wasn’t the happiest time for us. We didn't do much, we didn't go many places - the furthest I'd go is up to my sisters in Old Trafford.” You learn to adapt and you cut back on things A year before they had been to Barbados to see family and friends. It was to be their last holiday abroad. His then wife, Miriam Chin, said that the family had to economise. “You don’t go and buy extravagant things from Tesco,” she says. “You shop around, and you go to places where there’s less choice because you can’t indulge in other things. You go to the Aldis and the Lidls, where you get your basic fruit and veg. “But you learn to adapt and you cut back on things.” By the end of 2011, almost 2.7 million people were looking for work as the recession bit. Some firms, like Woolworths, went bust. Others contracted as consumer demand waned. The quarterly unemployment rate grew to 8.4%, the highest since 1995. But after the initial shock, a surprising thing happened. Unemployment fell as jobs started to be created - the UK’s labour market flexibility acted as a shock absorber. Mr Marchan found work - well-paid work - running service station forecourt shops. Plentiful employment is not the normal path of events following a recession and a subsequent period of low growth. And the explanation for it lies in two trends that were apparent in the economy -  one to do with the financial crisis and one that wasn’t. The first was the flood of cheap money that was created by the Bank of England to shore up the financial system. The impact of the crash was felt across the UK's high streets This was “quantitative easing” - the Bank creating billions of pounds worth of “new money” (not literally printing it - this was done digitally) to buy assets, such as government and company debt, and allow firms to borrow cheaply. Some described it as a necessary drug to keep the patient - the UK economy - alive. The Bank also slashed interest rates to record lows. At the beginning of November 2008 rates were at 4.5%. By March 2009 they were down to 0.5%. They wouldn’t rise again for eight years. Ultra-low interest rates made borrowing money for companies very cheap, as well as boosting anyone with a variable mortgage who found their monthly repayments slashed. People had a little more money to spend in the shops. There are positives, but no doubt for the average UK worker it’s been a struggle in the last 10 years. The effect was to make the recession more shallow than expected. It allowed companies which would otherwise have gone under or certainly stopped investing, to keep going and - to an extent - keep expanding. People were kept in post, helped by employees regularly offering to work fewer hours for a period or accept pay cuts. By May 2018, the unemployment rate stood at 4.2%, the lowest since the mid-1970s. “People have essentially priced themselves into work, so employment has actually held up remarkably well,” says Ms Ward. “The employment statistics suggest the economy is doing fantastically well. “But if we look at what has happened to guarantee that, it’s people accepting real wage declines. “The upside to that is of course people have maintained their jobs, and our housing market has been more stable than would have otherwise been the case. “So there are positives, but no doubt for the average UK worker it’s been a struggle in the last 10 years.” The other trend which helped job creation was technology - which shows, even with something as fundamental as the financial crisis, that economies rise and fall because of a number of factors. New ways of working via digital platforms such as Deliveroo or Uber opened up a different market for those hunting for jobs. Hyper-flexible, often insecure, the new world of work did mean that many people who might have struggled to find employment were not locked out of the system. With immigration rates high, there was a plentiful supply of people looking for work. Firms went on a hiring spree as investing in workers was often cheaper than investing in, say, a new piece of kit to make the company run more efficiently. There were downsides. Not investing in machinery or other new kit tends to have a negative effect on productivity - the amount of economic wealth created for every hour a person works. Before the financial crisis, productivity tended to increase by 2% a year. After the financial crisis, that figure had halved. And if an economy is not more productive, it does not grow as quickly and incomes tend to stagnate. UK productivity has slowed down over the last decade “This has been a very jobs-rich recovery and a very investment-light recovery,” says Ms Ward. “A company choosing to expand has held off investment. They’re worried about large sunk costs. “But because workers have been willing to accept real pay cuts, they’ve opted for increased staff. “By definition that’s a lot of workers producing the same GDP [gross domestic product or national income] and that means low productivity.” When Mr Marchan’s job running petrol service stations ended - the petrol firm he was working for was taken over - he ended up at the NHS as a receptionist, earning less than he had been a decade earlier. Again he had to give things up, being forced to sell his Audi car just a year after buying it. “Each time I lost a job, I’d say it cost me five years. I’m still 10 years behind what I’d like to be.” That was common for many millions of people as real earnings rose slower than prices (inflation). In 2018, at the age of 41, and after four years working for the NHS, does he have any disposable income? “No! With two children at university?” Mr Marchan answers with a laugh. And if he was to get an unexpected bill at the end of the month of £50, how would he pay it? “On my emergency credit card, pay it off a little bit each time,” Mr Marchan answers. He pauses. “I did that just last month. Got a speeding ticket.” It will take the rest of the year to clear it. David Cameron addresses the 2009 Conservative Party conference It was a warm April day at Cheltenham Racecourse and David Cameron, who had made a bit of a name for himself striding around with no notes when delivering speeches, decided on a different approach for that year’s Conservative Spring Conference. The Leader of the Opposition spoke for 35 minutes behind a lectern. There was nothing flash this time, just a sober assessment. “The age of irresponsibility is giving way to the age of austerity,” he toldthat assembled audience of Tory faithfulin 2009. “The money has run out. The alternative to dealing with the debt crisis now is mounting debt, higher interest rates and a weaker economy. Unless we deal with this debt crisis, we risk becoming once again the sick man of Europe. “Our recovery will be held back, and our children will be weighed down, by a millstone of debt. So this is no time for business as usual.” Four days earlier, Alistair Darling, the Chancellor, had revealed that the government deficit - that is the difference between what the government receives in taxes and spends on public services - had ballooned to £175bn. It was the largest deficit in history. The Conservatives planned to cut the deficit by targeting public spending. Voters at least appeared to partly back that plan when the Tories became the largest party in Parliament after the 2010 General Election, and led a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. George Osborne ahead of his 2010 emergency budget In an emergency budget in June that year, George Osborne, the new Chancellor, laid out what he saw as the challenge. “The coalition government has inherited from its predecessor the largest budget deficit of any economy in Europe with the single exception of Ireland,” he said. “One pound in every four we spend is being borrowed.” What had quickly become clear was that a financial crisis very soon became a crisis in the public finances. There was the money the government spent bailing out the banks. There was the money lost in tax revenues, as growth turned to recession. And there was the swirling danger of sovereign defaults (countries failing to repay their debts) as the same investors worried about lending to banks and businesses started to question the very viability of the huge debts governments themselves were running up. If a state stops being able to borrow on the money markets, then a credit crisis has turned into something far worse. Greece found this to its cost with multiple multi-billion euro bailouts from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. International creditors - those firms which had previously been so keen to buy up state debt - were charging more for their money or had disappeared altogether, leaving the Greek government with bills it could not pay. Each bailout came with stringent austerity measures attached, including sharp cuts in public service provision. There were riots in the streets. In Britain there were plenty of demonstrations as the public sector cuts bit. “The new Budget forecasts suggest that the financial crisis and the economic damage associated with it opened an additional structural hole in the public finances of around 5.8% of national income or £86bn a year in today’s terms,” said Robert Chote, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, at the time. There was apublic sector pay freezefollowed by a 1% pay cap which has only been lifted in the past 12 months. The government announced £11bn of cuts to welfare spending. Outside the protected departments of health and overseas aid, cuts of 25% were planned over five years. “We are looking at the longest, deepest sustained period of cuts to public services spending at least since World War Two,” Chote said. Taxes also rose, by £8bn, for individuals and businesses by 2014-15. “Balancing the books” became the government’s mantra - setting targets for itself to match the amount it spent on public services to the amount it collected in revenues from taxes and investments. The targets to eliminate what is called the deficit were continually missed. The economy performed more poorly than expected, the government failed to make the planned cuts and global events - such as the eurozone crisis - knocked Britain off course. Some economists blamed austerity itself for taking so much spending power out of the economy that it had a depressive effect. For the Conservatives, on the terms they had set themselves, the medicine did work. The public finances were in surplus by £2bnfor the month of July, the largest in 18 years. At the same time, borrowing in the April-to-July period fell to its lowest level since 2002. The effects of the financial crisis are still deep. Overall, government debt is still huge - £1.8tn. Growth is still low by historic standards. Incomes are rising only just above the rate of inflation. Productivity is poor. The average percentage of British disposable income that is saved is 4.1%, the third lowest since records began in 1963. In the 1990s, it was as high as 14.7%. “Putting money away” remains relatively unattractive. And it is clear why. A lump sum of £1,000 saved for a decade from 1997 at the interest base rate would have paid back £1,653 by 2006, according to figures compiled for the BBC by Savings Champion. A lump sum of £1,000 saved for a decade from 2007 would have paid back £1,150 by the end of 2016. Savings have not been paying back very much for an awfully long time. Those low interest rates - coupled with the vast expansion of monetary support from the Bank of England - also contributed to rocketing house prices in some parts of the UK. Over the past decade, the average house price has increased by 25% (ONS). In London and the south-east, and also in Manchester and other cities, the increase was much higher. The Marchan family may have had to switch to an interest-only mortgage during the hard times, but they have at least seen the price of their house in Manchester rise. “On my street, when we bought my house it was £42,000,” says Mr Marchan. “They’re going for £180,000 on this street.” Even that apparent good fortune leaves Mr Marchan worried for his sons, who are studying architecture and biomedical sciences at university. Even in professional jobs they may struggle to raise the kinds of deposits now needed to buy a house in many parts of Manchester. “I say it to them, once they finish university, I don’t know how they’re going to get on the property ladder anyway.” The Bank of England insists that regulations covering the banks and the wider financial services sector are now far more robust. Never say never but it appears a similar crisis could not happen again. The government has signalled the end of austerity as the public finances look in a better state. The American economyis strengthening. Global growth is stronger. There are reasons for optimism. But the effects of the financial crisis still persist, a decade after Dick Fuld became the face of all that was wrong in the interconnected, high-rolling financial world. There are still the structural issues. What is the correct role of government in supporting growth and managing risk? How might an industrial strategy help that? And how can the rules of globalisation and international trade be changed to ensure that no groups are left behind? But there are also rather less tangible strands that are no less important for the economic health of us as individuals, for the UK itself and for the world economy. Those strands are around sentiment, confidence and the return of sensible risk-taking. Emotions - because so much of economics is about emotions and human behaviour - have been so damaged, destroyed by the events of that crazy autumn of 2008. At the beginning of this year I interviewed Larry Fink, the head of the world’s largest investment fund BlackRock, which invests trillions of dollars in governments and businesses. What he says moves markets and makes prime ministers sweat. I asked him what was holding back economies, if we think about economies being fundamentally the millions of decisions made every day by people like Earl Marchan who might have an extra pound at the end of the week. Or might not. “Fear,” he said. “Fear of running out of money.” Ten years after the world nearly did just that. Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.019026723
"Viktor Orban launched an impassioned defence on Tuesday - but it was not enough The European Parliament has voted to pursue unprecedented disciplinary action against Hungary over alleged breaches of the EU's core values. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government has been accused of attacks on the media, minorities, and the rule of law - charges which he denies. More than two-thirds of MEPs backed the censure motion - the first such vote against a member state under EU rules. If also approved by national leaders, Hungary could face punitive measures. The ultimate sanction, the suspension of Hungary's voting rights, is unlikely as Poland is likely to veto any such move. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest says Mr Orban appears increasingly isolated among European conservatives but is being applauded by nationalist parties. Since coming to power, Mr Orban's government has taken a hardline stance against immigration. It introduced a law which made it a criminal offence for lawyers and activists to help asylum seekers, under the banner of ""facilitating illegal immigration"". What sanctions can the EU impose on Hungary? In depth - Viktor Orban's Hungary Nationalism in heart of Europe needles EU But there have also been reports of pressure being put on the courts and the electoral system, and of widespread corruption. After the vote, the European Parliament said it was also concerned about: The constitutional and electoral system Privacy and data protection Freedom of expression and religion Academic freedom and freedom of association Equal rights, particularly for refugees and minorities such as Roma and Jews Mr Orban addressed the parliament on Tuesday in defence of his government, labelling the threat of censure as a form of ""blackmail"" and an insult to Hungary. Judith Sargentini, author of the report on Hungary, was applauded by many MEPs after the vote He claimed a report by Dutch Greens MEP Judith Sargentini was an ""abuse of power"", and included ""serious factual misrepresentations"". Ms Sargentini's report into Hungary's ruling Fidesz party alleged such actions were ""a clear breach of the values of our union"". Analysis by BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming The opposition to Viktor Orban received a boost last night when Manfred Weber, leader of the European Parliament's centre-right group the European People's Party (EPP), lost patience with his erstwhile ally and announced he would vote to trigger Article 7. But it has created a split within the EPP because Forza Italia, some Bulgarians, a few Germans and assorted others gave their backing to Budapest. Most British Conservative MEPs supported the Hungarian government, arguing that the EU had intruded into purely national matters. They strongly deny it was to secure Hungary's support in the Brexit process or out of admiration for the country's leader. However, this episode might not bother Mr Orban at all, as it boosts his image back home as a scourge of the European establishment. Under an EU rule called Article 7, breaching the union's founding principles can lead to the suspension of a member state's rights as a punitive measure. However, Hungary is currently facing ""preventative"" measures, which the parliament says are designed to avoid sanctions entirely. The BBC Reality Check team has explained the Article 7 process in detail. Broadly, the decision on Hungary will now be referred to the heads of the 28 EU member states to consider. However, because this step has never been taken before, it is not clear what will happen next, or when. Suspension of Hungary's voting rights is the most serious possible consequence - but is considered unlikely. Poland is also facing disciplinary proceedings, launched by the European Commission in December last year. The case has yet to reach the European Parliament. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto reacted angrily to the vote, calling it the ""petty revenge"" of ""pro-immigration"" politicians. Some politicians from other countries also defended Mr Orban's government. Britain's Nigel Farage, a pro-Brexit MEP, wrote that the decision demonstrated ""the authoritarian grip of the EU"".

Anti-Islam Dutch populist Geert Wilders tweeted: ""Hungary is the example for all EU countries and Orban is a hero and deserves the Nobel Prize."" But Ms Sargentini, who wrote the report on Mr Orban's government, said the decision sent an important message that the EU would stand up for citizens' rights. ""Viktor Orban's government has been leading the charge against European values by silencing independent media, replacing critical judges, and putting academia on a leash,"" she said. ""Individuals close to the government have been enriching themselves, their friends and family members at the expense of Hungarian and European taxpayers. The Hungarian people deserve better."" Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto reacted angrily to the vote Amnesty International's expert on human rights in the EU, Berber Biala-Hettinga, hailed the vote as ""historic"". ""The European Parliament rightly stood up for the Hungarian people and for the EU. They made it clear that human rights, the rule of law and democratic values are not up for negotiation,"" she said. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said that he would have voted for the measure if he was an MEP. ""The European Commission is using the tools we have, launching infringement procedures against countries that don't respect EU law. [I] am in harmony with today's decision,"" he said through a spokeswoman's Twitter account.

"Sam Oliver has been cleared over a late-night confrontation in Sydney A British tourist has been found not guilty of assaulting Australia's former Rugby Sevens captain James Stannard. Sam Oliver, 23, had been accused of knocking Stannard to the pavement with a single punch, leaving him with a fractured skull. The confrontation took place outside a Sydney kebab shop in the early hours of 30 March. Mr Oliver, from Newcastle, argued that he had acted in self-defence. On Wednesday, Magistrate Richard Funston found Mr Oliver not guilty of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. ""I have come to the view that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this very serious charge can be made out,"" Magistrate Funston said. He said ""alcohol played a huge part"" in the ""unfortunate incident"" and both men had been heavily intoxicated at the time. Witnesses had also been intoxicated and relayed inconsistent memories, the magistrate added. Mr Oliver's lawyer told a court hearing that Mr Stannard had sworn at his client, using an anti-British expletive, and had thrown the first punch, leaving him with a black eye. The court also heard from a paramedic who said Mr Oliver acknowledged ""there was a fight but denied the king hit"" - Australian slang for a single punch. James Stannard says he is disappointed with the verdict Prosecutors alleged Mr Oliver had thrown the only punch in the confrontation. Following the verdict in Downing Centre local court, Mr Oliver said he was ""pretty relieved"". ""Nothing good happens after 2 o'clock,"" he told reporters. ""I need to let my mum know straight away. She is worried sick."" Mr Stannard, who retired from rugby in June, said he was disappointed. ""I feel like the truth did not come out in the hearing,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Lisa Hardin had to wait two months for an appointment to fit a contraceptive implant Doctors are warning that contraceptive access is at a ""crossroads"", with services being cut across England. Figures seen exclusively by the BBC show half of councils have cut, or plan to cut, services, particularly affecting long-acting contraception. Leading reproductive health consultant Dr Asha Kasliwal has warned this may be a factor in rising abortion rates in older women. The Department of Health says local councils allocate their health budgets. Through Freedom of Information requests, the Advisory Group on Contraception obtained data suggesting that almost half of all councils in England have closed, or plan to cut, the number of sites providing contraception services between 2015 and 2019. The AGC contacted all 152 local authorities in England, with 74 (49%) saying they have reduced, or plan to reduce, the number of sites commissioned to deliver contraceptive services in at least one year between 2015/16 and 2018/19. While the most widely accessible form of contraception is condoms, and the most commonly prescribed the contraceptive pill, increasing numbers of women are asking for long-acting forms of contraception - like the coil and implants. These are more effective than the pill and the most popular form of contraception for older women - and recommended by the NHS. Between 2014 and 2016, three-quarters of councils in England had reductions in long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) being fitted by GPs and walk-in clinics because fewer GPs had the time or training to fit them, leading to women increasingly having to seek appointments at sexual health clinics. Dr Louise Skioldebrand is one of only a handful of GPs still carrying out fittings in Stowmarket, Suffolk. She said: ""There are only a certain number of GPs who are trained to fit coils and implants. We have a six-week waiting time. I think there's a real risk that unplanned pregnancies will go up. I would guess in a year's time, we will have more."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""It's extremely concerning to hear of such large-scale cuts, or plans to cut, contraceptive services, across England - actions that will potentially affect millions of women. Access to long-acting contraception - like implants - is particularly affected. ""It seems bizarre when there is strong evidence that investing in good contraception services is one of the most cost-effective healthcare interventions available."" She added: ""It's also incredibly frustrating, because we've actually had years of improvement in the quality of sexual and reproductive healthcare in the UK; we've seen teenage pregnancy rates halved; we've seen take up of LARCs increasing. ""But the most recent data shows prescriptions for LARCs - reliable, cost-effective contraception - decreasing. ""We're at a crossroads, whereby all the progress we've made is under serious threat, and we fear it will be some of our most vulnerable patients who are affected most."" Prof Lampard said the way sexual and reproductive health services were organised was too fragmented. And she said the college was aware of GPs who had been running LARC-fitting clinics, but not being adequately funded to do so. Dr Kasliwal, president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare which represents 15,000 doctors and clinicians, added: ""My concern is that the unmet need (for contraception) might get translated into unplanned pregnancies and possibly the increased abortion rates that we are seeing today.' Lisa Hardin from Northampton had an unplanned pregnancy while taking the contraceptive pill last year. After her daughter's birth, she wanted to get an implant, but her GP had stopped fitting them so she had to go to a clinic. ""I had to wait another two months until I actually got my implant in - but no-one thinks, for three months, what are you supposed to do in the meantime? I was so worried about getting pregnant."" The Department of Health and Social Care says it is up to local councils to allocate the public health budget - including funding for contraception services. ""We have a strong track record on sexual health - sexually transmitted infections continue to fall and teenage pregnancies are at an all-time low. ""A wide range of contraceptive choices are available free of charge from most GP surgeries, community contraceptive clinics and sexual health clinics."" Are women turning their back on the pill?

"Merging House of Fraser and Debenhams has been discussed at board level, a Sports Direct director has revealed. Sports Direct bought House of Fraser last month and owns 29.7% of Debenhams. Simon Bentley, a non-executive director of Sports Direct, was reported as saying that combining the two department stores had been discussed at board level. He later clarified that he had not intended his remarks to be interpreted in this way. He was quoted as telling journalists that a merger ""had been discussed"". But he added: ""If any of you had the job of handling House of Fraser right now, I think you might have your hands full, and incidentally we've also got Sports Direct. ""If there's opportunities in the future, then we'll be in a position to take advantage of them."" Mr Bentley, who was speaking on the day of Sports Direct's annual general meeting, later clarified his remarks. ""I was asked a general question about whether or not we discuss our strategic investments, and in particular Debenhams, to which I replied in the positive. ""I made no mention of any merger between House of Fraser and Debenhams, nor did I intend my answer to infer that."" His comments were reported shortly after the unexpected announcement ahead of the AGM that Keith Hellawell was stepping down as chairman immediately. It was also announced that Mr Bentley, who has been on the retailer's board since 2007,  was leaving after the AGM. Analysts have speculated about the possibility of a tie-up between the two department store chains sinceSports Direct bought House of Fraser for Â£90mlast month. Mr Ashley has said he wanted to turn House of Fraser into the ""Harrods of the High Street"". Sports Direct bought the department store chain shortly after taking a taking a Â£85.4m hit on the value of its stake in Debenhams, whichearlier this week was forced to insist that its sales had not collapsed. Keith Hellawell is stepping down as Sports Direct chairman Mr Hellawell's retirement followed last year's meeting where he was re-elected byjust 53% of independent shareholders. He had said he would step down at the next annual meeting if he did not win their support again. The former chief constable of West Yorkshire Police had faced criticism about the way Sports Direct was run. ""Having overseen significant improvements in the working practices and corporate governance of the company, which includes a refresh of the board, now is the right time for me to step aside,"" Mr Hellawell said. ""I have every confidence that the group will continue to go from strength to strength."" The company has not yet published the outcome of the voting at the meeting and said that neither Mr Hellawell or Mr Bentley would stand for re-election. The new chair of Sports Direct is David Daly, who joined the board last year after a long career at Nike. He is also a non-executive director of Fulham Football Club. Nicola Frampton, managing director of William Hill's UK retail division, will also join the board. Investors have been concerned about the influence of Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley Ahead of the meeting, three shareholder advisory bodies are said to have told investors not to support Mr Hellawell's re-election. Investors have been concerned about the way Sports Direct treats its workers, as well as the influence of Mike Ashley, who owns 61% of the retailer.

"Lynette Dawson, a mother of two, was last seen in 1982 Australian police have begun digging at the former home of a Sydney woman whose disappearance in 1982 has recently attracted global attention. Lynette Dawson, a mother of two, vanished without a trace. Her husband, Chris Dawson, said she had left the family - perhaps for a religious group. Mr Dawson has denied murdering his wife after two coroners' inquests found she had been killed by a ""known person"". A popular podcast, The Teacher's Pet, has brought wide attention to the case. On Wednesday, police said they had begun a five-day forensic search of the couple's former home in the suburb of Bayview. ""This is all about getting justice for Lyn,"" said Supt Scott Cook from New South Wales Police. Supt Cook said police would pursue charges against Mr Dawson regardless of the outcome of the search. Detectives set up a taskforce in 2015 to re-investigate the case. In April, they sent a brief of new evidence to the state's Director of Public Prosecutions to consider whether criminal charges should be laid. Prosecutors have previously said there was insufficient evidence to lay charges. Lynette Dawson's disappearance has been given wider attention by a popular podcast An inquest in 2003 found Mr Dawson, a former rugby league star and high school teacher, had had sexual relationships with teenage students. One 16-year-old girl moved in with Mr Dawson within days of his wife's disappearance. The pair later married, but have since separated. Two separate inquests recommended that murder charges be laid against a ""known person"". Hywel Griffith, BBC News, Sydney The satellite-equipped vehicles parked along Gilwinga Drive, Bayview, tell you this is not a run-of-the-mill investigation. This leafy street of multi-million-dollar properties may yet provide the answers to a decades-old mystery which has caught the attention of millions of people around the world. With the sound of drills and earth cutters buzzing in the background, police announced their new search in front of news cameras. This isn't the first time the police have dug here. But it is a very public display of what officers say is their commitment to give Lynette Dawson's family answers, and a way to apply even more pressure on the man they believe was responsible for her death. Police say they have previously discovered ""anomalies"" in the ground at the property. This time, they plan to excavate four sites. ""What's different about this dig is it will be more extensive. We will go until we hit rock,"" Supt Cook said. Since May, more than 12 million people have downloaded The Teacher's Pet podcast, which is produced by The Australian newspaper. Why 2018 is the year of the 'podcast boom' Are podcasts breaking through to the mainstream? It has highlighted the bungled handling of the case by police in the early years after Mrs Dawson's disappearance, prompting a recent apology from the state's police commissioner.

"Hugo Lloris joined Tottenham Hotspur from Lyon in 2012 World Cup-winning captain Hugo Lloris has admitted being more than twice the drink-drive limit when he was stopped by police in central London. The Tottenham and France goalkeeper was charged following a routine patrol stop in Gloucester Place, Marylebone, in the early hours of 24 August. The 31-year-old, of East Finchley, pleaded guilty when he appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court. He was fined Â£50,000 and banned from driving for 20 months. The court heard police in an unmarked car spotted Lloris' Porsche Panamera driving at 15mph (24kph) in a 30mph (48kph) zone. He veered his car ""towards parked vehicles"" before correcting himself and went through a red light, prosecutor Henry Fitch said. When officers stopped the vehicle, they found vomit and said Lloris had to be helped from the car. Lloris was the captain of France's 2018 World Cup-winning side Magistrate Amanda Barron said it was ""pure luck"" Lloris ""did not cause damage to other vehicles or pedestrians"", and his actions had put his and his passenger's lives at risk. The court was told the Spurs goalkeeper provided a sample containing 80 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit in England and Wales is 35 micrograms. David Sonn, defending, said Lloris had been dining in a restaurant with two friends where he was showered with drinks from fellow diners and ""by 2am he was completely drunk"". He said a taxi which had booked cancelled so Lloris made ""the first of a number of unwise decisions"" and decided to drive home. ""On July 15 he was arguably the proudest man on the planet [having captained France to the World Cup victory],"" Mr Sonn said. ""Just 40 days later, he was arrested. He experienced the indignity of being handcuffed and put in a police station overnight. ""The spectacular fall from grace is not lost on Mr Lloris,"" he said. When sentencing, the magistrate said the fine represented the seriousness of the offence as well as the goalkeeper's financial means. The Spurs captain has been with the club since 2012.

"The Extreme Dwarfanators Wrestling event was due to take place in Leicester in October A charity has said it is ""very pleased"" a wrestling event involving people with dwarfism has been cancelled. Extreme Dwarfanators Wrestling was due to take place in Leicester in October, but Morningside Arena dropped it due to the ""tone of promotion"". The Restricted Growth Association (RGA) compared the event to a ""freak show"". Organisers said the show was about people with dwarfism being equal and that the fighters were ""pro athletes"". Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The Ferndown Leisure Centre, in Dorset, told the BBC it had also cancelled the event, but several other venues across the UK are still selling tickets. A spokeswoman for the RGA said: ""We are very pleased to hear that the [Morningside] arena took the time to listen to our concerns and we thank them for reconsidering their position."" The event is still due to be held in Cardiff, Torquay, Swansea and Liverpool Gillian Martin, from the RGA, said the event was a ""Victorian spectacle"" that harps back to ""freak shows, carnivals, travelling troupes"" for people to ""poke fun"" at those with disabilities.

"More than 250 free-to-use cash machines are disappearing a month as operators shut unprofitable ones, the network co-ordinator Link has said. There are 53,000 free machines in the UK - but the number is shrinking at a record rate as people use less cash. Now the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) is cracking down on the closures and asking for more network protection. ""Free-to-use ATMs continue to play a vital role in helping people access their money,"" the regulator said. Hannah Nixon, the PSR's managing director, said: ""The requirements we intend to place on Link will help ensure that Link achieves their commitment to protecting the geographic spread of free-to-use ATMs across the UK."" Link's ATM Footprint Report found that between the end of January and the start of July 2018, the number of free-to-use ATMs fell from 54,500 to 53,200. That is partly because people are using cash less, Link said, thanks to the rise in popularity of new payment methods such as contactless transactions. But it is also because cash machine operators such as Cardtronics and Note Machine, who get a fee from our banks each time we use one, are finding that fewer of their machines are economic to run. Row intensifies over cash machines fee Who do we trust after cash? The High Streets with 'too many' ATMs Under pressure from banks, Link is cutting the fee it pays to operators while trying to restrict the resulting closures in city centres, Link said it had set up ""specific arrangements to protect free-to-use ATMs more than 1km away from their next nearest free-to-use ATM"". The organisation has earmarked some 2,365 free machines in remote and rural areas that it wants to remain open. But 76 of these protected cash machines closed between January and July, 21 of them without even a Post Office nearby to get cash over the counter. The PSR says it is concerned and is taking action to ensure Link meets its commitments. It is also seeking renewed commitments from banks that consumers will continue to be offered services, allowing them to access their cash. But the regulator's intervention on ATM closures may be ""too little, too late"", warned Nicky Morgan, Chair of the Treasury Committee. She said: ""The PSR is rightly concerned by the closures, but I fear its regulatory intervention may be too little, too late. It must ensure that Link is held to its commitment to maintain the broad geographic spread of free-to-use ATMs. ""The Committee has been clear that this is a major test of what is a relatively new regulator, but the banks, the ATM deployers, and Link itself also have a duty to ensure consumers don't lose out."" Jenni Allen, managing director of Which? Money, said: ""Link is failing on its commitment to protect access to cash for people in remote and rural areas who need it most. ""The PSR must now urgently intervene to stop further closures and ensure that no more consumers are suddenly stripped of their access to cash."" Radio 1 Newsbeat reporter Gurvinder Gill There are plenty of cash machines in King's Lynn town centre, you'll find most major banks here on the High Street. But some of the surrounding villages have been listed as the worst places in the country when it comes to accessing cash. Lauren, who lives in Narborough in Norfolk, told me she has to travel 10 minutes in her car to get to her closest ATM. She says she always has to be organised and often gets cash back at supermarkets. Lily lives in King's Lynn and told me her closest cash machine is at a Tesco Express which is 15 minutes away. She says she avoids using cash when she can, but does need it for nights out and getting a taxi home.

"International Trade Questions at start of the day Questions next to Women and Equalities ministerial team Urgent question on Bedford prison Business statement outlines what's coming up in the Commons Statement on scallop fishing from Fisheries Minister George Eustice Debate on proxy voting Peers question ministers from 11am Sophie Morris, Robbie Hawkins and Julia Butler Passports and driving licences could also be affected by a no-deal Brexit, say UK ministers. House of CommonsParliament MPs' last day in Parliament before conference season kicked off with questions to International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and his ministerial team, followed by questions to Women and Equalities ministers. Prisons Minister Rory Stewart then responded to an urgent question from Labour MP Mohammad Yasin on concerns about HMP Bedford, before Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Minister George Eustice delivered a statement on scallop fishing in the Channel. The Business statement saw concerns raised about the abuse of MPs' families, and then MPs moved to the much awaited general debate on proxy voting, with Jo Swinson's son Gabriel listening to the last of the debate in the chamber. MPs recounted stories about their own maternity or paternity leave and many called for changes to be made to the way Westminster works. The day ended with an adjournment debate led by Labour's Catherine West on the humanitarian situation in Burma. What happened today? House of LordsParliament Earlier today in the House of Lords, during a debate on anti-Semitism, numerous Labour peers including Lord Mendelsohn and Lord Parekh, as well as other crossbench peers, were not afraid to criticise the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's handling of the anti-Semitism row. There's also been a debate on IVF to mark its 40th anniversary, and on the need to reform the Lobbying Act. The Lords will continue to debate the way formal international declarations of genocide or crimes against humanity are made until 6pm. Proxy voting debate House of CommonsParliament Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom says she ""will be very boring and very quiet"" in her closing remarks, so as not to disturb Jo Swinson's new baby. She ""quietly reminds those"" who have criticised the delay in the debate taking place, that the Leaders' office and business managers have never before managed to change voting procedure. ""I'm determined to get that right, and that it's this government that makes that change, and in fact that it's me as leader that makes that change. ""I intend to bring forward a substantive motion as soon as possible."" She stresses that any changes need checks to ensure they match the requirements of the House. But I don't think that our ambitions for modernising Parliament should be limited only to proxy voting. There is much more that we can consider when looking at what we can do to modernise this amazing place to work... there is no question in my mind that we need to make progress."" Andrea Leadsom International Declarations of Genocide Debate House of LordsParliament Peers turn now to a debate on the way formal international declarations of genocide or crimes against humanity are made, opened by the crossbench peer Lord Alton. He is also asking how the government can further the prosecution of those responsible. He says ""we've seen genocide again and again, with 'never again' happening endlessly again."" Lord Alton says that against this backdrop, it is impossible to understand why governments fail to make formal declarations of genocide and to take appropriate action. He says a petition with signatures from 160 MPs was sent to the prime minister asking her to lead on seeking a referral of the Burmese military to the International Criminal Court. A UN report saystop military figures in Myanmar must be investigated for genocidein Rakhine state and crimes against humanity in other areas. The report, based on hundreds of interviews, is the strongest condemnation from the UN so far of violence against Rohingya Muslims. At least 700,000 Rohingya fled violence in the country in the past 12 months. Lord Alton says as the 70th anniversary of theConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,externalapproaches, it is about time to reconsider the government's longstanding policy to genocide determinations, and to consider new policies to ensure that the government is ""fully equipped under its obligations in the genocide convention to prevent and combat genocide"".

Ms Vaz concludes her remarks by saying ""we have to get it [proxing voting] right, and soon"".

He says he wasn't intending to take part today, but explains that he and his wife have had a complex pregnancy and as a result he won't be able to be in the house when the Agriculture Bill goes through the House after recess. ""Proxy voting won't help me, I will miss that first week back,"" he says, but ""I am incredibly frustrated that this issue has been kicked into the long grass time after time.""

Proxy voting House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Emma Reynolds says she was told by a constituent she ""wasn't worth the money, because I was on maternity leave"". A national newspaper also said she had the second worst voting record during this time, without checking with her as to why. She says only proxy voting would allow new parents to continue to represent their constituency, whilst it would ""send an important signal"" to young people wanting to start a family but also considering standing as MPs ""that they can do both"". Proxy voting House of CommonsParliament SNP MP Patricia Gibson says the status of this proposal is similar to when we had the smoking ban in public places. ""Why is it taking so long?"" she wonders. Ms Gibson argues the case for proxy voting but issues a caveat that ""maternity leave is sacrosanct"" and nothing should be done that would ""interfere or erode"" it. Ms Gibson says pregnancy discrimination is still a big issue and a stark reminder of how fragile rights for mothers can be. The SNP MP warns against sending a signal to outside employers that women on maternity leave are still able to carry out some tasks. IVF 40th Anniversary Debate House of LordsParliament Feminist campaigner Baroness Boycott says at the time leading up to IVF being introduced she was ""more worried about not getting pregnant than getting pregnant"". The battle then was ""contraception, not conception"", but she says IVF changed ""the prospect of what it [motherhood] could mean for you as a woman... it was a quite staggeringly wonderful invention."" She warns that ""access to IVF has all to often become an option open only to the privileged,"" and that there are of risks of poorer women essentially ""renting their womb"" for financial gain. She compares this to the sale of organs. Concluding, she says ""it worries me that men are left out of the picture when it comes to IVF"" - they deposit what's needed and the process leaves them there. She ""would hate to see anything that devalues fatherhood... it is just as important as motherhood."" IVF 40th Anniversary Debate House of LordsParliament Conservative peer the Earl of Selborne says the most recent big development surrounding IVF is the regulators' discussion of gene editing in 2016. Since 2016, scientists have been able to conduct gene editing for use and research in the UK, but the process remains illegal for reproductive purposes. He says ""gene editing has the potential of preventing a future child from developing a genetic disorder"" but there are moral issues involved which require in depth discussion. The Earl of Selborne says interventions with gene editing ""must not marginalise disadvantaged groups in society"", and that more work and research needs to be conducted in this area. He says there is a need for wider debate on the role of gene editing for reproductive purposes, as he believes this could be a crucial developing area of IVF in the coming years.

IVF 40th Anniversary Debate House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Barker says the laws on surrogacy are so tight, that now there is a strong argument that the laws have turned out to be ""too restrictive"". Baroness Barker says she hopes the government will work with surrogacy charities to come forward with legislative proposals that will be more beneficial to people, as for many, time is running out and it is an urgent issue. She says it is time to update the legislation as ""there are now many more ways of getting pregnant than there were when this legislation was put in place"". Baroness Barker calls for more clarity on the regulation of research and treatment. She says the UK has led the way with IVF, and by providing more clear research, we can continue to do this. ""These laws apply for the protection of women, and is the sort of work we do best."" IVF 40th Anniversary Debate House of LordsParliament Lord Mackay of Clashfern says he ""had responsibilities in the early days of the law"" and shares his memories of trying to pass legislation on IVF through Parliament, stressing the role played by the House of Lords. The Conservative peer says it is ""a tremendous area of success for our doctors and our scientists"". ""I wish every success to this great enterprise as it moves on into the future."" IVF 40th Anniversary Debate House of LordsParliament Crossbench peer Baroness Deech opens the next debate in the Lords today on the 40th anniversary of the first baby born using in vitro fertilisation. She says IVF has kept up to date with changes in the modern family, and has enabled the UK to be ""a pioneer in informative but innovative research"". Baroness Deech acknowledges that while moral debates continue, ""we should be wary of putting too much pressure on women to get pregnant at all costs"", and for men to be seen as simply sperm donors. ""No childless woman should ever be made to feel that she can only be perfected and given a role in life by being subjected to every reproductive technique"". Baroness Deech notes that at present, embryos can only be kept alive for 14 days. She says researchers beginning to experiment with embryos up to 28 days is too controversial and would reignite debates over the issues and rights of an embryo. She says IVF has gone from a matter of a simple fertility treatment, to a matter of ""convenience and preference"", including the choice of sex of a baby. Baroness Deech says the UK must be proud of this concept they gave birth to.     Proxy voting House of CommonsParliament Mother of the House Harriet Harman says proxy voting was less of an issue when MPs were ""overwhelmingly male"" but ""there has been a transformation inside and outside the House [of Commons]"". Ms Harman says that MPs with illnesses ""have been well served by pairing"" and it provides a necessary degree of discretion but ""you have either had a baby or you haven't"" and proxy voting suits that. ""Proxy voting is 30 years too late"", she says. Topical Question on Anti-Semitism House of LordsParliament Lord Bourne, Minister for Housing, Communities and Local Government, says he would like to pay tribute to members of the Labour Party who have shown ""considerable courage in criticising their own leadership"". Lord Bourne says anti-Semitism is ""far from a criticism of the Labour Party, it's a criticism of its leadership"". He says it is impossible to think the Labour Party of any leader before would be where the party is today. ""It is a problem that needs addressing quickly"". Lord Bourne says the message to Jewish people, politicians and general members of the public in the UK is that ""we remain in this country, totally committed to tackling anti-Semitism alongside other religious hatreds, and doing whatever else is needed to become a united country"". Topical Question on Anti-Semitism House of LordsParliament ""It is deeply disappointing that this appalling manifestation of racism should still be with us,"" Labour spokesman Lord Beecham says. It is ""especially troubling,"" he says, that there are people still ""in denial"" about the problem, with some in his own party ""refusing to accept it exists"", even after Jeremy Corbyn accepted it was a problem. ""Let's be clear, this is not just a matter for the Labour party,"" he adds, ""all three major parties have encountered the problem in some degree."" He says if that the issue is to be tackled two areas that need improvement are the failure of tech companies to combat abuse on social media and the promotion of ""a multi-ethnic society throughout education system"".

"The EU plans to send 10,000 more border guards to tackle unlawful immigration by 2020, the European Commission's president Jean-Claude Juncker said in his annual state of the union address. He called for more solidarity, rather than ""ad-hoc solutions"" for people on migrant ships. His speech also tackled the region's other burning issues - populism, terrorism and Brexit. This is Mr Juncker's last 12 months in the role. He also proposed a new Africa-Europe alliance, based on co-operation rather than charity, leading to a continent-to-continent free trade agreement. Live: Juncker speech and reaction Who is Jean-Claude Juncker? 'I don't own a smartphone' - Juncker He recommended that the euro be used more strategically as the biggest currency after the dollar. Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, currently employs 1,600 border guards across the EU And he called for strong leadership on Brexit. ""The United Kingdom will never be an ordinary third country for us,"" he said. The next elections to the European parliament are expected to be held in late May next year. Analysis by Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor This was Jean-Claude Juncker's final speech as European Commission president, a nod to his legacy.

Public opinion polls across Europe show people more in favour of the EU than they have been in recent years but - and this is a hugely important but - they're also more sympathetic towards populist parties, which are often nationalist and Eurosceptic in nature. These parties tend to win favour among voters because their message is that they - unlike traditional parties, and unlike what they call remote technocrats in Brussels - are listening to people's concerns and care deeply about social issues. Populist parties are expected to do very well in next year's elections for the European Parliament. Mr Juncker said little today to change that by persuading disenchanted voters. In his speech, Jean Claude Juncker also made a notably controversial proposal to abolish EU member countries' vetoes on certain tax and foreign policy issues. This is likely to be pounced on by critics of the EU who accuse it of being an undemocratic institution. Mr Juncker said the EU needed to be secure from the many threats that faced it. ""We will not militarise the European Union. What we want is to become more autonomous and live up to our global responsibilities,"" he said. ""Only a strong and united Europe can protect our citizens against threats internal and external - from terrorism to climate change."" Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, currently employs 1,600 border guards across the EU, so the new figure is a substantial hike. Mr Juncker committed to further developing the European Asylum Agency to offer more support to member states processing asylum seekers. He stressed a need for legal routes for migration into Europe. ""We need skilled migrants,"" he said. From the start of Mr Juncker's mandate in 2014, migration has been a major crisis.

"The EU plans to send 10,000 more border guards to tackle unlawful immigration by 2020, the European Commission's president Jean-Claude Juncker said in his annual state of the union address. He called for more solidarity, rather than ""ad-hoc solutions"" for people on migrant ships. His speech also tackled the region's other burning issues - populism, terrorism and Brexit. This is Mr Juncker's last 12 months in the role. He also proposed a new Africa-Europe alliance, based on co-operation rather than charity, leading to a continent-to-continent free trade agreement.

"Clinics must make it clear that there is little point in women over 40 freezing their eggs, because the odds of a future pregnancy are very slim, says UK fertility regulator the HFEA. Fertility declines with age, so the optimum time for egg freezing is before a woman turns 35, it says. Yet data shows that the most common age at which women are treated is 38, with many freezing eggs into their 40s. NHS clinics usually have a younger cut-off age, but private ones may not. The women who empty their savings to freeze their eggs Should I freeze my eggs for my 30th birthday? Why I chose to freeze my eggs Women can only get egg freezing on the NHS if it is for medical reasons, such as needing a cancer treatment which may cause them later fertility problems. Private clinics also offer it to women who want it for social reasons, like delaying starting a family because they haven't met the right partner yet. In 2016, 80% of the 1,310 freezing procedures carried out were done in private clinics, The singer Rita Ora froze her eggs in her early 20s Around 890 of all the treatments were for women aged 35 and over, compared with 419 treatments for women younger than this. The HFEA says it is not clear why patients of this age are freezing eggs. Most women freezing eggs using NHS funding were aged below 35, with 89% below 38. It says women must be given clear information about the risks, costs and likely success rates of egg freezing, which is becoming an increasingly popular ""fertility insurance"" back-up plan. Success rates can be low Egg quality and number naturally drops as a woman gets older It is not a simple fix for delaying motherhood NHS funding may be available if you are having medical treatment that affects your fertility Frozen eggs can usually only be stored for 10 years (although there are some exceptions for medical reasons) Egg freezing costs anywhere between Â£2,720 and Â£3,920 per go. Most clinics will include a couple of years of storage in that price, but there may be an extra annual charge of up to Â£350 for that service. The complete cost if you then opt to thaw and use your eggs in a future treatment, is Â£7,000 to Â£8,000. Birth rates from frozen own eggs are increasing but remain below that of conventional IVF treatment cycles, being successful one in every five times, on average, compared to around one in three for ""fresh egg"" IVF. While a woman's age at thaw has relatively little impact on a woman's chances of success, the age at freeze does, with evidence suggesting that if eggs are frozen below the age of 35, the chances of success will be higher than the natural conception rate as the woman gets older, says the HFEA. HFEA Chair Sally Cheshire said: ""Clinics have an ethical responsibility to be clear that egg freezing below the age of 35 offers women their best chance of creating their much longed-for family."" Aileen Feeney from Fertility Network said women should know their fertility ""vital statistics"" 28:35:42: ""By 28, female fertility has already begun to fall; 35, female fertility plummets; 42, your chance of becoming a biological mother is vanishingly small."" Prof Simon Fishel, from the independent IVF provider CARE Fertility Group, said women face a hard choice, knowing that if they freeze eggs early they can still only be stored for 10 years.

"This video can not be played Alice Ruggles' parents welcome report into stalking murder Police officers failed to properly investigate complaints a young woman made against her former boyfriend in the days before he brutally murdered her, the police watchdog has found. Alice Ruggles' throat was cut by Trimaan Dhillon after he broke into her Gateshead flat in October 2016. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said two officers had cases of misconduct to answer while another performed unsatisfactorily. Northumbria Police has apologised. Dhillon, who was a serving soldier, was jailed for a minimum of 22 yearsafter being convicted of murder in April last year, aged 26. He bombarded Miss Ruggles, 24, originally from Leicestershire, with text messages and phone calls, made unwelcome visits to her home, gave her unwanted gifts and threatened to kill himself, Newcastle Crown Court had heard. After an internal review identified potential misconduct by officers, the force referred the matter to the IOPC. It found the force treated the matter as harassment rather than the more serious offence of stalking. The report said details Miss Ruggles gave on 1 October about Dhillon knocking at her door and a text message confirming he had been outside her home were not recorded by the call-handler, who has since left the force. Trimaan Dhillon, known as Harry, had been subject to a restraining order after attacking a previous partner In the days that followed, Dhillon was issued with a police information notice (PIN) for harassment to warn him that he could be arrested if he contacted Miss Ruggles again. However, an officer arranged for a major at Dhillon's barracks in Scotland to issue the PIN - against national guidance for it to be done by a police officer in person, unless in exceptional circumstances. After contacting police again on 7 October having received a letter and photographs in the post, Miss Ruggles was asked if she wanted her former partner arrested - a question the IOPC said victims should not be asked, as guidance states the decision to arrest lies with an officer. Five days after declining the offer of having her ex arrested, Miss Ruggles' was found dead by her flatmate. Northumbria Police said ""lessons have been learned"" and it had implemented an improvement plan. A sergeant and PC ""have received words of advice and completed enhanced training"", it added, while a ""performance meeting has been held with a further PC"". The Home Office only started collating police force stalking statistics in 2014-15 after it became a standalone offence two years previously. Before then it was treated as harassment. Since then forces have steadily been recording more and more stalking crimes. In 2014-15 there were 2,882 recorded offences in England and Wales. That jumped to 4,164 a year later, 5,313 the year after that, and then nearly doubled to 10,214 last year. But there were only 1,822 charges for stalking in 2017-18, illustrating the difficulty of prosecuting these types of crimes. Miss Ruggles' mother, Dr Sue Hills, said ""every single indicator was there"" to suggest Dhillon should have been arrested and prosecuted for stalking. Dr Sue Hills said her daughter ""may still be alive if things had happened differently"" She added: ""I am disappointed the police didn't deal with it as stalking because it so clearly was when we look back to it. ""The police should've known because it's their job to know. ""To be fair, they are moving in the right direction. ""A lot of forces are changing the way they deal with stalking. I think that's a really big change that could be helpful.""

"This video can not be played Michael Gove tells Today challenging Theresa May's leadership is 'loose talk' Conservative MPs opposed to Theresa May's Brexit plan have met to discuss how and when they could force her to stand down as prime minister. About 50 members of the European Research Group (ERG) openly discussed ""how best you game the leadership election rules,"" a source said. Eurosceptic MPs are to unveil what they say is a solution to the Irish border. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said leadership speculation was ""loose talk"" and urged MPs to unite behind the PM. Mr Gove said he wanted Mrs May to stay in Downing Street ""as long as possible"" and believed her much-criticised Chequers blueprint for future relations with the EU could win the support of Parliament. Chequers worse than status quo - Johnson Reality Check: The Brexiteers' trade plan Brexit and the hardest border Leadership speculation was ""like the weather...feature of British life"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""This is loose talk. There is always loose talk. The critical thing is we deliver on the Brexit mandate and any diversion or distraction from that commitment means our ability to ensure that it delivered is undermined."" Please upgrade your browser Read the full glossary here The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the significance of the ideas discussed at the ERG meeting would have to be considered as leading Tory Brexiteers - Jacob Rees-Mogg, Owen Paterson, Iain Duncan Smith, Bernard Jenkin, David Davis, Boris Johnson - were not present. Mrs May says she wants to strike a trade deal with the EU for after the UK leaves in 2019. She also says there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland, in order to avoid a hard border there. Boris Johnson was among leading Tory MPs at an event discussing a ""clean break"" from the EU earlier on Tuesday The ERG strongly opposes these proposals, which form part of what has become known as the Chequers plan. One MP present at the meeting on Tuesday evening said the group considered ""possible scenarios over the Autumn"" depending on the deal the prime minister did or didn't get with the EU, BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said. Comments at Tuesday evening's meeting were said to include ""everyone I know says she has to go"", ""she's a disaster"" and ""this can't go on"".  We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave? Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before... So there are some BIG problems to solve Such as how we donât end up worse-off economically The EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the border And people can also move around as if the EU was a single country Outside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countries This could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firms The EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membership But that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the world Any special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs first Then the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across Europe Thatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦ So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019 But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after that During which the UK could still be governed by some EU laws A trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agree However, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quicker But it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...

A number told the meeting in Westminster that they had already submitted letters of no confidence in Mrs May. However, it is understood they are not planning an immediate move against her. A Conservative leadership contest can be triggered either if the leader resigns or if 15% of Tory MPs (currently 48) write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, demanding a vote of no confidence. Are Tory MPs ready to move against May? By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg There is massive frustration with her leadership, her position on Chequers and the way her proposals tuck the UK closely into the EU in perpetuity. And yes, there are some MPs who want to see her gone immediately. However senior voices in the European Research Group are adamant that it is not the time to try to oust the PM. It would be ""stupid"", one told me last night. Imagine in these critical weeks of the Brexit negotiations if the UK started to try to change the prime minister. Right now those jostling to remove her know they don't have any guarantees they would have the numbers to force her out, even though they may well be able to pull together enough MPs to submit letters to the chair of 1922 committee to trigger a contest. Read Laura's full blog Who are the European Research Group? Alternative plans for the border are due to be unveiled at an event in London which will be attended by former Northern Ireland Secretaries Owen Paterson and Theresa Villiers, the former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Northern Ireland First Minister Lord Trimble. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the ERG, said the group would offer a solution ""that any reasonable person would accept"". This video can not be played IDS: âIâd stamp on any coup against PMâ With the UK due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, the challenge has been to avoid a so-called hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - which is an EU member. Both sides are keen to avoid the imposition of barriers and checkpoints amid warnings of damage to cross-border trade and disruption to the Good Friday Agreement, which was signed in April 1998 and helped bring an end to 30 years of sectarian conflict, known as the Troubles. The government says its plan for ""harmonisation"" with EU trade rules and a ""combined customs territory"" with the EU will avoid friction at the border.

If you can't see the timeline,follow this link,external It says Parliament will be able to choose to diverge from the EU rules at a later date, ""recognising that this would have consequences"". But critics say this would get in the way of the UK trading freely with countries outside the EU. The government's Chequers plan has not yet been accepted by the EU. Both sides have also agreed on the need for a ""backstop"" agreement to avoid new physical infrastructure on the border, irrespective of the final deal that is negotiated. 'Exports could be stuck at border' The Brexit factions reshaping UK politics Why is Brexit taking sooo long? Some Brexiteers have claimed the border issue is being ""exploited"" by the EU and Remain supporters to keep the UK closely tied to Brussels. Speaking at the launch of the ""clean-break"" proposals, attended by Tory Brexiteers on Tuesday, Mr Rees-Mogg said the border was the only thing standing in the way of the UK negotiating a free trade deal like the EU has with Canada. He added: ""It is possible to move very swiftly to a Canada-plus style deal as long as we can come up with a scheme, which I think we have got for tomorrow, on how do you ensure a solution to the Northern Ireland problem that any reasonable person would accept?""

Mr Gove said he wanted Mrs May to stay in Downing Street ""as long as possible"" and believed her much-criticised Chequers blueprint for future relations with the EU could win the support of Parliament. Chequers worse than status quo - Johnson Reality Check: The Brexiteers' trade plan Brexit and the hardest border Leadership speculation was ""like the weather...feature of British life"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""This is loose talk. There is always loose talk. The critical thing is we deliver on the Brexit mandate and any diversion or distraction from that commitment means our ability to ensure that it delivered is undermined.""

Mrs May says she wants to strike a trade deal with the EU for after the UK leaves in 2019. She also says there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland, in order to avoid a hard border there. Boris Johnson was among leading Tory MPs at an event discussing a ""clean break"" from the EU earlier on Tuesday The ERG strongly opposes these proposals, which form part of what has become known as the Chequers plan. One MP present at the meeting on Tuesday evening said the group considered ""possible scenarios over the Autumn"" depending on the deal the prime minister did or didn't get with the EU, BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said. Comments at Tuesday evening's meeting were said to include ""everyone I know says she has to go"", ""she's a disaster"" and ""this can't go on"".  We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave? Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before... So there are some BIG problems to solve Such as how we donât end up worse-off economically The EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the border And people can also move around as if the EU was a single country Outside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countries This could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firms The EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membership But that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the world Any special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs first Then the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across Europe Thatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦ So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019 But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after that During which the UK could still be governed by some EU laws A trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agree However, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quicker But it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...

A number told the meeting in Westminster that they had already submitted letters of no confidence in Mrs May. However, it is understood they are not planning an immediate move against her. A Conservative leadership contest can be triggered either if the leader resigns or if 15% of Tory MPs (currently 48) write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, demanding a vote of no confidence. Are Tory MPs ready to move against May? By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg There is massive frustration with her leadership, her position on Chequers and the way her proposals tuck the UK closely into the EU in perpetuity. And yes, there are some MPs who want to see her gone immediately. However senior voices in the European Research Group are adamant that it is not the time to try to oust the PM. It would be ""stupid"", one told me last night. Imagine in these critical weeks of the Brexit negotiations if the UK started to try to change the prime minister. Right now those jostling to remove her know they don't have any guarantees they would have the numbers to force her out, even though they may well be able to pull together enough MPs to submit letters to the chair of 1922 committee to trigger a contest. Read Laura's full blog Who are the European Research Group? Alternative plans for the border are due to be unveiled at an event in London which will be attended by former Northern Ireland Secretaries Owen Paterson and Theresa Villiers, the former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Northern Ireland First Minister Lord Trimble. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the ERG, said the group would offer a solution ""that any reasonable person would accept"". This video can not be played IDS: âIâd stamp on any coup against PMâ With the UK due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, the challenge has been to avoid a so-called hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - which is an EU member. Both sides are keen to avoid the imposition of barriers and checkpoints amid warnings of damage to cross-border trade and disruption to the Good Friday Agreement, which was signed in April 1998 and helped bring an end to 30 years of sectarian conflict, known as the Troubles. The government says its plan for ""harmonisation"" with EU trade rules and a ""combined customs territory"" with the EU will avoid friction at the border.

If you can't see the timeline,follow this link,external It says Parliament will be able to choose to diverge from the EU rules at a later date, ""recognising that this would have consequences"". But critics say this would get in the way of the UK trading freely with countries outside the EU. The government's Chequers plan has not yet been accepted by the EU. Both sides have also agreed on the need for a ""backstop"" agreement to avoid new physical infrastructure on the border, irrespective of the final deal that is negotiated. 'Exports could be stuck at border' The Brexit factions reshaping UK politics Why is Brexit taking sooo long? Some Brexiteers have claimed the border issue is being ""exploited"" by the EU and Remain supporters to keep the UK closely tied to Brussels. Speaking at the launch of the ""clean-break"" proposals, attended by Tory Brexiteers on Tuesday, Mr Rees-Mogg said the border was the only thing standing in the way of the UK negotiating a free trade deal like the EU has with Canada. He added: ""It is possible to move very swiftly to a Canada-plus style deal as long as we can come up with a scheme, which I think we have got for tomorrow, on how do you ensure a solution to the Northern Ireland problem that any reasonable person would accept?""

"Smacking is harmful to children's mental health and should be banned, school psychologists say. The Association of Educational Psychologists has tabled a motion to the TUC Conference calling for physical punishment to be outlawed. Presently, although corporal punishment is banned in schools, parents can ""smack"" or physically chastise a child as long as it is deemed ""reasonable"". Psychologists say there are many better ways of teaching right from wrong. Member of the AEP national executive committee, John Drewicz, will tell the conference in Manchester: ""Smacking is harmful to a child's mental health, it models aggressive behaviour and it says to them that it is OK to use violence."" He will add: ""Sixty countries already have full bans, including Sweden, Ireland, Spain, Germany and Portugal, and it is time to make violence against children illegal in the UK in all settings, including the home."" Kirstie Allsopp: 'I smashed my kids' iPads' Why I was ashamed of my son's behaviour Schools: How strict is too strict? The motion also notes that the Welsh government is taking steps towards removing the defence of reasonable chastisement for parents. But some campaigners have argued that parents would be criminalised if a smacking ban were to be passed. There are also moves in the Scottish Parliament to ban physical chastisement of children. A bill, lodged by Green MSP John Finnie, has been backed by the government and looks certain to pass at Holyrood. Psychologists cite research suggesting that when force is used by parents, there are changes in their brain activity which mean the degree of force used on the child can escalate. They argue that physical chastisement also leads to a lower quality of parent-child relationship, poorer mental health in childhood and adulthood, as well as higher levels of aggression in the child and more anti-social behaviour. The biggest teaching union, the National Education Union, is seconding the motion. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the union, said parents and carers had a right to set boundaries for their children to help them develop social skills and good behaviour. ""However, we need to ensure that children are legally safeguarded in their own homes. ""We are not talking about dictating to parents how this is done but what we are saying is that it in 2018 beating children in anger, or as part of a pre-meditated punishment, is neither acceptable or defensible."" Sue Atkins, a parenting expert and former head teacher, said studies had shown that using physical force on children had caused anxiety and depression and damaged their self-esteem. But Dr Stuart Waiton, a sociologist and campaigner at Be Reasonable Scotland, said parents did many things to children which if they were done to adults would be classed as unlawful. He said: ""What about grounding a child? If you grounded an adult it would be a criminal offence.""

"Police released CCTV showing the two men at Gatwick Airport When the UK authorities announced on Wednesday that they suspected two alleged Russian agents in the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, they released CCTV images of the suspects arriving at Gatwick airport. Two of the images, framed side by side, began to spread on social media, driven by pro-Russia conspiracy theorists and suspected troll accounts. They showed the alleged agents - Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - passing through a non-return gate at the airport. The images had identical timestamps. How could two men be in exactly the same place at the same time, a flood of tweets asked. Speaking on state TV, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed that either ""the date and the exact time were superimposed on the image"" or that Russian intelligence officers had ""mastered the skill of walking simultaneously"". Her remarks were echoed by pro-Kremlin accounts on Twitter and on the messaging app Telegram, which is popular in Russia. Users suggested the CCTV images had been manipulated. They mocked the British authorities and alleged it was an MI6 operation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Soon it would not necessarily matter that the background of the CCTV images were not identical; that the camera was at a different angle; that Google Maps shows that the non-return gates at Gatwick are a series of near-identical corridors that the two men could easily have passed down, adjacent to one another, at the same time. What would matter would be that some people following the story would begin to question what was real and what wasn't. Some might even begin to question the very idea that there was a real, reliable version of events at all. A still from Google maps, showing the exit gates at Gatwick airport Russia denies any involvement in the Skripal case, and its embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC, but analysts say the Russian state is now the chief exponent of a new kind of information warfare. A loosely-defined network of Russian state actors, state-controlled media, and armies of social media bots and trolls is said to work in unison to spread and amplify multiple narratives and conspiracies around cases like the Skripal poisoning. The goal is no longer to deny or disprove an official version of events, it is to flood the zone with so many competing versions that nothing seems to make sense. ""What is really striking is that you no longer see the Russian machine pushing a single message, it pushes dozens of messages,"" said Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies Russian disinformation. ""The idea is to confuse people."" Other theories circulating on Wednesday included a claim that the suspects were British actors, stars of a (non-existent) KGB spy series broadcast on British television in the 2000s. Another suggested the attempted assassination in Salisbury, and the deaths of other Russian nationals in Britain, were part of an MI6 plot. ""Why do all these horrible events only happen in Britain?"" asked Andrei Klimov, a Russian member of parliament, on state TV. Salisbury: Russian nationals named as suspects On the trail of Novichok suspects What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? ""The more different theories you put out, the more different Google results you're going to get,"" said Mr Nimmo. ""So instead of seeing two or three different versions of the story you're seeing 20 or 30. And for someone who is not following the story regularly that becomes more and more confusing until they give up. And at that point, the Russian disinformation has had its effect."" Early evidence of the tactic can be traced back to the 2000s but it first drew serious international attention in 2014, when Malaysian Airlines flight MH-17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing 298 people. The available evidence pointed to a Russian-supplied surface-to-air missile fired from rebel-held territory in east Ukraine. Russia had already been accused of deploying crude disinformation techniques around its actions in east Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea, but its response to being linked to the downing of MH-17 appeared to be much more co-ordinated - the ""tipping point where Russian information warfare kicked into high gear"", Mr Nimmo said. This video can not be played Skripal poisoning: On the trail of Novichok suspects In the days and months after the aircraft was shot down, Russian state media and pro-Kremlin social media accounts pushed out a raft of different and wildly contradictory theories: that a Ukrainian Su-25 combat aircraft had been picked up by radar near MH-17; that video evidence showed a missile being fired from government, not separatist, territory; that Ukrainian fighters had mistaken MH-17 for Vladimir Putin's plane in an assassination attempt; that the CIA was behind it. ""MH-17 is really the classic example,"" said Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher on computational propaganda at the University of Oxford. ""You saw a whole series of different conspiracies and competing narratives emerge, attached to various hashtags and social media campaigns. The goal was to confuse people, to polarise them, to push them further and further away from reality."" The tactic expanded and evolved in the years after the MH-17 attack, with Russia linked to disinformation campaigns around its actions in Syria, the 2016 US election, the murder of Boris Nemtsov, and a UK inquiry into the murder of former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko in London. This video can not be played Salisbury Novichok suspects: What does Russia's media think? A key component in more recent alleged Russian disinformation campaigns has been the use of humour and ridicule. When a UK inquiry found in 2016 that Russian president Vladimir Putin ""probably approved"" the murder of Litvinenko, a hashtag - #putinprobablyapproved - spread through Twitter, with tweets suggesting Mr Putin had ""probably approved"" the assassination of JFK, the invasion of Iraq, climate change and more. In the hours after the UK named the suspects in the Skripal case, a flood of near-identical tweets used pictures of comedians, historical figures and Hollywood spies - from Joseph Stalin to Jason Bourne - in place of the suspects, in an attempt to ridicule the UK's announcement. The official account of the Russian embassy in London even joined in, posting an image of the two Skripal suspects allegedly carrying the Novichok toxin alongside a picture of British police in biohazard suits, asking users to ""spot the difference"". On Russian state news bulletins, anchors reported the news with a mixture of disbelief and sarcasm. ""The strategy is optimised for the internet, it's meant to go viral,"" said Mr Nimmo. ""That's why mockery and sarcasm and attempts at funny memes are so much a part of this ... It is disinformation for the information age."" Allow Twitter content?

In 2015, the European Union was sufficiently alarmed by Russian disinformation that it created a task force - the East Stratcom team - directed solely at counteracting the perceived threat. The small team attempts to debunk fake stories in real time, but it is reportedly vastly outmatched by the amount of material coming its way. Peter Wilson, the UK ambassador to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said earlier this year the OPCW had counted more than 30 different Russian theories swirling around the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. The effectiveness and reach of this type of disinformation operation in the West is debatable. A YouGov poll conducted earlier this year found that 75% of Britons believed that the Russian state was behind the Skripal poisoning, while just 5% said they thought Russia was innocent. But the sheer volume of Russian disinformation being exported abroad remained a major cause for concern, said one EU official who works on the issue but was not authorised to speak about it publicly. ""Some people like to think this tactic was used around Brexit and it went away, or it was used around Skripal and went away, but it's happening 24/7,"" he said. ""Others also use disinformation, of course ... But this aggression, this exporting of information narratives abroad, this is really something where Russia is number one in the world.""

"This video can not be played 'I earned more as a student than I have since' The substantial impact of the financial crisis has left people's wages 3% below what they were a decade ago, new research reveals. The analysis done for the BBC by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that on average people's real annual wages are Â£800 lower. And that people who are aged between 30 and 39 now are earning Â£2,100 a year less than people of the same age group in 2008. That's a drop of 7.2%. For those in their 20s, the decline is 5%, compared with the drop for the over-60s in work of 0.7%, or Â£130. At the time of the financial crisis in 2008, the average wage was Â£24,100. In 2017, it was Â£23,300. Carney warns against complacency on 10th anniversary of financial crisis Who was to blame for the financial crisis? This video can not be played A decade on from the global financial crisis, families are still feeling the effects. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: ""The average earnings of those in their 20s and 30s fell especially sharply in the immediate aftermath of the recession, perhaps as employers were able to cut starting wages more than wages of those already in work."" While this age group has seen earnings grow in recent years, it has not been ""enough to make up for initial losses,"" he said. Mr Johnson added: ""Pensioners have done much better than younger people on average. In part this is because they are less reliant on earnings and so haven't suffered from falls in earnings."" In addition, however, ""government has chosen to protect the state pensions and other benefits received by pensioners,"" Mr Johnson said. Even more stark is the analysis from the IFS that, if wage growth trends between 1998 and 2008 had continued, people would on average be earning Â£3,500 more. That's 15% higher than today's average figure. Homes:House prices in London and the south east may have risen sharply in the decade since the crisis. But in large swathes of the UK prices have still not recovered to the levels seen in 2008. Savings:The last decade has been a disaster for Britain's savers, especially many elderly people who rely on their savings income. Savers who once enjoyed rates of 5%-plus now get a fraction of that. Borrowing:Average household debt has climbed from less than Â£3,000 to Â£4,000 in the last decade. There are lots of reasons for this, not least the easy credit available through plastic cards. Banking:The way we bank has completely changed. Challenger banks have emerged, and mobile technology means we increasingly sort our finances using phones. But online banking has brought branch closures - and cyber-attacks. Read our report on a decade of changes ""We should never stop reminding ourselves just what an astonishing decade we have just lived through, and continue to live through,"" said Mr Johnson. ""The UK economy has broken record after record, and not generally in a good way. ""Record low earnings growth, record low interest rates, record public borrowing followed by record cuts in public spending. ""On the upside employment levels are remarkably high and, in spite of how it may feel, the gap between rich and poor has actually narrowed somewhat, but the gap between old and young has grown and grown."" A regional breakdown of the effect of the financial crisis on wages shows that London, the East Midlands and the south-west of England have been worst hit. The IFS said that the financial crisis of a decade ago sparked the deepest recession since the Second World War and had been remarkable for the ""persistence of its effects"". Economic growth is still low by historic standards and the total debts of the government have grown by Â£1tn. The public spending cuts pushed through by the governments of 2010 and 2015 were ""historically unprecedented"" the IFS said. The government has said that there are now record levels of employment and that the introduction of the National Living Wage and tax cuts had helped support many millions of working people. The deficit - that is the difference between what the government spends on services and receives in tax revenues - has also been substantially reduced. How did the crisis affect your finances?

"Watch out for Bronagh, Kevin, or Idris - they could prove dangerous. The three names are included in the 21 storm names announced for the 2018/19 season by the Met Office and Met Ãireann. This is the fourth year that names have been used for storms that hit Ireland and Britain. The names are chosen by the public in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and are aimed at raising awareness of severe weather. Why do storms need names?,external A history of UK named storms ""Naming storms has been proved to raise awareness of severe weather in the UK and Ireland, providing a consistent message to the public and crucially prompting people to take action to prevent harm to themselves or to their property"" said Derrick Ryall from the Met Office. Previous names have included Aileen, Brian, and Fionn in 2017/18. Storms are named when there is a risk of medium to high impacts from wind, rain, or snow. They are sparked when warning levels reach 'Amber' in the UK and 'Status Orange' in the Republic of Ireland. The letters Q, U, X, Y, and Z are omitted to conform to international storm naming conventions. According to research from the Met Office 77% of people found naming storms useful for making the public aware of severe weather. It also found that 63% of people agreed that storm naming was useful for letting them know when to take action or prepare in advance. Eight storms were named last year, from Aileen in September to Hector in June. In addition, there was also ex-hurricane Ophelia in October but that storm was named by the National Hurricane Center.

"NHS staff are encouraged to have the vaccination to protect patients and the public An enhanced flu jab for elderly people will save hundred of lives this winter, according to Public Health England. Flu is far more dangerous in old age. The effectiveness of flu jabs notoriously declines as people get older and waseffective in just one in 10 over-65s last winter,external. The enhanced vaccine that will be given this year contains extra ingredients designed to help aged immune systems develop a stronger defence against flu. It is hoped the ""adjuvanted vaccine"" will help ease pressures on the health service. Public Health England estimates the vaccine will lead to: 30,000 fewer GP appointments 2,000 fewer people needing hospital care 700 fewer deaths from flu Prof Paul Cosford, from Public Health England, told the BBC: ""This looks like it is going to be is a significant improvement and quite a step in our battle against flu each winter."" The vaccine will also be offered to the over-65s in Wales and Northern Ireland as well as the over-75s in Scotland. The over-65s vaccine will protect against three strains of flu, but people under 65, in the so-called at-risk groups, will be offered a vaccine that protects against four types of flu. At-risk groups include pregnant women and those with long-term health conditions. Meanwhile, the childhood vaccination programme will be expanded so children from age two up to Year 5 in primary school are offered a flu nasal spray. Children are seen as flu ""super-spreaders"" - in part due to worse hygiene - so the childhood programme is designed to protect both children and anyone they come into contact with. In total, 24 million people in England will be offered the flu vaccine - 3 million more than last winter. But a major sticking point for health officials remains the roughly one-in-three NHS staff who do not get vaccinated. Prof Cosford said staff had a ""professional duty"" to be vaccinated to protect their patients. Prof Jane Cummings, chief nurse for England, said up to half of flu cases had no symptoms so she expected staff to be vaccinated. She said: ""Faced with the worst flu season in a decade, NHS staff last winter did a remarkable job providing care for patients. ""This year, the public will be better protected from flu than ever before, with at-risk groups being offered the most effective vaccine available and every member of NHS staff expected to get their jab."" Chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies said: ""Getting the flu vaccine is the single best way to protect yourself against this potentially fatal illness, and this year, the NHS is offering it to 24 million people across the country.

"Police released CCTV showing the two men at Gatwick Airport When the UK authorities announced on Wednesday that they suspected two alleged Russian agents in the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, they released CCTV images of the suspects arriving at Gatwick airport. Two of the images, framed side by side, began to spread on social media, driven by pro-Russia conspiracy theorists and suspected troll accounts. They showed the alleged agents - Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - passing through a non-return gate at the airport. The images had identical timestamps. How could two men be in exactly the same place at the same time, a flood of tweets asked. Speaking on state TV, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed that either ""the date and the exact time were superimposed on the image"" or that Russian intelligence officers had ""mastered the skill of walking simultaneously"". Her remarks were echoed by pro-Kremlin accounts on Twitter and on the messaging app Telegram, which is popular in Russia. Users suggested the CCTV images had been manipulated. They mocked the British authorities and alleged it was an MI6 operation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Soon it would not necessarily matter that the background of the CCTV images were not identical; that the camera was at a different angle; that Google Maps shows that the non-return gates at Gatwick are a series of near-identical corridors that the two men could easily have passed down, adjacent to one another, at the same time. What would matter would be that some people following the story would begin to question what was real and what wasn't. Some might even begin to question the very idea that there was a real, reliable version of events at all. A still from Google maps, showing the exit gates at Gatwick airport Russia denies any involvement in the Skripal case, and its embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC, but analysts say the Russian state is now the chief exponent of a new kind of information warfare. A loosely-defined network of Russian state actors, state-controlled media, and armies of social media bots and trolls is said to work in unison to spread and amplify multiple narratives and conspiracies around cases like the Skripal poisoning. The goal is no longer to deny or disprove an official version of events, it is to flood the zone with so many competing versions that nothing seems to make sense. ""What is really striking is that you no longer see the Russian machine pushing a single message, it pushes dozens of messages,"" said Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies Russian disinformation. ""The idea is to confuse people."" Other theories circulating on Wednesday included a claim that the suspects were British actors, stars of a (non-existent) KGB spy series broadcast on British television in the 2000s. Another suggested the attempted assassination in Salisbury, and the deaths of other Russian nationals in Britain, were part of an MI6 plot. ""Why do all these horrible events only happen in Britain?"" asked Andrei Klimov, a Russian member of parliament, on state TV. Salisbury: Russian nationals named as suspects On the trail of Novichok suspects What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? ""The more different theories you put out, the more different Google results you're going to get,"" said Mr Nimmo. ""So instead of seeing two or three different versions of the story you're seeing 20 or 30. And for someone who is not following the story regularly that becomes more and more confusing until they give up. And at that point, the Russian disinformation has had its effect."" Early evidence of the tactic can be traced back to the 2000s but it first drew serious international attention in 2014, when Malaysian Airlines flight MH-17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing 298 people. The available evidence pointed to a Russian-supplied surface-to-air missile fired from rebel-held territory in east Ukraine. Russia had already been accused of deploying crude disinformation techniques around its actions in east Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea, but its response to being linked to the downing of MH-17 appeared to be much more co-ordinated - the ""tipping point where Russian information warfare kicked into high gear"", Mr Nimmo said. This video can not be played Skripal poisoning: On the trail of Novichok suspects In the days and months after the aircraft was shot down, Russian state media and pro-Kremlin social media accounts pushed out a raft of different and wildly contradictory theories: that a Ukrainian Su-25 combat aircraft had been picked up by radar near MH-17; that video evidence showed a missile being fired from government, not separatist, territory; that Ukrainian fighters had mistaken MH-17 for Vladimir Putin's plane in an assassination attempt; that the CIA was behind it. ""MH-17 is really the classic example,"" said Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher on computational propaganda at the University of Oxford. ""You saw a whole series of different conspiracies and competing narratives emerge, attached to various hashtags and social media campaigns. The goal was to confuse people, to polarise them, to push them further and further away from reality."" The tactic expanded and evolved in the years after the MH-17 attack, with Russia linked to disinformation campaigns around its actions in Syria, the 2016 US election, the murder of Boris Nemtsov, and a UK inquiry into the murder of former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko in London. This video can not be played Salisbury Novichok suspects: What does Russia's media think? A key component in more recent alleged Russian disinformation campaigns has been the use of humour and ridicule. When a UK inquiry found in 2016 that Russian president Vladimir Putin ""probably approved"" the murder of Litvinenko, a hashtag - #putinprobablyapproved - spread through Twitter, with tweets suggesting Mr Putin had ""probably approved"" the assassination of JFK, the invasion of Iraq, climate change and more. In the hours after the UK named the suspects in the Skripal case, a flood of near-identical tweets used pictures of comedians, historical figures and Hollywood spies - from Joseph Stalin to Jason Bourne - in place of the suspects, in an attempt to ridicule the UK's announcement. The official account of the Russian embassy in London even joined in, posting an image of the two Skripal suspects allegedly carrying the Novichok toxin alongside a picture of British police in biohazard suits, asking users to ""spot the difference"". On Russian state news bulletins, anchors reported the news with a mixture of disbelief and sarcasm. ""The strategy is optimised for the internet, it's meant to go viral,"" said Mr Nimmo. ""That's why mockery and sarcasm and attempts at funny memes are so much a part of this ... It is disinformation for the information age."" Allow Twitter content?

In 2015, the European Union was sufficiently alarmed by Russian disinformation that it created a task force - the East Stratcom team - directed solely at counteracting the perceived threat. The small team attempts to debunk fake stories in real time, but it is reportedly vastly outmatched by the amount of material coming its way. Peter Wilson, the UK ambassador to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said earlier this year the OPCW had counted more than 30 different Russian theories swirling around the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. The effectiveness and reach of this type of disinformation operation in the West is debatable. A YouGov poll conducted earlier this year found that 75% of Britons believed that the Russian state was behind the Skripal poisoning, while just 5% said they thought Russia was innocent. But the sheer volume of Russian disinformation being exported abroad remained a major cause for concern, said one EU official who works on the issue but was not authorised to speak about it publicly. ""Some people like to think this tactic was used around Brexit and it went away, or it was used around Skripal and went away, but it's happening 24/7,"" he said. ""Others also use disinformation, of course ... But this aggression, this exporting of information narratives abroad, this is really something where Russia is number one in the world.""

"Adverts for Vodafone broadband have been banned for misleading customers over speeds and reductions in bills. The television and radio ads, featuring actor Martin Freeman, stated: ""Vodafone guarantee your home broadband speeds or money off until it's fixed."" But the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld complaints - including from rival BT - that the claims could not be substantiated. Vodafone said it was ""disappointed"" by the ASA's ruling to ban the ads. The ads featured Mr Freeman playing an online video game, only to have his internet ""drop out"" at a key moment. His opponent in the game tells him to ""just get Vodafone"" and on-screen text tells viewers they can claim a discount if speeds are below certain thresholds. And Vodafone's website stated: ""Our Ultimate Speed Guarantee means you get the best broadband speed available to you, or we'll give you a discount off your monthly bill until we can get you there."" But the ASA said consumers would interpret the ads to mean that Vodafone could guarantee minimum speeds fast enough to avoid common issues such as buffering. The regulator said customers experiencing buffering and lower speeds might not qualify for the discount on bills. The ASA said that it had told Vodafone to ensure its advertising did not mislead customers in the future. A Vodafone spokeswoman said the company was ""disappointed"" by the ruling and added the ASA had ""misunderstood"" the offer. She said the guarantee ""is still unmatched in the market as no other major brand offers a promise like this across their entire range, nor do they apply discounts directly to customers' bills if they don't deliver"".

"This video can not be played President Vladimir Putin says the suspects are civilians The two suspects in the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter are civilians, not criminals, Russian President Vladimir Putin says. The UK government had named them as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, and said they were from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU. Mr Putin said he hoped the men would tell their story soon. Downing Street said that Russia has repeatedly been asked to account for what happened in Salisbury. The prime minister's official spokesman said that Moscow ""had replied with obfuscation and lies"". ""I have seen nothing to suggest that has changed,"" the spokesman said. Meanwhile, Security Minister Ben Wallace - speaking in the Commons - suggested there had been failures in the baggage checks before the two suspects boarded a plane from Russia to the UK. He added there was ""no doubt"" there would have been some checks on the Russian side of their journey but ""the baggage checks weren't probably as good as they might be"". Mr Skripal and Yulia were poisoned in Salisbury in the UK in March. ""We know who they are, we have found them,"" Mr Putin said in the far eastern city of Vladivostok. ""I hope they will turn up themselves and tell everything. This would be best for everyone. ""There is nothing special there, nothing criminal, I assure you. We'll see in the near future,"" he added. BBC Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford called Mr Putin's words a ""tantalising hint"" that the two men will speak ""very soon"". ""But the question of course is who will we see because don't forget that, in the UK, the suspicion is that the two names that were given are in fact aliases,"" our correspondent added. Russian state TV says one of the suspects, Mr Petrov, told the channel he might comment publicly on the case next week. By BBC Monitoring Within minutes, Putin's remarks became top news on Russian TV, which called them ""simply sensational"". On state TV's Channel One, a talk show speculated whether Theresa May would resign upon seeing that Petrov and Boshirov are not Russian hitmen after all, or whether the British government would come up with more ""lies"" to denigrate Russia. Rossiya 1, another government-run TV channel, showed a beaming commentator saying he was ""full of admiration for how Vladimir Putin is doing it"", as the studio erupted in applause. But the Kremlin's media machine suggested the most exciting news is yet to come - when the two suspects appear on TV in person and deal the final blow to accusations of Russia's involvement in the poisoning. Scotland Yard and the UK's Crown Prosecution Service have said there is enough evidence to charge the men, who are understood to have travelled to London from Moscow on 2 March on Russian passports. Two days later, police say they sprayed the nerve agent, Novichok, on the front door of Mr Skripal's home in the Wiltshire city of Salisbury, before travelling home to Russia later that day. What happened to the Skripals? The new Russian disinformation game Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far What is the GRU? UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid has warned the men, thought to be aged about 40, will be caught and prosecuted if they ever step out of Russia. The CPS is not applying to Russia for the extradition of the two men, as Russia does not extradite its own nationals. But a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case they travel to the EU. This video can not be played On the trail of Russians Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who UK police believe carried out a nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018 Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident in the city of Salisbury. He was later discharged from hospital, as were the Skripals. Police are linking the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June, when Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley became unwell at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles away. Ms Sturgess died in hospital on 8 July. Mr Putin said his government had found the pair and hoped they would appear soon and tell their story UK police said the two men arrived at Gatwick Airport from Moscow on 2 March and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London. On 4 March they travelled to Salisbury - having also visited for reconnaissance the previous day - where Mr Skripal's front door was contaminated with Novichok. Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew back to Moscow from Heathrow later that night. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in. Police said Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley were later exposed to Novichokafter handling a contaminated container, labelled as Nina Ricci Premier Jour perfume. Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing the small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put bottle and applicator together and got some of the contents on himself. His partner, Ms Sturgess, applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. The attack in Salisbury prompted an international row, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, including the US, while Moscow expelled diplomats in response. Last month the US confirmed it was implementing fresh sanctions against Russia over the incident. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has also said Britain will push for the EU to agree new sanctions. Since the UK named the two suspects, US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed that the Russian government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning of the Skripals and have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. In response, Russia accused the British authorities of Russophobia, misleading the international community and UK citizens and of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"".

"Boris Johnson was among leading Tory MPs present to endorse the launch of the report Boris Johnson and other leading Tory Brexiteers have attacked Theresa May's Brexit plan at an event putting the economic case for leaving the EU without an agreement on trade. TheEconomists For Free Trade report,externalsaid the UK had ""nothing to fear"" from a ""clean break"" from the EU and using World Trade Organisation rules. This could give an Â£80bn boost to the tax base and cut prices by 8%, it said. But the claims were branded ""Project Fantasy"" by Labour MP Chuka Umunna. And Chancellor Philip Hammond said the economic assumptions behind the analysis were ""not sustainable"" and out of line with other forecasts. Reality Check: The case for a 'clean-break' Brexit Mr Hammond, who earlier on Tuesday announced Bank of England Governor Mark Carney would be extending his contract until January 2020 to provide continuity after Brexit, has issued a fresh warning of ""some turbulence"" if the UK left the EU in March without a deal. Ministers have said reaching a general agreement on future economic co-operation with the EU is in the UK's interests before it leaves on 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU are hoping to agree a way forward next month, at the same time as they settle the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the bloc, including a transition period up to the end of 2020. Carney to stay at Bank of England till 2020 At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? Mr Johnson and other Conservative MPs opposed to Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU are facing growing pressure to provide an alternative plan. Mr Johnson, who made a surprise appearance at the launch of the report in Westminster, said Mrs May's Chequers plan would mean ""abandoning our seat around the table in Brussels and continuing to accept the single market legislation"". He added: ""That seems to me to be a particular economic risk in Chequers and makes it substantially worse than the status quo."" By the BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason In Committee Room 9, the glitterati of the Brexiteer establishment. This was a gig with two key messages: banishing the bogeyman, as they see it, of WTO rules; they can be embraced, not fled from. Oh, and the government's Chequers plan is terrible. Boris Johnson and David Davis were both there, and recipients of applause for being willing to leave the cabinet on principle. Other stalwarts of the Eurosceptic army joined the crowd: Bill Cash, Iain Duncan Smith, and from the business world, Richard Tice and John Mills. This was not about sticking two fingers up to the EU. Plenty in the room argued that leaving the EU on WTO terms next March would be fine, but preferred reaching a withdrawal agreement, and securing a transition period. During this transition a looser long term relationship could be negotiated with Brussels, which they want to be a souped-up version of the free trade agreement between Canada and the EU. Jacob Rees-Mogg said the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs he chairs would spell out its solution to the issue of avoiding a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland at a meeting on Wednesday. ""Leaving on a world trade deal is a perfectly sensible thing to do but I think we can do better,"" he added. He said the UK should ""negotiate the 'Canada plus' deal now which is being offered by the EU and has been offered from an early stage"". ""Canada plus"", a free trade pact along the lines of the EU's 2016 agreement with Canada but with deeper ties, has been rejected by Theresa May and Chancellor Philip Hammond, who says it will hit jobs, trade and growth. The UK is set to quit the single market but Mrs May wants British manufacturers to continue to have full access to European markets for their goods through a free trade zone - which would see the UK sign up to a common rule book. The Treasury has warned that a no-deal Brexit could result in Â£80bn extra borrowing by 2030 The so-called Chequers plan is unpopular with many Tory MPs, who argue it would compromise the UK's sovereignty, and Economists For Free Trade, led by Professor Patrick Minford. said the evidence showed it was not necessary to enjoy preferential market status to trade successfully with the EU. In the past 25 years, it said the UK had been ""heavily outperformed"" by countries outside the single market trading with the EU on WTO rules, such as the United States, India and China. During that period, it said the aggregate export growth of WTO countries had been four times larger than the growth of UK exports into the single market. At the same time, it said British exports to the rest of the world had grown more than three times faster than to the EU. The group of economists said it was wrong to characterise leaving the EU without a trade agreement in place as ""crashing out"" without a deal, because the UK and the European Commission would have a duty to reach a series of individual agreements in areas such as aviation and energy. ""We have nothing to fear from trading on WTO terms,"" it said. ""Let Brexit mean Brexit and let us flourish under the auspices of the WTO."" Â£200m land sale to test Brexit effect November Brexit deal is doable - Barnier May plans to 'keep calm and carry on' Outside the EU, the report argues, the UK would be free to set its own tariffs on imports and if these were eliminated, it could reduce prices for consumers by as much as 8%. with those on low incomes benefiting the most from cheaper food and clothing. On the other hand, it said if the EU chose to impose import tariffs on popular items, the UK could reciprocate and its large trade surplus with the UK could result in an annual boost to the UK Exchequer of as much as Â£13bn. But Mr Hammond suggested the report over-estimated the economic benefit to the UK of removing tariffs on EU imports as well as ""implausibly"" assuming there would be no new non-tariff barriers in the event of a no-deal exit nor additional burdens on financial services firms. ""The model makes no allowance for differences in quality and safety of imported goods... and it assumes all standards on imported goods will be abolished,"" he told the Lords economic affairs committee. ""I'm sure the model is very effective but the assumptions that it makes are widely out of line with assumptions used by other economic models and frankly, I believe, are not sustainable"". Labour's Chuka Umunna, a leading member of the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the final deal, said a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK. ""The latest Project Fantasy document from advocates of an ultra-hard Brexit promises to take us to a land of milk-and-honey,"" he said. ""The reality is that, before we have even left, Brexit is forcing up prices in the shops, destabilising our economy and stripping our health service of the doctors and nurses that it so badly needs."" In a related development, the chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's largest car manufacturer, has warned the wrong kind of Brexit deal could cost the firm Â£1.2bn and result in jobs being moved abroad. Dr Ralph Speth told a conference in Birmingham that unrestricted access to the single market was vital for his business and ""any friction at the border puts business at jeopardy"".

"Jacob Rees-Mogg launching the report produced by Economists for Free Trade A group of Tory MPs has endorsed a plan for a ""clean break"" from the European Union (EU), with the UK defaulting to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules when it leaves the EU. The proposals arecontained in a report,externalby the pressure group Economists for Free Trade (EFT). Here's an initial look at a few of the claims they've made. These figures are based on a number of calculations and assumptions, not all of which stand up to scrutiny. Those who have modelled a clean Brexit properly, the EFT asserts, report long-term gains from free trade of 2%-4% of GDP. The report dismisses alternative modelling - done by the Treasury and by Whitehall's Cross Departmental Brexit Analysis - which arrived at very different conclusions. But that is part of the problem. The EFT are convinced that they are the only people who have modelled the data correctly - even though theirs is a minority view. ""The vast majority of economists think it will be different,"" says Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex. ""Because a hard Brexit will cut trade with the EU, which is by far our largest trading partner, significantly."" Chequers plan 'worse than status quo' What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Last year,externalthe UK exported almost Â£274bn in goods and services to the EU, compared with Â£112bn to the US. When it comes to imports, the UK imported Â£341bn in goods and services from the EU and Â£70bn from the US. For those who love the detail,here,externalis one example of economists who criticise the EFT's methodology. Tory supporters of Brexit are, however, unbowed: ""Perhaps it's our fault,"" says leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, ""by not putting the argument for a world trade deal earlier, we left the running to people who don't want us to leave the EU at all."" The EFT report also says the UK would no longer have to pay a net amount of Â£12bn to the EU every year, although that figure appears to be slightly inflated. According to the Treasury,externalnet payments to the EU amounted to Â£9.6bn in 2016 and Â£8.9bn in 2017. Forecasts over the next five years suggest that - if the UK were to stay in the EU - net payments to the EU would rise to roughly Â£11bn a year. The EFT report goes on to suggest that the UK could choose to withhold ""most or all"" of the estimated Â£39bn financial settlement that the government has provisionally agreed to pay the EU as part of a Withdrawal Agreement. In theory, the UK could do that, but it would probably prompt a legal challenge from the EU, and it would certainly damage relations severely at a time when - as the EFT report suggests - the government would be looking for co-operation in a whole series of policy areas. It says only 4% of goods arriving in the UK from non-EU countries are subject to checks, and it suggests that trade with the EU in future could therefore be almost as seamless as it is now. It's correct that very few physical or documentary checks are carried out on non-EU goods. But evidence given to the Home Affairs Select Committee suggests that things are rather more complicated than that. If a lorry arrives at Dover, for example, from a non-EU country, it is usually delayed by 60 to 90 minutes even if no checks are made. The UK could choose to speed up that process and abolish many checks, but there would still be far more checks on UK goods being exported to the EU via Dover. Lorries from outside the EU have to wait up to 90 minutes even if no checks are made There would also be further complications for UK exports. Once the UK is designated as a third country by the EU, all UK exports of animal origin would only be able to enter EU territory via a veterinary border inspection post, where there are often time-consuming physical inspections as well as documentary checks. Neither the Eurotunnel nor the Calais port is currently designated as a veterinary border inspection post. The EFT report says that under WTO rules sanitary and phytosanitary measures (ie safety checks on food) can't be used as a ""surreptitious means of inhibiting cross-border trade"". This is true, but that does not erase what are known as non-tariff-barriers entirely, it simply reduces inspections where possible. ""The only countries that have managed to remove the need for health checks on food being exported to the EU,"" says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, ""are the European Economic Area members and Switzerland. They have not only implemented EU rules in this area domestically, they also apply EU checks on all imports of animal origin entering from the rest of the world."" The EFT report also suggests lifting tariffs (or import charges) on imported goods to make prices cheaper. It recognises that if you do that for one country, you have to do it for every country, under WTO rules. If tariffs were removed for all agricultural produce, cheap imports would flood in and food prices would fall - but the UK farming industry could be decimated. The report claims lifting some tariffs could reduce food prices So, the report says, that ""perhaps the most attractive goods to target"" might be ones that we don't produce in the UK at all. It mentions oranges as one example, but it would be a pretty limited number of goods. Again, others are extremely sceptical about the EFT's policy proposals. According to a report published earlier this year by the House of Lords European Union Committee, ""EU food imports cannot easily be replaced by either producing more in the UK or importing more from non-EU countries"". The Lords report forecast that food prices were likely to rise without a Brexit deal.

"Westminster is buzzing with talk of splits, general elections, second referendums and even the formation of new political parties as Brexit strains traditional loyalties to breaking point. With votes on any deal struck by Theresa May with the EU expected to happen this autumn, here is a guide to the main factions in the Commons: Jeremy Wright and David Lidington - cabinet ministers loyal to the PM Government ministers, basically - there are just over 100 them out of a total of 316 Tory MPs - and those backbenchers who support Theresa May's Brexit policies, or at least are not willing to vote against them and threaten her leadership. Most Tory MPs fall into this category but it is not enough for Mrs May to be sure of winning key Commons votes, even with the support of the DUP's 10 MPs, who unlike Mrs May backed Leave in the EU referendum. Ten members of Mrs May's government have quit in recent months - most of them because they are against her Chequers plan for post-Brexit trade, although Defence Minister Guto Bebb quit because he is in favour of it. Mr Bebb thought she had caved in to the hard Brexiteers (see below) over customs legislation. He has now joined the People's Vote campaign (see below). Kuennsberg: May plans to 'keep calm and carry on' At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Sixty Conservative MPs, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured above), are members of the European Research Group - a pro-Brexit lobby, who are against Theresa May's plans for trading arrangements with the EU. They are well-organised and highly motivated and the PM's continued survival in Number 10 is, largely, in their hands. The rebel ranks were swollen by ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit Secretary David Davis and his deputy Steve Baker, who all quit in protest at her blueprint for post-Brexit trade with the EU hammered out at her country residence Chequers, in July. Mr Baker claims as many as 80 Conservative MPs are prepared to vote against the Chequers plan. He has warned about a ""catastrophic split"" in the Conservative Party if it is not able to unite around a different vision. Mr Johnson has thrown grenades - and a ""suicide vest"" - into the debate from the pages of national newspapers, with increasingly strident attacks on the Chequers proposal, prompting an angry backlash from Theresa May loyalists. May warned of Tory split over Brexit plan Johnson: PM's Brexit plan a 'suicide vest' At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know The Dominic Grieve gang. Like most of his cohorts, who number about a dozen and include former minister Nicky Morgan (seated behind Mr Grieve in the picture above) who led an unsuccessful rebellion in the customs vote, the former attorney general is not a natural rebel. Mr Grieve and his supporters inflicted the government's first Brexit defeat, in December, securing a ""meaningful vote"" for MPs on the final deal with Brussels, but some wonder whether his gang have the killer instinct of their pro-Brexit rivals when that final showdown happens in the autumn. Mr Grievehas said he will quit the party,externalif Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, in reaction to a row over the former foreign secretary's comments about the burka. Government survives key Brexit trade vote Conservative MP Anna Soubry, a close ally of Labour's Chuka Umunna in the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum (see below), has called in the past for the creation of a new centre-ground party. She also backed a call by fellow Conservative Sir Nicholas Soames - a longstanding pro-European and the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill - for a ""government of national unity"", made up of senior figures from different parties to sort out Brexit, although that idea seems to have disappeared from the radar. But it is the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the UK's traditional centre party, who has emerged as the biggest cheerleader for a new centre party. Sir Vince Cable is openly encouraging disaffected anti-Brexit Labour and Tory MPs to form new groups and work with the Lib Dems to colonise what he believes is the vast territory that has opened up in British politics as Labour moves to the left under Jeremy Corbyn and Tory Brexiteers push their party to the right. Sir Vince, who has said he will stand down as Lib Dem leader once Brexit has been ""resolved or stopped"", admits his party, with just 12 MPs, has struggled to achieve the rapid growth in support it wanted despite being the only national party campaigning for a second referendum and has set out plans to transform into a ""movement for moderates"". Cable to quit 'once Brexit resolved' Former Education Secretary Justine Greening is the most senior Conservative to have called for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. She was backed by Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry, and another prominent backbencher, Sarah Wollaston, has also joined the People's Vote campaign. along with Phillip Lee and Guto Bebb. No 10 rejects Greening's referendum call Jeremy Corbyn's supporters insist the party has never been more united behind its leader - despite a bitter and divisive row about anti-Semitism that dragged on for months over the summer. The vast majority of the shadow cabinet - about 30 MPs - and most of the 47 new Labour MPs elected last year, in addition to a handful of long-serving left wing backbenchers, are fiercely loyal to the leader and back his Brexit stance. But many, maybe even the majority, of the 257 Labour MPs, including the self-styled ""moderates"" who served in government during the Blair/Brown era, remain unhappy with the direction the party is going in. Some Corbyn critics have faced no confidence votes from their local parties, a sign they could face de-selection before the next general election. Corbyn critics lose no-confidence votes Blair doubts Labour can be 'taken back' Why Corbyn allies want MP selection change Jeremy Corbyn's backing for Brexit and refusal to throw his weight behind calls for a second referendum, after campaigning for Remain in the referendum, are a major sore point among ""moderate"" Labour MPs, who suspect he remains a Eurosceptic at heart. The cross-party People's Vote campaign for a second referendum is backed by about 30 Labour MPs, including prominent figures such as Chuka Umunna (pictured above), Chris Leslie and Stephen Doughty. They outnumber members of other parties in the group, which also includes Lib Dems, Green MP Caroline Lucas, five Conservative MPs and Plaid Cymru's four MPs. These MPs tend to eschew party labels when commenting on Brexit. The Labour members are in open revolt against their party leadership's opposition to a second referendum - but they insist they are not operating as a party within a party. Chuka Umunna haswritten to members of his local party in Streatham,external, South London, to deny speculation he is involved in talks about the formation of a new party. The idea that the People's Vote is the forerunner of a such a party is ""patently absurd"", he writes. But he has also claimed Jeremy Corbyn's supporters are trying to force ""moderate"" MPs like himself out of Labour, something the party leadership says is simply not the case. Call off the dogs, Umunna tells Corbyn Turn fire outwards, Corbyn urges MPs Like the members of the People's Vote campaign, the SNP's 35 MPs, led by Ian Blackford (pictured) are against Brexit and want the UK to stay in the EU single market and customs union. They have said they won't stand in the way of a second referendum but have not committed to voting for one. One reason for this is that Scotland voted for Remain in 2016 and it did not make any difference to the result. They are likely to vote against anything resembling a ""hard Brexit"". Kate Hoey (pictured), John Mann, Frank Field and Graham Stringer - along with the currently independent Kelvin Hopkins - voted with the government in key Brexit votes, helping to ensure Theresa May's survival. This is the core of a group who say they are standing up for the millions of Labour supporters who voted to Leave the EU. Mr Field has resigned the Labour whip in Parliament - and is fighting to remain a member of the party - after claiming it has become a ""force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". The MP's opponents say he jumped before he was pushed after losing a confidence vote organised by local activists in Birkenhead angry at his support for the government in Brexit votes, which they believe robbed Labour of the chance to force a general election it could have won. Ms Hoey isalso facing callsto be expelled from Labour and has lost a confidence vote in her local Vauxhall Labour Party. Graham Stringer won a confidence vote in his Blackley and Broughton Labour branch.

"Mitiga was closed until recently amid militia clashes in Tripoli The only working airport in Libya's capital, Tripoli, has diverted flights after it came under rocket fire.

"This video can not be played Trump: Puerto Rico hurricane response an ""unsung success"" President Donald Trump has been criticised for hailing the US response to the deadly Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year as ""tremendous"". The mayor of its capital tweeted: ""If he thinks the death of 3,000 people is a success God help us all."" Puerto Rico only finished restoring full power last month, 11 months after the hurricane hit. A recent report says 8% left the island after the hurricane and many died due to poor health care and other services. The island's Governor Ricardo Rossello issued a statement on Tuesday night, describing Maria as ""the worst natural disaster in our modern history. Our basic infrastructure was devastated, thousands of our people lost their lives and many others still struggle"". Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US, is home to some 3.3 million people. He was asked at the White House what lessons could be learned from Hurricane Maria asHurricane Florence bears down on the Carolinas. Maria, he said, was the ""hardest one we had by far because of the island nature"", adding: ""I actually think it was one of the best jobs that's ever been done with respect to what this is all about. This video can not be played Why Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico so hard ""The job that Fema [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] and law enforcement and everybody did working along with the governor in Puerto Rico, I think was tremendous. I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success."" Mr Trump had said recently: ""We have put billions and billions of dollars into Puerto Rico and it was a very tough one. I think most of the people in Puerto Rico really appreciate what we've done."" Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a statement: ""No relationship between a colony and the federal government can ever be called 'successful' because Puerto Ricans lack certain inalienable rights enjoyed by our fellow Americans in the states."" The mayor of the Puerto Rican capital San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, a vocal critic of Mr Trump who earlier described his response to Maria as a ""stain on his presidency"", said his latest comment ""added ""insult to injury"". Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted: ""Nearly 3,000 people died. That is not a 'success'. That is a tragedy and a disgrace."" Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said: ""This is an offensive, hurtful and blatantly false comment from the president."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some Trump supporters on social media accepted there had been failures but said the president had done all he could and that it was Puerto Rican officials who were to blame. Maria made landfall in mid-September last year having just been downgraded to a category four hurricane, with winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) and driving rain. It caused catastrophic damage to the north-eastern Caribbean and was the most intense cyclone worldwide in 2017. Six graphics that sum up Puerto Rico disaster Infrastructure was severely damaged in Puerto Rico and the territory struggled to make repairs to the power grid, only completing the work 11 months later. Maria was estimated to have caused $100bn (Â£77bn) in damage. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

"Food and livestock could be delayed at UK borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the National Audit Office says. The public spending watchdog warns the government has failed to hire enough vets to process exports from the UK in its no-deal preparations. The Department for Food and Rural Affairs says it's preparing for a range of scenarios and has hired extra staff. But the Committee of Public Accounts chairwoman, Labour's Meg Hillier, said: ""We are rapidly running out of time."" National Farmers Union president Minette Batters said the report showed Defra was not ready for a no-deal situation. She warned a ""crash-out scenario"" would be ""Armageddon"" for British farmers, who needed a ""free and frictionless trade deal"" with the EU to operate. Defra is one of the government departments most affected by Brexit. It said the work it was doing would mean that environmental, welfare, and bio-security standards would continue to be met in a way that supported trade and ""the smooth flow of goods."" But the NAO accused it of being unprepared for no deal, saying many of its plans were of ""poor quality"" or lacked maturity. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said Defra was preparing for ""every eventuality"" and increasing the number of vets available. ""We won't have food rotting or animals being destroyed by the side of the road,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. In the interview he was also asked whether a ban on live animal exports would be introduced. The governmentannounced a six-week consultation on the policy in April. Mr Gove said the government was still gathering evidence on any potential ban, adding ""all options are on the table"". He said ""restrictions"" on live animal exports would be introduced but stopped short of confirming that there would be a ban. Labour accused Mr Gove of ""pedalling back on his promise to ban live exports"" and called for the government to clarify its position. A Conservative spokesperson said the party had consistently said it would control the export of live animals after Brexit and a ban remained ""a possibility"". Labour's manifesto did not mention the issue, the spokesperson added. Defra needs vets to process export health certificates, which are used to prove food and livestock exports comply with animal health standards and regulations - a need which is expected to increase if the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal. Without them consignments of food could be delayed at the border or prevented from leaving the UK, the NAO says. It points out that Defra will also have to introduce a UK equivalent for each of 1,400 different versions of the current EU certificates, which currently refer to EU law, and agree these with 154 different countries in order to continue to export to them. The NAO says Defra will simply not be able to reach agreements with all of these countries by March 2019, when Britain is due to leave the European union. This could leave UK firms unable to export to some countries for a period after Brexit, it warns. UK and France fail to agree scallop deal No-deal Brexit 'disastrous' for food firms It comes as Mr Gove introduced a newAgriculture Bill,externalin Parliament, intended to change the way farming subsidies are paid after Brexit. The so-called ""green Brexit"" plan would see farmers paid for ""public goods"" such as improving access to the countryside or taking action to reduce flooding. It also includes plans to make cash available for farmers who invest in new technologies and boost productivity. The existing subsidies paid to farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy will be phased out over seven years. The NAO report also raises concerns about readiness for Brexit in the fishing and chemical manufacturing industries, saying that, while Defra had achieved a great deal, gaps remained. Defra said it had already started to build new IT systems and develop new services to replace those currently provided by the EU and had hired 1,307 more staff for Brexit-related work.

"Lula had a huge lead over all other candidates Former Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has pulled out of next month's presidential election to allow his running mate to stand in his place. Lula had been the frontrunner despite being in jail for a corruption conviction and despite the top electoral court barring his candidacy. With the deadline for the registration of candidates only hours away, he threw his weight behind his Workers' Party colleague Fernando Haddad. The election is on 7 October. It has been a tumultuous election campaign dominated by Lula's legal battles and the stabbing last week of Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right candidate who is second in the polls behind Lula. Mr Bolsonaro was attacked by a lone assailant during a campaign rally and is still in hospital.. The Workers' Party leadership presented a united front With the clock ticking down on a deadline for candidates to be registered, senior members of the Workers' Party gathered in front of the police headquarters where Lula, 72, is serving a 12-year prison sentence for corruption. The party's founder, Luiz Eduardo Greenhalgh, then read out a letter written by Lula in his cell. In it, Lula, who governed from January 2003 until December 2010, said that he had been ""unjustly imprisoned"" before asking ""all who would vote for me to vote for our friend Fernando Haddad for president"". Lula was barred after being convicted on corruption and money laundering charges Lula was barred from running for the presidency under a 2010 law dubbed ""Clean Slate"". It prohibits those who have a criminal conviction which has been upheld on appeal from running for public office. In July 2017, Lula was found guilty of accepting an upgrade to a beachfront flat as a bribe from an engineering firm involved in a major corruption scheme. Lula has always denied any wrongdoing and appealed against the verdict. The appeal was rejected and Lula was given 24 hours to turn himself in. From his cell, Lula has continued the legal fight against his conviction and the ban which prevents him from running for public office. Supporters of Lula have been camped outside the police headquarters where he is jailed The decision was made less than two weeks after Brazil's top electoral court ruled that he was ""ineligible"" to run for the presidency. Lula's legal team has appealed against that decision and the Supreme Court is still due to rule on it. But after a Workers' Party request to extend the deadline to register presidential candidates from the 11 September to 17 September was rejected, its leadership felt it had to act. Not registering Mr Haddad meant that if Lula's appeal were to fail, the party could have been left without a presidential candidate altogether. After Lula backed Mr Haddad in his letter, the party registered him as its new candidate with just hours to spare. The Workers' Party is stressing that a vote for Haddad is a vote for Lula The Workers' Party hopes people who were going to vote for Lula will now vote for Mr Haddad. Lula left office with record approval ratings in 2010 and despite his imprisonment, almost 40% of people asked by polling firm Datafolha said they would vote for him. Mr Haddad, on the other hand, is not very well known outside of SÃ£o Paulo, where he was mayor from 2013 to 2017. In his letter, Lula said that Mr Haddad ""will be my representative in this battle"". ""Our name is now Haddad!"" he wrote. In its first TV spot since Mr Haddad became its presidential candidate, the party also stressed the links between the two men. Both Lula and Mr Haddad appear for the same amount of time and rather than talking about himself, Mr Haddad praises Lula and his achievements. Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent In his letter, Lula says that while a man can be unfairly imprisoned, his ideas cannot be. He's made it clear he will keep fighting for the party from behind bars. Lula asked his supporters to vote for Fernando Haddad but he's a relative unknown, especially in the north-east of the country, a poor part of Brazil that has traditionally been a Lula heartland. There are less than four weeks left until the first round. The latest poll, released by IBOPE on Tuesday evening, suggested that the percentage of voters intending to back far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro had risen to 26%. Mr Haddad isn't doing badly - his share has risen to 8% while other candidates saw their share remain stable or fall. The Workers' Party has adopted a new slogan - ""Haddad is Lula"" - there's no clearer signal that although Lula is out of the race, the country's most popular politician is still in the minds of millions. He was the minister of education during Lula's presidency and is thought to enjoy his trust. He was Lula's vice-presidential running mate until now. Fernando Haddad has not performed well in the polls so far From 2013 to 2017, the 55-year-old also served as mayor of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil's most populous city and faced mass demonstrations against bus fare rises. The Workers' Party hopes that Mr Haddad will get through to the run-off scheduled for 28 October. But Mr Haddad is facing legal problems of his own. Prosecutors allege that during his campaign for mayor his team received a loan from a construction firm which stood to benefit from contracts once he was elected. He has denied any wrongdoing. The most recent poll carried out by research company Ibope between 8 and 11 September suggests the following results for the top five candidates: Jair Bolsonaro (far right, PSL): 26% Ciro Gomes (centre left, PDT): 11% Marina Silva (green, Rede): 9% Geraldo Alckmin (centre right, PSDB): 9% Fernando Haddad (Workers' Party, PT): 8% It is expected that Mr Haddad's share will rise now he is the Workers' Party's official candidate.

"Clinics must make it clear that there is little point in women over 40 freezing their eggs, because the odds of a future pregnancy are very slim, says UK fertility regulator the HFEA. Fertility declines with age, so the optimum time for egg freezing is before a woman turns 35, it says. Yet data shows that the most common age at which women are treated is 38, with many freezing eggs into their 40s. NHS clinics usually have a younger cut-off age, but private ones may not. The women who empty their savings to freeze their eggs Should I freeze my eggs for my 30th birthday? Why I chose to freeze my eggs Women can only get egg freezing on the NHS if it is for medical reasons, such as needing a cancer treatment which may cause them later fertility problems. Private clinics also offer it to women who want it for social reasons, like delaying starting a family because they haven't met the right partner yet. In 2016, 80% of the 1,310 freezing procedures carried out were done in private clinics, The singer Rita Ora froze her eggs in her early 20s Around 890 of all the treatments were for women aged 35 and over, compared with 419 treatments for women younger than this. The HFEA says it is not clear why patients of this age are freezing eggs. Most women freezing eggs using NHS funding were aged below 35, with 89% below 38. It says women must be given clear information about the risks, costs and likely success rates of egg freezing, which is becoming an increasingly popular ""fertility insurance"" back-up plan. Success rates can be low Egg quality and number naturally drops as a woman gets older It is not a simple fix for delaying motherhood NHS funding may be available if you are having medical treatment that affects your fertility Frozen eggs can usually only be stored for 10 years (although there are some exceptions for medical reasons) Egg freezing costs anywhere between Â£2,720 and Â£3,920 per go. Most clinics will include a couple of years of storage in that price, but there may be an extra annual charge of up to Â£350 for that service. The complete cost if you then opt to thaw and use your eggs in a future treatment, is Â£7,000 to Â£8,000. Birth rates from frozen own eggs are increasing but remain below that of conventional IVF treatment cycles, being successful one in every five times, on average, compared to around one in three for ""fresh egg"" IVF. While a woman's age at thaw has relatively little impact on a woman's chances of success, the age at freeze does, with evidence suggesting that if eggs are frozen below the age of 35, the chances of success will be higher than the natural conception rate as the woman gets older, says the HFEA. HFEA Chair Sally Cheshire said: ""Clinics have an ethical responsibility to be clear that egg freezing below the age of 35 offers women their best chance of creating their much longed-for family."" Aileen Feeney from Fertility Network said women should know their fertility ""vital statistics"" 28:35:42: ""By 28, female fertility has already begun to fall; 35, female fertility plummets; 42, your chance of becoming a biological mother is vanishingly small."" Prof Simon Fishel, from the independent IVF provider CARE Fertility Group, said women face a hard choice, knowing that if they freeze eggs early they can still only be stored for 10 years.

"This video can not be played 'I earned more as a student than I have since' The substantial impact of the financial crisis has left people's wages 3% below what they were a decade ago, new research reveals. The analysis done for the BBC by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that on average people's real annual wages are Â£800 lower. And that people who are aged between 30 and 39 now are earning Â£2,100 a year less than people of the same age group in 2008. That's a drop of 7.2%. For those in their 20s, the decline is 5%, compared with the drop for the over-60s in work of 0.7%, or Â£130. At the time of the financial crisis in 2008, the average wage was Â£24,100.

Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: ""The average earnings of those in their 20s and 30s fell especially sharply in the immediate aftermath of the recession, perhaps as employers were able to cut starting wages more than wages of those already in work."" While this age group has seen earnings grow in recent years, it has not been ""enough to make up for initial losses,"" he said. Mr Johnson added: ""Pensioners have done much better than younger people on average. In part this is because they are less reliant on earnings and so haven't suffered from falls in earnings."" In addition, however, ""government has chosen to protect the state pensions and other benefits received by pensioners,"" Mr Johnson said.

"Adverts for Vodafone broadband have been banned for misleading customers over speeds and reductions in bills. The television and radio ads, featuring actor Martin Freeman, stated: ""Vodafone guarantee your home broadband speeds or money off until it's fixed."" But the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld complaints - including from rival BT - that the claims could not be substantiated. Vodafone said it was ""disappointed"" by the ASA's ruling to ban the ads. The ads featured Mr Freeman playing an online video game, only to have his internet ""drop out"" at a key moment. His opponent in the game tells him to ""just get Vodafone"" and on-screen text tells viewers they can claim a discount if speeds are below certain thresholds. And Vodafone's website stated: ""Our Ultimate Speed Guarantee means you get the best broadband speed available to you, or we'll give you a discount off your monthly bill until we can get you there."" But the ASA said consumers would interpret the ads to mean that Vodafone could guarantee minimum speeds fast enough to avoid common issues such as buffering. The regulator said customers experiencing buffering and lower speeds might not qualify for the discount on bills. The ASA said that it had told Vodafone to ensure its advertising did not mislead customers in the future. A Vodafone spokeswoman said the company was ""disappointed"" by the ruling and added the ASA had ""misunderstood"" the offer. She said the guarantee ""is still unmatched in the market as no other major brand offers a promise like this across their entire range, nor do they apply discounts directly to customers' bills if they don't deliver"".

"Bowie pictured on London's Kingly Street, off Carnaby Street in 1963 The first known studio recording of David Bowie has sold for nearly Â£40,000 - four times the estimate. The 1963 demo tape, rejected by Decca, features a 16-year-old Bowie - then known as David Jones - singing I Never Dreamed with first band The Konrads. The 18-minute recording was sold by the band's drummer David Hadfield, who had discovered it in an old bread basket in his loft. Omega Auctions said it sold for a total of Â£39,360 after a ""bidding frenzy"". They had estimated it would reach Â£10,000. David Bowie: A life in pictures How Bowie's career shaped modern pop This video can not be played A clip of a 1963 recording, thought to be the first, of a teenage David Bowie singing Director of Omega Auctions Karen Fairweather said the recording was the last lot of the day, and it had already reached Â£11,000 in pre-bidding before the auction began. The bidding was fierce between two overseas collectors, who did not attend in person, before the winning bid was made. ""There was certainly applause when the hammer went down,"" she said. ""It's a fantastic piece of history."" Auctioneer Paul Fairweather described the tape - thought to be the only copy that exists - as a ""significant recording, completely unique"". He said it offers new insight into Bowie as a ""fledgling musician who would go on to super-stardom."" Promotional sketches by Bowie from when he was in The Konrads, along with photographs and band documents, sold for Â£17,130 and an early 1963 poster of the band went for Â£6,600. All prices include buyers' premium. This picture, showing Bowie performing on saxophone at a youth club at Biggin Hill in May 1963, is believed to be one of the first images of him on stage Bowie was The Konrads' saxophonist but it was decided that he should sing lead vocals for the tape. Hadfield said: ""David had no inclination to become a singer at this point, his heart and mind were focused on becoming a world-class saxophone player. ""Our agent, Eric Easton, who also managed the Rolling Stones, asked us to do a demo so he could try and get us an audition at Decca. ""We had decided that we would do a couple of guitar instrumentals and one original song. ""Decca initially turned us down, but when they eventually gave us an audition later that year, vocalist Roger Ferris was the lead voice and David sang backing harmonies."" Bowie left the band shortly after the audition, which did not result in the band being signed. Bowie performing at a concert in Paris in 2002 He went on to become a solo artist six years later, having changed his surname to Bowie so he didn't get confused with The Monkees' Davy Jones, and gained worldwide success. He died of cancer in January 2016, two days after his 69th birthday - and the release of his 25th studio album.

"A ""naive"" bid by Stagecoach and Virgin to run the Intercity East Coast rail franchise led to its failure, according to MPs. The Transport Select Committee said the two companies' assessment of the financial risk associated with their bid was wholly inadequate. It also says the Department for Transport (DfT) must take the blame for not managing the bid effectively. The rail franchise was taken back under government control in June. The joint venture, known as Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC), 90% owned by Stagecoach and 10% owned by Virgin, took over the franchise in 2015. It estimated that revenues would grow by 10% a year, when in reality they rose by just 3%. The committee's report said: ""There was very little resilience built into the bid by Stagecoach and Virgin and it bid for the franchise on very optimistic grounds. ""This was naÃ¯ve, and it should have been more aware of the financial risks involved."" Transport Secretary Chris Graylingterminated the franchise contract,externalin June this year and created the East Coast Partnership to take over the route. He said at the time: ""Stagecoach and Virgin Trains got their bid wrong and they are now paying a price."" However, Lilian Greenwood, who chairs the transport committee said: ""The Secretary of State pointed the finger at Stagecoach and Virgin for getting their bids wrong, but the department is not blameless. The committee's report said the DfT had not conducted appropriate due diligence that would have spotted the weaknesses of the bid, while the structure of the bid process encouraged overbidding. Ms Greenwood added: ""Even now, there is no concrete plan, nor timescales, for the interim operator of this franchise. ""From our inquiry, we cannot be sure, and cannot reassure passengers or public, that the arrangements for the East Coast Partnership will more successfully overcome the systemic difficulties presented by the current set-up."" The Department of Transport said it ""carried out a rigorous assessment at the time the VTEC franchise was let in 2015 to ensure that the bid was realistic and in the best interests of taxpayers and passengers. ""However, Stagecoach rightly took a degree of risk around their assumptions. The department is continuously improving its risk assessment process to reduce the likelihood of overbidding."" A Stagecoach Group spokesman said it operated railways for the government for more than 20 years and had used the same ""bold, ambitious and meticulous approach which delivered strong success in the past"". ""As the committee makes absolutely clear, there was no incentive to deliberately overbid and there was no taxpayer bailout in the unfortunate premature end to the contract. Most importantly, we are pleased the committee has supported our positive suggestions to reform franchising, including more appropriate risk-sharing, making the system more accountable and robust,"" he added. The London to Edinburgh line links London Kings Cross to the north of England and Scotland. Under VTEC the line made an operating profit of Â£240m a year and had 92% passenger satisfaction, one of the highest levels among the long-distance franchises on the network. Yet the profits was still not enough to cover the premiums it had to pay the DfT, which amounted to Â£3.3bn over the eight year life of the franchise. The line went into technical default in January 2018 and the contract was terminated in June. Virgin and Stagecoach made a loss of some Â£200m from the contract. It was the third franchise failure on this line since 2006. The MPs also exonerated Network Rail from any blame for the collapse of the franchise despitecomments from Virgin's Sir Richard Bransonthat implied the franchise had been hit by delays to improvements to the rail infrastructure. The report said: ""Network Rail does not bear any responsibility for the early termination of this franchise. To date, Network Rail have provided all the infrastructure upgrades that it had formally committed to when this franchise was let.""

"Jacob Rees-Mogg launching the report produced by Economists for Free Trade A group of Tory MPs has endorsed a plan for a ""clean break"" from the European Union (EU), with the UK defaulting to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules when it leaves the EU. The proposals arecontained in a report,externalby the pressure group Economists for Free Trade (EFT). Here's an initial look at a few of the claims they've made. These figures are based on a number of calculations and assumptions, not all of which stand up to scrutiny. Those who have modelled a clean Brexit properly, the EFT asserts, report long-term gains from free trade of 2%-4% of GDP. The report dismisses alternative modelling - done by the Treasury and by Whitehall's Cross Departmental Brexit Analysis - which arrived at very different conclusions. But that is part of the problem. The EFT are convinced that they are the only people who have modelled the data correctly - even though theirs is a minority view. ""The vast majority of economists think it will be different,"" says Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex. ""Because a hard Brexit will cut trade with the EU, which is by far our largest trading partner, significantly."" Chequers plan 'worse than status quo' What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Last year,externalthe UK exported almost Â£274bn in goods and services to the EU, compared with Â£112bn to the US. When it comes to imports, the UK imported Â£341bn in goods and services from the EU and Â£70bn from the US. For those who love the detail,here,externalis one example of economists who criticise the EFT's methodology. Tory supporters of Brexit are, however, unbowed: ""Perhaps it's our fault,"" says leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, ""by not putting the argument for a world trade deal earlier, we left the running to people who don't want us to leave the EU at all."" The EFT report also says the UK would no longer have to pay a net amount of Â£12bn to the EU every year, although that figure appears to be slightly inflated. According to the Treasury,externalnet payments to the EU amounted to Â£9.6bn in 2016 and Â£8.9bn in 2017. Forecasts over the next five years suggest that - if the UK were to stay in the EU - net payments to the EU would rise to roughly Â£11bn a year. The EFT report goes on to suggest that the UK could choose to withhold ""most or all"" of the estimated Â£39bn financial settlement that the government has provisionally agreed to pay the EU as part of a Withdrawal Agreement. In theory, the UK could do that, but it would probably prompt a legal challenge from the EU, and it would certainly damage relations severely at a time when - as the EFT report suggests - the government would be looking for co-operation in a whole series of policy areas. It says only 4% of goods arriving in the UK from non-EU countries are subject to checks, and it suggests that trade with the EU in future could therefore be almost as seamless as it is now. It's correct that very few physical or documentary checks are carried out on non-EU goods. But evidence given to the Home Affairs Select Committee suggests that things are rather more complicated than that. If a lorry arrives at Dover, for example, from a non-EU country, it is usually delayed by 60 to 90 minutes even if no checks are made. The UK could choose to speed up that process and abolish many checks, but there would still be far more checks on UK goods being exported to the EU via Dover. Lorries from outside the EU have to wait up to 90 minutes even if no checks are made There would also be further complications for UK exports. Once the UK is designated as a third country by the EU, all UK exports of animal origin would only be able to enter EU territory via a veterinary border inspection post, where there are often time-consuming physical inspections as well as documentary checks. Neither the Eurotunnel nor the Calais port is currently designated as a veterinary border inspection post. The EFT report says that under WTO rules sanitary and phytosanitary measures (ie safety checks on food) can't be used as a ""surreptitious means of inhibiting cross-border trade"". This is true, but that does not erase what are known as non-tariff-barriers entirely, it simply reduces inspections where possible. ""The only countries that have managed to remove the need for health checks on food being exported to the EU,"" says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, ""are the European Economic Area members and Switzerland. They have not only implemented EU rules in this area domestically, they also apply EU checks on all imports of animal origin entering from the rest of the world."" The EFT report also suggests lifting tariffs (or import charges) on imported goods to make prices cheaper. It recognises that if you do that for one country, you have to do it for every country, under WTO rules. If tariffs were removed for all agricultural produce, cheap imports would flood in and food prices would fall - but the UK farming industry could be decimated. The report claims lifting some tariffs could reduce food prices So, the report says, that ""perhaps the most attractive goods to target"" might be ones that we don't produce in the UK at all. It mentions oranges as one example, but it would be a pretty limited number of goods. Again, others are extremely sceptical about the EFT's policy proposals. According to a report published earlier this year by the House of Lords European Union Committee, ""EU food imports cannot easily be replaced by either producing more in the UK or importing more from non-EU countries"". The Lords report forecast that food prices were likely to rise without a Brexit deal.

"The government's refusal to increase police pay by 3% in England and Wales is a ""punch on the nose"", Britain's most senior police officer has said. Cressida Dick said she was ""extremely disappointed"" by the decision to give police a 2% rise, against the recommendation of an independent board. The Met Police chief said she did not want police to be affected by understaffing like the prison service. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said it had been a collective government decision. ""When it comes to pay recommendationsâ¦ for millions of public sector workersâ¦ you have to, as a government, take them all into account,"" he told the Police Superintendents' Association annual conference in Leicester. Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? Ministers 'unaware of police cuts impact' No-one charged 'in 9 out of 10 crimes' Reality Check: Is police funding falling? Mr Javid said that he understood concerns, however. ""This is a reflection of trying to strike that balance and I'm not pretending it's easy,"" he said, adding that he knows there is ""a need for more resources"". The comments from Ms Dick come as a public spending watchdog called the government's approach to police funding ""ineffective"". According to the National Audit Office,external, the Home Office does not know whether the police system in England and Wales is ""financially sustainable"" following widespread funding cuts. Sajid Javid said he will ""continue to fight on the police's behalf"" Ms Dick told the Police Superintendents' Association that the government decision on pay would make it harder to recruit and retain officers. ""I do think that decision will have affected morale,"" she said. ""I don't want the government to wait until we are struggling like the prison service with chronic understaffing."" She said the decision to impose the 2% pay award for pensionable pay flew in the face of evidence and rational argument, adding that it ""feels like 1% to our officers"". ""I am extremely disappointed by that outcome,"" she said, adding that police had worked ""tirelessly"" with the Home Office and the independent Pay Review Body (PRB) to make the case for ""fair pay"" for officers. Ms Dick noted it was the second year in a row the PRB recommendation had been rejected, adding that it leaves the whole process ""in tatters"". The Home Office acknowledges forces are stretched but says it has increased funding this year and points out that new officers are being recruited. However, Ms Dick argued that it was proving difficult to recruit in the Met, partly, she said because of officers' pay, which starts at Â£22,300 in London. At the conference Mr Javid also said he will ensure police chiefs can award bonuses of up to Â£4,000 for superintendents in challenging roles and officers in hard-to-fill jobs. ""I do fully recognise the pressures on policing so let me be very clear with you,"" he said. ""I will continue to fight on the police's behalf so that you have the resources that you need to do your jobs effectively."" BBC home editor Mark Easton said the Home Office had faced a double whammy with Ms Dick's comments and the audit office's report, which was ""one of the most critical I can remember"". ""In normal circumstances the home secretary might be on the ropes on a day like today, but I think because Sajid Javid is new to the job I think there's understanding  he's still getting his feet under the table,"" he said. ""But of course the public is getting more concerned about crime, there's still the threat from terrorism, and I don't think he's going to be able to dodge these questions for that much longer.""

The police superintendents warmed to Sajid Javid. They laughed at his joke about Bodyguard, the TV drama focusing on a protection officer assigned to look after a home secretary. And they enjoyed the conference hall banter between him and his brother, Bas, a chief superintendent in the West Midlands who was watching the speech. The brothers later embraced and posed for pictures. Having a close relative in the police has clearly helped Mr Javid understand the challenges facing the service. Finding the answers, though, is less straightforward. The home secretary is banking on squeezing more money out of the Treasury in the next spending review: there's ""no plan B"" he said. And unlike the earlier part of his address, he wasn't joking. Since March 2010 - the last set of Home Office figures before the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition came into power - there has been a cut of 21,330 police officers. Ms Dick told the conference that the force had faced ""unprecedented challenges"", noting that some officers are working ""longer and harder"". She announced a new scheme to encourage recently retired officers to return to work, saying ""expertise"" was being lost. ""This is not a service that needs reform, this is a service that needs support and needs resources... the NAO report shows this,"" she said. It took 18 days to charge an offence for the year ending March 2018 - four days longer than for the year ending March 2016 The arrest rate fell to 14 arrests per 1,000 population in 2016-17, down from 17 per 1,000 population in 2014-15 There have been fewer breathalyser tests, motoring fixed penalty notices and convictions for drugs trafficking and possession since 2010 33% of victims were not happy with police response in the year ending March 2018, up from 29% in the year ending March 2016 A Home Office spokesman disputed some of the NAO's findings - saying it had ""a strategic direction"" and last year conducted a substantial review of police pressures. ""Our decision to empower locally accountable police and crime commissioners to make decisions using their local expertise does not mean that we do not understand the demands on police forces,"" said the spokesman. ""The report does not recognise the strengths of PCCs and chief constables leading on day-to-day policing matters, including on financial sustainability. ""We remain committed to working closely with police and delivered a Â£460m increase in overall police funding in 2018/19, including increased funding for local policing through council tax,"" the spokesman said. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""We need to listen to people like Cressida Dick and the government needs to make the effort to understand what the effects of its cuts are, not just put the blame on police and crime commissioners."" Offers for 2018-19 have not yet been made in Scotland or Northern Ireland. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""The Police Negotiating Board (PNB) continues to discuss police officer pay and there were constructive discussions at the latest meeting today. PNB will refer its agreement to Scottish ministers for approval in due course."" The starting salary for newly-recruited police constables in Scotland is higher than in England and Wales. The situation in Northern Ireland isyet to be determinedbecause of the absence of a devolved administration.
