"Islamic sharia courts can approve Muslim marriages for those under the age of 16 in Malaysia The wedding of a girl of 11 to a man of 41 has prompted outrage in Malaysia and calls for the minimum age for all marriages to be changed to 18. Her Thai parents say they consented for her to become the Malaysian's third wife if he agreed she could stay at their home until she was 16. Malaysia's government says it has no record of the marriage, which occurred in Thailand, and is investigating. The UN children's agency said it was ""shocking and unacceptable"". Child marriages declining, says Unicef 'I was 12 when I married a 35-year-old' Country profile ""It is not in the best interest of the child,"" said Unicef's Malaysia representative, Marianne Clark-Hattingh. Photos have emerged showing the adult groom holding the girl's hand after the marriage ceremony. He already has two wives and six children aged between five and 18, local media reports say. The girl's Thai family work in the north-eastern Malaysian state of Kelantan, tapping rubber from trees. Malaysian activists say the groom is a prosperous trader while the girl's parents have lived in poverty. While the current legal age for marriage in Malaysia is 18, Islamic sharia courts can approve Muslim marriages for those under the age of 16. However the Malaysian government said local religious authorities had no record of this marriage. Without permission from a religious court the marriage would be unlawful and the groom could face up to six months in jail, the ministry for women, family and community development said. ""Marrying an 11-year-old girl is like the behaviour of a child predator or paedophile,"" activist Syed Azmi Alhabshi told AFP news agency. The girl who sabotaged her own wedding Is a child bride really married every seven seconds? Activists say about 16,000 Malaysian girls under the age of 15 are already married, AFP reports. Last year Malaysia passed a law on sex crimes against children but did not criminalise child marriage. Last week the country hosted a ""Girls not Brides"" conference in the capital Kuala Lumpur which had ending child marriage as its theme.

"Poundworld went into administration last month Nearly 22,000 jobs have been hit on the UK's struggling High Streets this year. BBC 5 live's Wake Up To Money has been tracking shop closures and retail administrations and found that more than 7,000 people have lost their jobs. A further 9,500 roles are due to go through planned shop closures, while 5,100 are in doubt at Poundworld, which is in administration. In the past six months, about 1,200 shops run by major chains have either shut or are at risk of closure. To put that in context, a report by PwC and the Local Data Company found 4,000 High Street shops opened last year and 5,800 closed, causing a net loss of 1,800. Six reasons behind the High Street crisis The death of a Poundworld Sluggish sales, competition from online and rising costs have been blamed for the changing landscape. High-profile failures such as Maplin and Toys R Us have been followed by a string of closure plans from High Street stalwarts such as Marks & Spencer, House of Fraser, Carphone Warehouse, New Look and Carpetright. This trend is set to continue. On Thursday, the new owners of Homebase said 300 head office staff would go and store closures are expected. Meanwhile, The Original Factory Shop is planning to close more than 30 shops, while N Brown, which is behind brands such as Jacamo and Simply Be, wants to retreat from the High Street altogether. Zain Venturi spent three years at a Maplin shop in London until it closed last month. He has switched career and is now working as an IT engineer. He said: ""I was on the shop floor and we could see what was happening before management could. The guys at head office did not understand what the customers wanted. Shopping has changed and they weren't in tune with what's happening."" He added: ""Those most affected were working in the shops. I'm lucky, I can talk and people buy into that, but if you can't you're going to have issues. ""Everything that happens in life opens up an opportunity - hopefully something more financially rewarding. ""I'm not the only one who found something paying more, quite a few others went into the IT field. It was such a nice place to work so it stopped you from pushing yourself out there."" The national unemployment rate is still at a 40-year low, at just over 4%, and the most recent official figures show 2.92 million people were working in retail in March. That's up on 2.87 million a year earlier, but the Recruitment and Employment Confederation has seen retail vacancies fall in recent months. It publishes a monthly report based on information from 400 recruitment agencies around the country. Retail vacancies continued to rise until March, but that growth has since stalled. REC policy director Tom Hadley said: ""Every sector is showing more demand apart from retail. That does show there are jobs in other sectors and that's a note of encouragement. ""Some people are happy to stay in roles where you've got a customer service element, such as leisure of hospitality. We are seeing people make the transition into the care sector, where there is a big demand for staff. ""The rest of the jobs market is showing strong demand, so it's a good time to take stock of your options."" Have you recently lost your job in retail?

"Local residents say the family were a well-integrated part of the community in Burari Eleven members of an extended family have been found dead in a house in India's capital, Delhi - 10 of them hanging from the ceiling, police say. A woman in her 70s was the only one found lying on the floor. Most of the dead were blindfolded and gagged with their hands tied behind their backs. What lies behind the deaths is unclear and police have not ruled out murder. But they also released a statement saying they had found evidence of ""mystical practices"" by the family. The full police statement refers to handwritten notes found in the house which pointed to ""definite spiritual and mystical practices"" that appear to have some links to the deaths. They are still waiting for the results of the post-mortem examinations, questioning neighbours and examining CCTV footage of the area. One police official told the AFP news agency it was ""still too early"" to know what happened. ""It is an ongoing investigation and we haven't ruled out anything,"" he said. The family had lived in the Burari district of Delhi for more than 20 years, although they were originally from Rajasthan. They ran two shops on the ground floor of a three-storey building. The bodies were discovered by a neighbour when he went to buy milk on Sunday morning. Gurcharan Singh discovered the bodies when going to buy milk ""When I entered the shop, all the doors were open and the bodies of all the people were hanging from the ceiling with their hands tied,"" Gurcharan Singh told BBC Hindi. The dead are thought to include two brothers, their wives and children as well as the elderly woman. The family's pet dog was found alive. The discovery of the bodies has left the neighbourhood in shock, BBC Hindi reports from the scene. Residents of the area and relatives have told local media the family were happy and part of the local community.

"A woman casts her ballot at a polling station in Oaxaca state Polls are closing across Mexico in elections marred by some of the worst political violence for decades. More than 130 candidates and political workers have been killed since campaigning began in September. The presidential frontrunner is AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, 64, the left-wing former mayor of Mexico City who has pledged to crack down on corruption. The coalition led by his party, Morena, could oust the two parties that have governed Mexico for nearly a century. Five things to know about the election Under the crosses of CuliacÃ¡n A guide to the drug cartels Analysis by Will Grant, BBC News, Mexico This has been the most violent election campaign in Mexico in living memory. Now that voting day has arrived, however, many Mexicans see it as an opportunity to remove the government that has led the country to this point. Millions of ordinary Mexicans are angry at President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto and his administration, particularly over the sluggish economy and widespread corruption, crime and impunity. The man widely expected to replace him, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador who is often referred to just by his initials Amlo, was the runner-up in the last two presidential elections. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador gives a thumbs-up as he leaves the polling station He has made tackling corruption the central plank of his election platform, promising to improve wages and pensions by stamping out rampant abuses by the state and the political and business elites. His opponents, including the centre-right candidate, Ricardo Anaya, have tried to paint him as a populist and a dangerous maverick who cannot be trusted with the economy. Most polls suggest, however, that a majority of voters have not listened to that message and are prepared to hand Mr LÃ³pez Obrador the presidency, third time around. Long queues of voters formed outside schools and community centres as polling day progressed but two more killings of party members were reported - one a member of the Workers' Party in the western state of Michoacan and the other a member of the governing PRI party in the central state of Puebla. Some 88 million people have been eligible to vote, and have been choosing not only a president but also 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. A huge crowd gathered outside the polling station in Mexico City's Tlalpan district to watch Mr LÃ³pez Obrador cast his vote. He called the election ""historic"" and told reporters: ""We represent the possibility of real change"". AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, (L) has been the front-runner ahead of Jose Antonio Meade (C) and Ricardo Anaya His closest rival looks to be Mr Anaya who heads a centre-right coalition. The candidate for the governing PRI party is JosÃ© Antonio Meade, a former finance minister. Polling stations began closing at 18:00 local time (23:00 GMT) and the first results are expected in the coming hours. If Mr LÃ³pez Obrador wins this time, he will end the dominance in Mexican politics of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the National Action Party (PAN). He has referred to them as being part of the same ""mafia of power"". This video can not be played Five things you need to know about AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador or ""Amlo"" Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter.

High levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas. Can Mexico save its journalists? Shot after investigating her daughter's death Mexico has a reputation for being one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists. Even before his own election, US President Donald Trump has continuously attacked Mexico over migration and trade. Who the next Mexican president will be and how he deals with President Trump and his plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and build a border wall will therefore be key to US-Mexican relations. The impact of Trump on illegal immigration Mr LÃ³pez Obrador has been the most critical of Mr Trump on the campaign trail. He has said he will make the US president ""see reason"". But on the matter of children being separated from their migrant parents at the US border, Mr Anaya went further than Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, saying that ""it reminds me of what the Nazis did in WWII, it's completely unacceptable"". Mr Meade has also criticised President Trump over the tariffs the US recently imposed on Mexican steel. This video can not be played If Nafta trade deal was a hamburger...

"More than 8 million tonnes of plastic ends up in the world's oceans each year Tempers flared in Australia over the weekend as retailers implemented a ban on single-use plastic bags. One customer reportedly grabbed a shop assistant by the throat, while another called staff ""money-grabbing scum"". The ban on single-use bags is part of a national push to reduce waste. Retailers in four of six Australian states now face fines for using them. More than 60 countries including the UK have now introduced bans or levies on single-use bags, according to the UN. The UN environment agency estimates that up to 5 trillion single-use bags are consumed worldwide each year. Australian chain Woolworths introduced a ban on the bags on 20 June, ahead of the 1 July deadline, offering reusable bags for 15 cents (Â£0.08; $0.11) instead. Plastic recycling: Your questions answered 50 nations 'curbing plastic pollution' Plastic waste: What are the alternatives? How a simple change is cutting coffee cup waste But customer ""bag rage"" pushed the chain to reverse the policy and offer the reusable bags for free until 8 July. ""They just want a little extra help from us to get through the transition,"" said Claire Peters, Woolworths managing director, in a statement. Another chain, Coles, said it would open every checkout lane on Sunday to reduce queue lengths and put on extra staff to explain the change to customers. This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic ""We are taking a proactive step,"" a Coles spokesperson said. A retail staff union urged customers to treat staff members with respect. ""While we understand that some customers may be frustrated by this change, there is absolutely no excuse for abusive or violent behaviour towards retail staff,"" said Gerard Dwyer, national secretary of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association. The union surveyed 132 of its members and said 57 reported suffering abuse over the ban. How is so much plastic getting intotheoceans? More than 8 million tonnes of plastic ends up in the world's oceans each year, according to the UN, which has called for single-use bags to be eliminated completely by 2022. The main way that plastic gets into the seas is via the world's major rivers.Research suggests that 95% of plastic is transported in this way,external. Eight of these rivers are found in Asia. This video can not be played Plastic pollution is killing animals in the Arctic Most of the plastic comes from China, but Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam also rank among major polluters. Consumer behaviour in developed countries including the UK, Europe and the US is also a major factor in pushing plastic into the world's waters. According to figures,US citizens produce around 120kg (264lb) of plastic waste per person every year,external. The UK produces around 76kg (167lb) of waste while in Sweden, it's around 18kg (40lb). Last December, 193 countries committed toa UN plan to stop plastic waste entering the oceans. But the commitment is not legally binding and doesn't have a timetable, and different countries have adopted different schemes. Around 40 have banned single-use plastic bags, with charges or outright prohibitions in place in China, Bangladesh. and about 15 African countries.

Peter Firmin (left) and Oliver Postgate created numerous much-loved characters through their production company Smallfilms Floella Benjamin, who fronted children's shows such as Play School and Play Away and is now a Baroness, said all Mr Firmin wanted to do ""was to create magic to stimulate kids' minds through his creative vision"". Alice Webb, director of BBC Children's programmes, said: ""Peter helped to bring to life some of the most iconic children's programmes of a generation."" She described him as a ""remarkable man with an incredible ability to create wonderful characters that children have adored for decades"". Fans of his work have been paying tribute on Twitter.

Walter Dunlop,externalsaid the Mr Firmin and Mr Postgate were a ""little oasis of kindness"", adding: ""Whenever I feel lost, scared or just in need of a little escape for a few minutes, their work will usually do it for me."" Peter Firmin said getting a Bafta in 2014 was ""touching"" Born in Harwich in 1928, he trained at the Colchester School of Art and, after a period of National Service in the Navy, he went on to attend the Central School of Art and Design. It was while teaching there that he met Mr Postgate with whom he formed Smallfilms. In 2016, in an interview with the BBC at the unveiling of an exhibition of his work, Mr Firmin said of his relationship with Mr Postgate: ""He wrote and imagined things and I brought them to life as pictures."" He said: ""We sometimes disagreed, but generally we agreed in the end as we had the same sort of taste and, also, we both rather liked the idea of gentle stories where there was no aggression really and everyone was rather happy, gentle and content."" Peter Firmin was still working on Clangers in 2018 Mr Firmin revealed that Bagpuss, who starred in 13 episodes in 1974, was supposed to be a marmalade-coloured cat but an error at the fur-dying company saw him become pink instead. Mr Firmin's wife Joan made Bagpuss' paws and knitted the original Clangers, while their daughter Emily played Bagpuss' owner. Clangers first aired in 1969 with Mr Postgate, who died in 2008, providing the narration. Mr Firmin's earlier creation, the Moon Mouse from his Noggin The Nog stories, provided the inspiration when the BBC asked him to create something set in space. Clangers, which followed a clan of mouse-like creatures who lived on a moon, was broadcast by the BBC until 1972 with a special following in 1974. In 2015, the series was revived on CBeebies and narrated by Michael Palin, which Mr Firmin called ""exciting"". Reacting to the news that he would be presented with a Special Award at the Bafta Children's Awards in 2014, Mr Firmin said it was touching that his work was remembered with affection, decades on. The chair of Bafta's Children's Committee at the time said Mr Firmin helped to lay the foundations of today's children's TV industry. Michael Palin narrates the new series of Clangers In recent years, Mr Firmin criticised the use of computer generated imagery on modern programmes and said there was more life in his knitted puppets. He said: ""I hate CGI faces on humans because you look in the eyes and there's nothing there. There's no soul."" Retaining the knitted characters in the new Clangers was important to him, he said, as he took on the role of design consultant and co-executive producer on the revival. Mr Firmin said: ""With high definition and the very good production, you do feel you could almost hold them now."" Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin (pictured in 2005) are said to have helped lay the foundations for children's TV While the recent series cost a reported Â£5m to make, Mr Firmin recalled the primitive settings in which the original was created, when improvisation was the order of the day.

"Scientists have taken early steps towards developing an artificial ovary that could lead to improved fertility preservation treatments. The technique is aimed at helping women at risk of becoming infertile, such as those who receive chemotherapy. The Danish scientists removed parts of the ovary and altered them so they could potentially be transplanted later when the woman wants to conceive. Experts say the work is ""exciting"" but human testing is still needed. Woman has baby using ovary frozen as child Baby born from frozen ovary in UK first Ovarian transplants are 'safe option' Treatments for cancer, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can often damage the ovaries and leave women infertile. One way women can preserve their chances of conceiving is with an ovarian tissue transplant, where all or part of the ovary is removed and frozen before it is damaged so that it can be used at a later date. This is the only fertility preservation treatment available for girls who have not started ovulating. But there is a small risk that in those with cancer the ovarian tissue may contain cancerous cells, raising the chances of the illness returning when the transplant takes place. This risk, although ""very low"", means women with certain forms of cancer, such as leukaemia and those originating in the womb, are unlikely to be offered the transplant. To eliminate that risk, scientists from the Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark, took ovarian follicles and ovarian tissue from patients due to have cancer treatment. They then removed the cancerous cells from the ovarian tissue, leaving behind a ""scaffold"" made up of proteins and collagen. Scientists were then able to grow the ovarian follicles on this engineered scaffold of ovarian tissue. This artificial ovary was then transplanted into mice, where it was able to support the survival and growth of the ovarian cells. Experts said the ""exciting"" technique needed to be tested in humans. But they said it might have advantages over other fertility treatments. Stuart Lavery, consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital, said the ovarian tissue transplants potentially contained thousands of eggs that would enable women to get pregnant ""naturally"", as opposed to IVF where an egg is fertilised in a laboratory and then returned to the womb. Dr Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midlands Fertility Services, said another advantage of ovarian tissue transplants is that they could enable women to restart their periods after damaging treatments, preventing the need for hormone replacement therapy. The treatment will need to be tested in humans first - a development expected to take place in the next three to four years. The research is being presented at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.

"Angela Merkel (left) and Horst Seehofer (right) will hold crisis talks later on Monday Germany's interior minister plans to hold last-ditch talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel after threatening to quit in protest at her migration policy. Horst Seehofer heads Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), a key party in Mrs Merkel's coalition. He argues that police should turn away migrants at the Bavarian border if they have sought asylum elsewhere. But Mrs Merkel is sticking to an EU-wide deal. The Merkel-Seehofer crisis talks are set for 17:00 in Berlin (15:00 GMT). A compromise looks unlikely, the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin reports. She says Mr Seehofer might have overplayed his hand by issuing his ultimatum, only for Mrs Merkel to return from Brussels with an EU-wide strategy and bilateral agreements with more than 10 countries. The risk for Mrs Merkel is that Mr Seehofer ends the CSU's alliance with her Christian Democrats (CDU), leaving her without a parliamentary majority. Gruelling migration talks end in draw Chancellor Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor Could the migration crisis finish the EU? The centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) - also in the ruling coalition - broadly back her position. Opinion polls suggest that, in the event of a fresh election, the SPD would not profit from the CDU-CSU rift over migration. But SPD leader Andrea Nahles warned that ""my patience has worn thin"". ""We want a humanitarian, but also realistic, migration policy,"" she told a news conference on Monday. On Sunday evening, the CDU passed a resolution supporting Mrs Merkel's position on migration. CDU General Secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said the party believed a European solution was necessary. Then reports emerged from the CSU that Mr Seehofer had offered to step down both as party leader and interior minister. Mr Seehofer complained during a meeting of top CSU officials that he had held a ""conversation with no effect"" with Mrs Merkel on Saturday, when they discussed a new EU deal on migration, sources said. Passau in Bavaria was on the frontline of Europe's 2015 migrant crisis Senior figures immediately tried to persuade Mr Seehofer not to quit, including CSU parliamentary group chief Alexander Dobrindt. ""This is a decision that I just cannot accept,"" Mr Dobrindt was quoted as saying. In the early hours of Monday, the party leader then announced he had agreed to hold final talks with the CDU as a ""concession"" in the interest of the country and the coalition. The CSU could put forward a new candidate for interior minister if Mr Seehofer does quit, keeping the ruling coalition intact The CSU could end its alliance with the CDU, but then the Greens or Free Democrats (FDP) could do a deal to join the ruling coalition Mrs Merkel could carry on weaker, with a minority government She could quit as chancellor She could call a confidence vote in the Bundestag, which could trigger fresh elections. Yes. The CDU-CSU alliance has lasted for decades, but it could break up over this, at a critical time for both parties. Bavarian state elections will be held in October, and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is a threat to both parties. The AfD surged into the German parliament (Bundestag) for the first time last year, winning 94 seats. Its success was based on strident anti-immigration rhetoric, attacking Mrs Merkel's decision to let in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-2016. However, opinion polls have suggested that Bavarians are more satisfied with Mrs Merkel than with the CSU leader, weakening Mr Seehofer's position. A new poll from RTL/n-TV suggests that CSU support has fallen 4.5% in Bavaria since the 2017 elections, to 34%. Nationally the party would be down to 5% - the threshold for entering the Bundestag - rather than 6.2% before. The CDU is marginally down nationally to 26%, the poll indicates. Mrs Merkel stayed up with EU leaders until dawn on Friday to clinch a new deal on migrants. She said Greece and Spain had agreed to take back migrants stopped at the Bavarian-Austrian border who are proven to have entered their countries first -  a move she hoped would allay Mr Seehofer's concerns. ""The sum of all we've agreed is equivalent to what the CSU wants - that's my personal view, but the CSU have to decide for themselves,"" she said. However, Italy - where most irregular migrants arrive - does not want to take back migrants who reach Germany. The divisions within the German government over the issue are also being played out in other EU countries, and three countries later said they were not part of the German deal: the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.

"Supermarket chain Asda is rationing the amount of some fizzy drinks that its online customers can buy as the national CO2 shortage continues. The Leeds-based grocer has restricted shoppers to six bottles or multipacks of soft drinks online. Those affected are its own-label soft drinks, plus Pepsi, Pepsi Max, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, 7Up, Irn Bru and Fanta. Asda said the limit did not apply to purchases made at its stores. The carbon dioxide scarcity has already forced beer, fizzy drink, crumpet, and meat firms to curb production. Scotland's biggest abattoir is closed and other meat producers are considering adapting their products to use less CO2. CO2 is widely used in the food processing and drinks industries. It puts the fizz into beer, cider and soft drinks, and is used in food packaging to extend the shelf life of salads, fresh meat and poultry. The gas is also used to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter, and create dry ice to help keep things chilled while in transit. However, several UK and mainland European producers of carbon dioxide - a by-product from ammonia production that is used in the fertiliser industry - have been closed for maintenance or scaled down operations. In the UK, only two of five plants that supply CO2 are operating at the moment, in Ince and Manchester. The trade journal Gasworld, which first revealed that CO2 was running short, said that the plant at Billingham, County Durham, was due to restart on Monday. Meanwhile the World Cup football, hot weather, and barbecue season has created an added demand for beer, just when the CO2 plants have gone offline.

Forecasters warned it could lead to torrential rain, hail and lightning and there was a small chance of flooding for homes and businesses. It also said the weather could lead to difficult driving conditions and road closures. The yellow weather warning came into force at 06:00 BST and will remain in place until 22:00.

The current moorland fires are relatively unusual, says Alastair Lewis, professor at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, but they could become more frequent because of climate change. Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London, said a population increase and the growth of development on the fringe of urban areas has also contributed. He says the link between fires and climate change is even stronger in northern Europe. While small fires can be beneficial to moorlands, large and intense fires damage ecosystems, he added. The Met Office says nearly all moorland fires in the UK are started by people - such as from campfires or discarded cigarettes and glass - whereas lightning strikes are frequently the cause in other parts of the world.

"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: How Kylian Mbappe lit up France v Argentina A seven-goal classic, the rise of Mbappe, more woe for Messi and the end of an era for Argentina? The 2018 World Cup quarter-final tie between France and Argentina had just about everything and you can watch all the action again on the BBC Sport website, Red Button and BBC iPlayer on Saturday from 15:30 GMT. This story was first published after the game on 30 June 2018. When Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe embraced at the end of abreathless World Cup classic,it was a striking moment that seemed to confirm the passing of greatness from one player to the next. Everyone present at the electrified Kazan Arena on Saturday left the stadium knowing they had witnessed a special match, a knockout game for the ages. And one player in particular set the spine tingling. Mbappe, despite being only 19 years old at this World Cup, scored two goals and ran with blistering pace from his own half to win a penalty for the opener inFrance's 4-3 victory over Argentina,a win that moves Didier Deschamps' talented side into the quarter-finals. Match of the Day to show classic highlights. plus France v Argentina Play along with BBC Sport's live 'Quarantine Quiz' on Friday night Mbappe was not even born when France won this competition on home soil in 1998. Neatly, Michael Owen's brilliant slalom through the Argentina defence at that tournament, which was so like Mbappe's here for the opener in Kazan, came exactly 20 years ago - on 30 June 1998. This video can not be played World Cup moments: Owen's wonder goal Mbappe, who was born on 20 December 1998, is technically still on loan at Paris St-Germain from Monaco but is expected to join the French champions for 180m euros (Â£165.7m) as the second most expensive player of all time. Only the 200m euros (Â£177m) PSG paid for Brazil forward Neymar in 2017 surpasses that fee. It is not just searing pace Mbappe is blessed with but sublime skill, quick thinking, two clever feet, a cool head, bravery, belief and a brutal eye for goal. His two finishes were predatory, low and powerful. ""It was an incredible performance from a centre forward who has the lot: blistering pace, goals, touch and technique,"" said former England captain Alan Shearer, speaking on Match of the Day. ""At 19, to put in a performance like that, with millions watching and Messi at the other end, it was simply brilliant."" Mbappe, from the suburbs of Paris, only made his international debut last year. His rise to the top has been dizzying since he burst on to the scene in the 2016-17 season, scoring 26 goals in 44 games as Monaco reached the Champions League semi-finals and won Ligue 1. His two goals here utterly wiped out Argentina's gathering momentum and announced his supreme talent to the world. Not since 1958, when the legendary Brazilian Pele, then 17, found the net twice against Sweden in the final, has a teenager scored twice in a World Cup game. ""I'm very happy, and it's flattering to be compared to a great player like Pele but he's in another category,"" Mbappe said. ""Still, it's great to join the list of players that have achieved such feats."" Lionel Messi has never scored a goal in the World Cup knockout stages This was a match that inflicted more agony on Messi, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner who seems destined never to shine as only he can on the biggest stage of all. Right after the final whistle, Messi did not look back as he and Mbappe came together and parted, but the young French striker did steal a brief final glance behind him. He would have seen the hunched back of Argentina's iconic number 10, broken by the weight of a whole nation's expectation. Messi dreamed of matching those demands but was once again unable to conjure his masterful best when it counted most. He provided two assists - one inadvertently as his shot was deflected in by Gabriel Mercado when Argentina took the lead, the other a sublime cross that found Sergio Aguero in the 93rd minute. That was too little, too late, a reminder of what might have been at the end of another largely peripheral display at this World Cup. Perhaps the moment that summed his afternoon up best was his sole shot on target, a strike in the 83rd minute that he failed to truly connect with and that Hugo Lloris gathered with ease. Six days after he turned 31, as he walked off the pitch with his head bowed and his captain's armband held in his hands, Messi could well have been turning his back on the World Cup for good, and on international football altogether. He did score a sublime opener in the narrow victory over Nigeria that dragged Argentina through to the knockout stage. Afterwards, Messi said he had ""never known suffering like it"". His words came after having suffered plenty with Argentina before - including three consecutive defeats in major finals when Germany claimed the 2014 World Cup and Chile beat them to the Copa America in 2015 and 2016. Messi said he was retiring after the 2016 defeat but changed his mind and helped drag his team-mates through qualifying for this World Cup, scoring a hat-trick in a decisive final match against Ecuador that rescued a poor campaign. The legacy of his remarkable achievements in club football with Barcelona will not be tainted by this low. But nonetheless there will forever be a regret and a sadness that a player as talented as Messi looks likely to have one thing missing: a World Cup he defined, which is exactly what Diego Maradona did in 1986. It is remarkable to think that he may forever remain without a single goal in the World Cup knockout stage. This defeat could well be the end for Argentina's manager Jorge Sampaoli, too. The expectation among many is that he will now leave. Although the former Sevilla boss would not discuss his future after the game, ex-Argentina and Tottenham midfielder Ossie Ardiles said the ""greatest mistake Argentina made was to put Sampaoli in charge"". He added: ""His only plan was to give the ball to Messi and hope for a miracle."" There is no doubt about what Javier Mascherano will do next - heannounced his international retirementwhile holding back the tears in a TV interview immediately after the defeat. At 34, Mascherano is the eldest of a generation that is now coming to an end. By the time the next World Cup comes around in 2022, Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain and Angel di Maria will all be 34. The question many Argentine journalists are asking is: Where is the next wave coming from? Argentina won the Under-20 World Cup in 1995, 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2007, but they now seem to be running out of emerging stars. It is not a problem shared by France. Barcelona's 21-year-old forward Ousmane Dembele was on the bench, Antoine Griezmann is still in his prime at 27 and there should be much more to come from Paul Pogba at just 25. Alexandre Lacazette, Kingsley Coman, Adrien Rabiot and Anthony Martial did not even make this squad. Should Mbappe continue to perform as he did in Saturday's thriller, this could develop into a very special tournament for him and France.

"Supermarket chain Asda is rationing the amount of some fizzy drinks that its online customers can buy as the national CO2 shortage continues. The Leeds-based grocer has restricted shoppers to six bottles or multipacks of soft drinks online. Those affected are its own-label soft drinks, plus Pepsi, Pepsi Max, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, 7Up, Irn Bru and Fanta. Asda said the limit did not apply to purchases made at its stores. The carbon dioxide scarcity has already forced beer, fizzy drink, crumpet, and meat firms to curb production. Scotland's biggest abattoir is closed and other meat producers are considering adapting their products to use less CO2. CO2 is widely used in the food processing and drinks industries. It puts the fizz into beer, cider and soft drinks, and is used in food packaging to extend the shelf life of salads, fresh meat and poultry. The gas is also used to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter, and create dry ice to help keep things chilled while in transit. However, several UK and mainland European producers of carbon dioxide - a by-product from ammonia production that is used in the fertiliser industry - have been closed for maintenance or scaled down operations. In the UK, only two of five plants that supply CO2 are operating at the moment, in Ince and Manchester. The trade journal Gasworld, which first revealed that CO2 was running short, said that the plant at Billingham, County Durham, was due to restart on Monday. Meanwhile the World Cup football, hot weather, and barbecue season has created an added demand for beer, just when the CO2 plants have gone offline.

"A minimum tenancy term of three years would be introduced under government proposals to give people renting homes in England more security. Figures show 80% of tenants currently have contracts of six or 12 months and ministers say longer agreements would allow them to put down more roots. They add tenants would be able to leave earlier under the plans while landlords would get more financial security. Labour says the plans do not go far enough and rent rises should be capped. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said loss of tenancy was ""the main driver of homelessness"" and called for the government to ""go beyond three years"". Four ways to fix the rental market Where's the best place to rent a home? Renting and buying - in charts A consultation on the minimum tenancy term will run until the end of the August. Exemptions to the rules could apply to some types of tenant - for instance those in student accommodation. Government figures show renters do stay in a property for an average of four years but most have shorter contracts. This video can not be played 'I'll be renting until I die' George Robertson, a landlord from St Albans, is concerned about how the proposals will affect him. ""I am a landlord with one house used as a pension top-up after my wife's state pension age was hiked up at short notice,"" he said. ""We feel this proposal will force small landlords like us, with just one property, out of the market [and] it will make it so much harder to manage difficulties with problem tenants. ""If this becomes law I will sell my property as we couldn't face the hassle of dealing with possible issues."" Jonathan Pearson, a renter living in London, is worried the proposals will mean less flexibility for tenants. ""If in future I say I only plan on renting for less than three years, that would reduce my chances of securing a property,"" said Mr Pearson. He said the real problem was the ""attitude of estate agents"", who treat tenants as a ""commodity"" and ""charge ridiculous tenancy renewal fees after the 12 month period is up"". But Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said it was an important step forward for tenants. He added: ""It is deeply unfair when renters are forced to uproot their lives or find new schools for their children at short notice due to the terms of their rental contract. ""Being able to call your rental property your home is vital to putting down roots and building stronger communities."" By BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam Something significant has happened to home ownership in the UK - it's dropped from 72% a decade ago to 63% last year. Much of that is down to affordability - especially in the south east of England, bank reticence to lend and stagnant real wages. That has meant that the number of people who need to rent is rising. The proportion of 35 to 54-year-olds who live as private tenants has nearly doubled in 10 years. Meanwhile, protections afforded to renters have not kept pace. So, any plan to impose minimum terms to rental agreements of three years would benefit millions hoping for some security of tenure. But it may also cause problems. Landlords could have less flexibility in financing of their properties and have to pay higher interest rates to lenders, which could then be passed on to tenants. Furthermore, tenants may not like being locked into long-term contracts if their own circumstances change and they need to move or even buy a house. Finding a middle ground won't be easy in the consultation. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said: ""Any fresh help for renters is welcome but this latest promise is meaningless if landlords can still force tenants out by hiking up the rent. He said Labour plans included controls on rents, an end to no-fault evictions and protection against substandard properties. Polly Neate, chief executive of charity Shelter, said: ""This is an important step forward. Losing a tenancy is the main driver of homelessness and also causes huge instability for renting families so everyone who rents will be very pleased to see a move towards longer tenancies. ""But if the government really wants to stand up and provide stability for renters, they can and should go beyond three years to provide real protection from eviction, and the huge upheaval of having to move home, jobs and schools. ""The government needs to bring forward new legislation quickly - with tens of thousands of families already homeless and many more at risk of the same fate, we simply cannot wait.""

"This video can not be played Footage from the Thai Navy shows rescuers at the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai Divers searching for 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded Thai cave over a week ago are near the area it is thought they were stranded. Rescuers believe they are less than 1km (0.6 miles) from where the boys may be, but are blocked by a narrow tunnel. Nothing has been heard from the boys aged 11 to 16 and their coach since they went to explore the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai on 23 June. The hope is they sought safety on a mound in an underground chamber. Rescuers have been helped by falling water levels inside the cave but are making slow progress. The group's plight has gripped the country and led to an outpouring of support and hope. Heavy rain - and the knowledge they were not equipped for a long stay underground - has led to fears that the boys and their coach might not survive. Drones, dogs, drilling and desperation Thais show their love for lost cave boys What to do to survive underground Rear Admiral Apakorn Yuukongkaew, commander of the Thai Navy Seals, said on Sunday that his divers had reached ""chamber three"" in the cave complex. They had been forced back from that location by rising floodwaters earlier in the week. From there they have to get to an area nicknamed ""Pattaya Beach"" after the well-known Thai beach resort city. ""It is hard because it's dark and flooded. The most important thing for today is speeding up to reach the kids,"" he told reporters. They made further progress on Monday but now have to widen a section of flooded tunnel in order to reach the boys' possible location. A Facebook photo shows the coach with some of the missing children The 12 boys are members of the Moo Pa - or Wild Boar - football team. Their 25-year-old assistant coach, Ekkapol Janthawong, is known to have occasionally brought them out on day trips - including a trip to the same cave two years ago. The youngest member, Chanin ""Titan"" Wibrunrungrueang, is 11 - he started playing football aged seven. Duangpet ""Dom"" Promtep, 13, is the team captain and said to be the motivator of the group. The club's head coach Nopparat Kantawong who did not join the group on their excursion, says he believes the boys, who dream of becoming professional football players in the future, will stick together. ""I believe they won't abandon each other,"" he told media outlets. ""They will take care of each other."" As well as the Seals, a team of international cave diving experts is helping with the rescue, but they are facing intensely difficult conditions underground. Pumps are removing about 10,000 litres of water from the cave every hour but some sections are still flooded. There is almost zero visibility in those areas, so divers are making slow progress.  Provincial Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters on Monday morning that it had taken the team about eight hours to travel 600m. Underscoring the dangers of the rescue scene, he also said four volunteers had briefly gone missing on Wednesday after entering the cave without letting co-ordinators know. Thai medical experts say the group's survival depends on whether they find fresh drinking water. They could survive eight days without food, Medical Services Department Director Dr Somsak Akkasilp said. But they were at risk from infection from unclean water or contact with an animal inside the cave, he added.

But there is disagreement on the UK side about what sort of trading relationship to pursue with the EU, and how closely aligned they should be in years to come. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Brokenshire, the secretary of state for local government and housing, said: ""I think there's no doubt that there are strong views on either side and that's what I would expect as we lead into the discussions on Friday. ""But, equally, I remain confident that we will come out from that meeting with that clear direction, the White Paper that will follow, and actually setting out our vision for our future with our EU partners."" After Brexit day in March 2019, a temporary transition period is planned until the end of 2020 to allow an ""orderly withdrawal"" for the UK. Business Secretary Greg Clark did not rule out an extension to this arrangement, telling Sky News the government had to be ""guided by the evidence"" and avoid ""frictions"" at the border. He said the government would assess how long a new customs system would take to put in place, adding that ""it seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence"". Ministers have yet to agree on how to replace the UK's membership of the EU customs union - on Saturday it was revealed Environment Secretary Michael Gove had physically torn apart a report on Theresa May's preferred ""partnership"" arrangement. Brexiteer Conservative MPs have said they will not accept any extension to the transition phase. More than 30 have signed a letter to Mrs May urging her to face down people trying to ""undermine"" the 2016 vote to leave the EU. Their other demands include not replicating the EU's customs union and an end to the free movement of EU citizens. ""Our departure must be absolute,"" the MPs say. ""We must not remain entangled with the EU's institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation.  Anything less will be a weakening of our democracy. Britain must stand firm."" EU leaders have called on Theresa May to spell out her Brexit vision in detail Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns, who delivered the letter to the PM, tweeted: ""We must be clear to those in the cabinet and on the back benches, we will not sit back & allow a small minority to dominate."" Eurosceptic former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said Theresa May ""probably doesn't need letters... to tell her what to do"". He added: ""I just think we simply have to get behind her and say, 'let's get her over there and tell the European Union they need to do a trade agreement with us and do it pretty quickly'."" But pro-EU Labour MP Alison McGovern said there was a ""serious"" price attached to the government's negotiating red lines like leaving the EU's single market and customs union. And she said the Chequers meeting was vital. ""We now need to know what it is the cabinet is trying to achieve - so this cannot be more important."" There are also Brexit divisions within the Labour Party, with Jeremy Corbyn urged by some of his MPs to back staying in the EU's single market or support another referendum on the final deal. Campaigners for a so-called ""People's Vote"" have published a survey of members of Unite - the trade union that is Labour's biggest donor - where a majority were in favour of a second referendum. Of almost 1,000 polled by YouGov, 57% backed a second referendum compared with 34% who were against, while respondents believed, by a margin of by a margin of 58% to 21%, that leaving the single market would make Britain worse off. The People's Vote campaign said its survey provided ""clear evidence that workers are turning decisively against the bad Brexit deal emerging from political machinations in Westminster and botched negotiations in Brussels"". Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""It's not our policy to have a second referendum - it's our policy to respect the result of the referendum but to have serious negotiations with the EU to gain a customs union and access to the single market to protect jobs in this country."" He added that one of the reasons people voted to leave the EU was because of the UK's ""deeply unequal society where many former industrial areas lose out very badly because they haven't had the investment they need"".

"Rail operator Govia Thameslink faces being stripped of its franchises unless performance on its services in the South East of England rapidly improves, the BBC understands. A source said the government could begin the process within weeks. Passengers on its Thameslink and Great Northern trains haveendured more than a month of disruptionfollowing the introduction of new timetables in May. Meanwhile, the firm said it is working on plans to compensate passengers. ""The industry is working together on this and an announcement will be made in due course,"" said a spokesman for Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR). The BBC understands that commuters are set to receive compensation worth a month's travel. GTR - which also runs Southern and the Gatwick Express services - changed the time of every train on its timetable on 20 May. Passengers were warned of disruption before the changes were brought in, but the implementation of the new timetable saw some services withdrawn and further cancellations without any warning. Since then, GTR chief executive Charles Horton has resigned and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has faced calls to stand down - asMPs from across all parties voiced their concernat the disruption caused in their constituencies. Passengers have expressed their anger on social media, while last week a memo leaked by the RMT union revealed that extra security staff were at stations to protect staff from ""unhappy customers"". But there is also frustration within government that whileNorthern, which encountered similar problems in the North of England, has introduced an interim timetable, Govia Thameslink's equivalent is still a fortnight away. ""They are now in the last chance saloon,"" a government source told the BBC. Passengers have been venting their anger on social media Will Graves, from Arlesey in Bedfordshire, spends around Â£400 each month commuting to London - but told the BBC the current service is ""the worst I can remember in my 14 years of commuting"". Mr Graves said that trains are regularly cancelled and almost always delayed - often due to no driver being available. ""When you do get on a train, you're standing shoulder to shoulder - it's horrendous,"" said Mr Graves. ""I think I've had only one journey that hasn't been delayed in the last month."" Trent Gashi, who commutes from Flitwick, Befordshire, to London, described Govia Thameslink's service as an ""utter farce"" and said ticket price rises in 2018 had ""added insult to injury"". ""Trains are cancelled without notice, people are ferried on and off as if they are livestock,"" said Mr Gashi. ""They make so much money out of people like us. It needs to be seriously addressed by the government."" Mick Cash, general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, has called for the UK's privatised rail networks to be brought back into public ownership ""on a permanent basis"". He described the ""last chance saloon"" comment as ""empty rhetoric"" that tells ""these basket-case companies"" that they have been ""let off the hook again while services are reduced to chaos"". He added: ""This is no time for empty threats from unnamed government sources."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said that, after ""months of chaos"" for passengers, he was in favour of Govia Thameslink losing its franchise. Hetweeted,external: ""City Hall will push for @TfL to take over more commuter routes so we can provide Londoners with a better service."" A spokesman for Govia Thameslink refused to comment on the reports about the possible loss of the franchises, instead choosing to re-release a statement in which it said it was ""sorry for the disruption"". GTR had added it rescheduled every train in its franchise in an attempt to improve rail efficiency but it was a ""hugely complicated task"" and involved re-training drivers on new routes. Mr Grayling had previously announced there would be compensation for commuters and an inquiry into what went wrong, saying there had been ""major failures"" by the rail industry. A Department for Transport spokesman added: ""GTR passengers are encountering unacceptable service levels and the transport secretary and rail minister have been clear it is their priority that this is put right as soon as possible.""

"World Cup last 16 continues Spain v Russia at 15:00 BST Croatia face Denmark at 19:00 BST Get involved: #bbcworldcup or text on 81111 Steve Sutcliffe Right time for me to head off. Thanks for sticking with me today. You can taste all the excitement and build-up to Spain v Russiahere. Spain v Russia (15:00 BST) Steady I here you say. And I tend to agree but Spain midfielder David Silva is preparing for this afternoon's last-16 clash against World Cup hosts Russia as though he is facing the boys from Brazil. Spain are heading into the contest as clear favourites but have arguably yet been able to find their top gear. ""I think that in a World Cup any opponent is tough. We saw this in our own group, it was very hard for us to win,"" Silva said. ""Now we're playing against Russia and I'm sure it's going to be extremely difficult, as if we were playing against Brazil."" Croatia v Denmark (19:00 BST) Age Hareide has also called the dual of the game. Croatia's Luka Modric v his own man, Christian Eriksen. An absolutely pivotal battle that. ""It could be a match between Modric and Eriksen, that would be interesting, that would be great for the fans."" Croatia v Denmark (19:00 BST) Some more from the Denmark camp here and a promise of expansive football. Whoa what's this I hear you say - after six clean sheets in their past seven games, the Danes are going all sexy football - it's like being in 1986 again! But apparently so according to manager Age Hareide. ""I think you will see a different Denmark from what you have seen so far and the type of game we have played,"" he said. ""Yes, we need to defend but we need to attack more."" Croatia v Denmark (19:00 BST) Denmark's assistant coach Jon Dahl Tomasson says that William Kvist could feature in Sunday's game. That's some recovery by the way - the midfielder punctured a lung and broke two ribs in Denmark's opening match against Peru on 16 June. He's got a degree in Economics though so I'm sure he's weighed the odds! Winger Yussuf Poulsen is available after serving a one-game ban against France. Personally I can't wait to see Ivan Rakitic and Luka Modric working in tandem. A midfield general and supremely gifted playmaker. Old school maybe but a lovely blend. Croatia v Denmark (19:00 BST) Croatia made nine changes for their last game and will recall most if not all of the players rested against Iceland. Ivan Rakitic, Dejan Lovren and Mario Mandzukic will be among the names returning to the starting line-up. #bbcworldcup or text on 81111 Craig:I had a poster of John Barnes on my wall in the late 80s. At club level he was awesome, had no affiliation with Liverpool, just loved watching Barnes play. Johhny:I came to Australia as a child and my Nana always sent me rolled up Shoot magazines. Football this and Newcastle that. My fave England player was Chris Waddle, then Peter Beardsley, Gazza and then Alan Shearer. Waddle is still my fave, the Geordie sausage maker. Howay! Russia v Spain (15:00 BST) Alan Dzagoev, who injured his hamstring in Russia's 5-0 win over Saudi Arabia in their first World Cup match, will be fit to play against Spain today. Well that's what his dad says, anyway. Russia take on Spain this afternoon at Moscow's Luzhniki stadium after reaching the knockout stage of the tournament for the first time in the post-Soviet era. ""Alan is currently feeling good... He told me that he will play in the match against Spain, if not in the starting line-up then as a substitute,"" news agency TASS quoted Dzagoev's father Tarel as saying. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: What is mate? Pablo Zabaleta explains Another reason to lament Argentina and Lionel Messi's departure -  no more pictures of him and his team-mates eschewing the Powerade (other energy drinks are available) for little ornate pots of South American power-juice mate. Fear not though - Brazil and Uruguay's presence should ensure local supplier remain in business. That's what Alan Shearer thought anyway. Allow Twitter content?

I mean how often do you concede goals like this? Not very I'd venture to say. But it was exquisite.... Meanwhile the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli is cutting quite a defiant figure in defeat and with his job potentially on the line after it was widely reported he had fallen out with his players following a 3-0 group stage loss to Croatia. ""This is very painful, especially because the players have made a huge
effort,"" he said. ""It was a very difficult game but we have not achieved our
goal here in Russia. I'm sad, I'm frustrated - I think that's quite normal."" There are also some nice lines from England's Kieran Tripper in Phil McNulty'spiece. Despite starting his career at Manchester City, Trippier still supported Manchester United. Hope he kept that quiet at the time. He said,""I always liked how David Beckham played - his set-plays and his dead balls."" ""Gary Neville played a similar position to me. Defensively and offensively he was a quality player for Manchester United and England. His trophies speak for themselves. ""I loved Gary Neville's energy, to get up and down for 90 minutes and his leadership as well. He was always organising, he was passionate. It was just his all-round game. He was a quality defender and could also chip in with a goal and an assist."" Now then, I'm sure that Gareth Southgate know's what team he's going to pick against Colombia on Tuesday but who would you go with? Raheem Sterling or Marcus Rashford?

Matt sensibly became a Spurs fan after Italia90, then reverted back to the Owls.

Sad! Kristoff:I distinctly remember my father having many pictures of Henrik Larsen and Peter Schmeichel up after our European Championship victory in 1992. Any picture of the Laudrup brothers was banned until I left home for the UK, when I became a Swansea fan after Michael won the League Cup. Andy:A poster of the 1982 England World Cup team was my favourite growing up with Kevin Keegan and Bryan Robson to name a few. I even had the football shirt, what a kit! England's Dele Alli acknowledged the World Cup is the ""the highest level."" So were there any regrets about staying on against Tunisia in the opening game and potentially making his injury worse. ""No, I'm glad he kept me on,"" Alli said. ""I had a similar injury when we played Real Madrid and scored two so if I had scored maybe people would think differently. ""I felt like I could run it off and I told the manager and the physios I was OK."" Some more here from Dele Alli who played in England's Group G opener against Tunisia but then missed the final two group matches with a thigh strain. ""Personally, the only pressure is the pressure I put on myself,"" he said. ""I want to go
out there and do as well as I can if I'm selected. Be part of the starting 11
and help the team as much as a I can, play as well as I can."" A few bullish words from Tottenham and England midfielder Dele Alli, which I don't mind to  be honest. After all why not aim high? ""As a team we're not scared of anyone,"" he said. ""Whatever team you put in front of us we're not going
to hide, we'll go out there be confident in ourselves, play the way we want to
play and hopefully win the game. ""We've come here with the mentality we want to win it

"This video can not be played Babies and pensioners took part in the celebrations in Aneurin Bevan's home town. Hundreds of people descended on the hometown of Aneurin Bevan to mark 70 years since he founded the NHS. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and First Minister Carwyn Jones attended Sunday's event at Bedwellty Park in Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent. Aneurin Bevan Day began with a banner parade from his former home on Charles Street involving about 200 people. Bevan, the architect of the NHS as minister of health in 1948, was born and brought up in Tredegar. Bethan Davies, 12, who lives in the town, said seeing the people marching past her house ""makes me feel really proud to be from Tredegar,"" while there were calls for a statue of him to be erected in his birthplace and a museum to be opened dedicated to the birth of the NHS.

Bevan was inspired by a late Victorian system that saw local miners and steel workers paying subscriptions every week to be covered for medical and hospital expenses. It spread to involve almost the whole town - and to include dental treatment, visits by a district nurse and even access to a physiotherapist. It was so successful that by the early 1930s more than 20,000 people were members of the Tredegar Workmen's Medical Aid Society. Tredegar Town Band led the procession on Bevan Day First Minister Carwyn Jones joined Blaenau Gwent's AM Alun Davies, MP Nick Smith and shadow Welsh secretary Christina Rees in the parade Bevan said in 1947: ""All I am doing is extending to the entire population of Britain the benefits we had in Tredegar for a generation or more. We are going to Tredegar-ise you."" Organised by the town council, Bevan Day also included Tredegar Comprehensive School pupils performing music and school oration and debating competitions.

Mr Corbyn told the crowd that growing inequalities in society caused many of the illnesses the NHS ended up treating. ""For years people were living longer and life expectancy was increasing,"" he said. ""That has now ground to a halt and in some parts of the country life expectancy is falling. This is unprecedented."" First Minister Carwyn Jones praised the NHS as a ""Tredegar invention, a Welsh invention, rolled out across the UK"". He said ""every single person here"" had a story involving the NHS, and he mentioned his own start in life as a baby in a special care unit. This video can not be played NHS at 70: Great-niece Mary Blake proud of Nye Bevan's legacy Aneurin Bevan overcame a speech impediment to become a noted orator Aneurin Bevan was born at 32 Charles Street, Tredegar, on 15 November 1897. His father was a miner and he was one of 10 children. He struggled at school and left at 13 to begin working in a local colliery before becoming a union activist and winning a scholarship to study in London. During the 1926 General Strike, he emerged as one of the leaders of the south Wales miners. In 1929, he was elected as the Labour MP for Ebbw Vale - which included Tredegar - and in 1934 married another Labour MP, Jennie Lee. After the landslide Labour victory in the 1945 general election, Bevan was appointed minister of health, responsible for establishing the National Health Service. The plaque near where 32 Charles Street once stood In 1951 he resigned from the government in protest at the introduction of prescription charges for dental care and spectacles. He died from cancer on 6 July 1960, aged 62. His ashes were scattered on the hills above Tredegar, and it was here that the Bevan Memorial Stones were unveiled by Michael Foot in 1972. A plaque marks the site of his birthplace, the row of miners' cottages now replaced by a housing complex. Rita, 96, said she remembered hearing ""brilliant"" Aneurin Bevan speak From babies in their prams, to elderly in wheelchairs, people of all ages turned out to celebrate Bevan's legacy in the town. And some remembered the birth of the NHS, or were born just days after it was founded. Rita Hale, 96, from Tredegar, said she had heard Bevan speak when she was young girl. She recalled him wearing a black cloak and a four cornered hat. ""I wish there were a few more like him today,"" she said. Tony was born in Tredegar four days after the NHS began - and believes was the first baby born in the town under the NHS While Tony, 70, who has lived in Tredegar all his life and was born just four days after the NHS was founded, said he thought the celebration was ""wonderful"". At the other end of the age range, pupils from Brynbach Primary School were involved in learning about their town's most famous son and took part in art and debating competitions. Following a class project on Aneurin Bevan, Year 6 pupils argued whether the NHS should still be free at the point of need. Lewis, 11, concluded that ""health shouldn't depend on wealth"" - to an audience including Health Secretary Vaughan Gething. ""Coming from Tredegar with all its history, we're quite proud someone world renowned came from here - and knowing what he did,"" said Lewis's mother Emma. Pupils from Brynbach Primary School took part in a debate on whether the NHS should be free at the point of need - and were watched by Health Secretary Vaughan Gething Brynbach Primary School pupil Oliver's prize winning art work to depict what the NHS means to him and his family Jacob's parents both work in the NHS and he was inspired to use the words of Bevan in his speech, in saying that the health service would last as long as people were prepared to fight for it. ""It's good that children learn about the values - and are really enthused about what he did,"" said his mother Alyson, a health visitor. Tredegar Town Band also premiered a new piece of music, Legacy, composed to mark the occasion - which will again be played in London on Thursday. Afterwards, Nygaire Bevan, great niece of Aneurin Bevan, was presented with a flame in a miner's lamp, which she will accompany on its journey to Westminster this week via the miners' mural at Llandough Hospital near Cardiff. She said she was ""particularly moved"" by the music and the procession involving the miners and the union banners, and said her great uncle would have been honoured. Tommy Smith, leader of Tredegar Town Council, said: ""It was really pleasing to see so many people come together - we're very proud in this town and we've tried to involve everybody.""

"This video can not be played James Brokenshire tells Andrew Marr he is confident his colleagues can agree a Brexit stance A cabinet minister says he is ""confident"" his colleagues will settle their differences over Brexit at a crunch summit at Chequers on Friday. James Brokenshire said there were ""strong views"" on both sides but predicted the away-day would yield a ""clear direction"" from the UK. Ministers are under increasing pressure to spell out what type of relationship with the EU the UK should pursue. EU chiefs demanded clarity from the UK at last week's Brussels summit. Theresa May has promised more details in a White Paper that will be published after Friday's cabinet get-together at her official country residence. 'Livid' Gove rips up EU customs report Kuenssberg: All eyes on Chequers 'Last call' for Brexit deal, EU warns The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations are taking place on what their future relationship will look like. But there is disagreement on the UK side about what sort of trading relationship to pursue with the EU, and how closely aligned they should be in years to come. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Brokenshire, the secretary of state for local government and housing, said: ""I think there's no doubt that there are strong views on either side and that's what I would expect as we lead into the discussions on Friday. ""But, equally, I remain confident that we will come out from that meeting with that clear direction, the White Paper that will follow, and actually setting out our vision for our future with our EU partners."" After Brexit day in March 2019, a temporary transition period is planned until the end of 2020 to allow an ""orderly withdrawal"" for the UK. Business Secretary Greg Clark did not rule out an extension to this arrangement, telling Sky News the government had to be ""guided by the evidence"" and avoid ""frictions"" at the border. He said the government would assess how long a new customs system would take to put in place, adding that ""it seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence"". Ministers have yet to agree on how to replace the UK's membership of the EU customs union - on Saturday it was revealed Environment Secretary Michael Gove had physically torn apart a report on Theresa May's preferred ""partnership"" arrangement. Brexiteer Conservative MPs have said they will not accept any extension to the transition phase. More than 30 have signed a letter to Mrs May urging her to face down people trying to ""undermine"" the 2016 vote to leave the EU. Their other demands include not replicating the EU's customs union and an end to the free movement of EU citizens. ""Our departure must be absolute,"" the MPs say. ""We must not remain entangled with the EU's institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation.  Anything less will be a weakening of our democracy. Britain must stand firm."" EU leaders have called on Theresa May to spell out her Brexit vision in detail Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns, who delivered the letter to the PM, tweeted: ""We must be clear to those in the cabinet and on the back benches, we will not sit back & allow a small minority to dominate."" Eurosceptic former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said Theresa May ""probably doesn't need letters... to tell her what to do"". He added: ""I just think we simply have to get behind her and say, 'let's get her over there and tell the European Union they need to do a trade agreement with us and do it pretty quickly'."" But pro-EU Labour MP Alison McGovern said there was a ""serious"" price attached to the government's negotiating red lines like leaving the EU's single market and customs union. And she said the Chequers meeting was vital. ""We now need to know what it is the cabinet is trying to achieve - so this cannot be more important."" There are also Brexit divisions within the Labour Party, with Jeremy Corbyn urged by some of his MPs to back staying in the EU's single market or support another referendum on the final deal. Campaigners for a so-called ""People's Vote"" have published a survey of members of Unite - the trade union that is Labour's biggest donor - where a majority were in favour of a second referendum. Of almost 1,000 polled by YouGov, 57% backed a second referendum compared with 34% who were against, while respondents believed, by a margin of by a margin of 58% to 21%, that leaving the single market would make Britain worse off. The People's Vote campaign said its survey provided ""clear evidence that workers are turning decisively against the bad Brexit deal emerging from political machinations in Westminster and botched negotiations in Brussels"". Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""It's not our policy to have a second referendum - it's our policy to respect the result of the referendum but to have serious negotiations with the EU to gain a customs union and access to the single market to protect jobs in this country."" He added that one of the reasons people voted to leave the EU was because of the UK's ""deeply unequal society where many former industrial areas lose out very badly because they haven't had the investment they need"".

"The group became cut off by the tide at Joss Bay, a popular beach on the Thanet coast Beachgoers have been warned of ""dangerous"" incoming tides which ""move quickly"" after eight people were cut off and had to be rescued. The coastguard was called at 12:30 BST on Saturday to help the group trapped by a locked gate at the bottom of the 39 Steps near Joss Bay in Kent. The rescue team was able to gain access to a path and helped the stranded people to safety. HM Coastguard duty controller Duncan Ley said they were ""extremely lucky"". Beaches around the coast have been packed with people enjoying the sun and cooling off as a heatwave grips the UK. Mr Ley said said there could have been a ""very different outcome"" at Joss Bay. He said: ""The UK's coastline is spectacular to explore - especially on glorious days like today, but incoming tides move very quickly and they can also be very, very dangerous."" He advised coastal walkers to check tide times and the weather forecast before setting off. He added: ""Carry a fully-charged mobile phone and tell someone where you are going and what time you will be home. ""If you do get cut off by the tide, don't attempt to climb cliffs as a short cut back to the top and do not attempt to self-rescue yourself or someone else if they get into difficulty. ""Our coastguards are skilfully trained in all manner of rescues, in all terrains and waters."" He said anyone in difficulty should call 999 and ask for the coastguard.

"This is the second prison break pulled off by Redoine Faid (pictured in 2010) A notorious gangster is on the run after escaping by helicopter from a prison in the Paris region. Redoine Faid was helped by three heavily-armed men with assault rifles. Two gunmen in balaclavas used smoke bombs and angle-grinders to break into the visitors' room where Faid was talking to his brother. A third man in the prison courtyard guarded the helicopter and its pilot - a flying instructor whom the men had taken hostage. The helicopter flew to the nearby Gonesse area, where it was found by local police. Faid, 46, has been serving a 25-year sentence for a failed robbery during which a police officer was killed. This is the armed robber's second prison break: in 2013, he escaped after seizing four guards as human shields and blowing several doors off with dynamite. He staged that escape less than half an hour after arriving at a prison in northern France, and spent six weeks on the run. The escape helicopter was found in Gonesse, north of Paris Faid escaped from the Sud-Francilien prison outside Paris Nearly 3,000 French police have been drafted into the manhunt, a police source told AFP. ""Everything is being done to locate the fugitive,"" an interior ministry official said. France's Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet, who travelled to the Sud-Francilien prison in RÃ©au on Sunday evening, called it ""a spectacular escape"". ""It was an extremely well-prepared commando unit that may have used drones to survey the area beforehand,"" she said. The prison courtyard where the helicopter landed was the only area not protected by anti-aircraft netting. Prison union representative Martial Delabroye said that was because inmates do not use it, ""except to leave the prison"". Nobody was injured during the jailbreak, which happened at around 11:20 (09:20 GMT) on Sunday. The captured pilot was released, and later taken to hospital suffering from shock. Faid's accomplices had taken the flying instructor hostage at a small flying club in Fontenay-TrÃ©signy, where he was waiting for a student, and ordered him to fly to the prison. Faid initially got out of the helicopter and into a black Renault Megane which was seen heading for the A1 motorway. That getaway car was later found burnt out at a shopping centre car park in Aulnay-sous-Bois, a Paris suburb. Early on Sunday afternoon, the fugitive was said to have swapped to a white van. Born in 1972, Faid grew up in a notoriously rough part of Paris. In the 1990s, he ran a gang involved in armed robbery and extortion in the French capital. He has said his lifestyle was inspired by Hollywood gangster films, including the Al Pacino thriller Scarface. He is devoted to US director Michael Mann's stylised crime thrillers, especially 1995 gangster film Heat. He once approached Mann at a Paris film festival and told him: ""You were my technical adviser."" Faid claimed to have watched the film dozens of times to hone his skills as a bank robber. Forensic police investigate the black car abandoned by Redoine Faid at a shopping centre car park In 2009, Faid wrote a book about his experiences of growing up in Paris's crime-ridden suburbs and graduating into a life of law-breaking. He claimed to have turned his back on criminality, but a year later was involved in the failed robbery which earned him a prison stretch in RÃ©au, in the Seine-et-Marne region. French police have nicknamed the gangster ""L'Ãcrivain"" - ""the writer"" - in a nod to his autobiography and subsequent media tour. One of Faid's most recent prison supervisors said he was never in conflict with guards, but that ""we must always be wary"". ""In the corner of his mind, he never lost the idea of escaping. Behind all his manners - he is very polite - he always hid his game,"" the supervisor said. Faid's cycle of imprisonment and escape began with his arrest in 1998 on multiple counts of armed robbery and bank theft. In 2009 he was freed on parole, swearing that he was a changed man - but by 2011, he had breached his terms of release and was back behind bars. In 2017, Faid was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for his 2013 jailbreak from SÃ©quedin prison, outside Lille. He was also given 18 years for masterminding a 2010 robbery in which a young policewoman, AurÃ©lie Fouquet, was killed. Faid mounted a failed appeal, and in April 2018 was given a heavier sentence of 25 years for the botched robbery. He was serving that term at the time of his latest escape. The fugitive is not the first to escape a French jail by helicopter. In 2001, three armed robbers fled a prison in Draguignan, southern France,external, after an accomplice hijacked a helicopter from an airfield in nearby St Tropez. Two years later, inmates accused of running an international drugs ring escaped a remand centre near Aix-en-Provence,externalby similar means.

"World Cup last 16 continues Spain v Russia at 15:00 BST Croatia face Denmark at 19:00 BST Get involved: #bbcworldcup or text on 81111 Steve Sutcliffe Right time for me to head off. Thanks for sticking with me today. You can taste all the excitement and build-up to Spain v Russiahere. Spain v Russia (15:00 BST) Steady I here you say. And I tend to agree but Spain midfielder David Silva is preparing for this afternoon's last-16 clash against World Cup hosts Russia as though he is facing the boys from Brazil. Spain are heading into the contest as clear favourites but have arguably yet been able to find their top gear. ""I think that in a World Cup any opponent is tough. We saw this in our own group, it was very hard for us to win,"" Silva said. ""Now we're playing against Russia and I'm sure it's going to be extremely difficult, as if we were playing against Brazil."" Croatia v Denmark (19:00 BST) Age Hareide has also called the dual of the game. Croatia's Luka Modric v his own man, Christian Eriksen. An absolutely pivotal battle that. ""It could be a match between Modric and Eriksen, that would be interesting, that would be great for the fans."" Croatia v Denmark (19:00 BST) Some more from the Denmark camp here and a promise of expansive football. Whoa what's this I hear you say - after six clean sheets in their past seven games, the Danes are going all sexy football - it's like being in 1986 again! But apparently so according to manager Age Hareide. ""I think you will see a different Denmark from what you have seen so far and the type of game we have played,"" he said. ""Yes, we need to defend but we need to attack more."" Croatia v Denmark (19:00 BST) Denmark's assistant coach Jon Dahl Tomasson says that William Kvist could feature in Sunday's game. That's some recovery by the way - the midfielder punctured a lung and broke two ribs in Denmark's opening match against Peru on 16 June. He's got a degree in Economics though so I'm sure he's weighed the odds! Winger Yussuf Poulsen is available after serving a one-game ban against France. Personally I can't wait to see Ivan Rakitic and Luka Modric working in tandem. A midfield general and supremely gifted playmaker. Old school maybe but a lovely blend. Croatia v Denmark (19:00 BST) Croatia made nine changes for their last game and will recall most if not all of the players rested against Iceland. Ivan Rakitic, Dejan Lovren and Mario Mandzukic will be among the names returning to the starting line-up. #bbcworldcup or text on 81111 Craig:I had a poster of John Barnes on my wall in the late 80s. At club level he was awesome, had no affiliation with Liverpool, just loved watching Barnes play. Johhny:I came to Australia as a child and my Nana always sent me rolled up Shoot magazines. Football this and Newcastle that. My fave England player was Chris Waddle, then Peter Beardsley, Gazza and then Alan Shearer. Waddle is still my fave, the Geordie sausage maker. Howay! Russia v Spain (15:00 BST) Alan Dzagoev, who injured his hamstring in Russia's 5-0 win over Saudi Arabia in their first World Cup match, will be fit to play against Spain today. Well that's what his dad says, anyway. Russia take on Spain this afternoon at Moscow's Luzhniki stadium after reaching the knockout stage of the tournament for the first time in the post-Soviet era. ""Alan is currently feeling good... He told me that he will play in the match against Spain, if not in the starting line-up then as a substitute,"" news agency TASS quoted Dzagoev's father Tarel as saying. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: What is mate? Pablo Zabaleta explains Another reason to lament Argentina and Lionel Messi's departure -  no more pictures of him and his team-mates eschewing the Powerade (other energy drinks are available) for little ornate pots of South American power-juice mate. Fear not though - Brazil and Uruguay's presence should ensure local supplier remain in business. That's what Alan Shearer thought anyway. Allow Twitter content?

I mean how often do you concede goals like this? Not very I'd venture to say. But it was exquisite.... Meanwhile the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli is cutting quite a defiant figure in defeat and with his job potentially on the line after it was widely reported he had fallen out with his players following a 3-0 group stage loss to Croatia. ""This is very painful, especially because the players have made a huge
effort,"" he said. ""It was a very difficult game but we have not achieved our
goal here in Russia. I'm sad, I'm frustrated - I think that's quite normal."" There are also some nice lines from England's Kieran Tripper in Phil McNulty'spiece. Despite starting his career at Manchester City, Trippier still supported Manchester United. Hope he kept that quiet at the time. He said,""I always liked how David Beckham played - his set-plays and his dead balls."" ""Gary Neville played a similar position to me. Defensively and offensively he was a quality player for Manchester United and England. His trophies speak for themselves. ""I loved Gary Neville's energy, to get up and down for 90 minutes and his leadership as well. He was always organising, he was passionate. It was just his all-round game. He was a quality defender and could also chip in with a goal and an assist.""

Matt sensibly became a Spurs fan after Italia90, then reverted back to the Owls.

Sad! Kristoff:I distinctly remember my father having many pictures of Henrik Larsen and Peter Schmeichel up after our European Championship victory in 1992. Any picture of the Laudrup brothers was banned until I left home for the UK, when I became a Swansea fan after Michael won the League Cup. Andy:A poster of the 1982 England World Cup team was my favourite growing up with Kevin Keegan and Bryan Robson to name a few. I even had the football shirt, what a kit! England's Dele Alli acknowledged the World Cup is the ""the highest level."" So were there any regrets about staying on against Tunisia in the opening game and potentially making his injury worse. ""No, I'm glad he kept me on,"" Alli said. ""I had a similar injury when we played Real Madrid and scored two so if I had scored maybe people would think differently. ""I felt like I could run it off and I told the manager and the physios I was OK."" Some more here from Dele Alli who played in England's Group G opener against Tunisia but then missed the final two group matches with a thigh strain. ""Personally, the only pressure is the pressure I put on myself,"" he said. ""I want to go
out there and do as well as I can if I'm selected. Be part of the starting 11
and help the team as much as a I can, play as well as I can."" A few bullish words from Tottenham and England midfielder Dele Alli, which I don't mind to  be honest. After all why not aim high? ""As a team we're not scared of anyone,"" he said. ""Whatever team you put in front of us we're not going
to hide, we'll go out there be confident in ourselves, play the way we want to
play and hopefully win the game. ""We've come here with the mentality we want to win it
and we're going to win it. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.018951261
"Organisers expected 15,000 people to attend Garage Nation festival in Hainault Forest Country Park Four men have been stabbed during a fight at an east London music festival. Two of the victims targeted at Garage Nation festival in Hainault Forest Country Park on Saturday were airlifted to hospital. One of them, a 26-year-old, may have life-changing injuries, the Metropolitan Police said. Officers believe the men were knifed during a fight in the VIP area before a group of male suspects ran towards the main entrance. The other victims had less serious ""stab and slash"" wounds, the Met said. The east London festival saw house, garage and RnB artists perform The second victim who was airlifted to hospital, a 22-year-old, has non life-threatening injuries. The third man went to an east London hospital with a less serious stab wound and has since left hospital. The fourth was treated at the scene by medics and left before police arrived. The Met were called at 19:35 BST and London Ambulance Service and London's Air Ambulance also attended. Police were called about seven hours into the festival, which started at midday There have been no arrests and inquiries continue. There were 15,000 people expected at the festival and more than 100 garage, house and RnB artists were performing, according to the event website. Mel Dee was on her way to one of the bars at the festival with three friends when she saw one of the victims get slashed across the back. ""We saw him go towards someone in quite an aggressive manner. Then he jolted back,"" she said. ""They'd slit his back, slashed him. It was very deep, he was fuming."" The 21-year-old, from north London, added: ""All of a sudden he'd ran towards whoever else it was and soon there were 15 of them. Other knives were pulled out. ""I could see people punching - arms flying everywhere. ""We ran as far away as we could."" Ms Dee said the security at Garage Nation was ""dreadful"". She said: ""They had a lack of security on the gate to get people through. They said, 'Can we check your bag?' and they got us to unzip our bags but they didn't search properly before letting us through. ""Other festivals I've been to are much more strict."" A spokesman from Garage Nation's promoters said: ""We run a strict four-stage policy search regime. ""The security was procured and agreed in line with the planning that has been ongoing for 12 months."" Organisers said they are assisting police with the investigation.

"President Trump and King Salman of Saudi Arabia discussed oil production by phone US President Donald Trump has urged Saudi Arabia to sharply increase its oil production to combat the rising cost of fuel. Mr Trump tweeted that he had asked Saudi ruler King Salman to raise oil output by up to two million barrels a day. ""Prices to [sic] high! He has agreed!"" the president added. Mr Trump said the move was needed due to ""turmoil and dysfunction in Iran and Venezuela"". Oil prices rose last week, partly due to US plans to reimpose sanctions on Iran, a major oil producer.

"A woman casts her ballot at a polling station in Oaxaca state Polls are closing across Mexico in elections marred by some of the worst political violence for decades. More than 130 candidates and political workers have been killed since campaigning began in September. The presidential frontrunner is AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, 64, the left-wing former mayor of Mexico City who has pledged to crack down on corruption. The coalition led by his party, Morena, could oust the two parties that have governed Mexico for nearly a century. Five things to know about the election Under the crosses of CuliacÃ¡n A guide to the drug cartels Analysis by Will Grant, BBC News, Mexico This has been the most violent election campaign in Mexico in living memory. Now that voting day has arrived, however, many Mexicans see it as an opportunity to remove the government that has led the country to this point. Millions of ordinary Mexicans are angry at President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto and his administration, particularly over the sluggish economy and widespread corruption, crime and impunity. The man widely expected to replace him, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador who is often referred to just by his initials Amlo, was the runner-up in the last two presidential elections. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador gives a thumbs-up as he leaves the polling station He has made tackling corruption the central plank of his election platform, promising to improve wages and pensions by stamping out rampant abuses by the state and the political and business elites. His opponents, including the centre-right candidate, Ricardo Anaya, have tried to paint him as a populist and a dangerous maverick who cannot be trusted with the economy. Most polls suggest, however, that a majority of voters have not listened to that message and are prepared to hand Mr LÃ³pez Obrador the presidency, third time around. Long queues of voters formed outside schools and community centres as polling day progressed but two more killings of party members were reported - one a member of the Workers' Party in the western state of Michoacan and the other a member of the governing PRI party in the central state of Puebla. Some 88 million people have been eligible to vote, and have been choosing not only a president but also 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. A huge crowd gathered outside the polling station in Mexico City's Tlalpan district to watch Mr LÃ³pez Obrador cast his vote. He called the election ""historic"" and told reporters: ""We represent the possibility of real change"". AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, (L) has been the front-runner ahead of Jose Antonio Meade (C) and Ricardo Anaya His closest rival looks to be Mr Anaya who heads a centre-right coalition. The candidate for the governing PRI party is JosÃ© Antonio Meade, a former finance minister. Polling stations began closing at 18:00 local time (23:00 GMT) and the first results are expected in the coming hours. If Mr LÃ³pez Obrador wins this time, he will end the dominance in Mexican politics of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the National Action Party (PAN). He has referred to them as being part of the same ""mafia of power"".

Even before his own election, US President Donald Trump has continuously attacked Mexico over migration and trade. Who the next Mexican president will be and how he deals with President Trump and his plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and build a border wall will therefore be key to US-Mexican relations.

"This video can not be played The Winter Hill blaze has spread over Lancashire moorland Fire crews are continuing to battle ""a rapidly developing and aggressive fire"" on moorland across Lancashire. A major incident was declared when strong winds caused two large fires to merge close to major communication masts. Police told walkers and motorists to stay away from the scene at Winter Hill and Scout Road near Bolton. More than 100 firefighters from around England are tackling the fire, Lancashire Fire service said. Firefighters try to quell the blaze The Winter Hill blaze is now in its fourth day It comes as crews from across the country also joinedfirefighters and the Armycombat a blaze 30 miles away at Saddleworth Moor in Greater Manchester, which started a week ago. Along with the Winter Hill fire, it has blanketed the region in smoke and ash. People in nearby areas have been asked to keep doors and windows closed. The Winter Hill blaze, which started on Thursday near a major TV transmitter, is smouldering in pockets across a 3 sq miles (8 sq km) area. A 22-year-old man, from Bolton, was arrested on Friday on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. The fire stretches over 3 sq miles (8 sq km) Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said it was expecting to tackle the fire until Tuesday at the earliest.

The current moorland fires are relatively unusual, says Alastair Lewis, professor at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, but they could become more frequent because of climate change. Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London, said a population increase and the growth of development on the fringe of urban areas has also contributed. He says the link between fires and climate change is even stronger in northern Europe. While small fires can be beneficial to moorlands, large and intense fires damage ecosystems, he added. The Met Office says nearly all moorland fires in the UK are started by people - such as from campfires or discarded cigarettes and glass - whereas lightning strikes are frequently the cause in other parts of the world. The UK's peaty moorlands are massive carbon reservoirs, which become tinder-boxes during prolonged dry spells, says Nick Ostle from Lancaster Environment Centre. Source:Science Media Centre,external Lancashire assistant chief fire officer Dave Russell said: ""Moorland firefighting is very demanding - the firefighters are dealing with undulating terrain, different types of vegetation but also the logistics of deploying resources onto the moorland present us with a number of challenges. ""We're dealing with smouldering fire and flame thumps, which could be 6 to 8 feet. ""My concern primarily yesterday was that, on the top of Winter Hill, there are a number of radio telecommunication systems, which are essentially part of critical national infrastructure."" A firefighter walks away from smoke as it rises over Winter Hill Trenches have been dug to prevent the fire spreading, including one around a house that was evacuated, while a helicopter has been dropping water to help douse the flames. Arson arrest over Winter Hill moor fire Fire-ravaged moors community rallies round What the moorland fire means for wildlife Greater Manchester assistant chief fire officer Dave Keelan said: ""This is an exceptionally challenging time and I am proud of the hard work and brave commitment of our firefighters."" Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said there was no significant rain forecast in the area this week. She added that ""winds are likely to pick up overnight"", which could worsen the fire. Dave Guest, BBC News Residents have been told to keep windows shut The terrain is difficult, the ground is tinder-dry and fire crews are being hampered by strong winds, which have continually whipped up the flames. The problem with peat fires, as we discovered on Saddleworth Moor last week, is they can often burn underground for quite some time and then pop up in different areas. The firefighters say a number of sightseers have been coming up here - ignoring road closures to try to get a closer look - and they're saying don't do that because it is very dangerous. There are about 200 firefighters on the moors, split over seven areas of wildfire at Saddleworth and Winter Hill. About 100 soldiers from the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, were sent from their Yorkshire barracks on Thursday to aid firefighters in Saddleworth for an initial 48-hour deployment.

In recent days there have been several warnings that time is running out to reach agreement before the autumn, so that a deal can be ratified by politicians. Theresa May's cabinet will gather at Chequers on Friday to try to agree a ""clear direction"" that the UK wants to follow in trade talks. Last October Mr Stevens told MPs he had not been asked by the government to examine the potential impact of the UK leaving in March 2019 with no deal in place. Asked about this scenario, he told Andrew Marr: ""There is immediate planning which the health department, with other parts of government, are undertaking around securing medicine supply and equipment under different scenarios. ""That will obviously crystallise when it's clear later this autumn what the UK's position will be."" He also said every hospital had been asked to ""reach out"" to EU nationals working there with information about how to apply to stay in the UK. There have been warnings about the UK leaving Euratom, which regulates Europe's nuclear industry, including the supply of medical isotopes which are essential for various types of cancer treatment. Prime Minister Theresa May has called for the UK to have a ""close association"" with Euratom after Brexit. She has also said the UK will seek ""associate membership"" of the European Medicines Agency, which evaluates and supervises medicines and helps national authorities authorise the sale of drugs across the EU's single market.

"This video can not be played Juncker: May will resolve Brexit splits ""The last call""... ""we cannot wait any more""... ""huge and serious"" gaps. European leaders can repeat the same message, louder and louder. But this EU summit's instructions to Theresa May may as well have been shouted into an empty cupboard. Because they know what she knows - that the past 24 hours of Brexit conversations are not nearly as important as the next seven days of discussions at home between Number 10 and the rest of the government. 'Last call' for Brexit deal, Tusk warns May warns EU: Put citizens' safety first And after more than two years, this time next week ministers should be nearing the conclusion of their country retreat at Chequers. It's there that the prime minister hopes to find resolution in her team on a more detailed offer to the rest of the EU - easing, if not removing, all the contradictions in the Tories' positions. Any pretence that the cabinet agrees is long gone. The government's promised publication of their choices within days, which if comprehensive and detailed as promised, will mark a big step forward, and in theory allow progress towards a final deal. But if the eventual Brexit white paper is flimsy - still a list of tentative options - patience in Brussels may finally run out. Sources suggest that if there is no clarity from the UK next week, all that will be available to Britain is a simple free trade deal. For many months, Theresa May has held the ring while inside her party brawls over Brexit have raged. If she can't end the fight, by picking a winning side or forcing a persuasive compromise, the EU may call time. In the next seven days the prime minister has hurdles she must clear to secure her future.

According to the Sunday Times, Theresa May has a defiant message,externalfor hardline Brexiteers: ""Oust me if your dare."" It says she will present the cabinet with a plan to keep Britain closely aligned to EU rules on the sale of goods when they meet at the prime minister's country residence in Chequers. At the same time she's made it clear she will not be ""bullied"" out of office unless rebels can muster the support of 159 Tory MPs needed to bring her down.

Elsewhere, the lead in theSunday Telegraph reveals senior Tory Eurosceptic MPs have been trying to forge alliances,externalwith the Trump administration.

Meanwhile, severalpapers report that Jeremy Corbyn is facing pressure from members of the trade union, Unite,external, to change his Brexit stance. The Sunday Mirror reports the results of a survey which finds that six out of 10 Unite members think Britain would be worse off outside the single market - even though Labour favours quitting.  The paper believes the results will infuriate the union's general secretary Len McCluskey who is a close ally of Mr Corbyn.

As a result he is said to be determined to help solve a problem that has stumped a series of world leaders.

It says Mexico's National Commission of Human Rights has called on the regional authorities to guarantee the safety of journalists on polling day.

"Holidaymakers who book hotels and flights from different firms but via a single travel intermediary will now get the same protection as those buying traditional package holidays. Package holidaymakers are both financially and legally covered if things go wrong. But those who book different elements of their holiday separately have been less well protected. The new EU regulations attempt to close the gap in consumer protection. ""Proper package holidays are the gold standard of travel,"" Simon Calder, travel correspondent at The Independent, told the BBC. ""By booking flights and accommodation in a single transaction from a tour operator, you transfer all the risk to the company. They have to sort out things like cancelled flight or an overbooked hotel. ""They also have to provide a refund or compensation as appropriate. But with the growth of online travel agents, people have been buying what they think is a package holiday, only to discover when it all goes wrong that the travel firm denies all responsibility. ""With these new changes the basic rule is - if it looks like a package holiday, with flights, accommodation and possibly a rental car all included in a single transaction, then it should have with all the prodigious consumer protection that comes with a proper package."" He said that already some companies such as On The Beach and Travel Republic had changed their terms to reflect the change. However he warned that if you are asked to pay separately online for flights and accommodation, it is likely you won't get any extra protection. The government said the new rules would protect an extra 10 million package travel holidays a year. The Package Travel Regulations 2018 were prompted by the growing number of people who book flights, hotels and other tourist services, like car hire, online. Last year 83% of British people booked a holiday over the internet. The new rules will also apply to people who go into a High Street travel agent and pick and choose separate elements of their holiday and pay for them all together. Until now mix-and-match holidays were financially protected, if an airline went out of business, for example. However, if a holidaymaker had a grievance with a hotelier, for example, they would have had to pursue any legal action themselves. Widening the definition of a package holiday means that from now on in such a situation the travel company is ""responsible for making sure that you get the holiday you paid for"", theAssociation of British Travel Agents,external(Abta) said in its guidance on the new rules. ""If something isn't provided or isn't as expected, and your travel company or its suppliers is at fault, they will need to sort this out for you,"" it added. Travel litigation specialist Joanne Brine of JMW Solicitors said: ""Should anything happen while you're on holiday - such as an accident or injury on hotel property - subsequent claims will be more straightforward to deal with, since the operator you booked with will hold liability if travel services aren't provided with reasonable skill and care. ""Plus, if an operator goes bust, you're guaranteed to receive a full refund or, if you're already abroad, to be brought home. Added legal protection also gives the right to help if weather conditions or industrial action hamper your plans. The European Union (EU)Package Travel Directive,externalapplies in all 28 EU nations. Earlier this year, theUK government issued guidance,externalon what it means for the UK travel industry. ""Package holiday regulations have finally been dragged out of the dark ages,"" said Which? travel editor Rory Boland. ""These new rules mean far more holidays will be classed as packages, giving holidaymakers protection when something goes wrong."" However, there are instances when a holidaymaker might think they are fully covered when they are not. That is because there are separate rules for ""linked travel arrangements"" online. This is when someone buys a flight on an airline's website, for example, and pays for it. They might be encouraged to go to a separate accommodation site, either immediately or within the next 24 hours, and they pay for a hotel or car rental separately. This arrangement is not classed as a package. It does not have any legal protection and the financial protection is at a lower level than for packages.

"Despite being a razor brand, Billie says it wants to remove the stigma around body hair ""Body hair. Everyone has it."" Simple words, but they've prompted a debate in the US and beyond this week thanks to a new razor advert that shows women actually shaving their body hair. Surely that's not so revolutionary? Except it is - because normally ads for women's razors show plastic-perfect, airbrushed legs that are already totally smooth. Razor brand Billie says it's the first to feature hairy women for 100 years and the advert has gone viral as a result. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

""I don't like razors but that ad is dope,"" agreed @hanguk0. ""When brands pretend that all women have hairless bodies,it's a version of body-shaming,"" Billie co-founder Georgina Gooley told Glamour magazine,external. ""It's saying you should feel ashamed of having body hair."" As well as its advert, the brand has launched an online campaign to normalise images of fuzzy, stubbly, natural women. It has donated positive, unflinching pictures to the stock photo site Unsplash,external, which people can use for free. Fans of the ad campaign said it had made them feel more positive about their body hair Amid the tide of support, however, some asked why a razor company would be trying to reduce taboos around body hair. In a piece for US website Slate, writer Rachelle Hampton observed: ""It's true that at this point in life, I enjoy the feeling of a smooth leg as much as anybody else,external. But I wouldn't have started shaving had I not been convinced by the age of 11 that there was something fundamentally wrong with having body hair."" Can a company selling razors really say it's not complicit in that? Billie addresses the issue with a line of pop-up text: ""If and when you feel like shaving, we're here.""

"This video can not be played ""Our humanity is at stake,"" Alicia Keys tells a rally in Washington Tens of thousands of people have joined nationwide protests across the US over the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies. More than 630 events were planned, with protesters calling for migrant families split at the US border to be reunited. Some 2,000 children remain separated from their parents, despite President Donald Trump bowing to public outrage and curtailing the policy. Concerns remain that records were not kept linking parents and children. Major protests took place in Washington DC, New York, and many other cities, using the hashtag #familiesbelongtogether. Marchers held placards calling for no more family separations and for the controversial immigration agency ICE to be abolished. Analysis by Tara McKelvey, White House reporter, BBC News The nation is deeply divided about immigration policy, and the president ignited the debate again with his tweets on Saturday. From his golf resort at Bedminster, New Jersey, he defended the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Twitter, describing it as the ""smartest, toughest and most spirited"" of law-enforcement groups. Meanwhile the movement to abolish ICE has been ""going mainstream"", according to some activists, and thousands have taken to the streets to protest the president's policies. More than 100 protesters gathered near the president's resort (""My civility is locked in a cage"", said one of their signs). I drove past the protesters on my way to the resort where I spent part of the day. As demonstrations heated up in New Jersey and across the US, the president was doubling down on his effort to promote his hardline policies. ""It goes against everything we stand for as a country,"" one protester, Paula Flores-Marques, 27, told Reuters in front of the White House in Washington DC. President Trump was out of town. In New York they chanted, ""Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here"". In Chicago, protesters marched to the local offices of federal immigration authorities. The original Trump administration ""zero tolerance"" policy required authorities to arrest and detain anyone crossing the Mexico-US border illegally. That meant separating children from their parents and holding them separately. This video can not be played What do Trump supporters make of the family separations? Faced with a massive public outcry after recordings were published of distressed, crying children in detention centres, President Trump promised to ""keep families together"" in migrant detention centres. Migrant families separation: The big picture explained But critics say the order did not address the issue of families already separated, leaving uncertainty over the fate of 2,342 children taken away from their parents between 5 May and 9 June alone. Earlier this week,a judge in California ordered the families to be reunited within 30 days. It also still requires authorities to detain immigrant families, rather than release them with a court date to return. Organisers said they wanted to send a message to President Trump, prompted by concerns that he would renege on his executive order. ""We cannot slow down now since the court ruling alone isn't enough and could be overturned,"" said a statement on the movement's website. This video can not be played Veronica is terrified she'll be separated from her daughter when she seeks asylum at the US border As well as the reunification of parents and children, organisers called for an end to immigrant detention - even when families are kept together - and also planned to voice opposition to President Trump's travel ban targeting five majority-Muslim nations, which was upheld by the US Supreme Court earlier this week. What is the Trump travel ban? 'Imagine your child clinging to your leg' Children 'in cages' in Texas Demonstrations were also likely to focus on the shake-up of the Supreme Court after Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement last week,giving President Trump the opportunity to solidify a conservative majority on the country's top court. This video can not be played Drone footage shows a ""tent city"" immigration centre Much of the uproar over the separation policy came after news organisations reported on children being held in cells, converted warehouses and desert tents around the country. President Trump on Saturday defended the agency that played a central role in carrying out the separations - the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He told its employees: ""You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave!"" Organisers issued instructions for people to dress in white, to represent peace and unity. The main march is taking place in Washington DC, but one of the people behind the movement, Anna Galland, said separate events were planned in 50 states. Allow Twitter content?

The protests are not the first against Mr Trump's immigration policy. Nearly 600 women were arrested on Thursday during a sit-in at a US Senate building against the government's migration policy.Actress Susan Sarandon was among those detained. Many were draped in foil sheets to highlight the flimsy bedding given to migrant children held in border detention facilities. President Trump's ""zero tolerance"" policy has strong support among his key Republican support base. He has repeatedly defended the policy, saying it is simply enforcing the law. Under a crackdown rolled out in May, all border crossers - including first-time offenders - are criminally charged and jailed.

"A woman casts her ballot at a polling station in Oaxaca state Polls are closing across Mexico in elections marred by some of the worst political violence for decades. More than 130 candidates and political workers have been killed since campaigning began in September. The presidential frontrunner is AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, 64, the left-wing former mayor of Mexico City who has pledged to crack down on corruption. The coalition led by his party, Morena, could oust the two parties that have governed Mexico for nearly a century. Five things to know about the election Under the crosses of CuliacÃ¡n A guide to the drug cartels Analysis by Will Grant, BBC News, Mexico This has been the most violent election campaign in Mexico in living memory. Now that voting day has arrived, however, many Mexicans see it as an opportunity to remove the government that has led the country to this point. Millions of ordinary Mexicans are angry at President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto and his administration, particularly over the sluggish economy and widespread corruption, crime and impunity. The man widely expected to replace him, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador who is often referred to just by his initials Amlo, was the runner-up in the last two presidential elections. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador gives a thumbs-up as he leaves the polling station He has made tackling corruption the central plank of his election platform, promising to improve wages and pensions by stamping out rampant abuses by the state and the political and business elites. His opponents, including the centre-right candidate, Ricardo Anaya, have tried to paint him as a populist and a dangerous maverick who cannot be trusted with the economy. Most polls suggest, however, that a majority of voters have not listened to that message and are prepared to hand Mr LÃ³pez Obrador the presidency, third time around. Long queues of voters formed outside schools and community centres as polling day progressed but two more killings of party members were reported - one a member of the Workers' Party in the western state of Michoacan and the other a member of the governing PRI party in the central state of Puebla. Some 88 million people have been eligible to vote, and have been choosing not only a president but also 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. A huge crowd gathered outside the polling station in Mexico City's Tlalpan district to watch Mr LÃ³pez Obrador cast his vote. He called the election ""historic"" and told reporters: ""We represent the possibility of real change"". AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, (L) has been the front-runner ahead of Jose Antonio Meade (C) and Ricardo Anaya His closest rival looks to be Mr Anaya who heads a centre-right coalition. The candidate for the governing PRI party is JosÃ© Antonio Meade, a former finance minister. Polling stations began closing at 18:00 local time (23:00 GMT) and the first results are expected in the coming hours. If Mr LÃ³pez Obrador wins this time, he will end the dominance in Mexican politics of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the National Action Party (PAN). He has referred to them as being part of the same ""mafia of power"".

High levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas. Can Mexico save its journalists? Shot after investigating her daughter's death Mexico has a reputation for being one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists. Even before his own election, US President Donald Trump has continuously attacked Mexico over migration and trade. Who the next Mexican president will be and how he deals with President Trump and his plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and build a border wall will therefore be key to US-Mexican relations. The impact of Trump on illegal immigration Mr LÃ³pez Obrador has been the most critical of Mr Trump on the campaign trail. He has said he will make the US president ""see reason"". But on the matter of children being separated from their migrant parents at the US border, Mr Anaya went further than Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, saying that ""it reminds me of what the Nazis did in WWII, it's completely unacceptable"". Mr Meade has also criticised President Trump over the tariffs the US recently imposed on Mexican steel. This video can not be played If Nafta trade deal was a hamburger...

"This video can not be played The Winter Hill blaze has spread over Lancashire moorland Fire crews are continuing to battle ""a rapidly developing and aggressive fire"" on moorland across Lancashire. A major incident was declared when strong winds caused two large fires to merge close to major communication masts. Police told walkers and motorists to stay away from the scene at Winter Hill and Scout Road near Bolton. More than 100 firefighters from around England are tackling the fire, Lancashire Fire service said. Firefighters try to quell the blaze The Winter Hill blaze is now in its fourth day It comes as crews from across the country also joinedfirefighters and the Armycombat a blaze 30 miles away at Saddleworth Moor in Greater Manchester, which started a week ago. Along with the Winter Hill fire, it has blanketed the region in smoke and ash. People in nearby areas have been asked to keep doors and windows closed. The Winter Hill blaze, which started on Thursday near a major TV transmitter, is smouldering in pockets across a 3 sq miles (8 sq km) area. A 22-year-old man, from Bolton, was arrested on Friday on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. The fire stretches over 3 sq miles (8 sq km) Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said it was expecting to tackle the fire until Tuesday at the earliest.

The current moorland fires are relatively unusual, says Alastair Lewis, professor at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, but they could become more frequent because of climate change. Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London, said a population increase and the growth of development on the fringe of urban areas has also contributed. He says the link between fires and climate change is even stronger in northern Europe. While small fires can be beneficial to moorlands, large and intense fires damage ecosystems, he added. The Met Office says nearly all moorland fires in the UK are started by people - such as from campfires or discarded cigarettes and glass - whereas lightning strikes are frequently the cause in other parts of the world. The UK's peaty moorlands are massive carbon reservoirs, which become tinder-boxes during prolonged dry spells, says Nick Ostle from Lancaster Environment Centre. Source:Science Media Centre,external Lancashire assistant chief fire officer Dave Russell said: ""Moorland firefighting is very demanding - the firefighters are dealing with undulating terrain, different types of vegetation but also the logistics of deploying resources onto the moorland present us with a number of challenges. ""We're dealing with smouldering fire and flame thumps, which could be 6 to 8 feet. ""My concern primarily yesterday was that, on the top of Winter Hill, there are a number of radio telecommunication systems, which are essentially part of critical national infrastructure."" A firefighter walks away from smoke as it rises over Winter Hill Trenches have been dug to prevent the fire spreading, including one around a house that was evacuated, while a helicopter has been dropping water to help douse the flames. Arson arrest over Winter Hill moor fire Fire-ravaged moors community rallies round What the moorland fire means for wildlife Greater Manchester assistant chief fire officer Dave Keelan said: ""This is an exceptionally challenging time and I am proud of the hard work and brave commitment of our firefighters."" Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said there was no significant rain forecast in the area this week. She added that ""winds are likely to pick up overnight"", which could worsen the fire. Dave Guest, BBC News Residents have been told to keep windows shut The terrain is difficult, the ground is tinder-dry and fire crews are being hampered by strong winds, which have continually whipped up the flames. The problem with peat fires, as we discovered on Saddleworth Moor last week, is they can often burn underground for quite some time and then pop up in different areas. The firefighters say a number of sightseers have been coming up here - ignoring road closures to try to get a closer look - and they're saying don't do that because it is very dangerous. There are about 200 firefighters on the moors, split over seven areas of wildfire at Saddleworth and Winter Hill. About 100 soldiers from the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, were sent from their Yorkshire barracks on Thursday to aid firefighters in Saddleworth for an initial 48-hour deployment. Their presence has been extended until Monday afternoon following a request by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham.
