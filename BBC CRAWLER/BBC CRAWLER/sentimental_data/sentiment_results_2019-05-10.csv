"This video can not be played Hammond: Economy is robust The UK economy picked up in the first three months of the year after manufacturers' stockpiling ahead of Brexit helped to boost growth. Growth was 0.5% in the quarter, up from 0.2% in the previous three months,the Office for National Statistics said.,external The manufacturing sector grew at its fastest rate since 1988 in the period. The ONS said this was driven by manufacturers rushing to deliver orders before the original Brexit deadline of 29 March. Pharmaceuticals was one of the sectors most affected, expanding 9.4% between January and March. Previous business surveys had shownmanufacturers stockpiling goods for Brexitin case the UK left the EU without a transition deal, which they feared could lead to delays at UK borders. As well as manufacturers rushing to deliver orders before the UK was due to leave the EU, firms also stockpiled parts. This drove a surge in imports, with the total trade deficit - the gap between what the UK imports and exports - doubling in the first quarter to a record high,separate data from the ONS showed.,external The total trade deficit widened from Â£8.9bn to Â£18.3bn, driven partly by a sharp increase in imports of cars and gold. However, the UK's deadline to exit the EU has since been extended until the end of October after Prime Minister Theresa May asked the EU for more time to negotiate a deal. Does GDP tell the whole economic story? Bank warns of 'more frequent' rate rises Chancellor Philip Hammond said the figures showed the economy remained ""robust"". ""These GDP figures this morning show again that the UK economy is performing robustly, despite the evidence of slowing global growth and the continued Brexit uncertainty at home - so it's good news,"" he told the BBC. But analysts have warned the impact of Brexit could mean the pick-up in growth is short-lived. Tej Parikh, senior economist at business lobby group the Institute of Directors, said it could well be just ""a flash in the pan"". ""Some businesses brought activity forward early this year in preparation for leaving the EU, so higher stocks and earlier orders have artificially bumped up the growth numbers. ""In the second quarter, many firms will be keen to run down their Brexit caches, which will drag on economic growth,"" he said. But Ruth Gregory, senior UK Economist at Capital Economics, said the figures offered some ""encouraging signs that underlying growth gained some pace"". She said household consumption growth was ""solid"" and pointed out that business investment grew ""for the first time in four quarters"". There's something upbeat in today's figures and also something downbeat, quite possibly with the same cause. In spite of all the political fuss, the economy grew better than it has in a while. At 1.8% for the year, it is almost at pre-financial crisis rates, when growth of 2-3% a year was normal. The figures can be taken to confirm predictions that there would be a boost to economic growth from ""stockpiling"" - firms spending more than usual building up their stocks of supplies, just in case a no-deal Brexit meant cross-border trade seized up. Manufacturing enjoyed a boost and more cars were imported than usual. You can't tell from these figures alone, but that may also be due to stockpiling: a ""buy-now-while-stocks-last"" effect in case the pound dropped (making imported cars more expensive) and tariffs were imposed (ditto). But here's the downer. Partly due to higher imports, the trade deficit doubled, from Â£8.9bn to Â£18.3bn. Because we enjoy a surplus in services, exporting more than we import, it looks even worse when you strip out services. The trade in goods deficit in the first quarter widened to a record: Â£43.3bn including non-monetary gold, which rose by Â£6bn. We know from numerous economic studies: people buy gold when they're worried. It looks like, in the first quarter of the year, economic growth was lifted - by anxiety. It's small, but you might call it a mini ""worry-boom"". Does GDP tell the whole economic story?

"The USS Arlington will join the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Gulf The US is sending a Patriot missile-defence system to the Middle East amid escalating tensions with Iran. A warship, USS Arlington, with amphibious vehicles and aircraft on board, will also join the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group in the Gulf. And US B-52 bombers have arrived at a base in Qatar, the Pentagon said. The US said the moves were a response to a possible threat to US forces in the region by Iran, without specifying. Iran dismissed the claim as nonsense. Tehran has described the deployments as ""psychological warfare"" aimed at intimidating the country. Fact file: Patriot missile defence Battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal begins Iran has also suggested it may resume uranium enrichment nuclear activities. The Pentagon says US forces are responding to a possible threat to US forces, but did not offer any specifics regarding those threats. The latest Pentagon statement on Friday said only that Washington was ""ready to defend US forces and interests in the region"", adding that the US did not seek conflict with Iran. There are about 5,200 US troops currently deployed in neighbouring Iraq. The US Patriot missile defence system (stock photo) The Patriot system can counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. Officials told US media the USS Arlington had already been scheduled to go to the region, but its deployment was brought forward to provide enhanced command and control capabilities. The USS Abraham Lincoln passed through the Suez Canal on Thursday, US Central Command said. Iran's semi-official Isna news agency quoted a senior Iranian cleric, Yousef Tabatabai-Nejad, as saying that the US military fleet could be ""destroyed with one missile"". Last year, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal America and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015. Under the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Nuclear deal - all you need to know How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard Is it about to become more expensive to fill my car? Last month,the US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group. The White House proceeded to end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil. The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests. The Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a ""new deal"" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its ""malign behaviour"" across the Middle East. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - through which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass. Earlier this week Iran announced that it had suspended two commitments under the 2015 accord in response to the economic sanctions the US had re-imposed. It also threatened to step up uranium enrichment if it was not shielded from the sanctions' effects within 60 days. European powers said they remained committed to the Iran nuclear deal but that they ""reject any ultimatums"" from Tehran to prevent its collapse. The real battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal has begun. In the year since the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the deal, Iran and all the other parties have carried on regardless. And the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, has repeatedly given Tehran a clean bill of health. Iran has been living up to its part of the bargain. But Iranian compliance was not the issue for the Trump administration, which says simply that this is a bad deal. The US's main European allies, along with Russia and China, disagree. So the Trump administration has been ratcheting up the pressure on Tehran. The pressure on Iran's economy has been severe and the Iranian government has now decided to act - saying it will no longer respect restrictions on storing enriched uranium and heavy water, and setting deadlines for the other parties to implement their commitments. A difficult couple of months of diplomacy lie ahead, with no guarantee of success. The Trump administration must see its ultimate goal - the collapse of the nuclear deal - as now being in sight. But the danger of conflict - albeit by accident rather than design - is growing.

"How can the number-crunchers get a better idea of the nation's well-being? Answering a simple ""How are you?"" with an honest detailed answer may lead to an awkward silence. After all, it's often just longhand for ""hello"". But the government's official number-crunchers at the Office for National Statistics genuinely care about the response. Next week, they'll publish their statistics into how people across the country are feeling about their lives. Have they gone soft? Not quite. They've realised that how we've traditionally measured living standards or economic well-being isn't up to scratch. We typically turn to GDP - gross domestic product. That's the measure of how much companies, individuals and the government earn/spend/produce (in theory, each of those give the same answer), with an adjustment for exports less imports. It measures the nation's net income, but may not tell the whole story. First, there are things which can skew the big picture. Take the first three months of this year, when the economy grew by 0.5%,according to the latest official figures.,external At the time, many companies were busy stockpiling components and finished goods due to fears of a no-deal Brexit. That makes growth look stronger, but that buzz of activity reflects contingency planning rather than a response to strong demand. And it may mean less of that activity further down the line, making growth look weaker in subsequent quarters. Even without distortions, GDP may not reflect the individual situation. The fates of government businesses and households will differ hugely in any quarter. The ONS provides a breakdown of some details. It has recently delved deeper into households' situations with a well-being dashboard, which looks at things such as incomes, debt and anxiety levels (Spoiler alert:  the most recent version shows most things on the rise). And there'll be winners and losers across the country. The Bank of England has also doubled down on work to highlight the fate of different regions. But then there's what is left out by GDP: basically, anything unpaid, from volunteering to housework. In other words, items that aren't termed ""market activity"". Economist Paul Samuelson joked that if a man marries his maid, GDP falls. It's not so much a joke as a criticism (and not just of outdated gender stereotyping) that statisticians fail to value certain types of work. The problem is that without payment, such work is hard to put a price tag on. Feeling a bit hard done-by aside, how much does that matter, given what policymakers actually use GDP for? The Bank of England manages the economy by setting interest rates to influence spending and borrowing, while the government uses the figures to gauge how much tax might come in. And of course, there's a multitude of other factors -  from crime to gender equality, biodiversity, access to clean energy and education levels - that hit our current and future living standards. These are just a few of the Sustainable Development Goals that the US has spelled out. The ONS has embarked on a marathon task to identify and measure hundreds of indicators to reflect those. They are about two-thirds of the way there - and even when they have finessed them, collecting the information on a regular basis may not be quick as gleaning GDP information. The number-crunchers acknowledge the need for a more ""holistic"" gauge of our well-being. GDP is three little letters that represents more than a trillion pounds of crucial and relatively easy to collect information on the financial state of our economy. It isn't perfect, but it still has its uses. Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Iran has insisted that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful World powers and Iran are trying to revive a landmark nuclear deal that has been close to collapse for three years. Here's how it got to this point. Iran has always insisted its nuclear programme is peaceful. But suspicions it was being used as a cover to develop a nuclear bomb prompted the UN, US and EU to impose crippling sanctions from 2010. In 2015, Iran reached a deal with six powers - China, France, Germany, Russia, the US and the UK - that saw it limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. Iran says it will not return to complying with the deal until the US lifts crippling sanctions A focus of concern was Iran's production of enriched uranium, which has civilian uses but can also be used in nuclear weapons. Restrictions were placed on the amount of the material that it could stockpile; the level of purity; and the number and type of centrifuge machines used to carry out enrichment. In addition, Iran agreed to allow international inspections. In 2018, then US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal and reinstated US sanctions. He wanted a new deal that would also curb Iran's ballistic missile programme and its involvement in regional conflicts. But Iran refused and saw its economy plunged into recession as the sanctions took effect. This video can not be played Iran's nuclear programme: What's been happening at its key nuclear sites? When they were tightened in 2019, Iran began breaching the deal's restrictions. Its stockpile of enriched uranium is now many times larger than permitted; part of it is just below the purity needed for a bomb; and hundreds of advanced centrifuges are spinning. Talks to save the pact began this May, after Joe Biden became president. He says the US will rejoin and lift the sanctions if Iran resumes all its obligations. His Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, says the US must make the first move. Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter?

"Chrissy Archibald was visiting London with her partner Tyler Ferguson when a van hit her One of the first armed police officers at the London Bridge attack has told how the first thing he did was to treat a dying woman at the scene. PC Andrew Duggan said he went into ""medic mode"" and helped Chrissy Archibald, who died after the attackers' van hit her on the bridge. The officer told an inquest he thought it was a road traffic accident. He stayed with Ms Archibald until an ambulance arrived, the court heard. PC Duggan said he only then realised there was a further incident south of the bridge. Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened Friday was the fourth day of an eight-week inquiry into the deaths of the victims of the attack. Ms Archibald's fiance, Tyler Ferguson, earlier told the inquest hefrantically tried to revive her, despite knowing she was dead. The other victims were: James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in London, French trio Xavier Thomas, 45, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Sebastien Belanger, 36, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, from Madrid, and Australians Sara Zelenak, 21, and Kirsty Boden, 28. Gareth Patterson, the barrister representing the families of some of the people stabbed in Borough Market, asked PC Duggan why he did not realise sooner there had been a terrorist attack. Police shot dead the suspects, Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, around 10 minutes after they began the attack. Floral tributes lie at the south end of London Bridge following the attacks on 3 June 2017 PC Duggan said he initially did not hear messages sent over the radio channel, used by armed officers, suggesting the incident was being treated as terrorism. Mr Patterson asked: ""With the benefit of hindsight, as possibly the first, or certainly a very early armed officer on the scene, would it have been better to have proceeded and investigated and potentially stopped this marauding terrorist attack?"" PC Duggan said: ""With the benefit of hindsight, no. My colleague and I did the best we could."" The barrister then asked: ""Do you think an opportunity might have been missed that night to stop this stabbing attack earlier than it possibly was?"" PC Duggan replied: ""No, I believe we deployed and did the best we could with the information at the time."" He added that it seemed ""like all hell [was] breaking loose"" on London Bridge. After helping the injured people on the bridge, he said he became aware there was another incident in Borough Market. As he rushed to the scene, he could hear gunshots ""echoing off the walls"", he told the court. BBC News reporter Alice Evans PC Andrew Duggan spent almost an hour and a half in the witness box in what, at times, felt like a very heated exchange with Gareth Patterson QC. PC Duggan said he left his main gun locked in his armed response car and headed onto the bridge in ''medic mode'', thinking there had been a car crash. He helped to perform CPR on Ms Archibald until paramedics arrived - before becoming aware he was needed elsewhere. Mr Patterson asked why, despite the Manchester and Westminster Bridge attacks, it had not crossed PC Duggan's mind that the events could have been part of a terrorist attack in which his expertise as a firearms officer might be needed. Secondly, he asked him why he had not heard the request on police radio for armed officers to attend. PC Duggan looked exasperated as he repeatedly told the court the only things he heard on his radio were the initial call - a ""very, very loud shout"" of ""London Bridge"" - the belief there had been a road traffic collision, and the possibility there was more than one casualty. Other information - including that people had been stabbed - had been transmitted on British Transport Police and Met Police radio channels, the court heard. But since PC Duggan had his earpiece radio set to the City Police channel he had not heard these other details, he said. Mr Patterson and the chief coroner, Judge Mark Lucraft QC, also made a point of thanking passers-by and the emergency services who made ""extended efforts"" to save Ms Archibald's life. The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan CCTV footage played to the court earlier on Friday, which was described by counsel to the inquests Jonathan Hough as ""graphic and distressing"", showed the van ploughing into Ms Archibald after mounting the kerb. Her partner heard a ""loud thud"" and then ""Chrissie was no longer next to me"", he said. He could see her arms and legs as she was ""pushed and pushed"" down the road under the van. When she was finally released, she had suffered ""devastating injuries"". He watched as she ""convulsed and released the physical life from her body"", but he attempted to perform CPR anyway, he said. The inquests were told on Wednesdaythat Ms Archibald might still be alive if barriers had been put up following the Westminster Bridge attack, which took place two months earlier. The inquests continue.

"A number of MPs are calling on a drug company to make a ""life-changing"" treatment affordable to UK patients. Citing aBBC Newsnight report, MPs across several parties have written to BioMarin, which markets Kuvan but did not initially discover it. The drug, which helps people who have PKU - a rare inherited disorder - is currently not available to NHS patients, as it costs Â£70,000. BioMarin says the NHS has not accepted its ""very competitive"" offer. People with PKU (phenylketonuria) - which affects between one in 10,000 and one in 14,000 people in England - cannot properly digest the amino acid phenylalanine. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and are broken down by the body to make our own proteins. But in people with PKU the levels build up, and can cause brain damage. Kuvan reduces the levels of phenylalanine in many people who have PKU. 'I helped test a wonder drug - then I was denied it' PKU and Kuvan - the campaign for an affordable drug The MPs, who include Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and shadow chancellor John McDonnell, say that BioMarin did not even discover the drug itself but licensed it from a laboratory in Switzerland. It was then researched, using public money, as a treatment for PKU. ""It seems likely that development costs associated with licensing this treatment have been recouped,"" the MPs said in their letter, adding: ""It is matter of public record that BioMarin has generated substantial revenues from Kuvan."" Louise Moorhouse, 35, knows at first-hand the difference Kuvan can make. In her early 20s she took part in trials while it was being developed by the US biotech company. ""Kuvan allowed me to eat a completely normal diet. It was almost like someone had opened curtains on my life and I could see everything in Technicolor,""she told Newsnight. ""It just freed me up so much."" After the trial, Louise was denied further access to Kuvan, but since Newsnight's investigation, BioMarin has said all ex-trial patients will be treated. This video can not be played PKU and Kuvan - the campaign for an affordable drug However, in their letter, MPs say: ""BioMarin currently has no competition for pharmacological treatments for PKU. This monopoly position carries a particular obligation to have regard to your responsibility to patients. ""BioMarin needs to prioritise making this treatment available at an appropriate price across the UK as soon as possible."" The letter, signed by 17 MPs so far and originated from the office of MP Liz Twist, comes amid growing concern about the prices of drugs for rare illnesses across Europe. Under a European incentive scheme to encourage companies to produce treatments for so-called orphan diseases, companies are granted up to 12 years market exclusivity. This is currently under review. The Dutch government, for example, is looking at issuing compulsory licenses if a company does not make a drug affordable. This means another company will be allowed to make the drug at a cheaper price, even when it doesn't hold the patent. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Under current cost-effectiveness criteria, [the] NHS expects discount in the range of 80%, making it very difficult to reach a mutually acceptable agreement,"" the company said in a statement.

"London Capital & Finance marketing promised high returns Thousands of small-scale investors who lost their savings by investing with London Capital & Finance (LCF) have been given fresh hope they may qualify for compensation. Nearly 12,000 peopleput Â£236m into the firm which collapsed in January. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme said it would ""explore whether there are grounds for compensation"" The compensation body had earlier said investors wouldn't be able to lodge claims as the scheme was unregulated. The FSCS was set up by the government to protect consumers if UK regulated firms went bust. But its chief executive told the BBC in March that it was unlikely LCF customers would get compensation, explaining that the company was not regulated for the purposes of selling its products, which it marketed as low risk investments. However the FSCS has now said it is looking at whether any of the conversations LCF had with investors counted as providing financial advice or whether it conducted other activities which could trigger compensation. The FSCS said LCF investors shouldregister with the FSCS via its website,externalfor updates of its investigation. ""By registering with us they will get regular updates on our investigation and this will be the best way for them to hear whether we believe there are grounds for compensation. ""This is a highly intricate case though, so we expect our investigation may take some time,"" it said. LCF advertised itself as a low-risk ISA, and promised to spread funds from the sale of mini-bonds between hundreds of companies. In reality, the fund did not qualify as an ISA, and the money was only invested in 12 companies - 10 of which were described as ""not independent"" from LCF, in a report by the fund's administrators. The Serious Fraud Office is conducting a probe into individuals associated with LCF.

"Khilan Chandaria and Usheila Patel were taken ill on 25 April - two days into their honeymoon A man whose new wife died on their honeymoon has been banned from leaving Sri Lanka. Khilan Chandaria, 33, and Usheila Patel, 31, from Finchley, north London, fell ill on 25 April, two days into their trip. Both were taken to hospital but Mrs Patel then died. Mr Chandaria has not been arrested but cannot leave Sri Lanka until an investigation into the death has concluded. The Foreign Office confirmed it was working with Mr Chandaria. The couple had been due to continue their honeymoon in the Maldives The couple married in Brent, north London, on 19 April - Good Friday - which was three years to the day after they met. Their visit to Sri Lanka was supposed to be the first part of a honeymoon that would eventually take them to the Maldives. They became ill while staying at a hotel in the coastal city of Galle. Mr Chandaira, who says he also suffered days of vomiting and fever, said he did not know what caused the sudden deterioration in their condition. ""I still speak to her every night,"" he said. ""I don't want to leave without her. ""I feel like the whole world is against me. It's been hard to do anything. ""I don't think the grieving process has really started yet."" While he had initially been free to leave Sri Lanka, he refused to leave until his wife's body has been released. He has now been banned from leaving until a government report into the death can be prepared. ""It just didn't feel right leaving her here,"" Mr Chandaira said.

"""Crumbs!"" is what Timea Ganji might have said when she noticed the loaf had gone ""a-rye"" A confused ""crust-omer"" opened a loaf of bread only to find the bag was full of crusts. Timea Ganji was hoping to make sandwiches for her children's lunch when she made the unlikely discovery. ""It's not funny first thing in the morning, when you have half an hour to get the kids to school and there's no time to get another loaf,"" she said. Kingsmill said it was investigating how it happened and had posted Mrs Ganji a ""more conventional loaf"". ""It just looked like a normal loaf when we bought it,"" said the 41-year-old, from Radcliffe-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire. ""Because of the yellow packaging, you can't see it properly. You can see it's sliced, but you couldn't see it is all just crusts. ""Then, in the morning, I just wanted some toast and to make sandwiches and I was just staring at it. I don't really understand how it can happen."" Kingsmill said it was investigating how the loaf had left the factory like this The mum-of-two posted photos of the find on Facebook and friends shared ways to use the crusts and old sayings about the benefits of eating them. ""Maybe I'd like curly hair but I don't want a hairy chest,"" she added. ""I don't mind eating them. I love baguettes with butter on them, or an end of sourdough or tiger bread, but these ends are not as tasty. ""You can't make sandwiches with them and the kids won't eat them."" Restaurant owner Mrs Ganji said she had considered adding the bread to a meatloaf or making breadcrumbs. Kingsmill said its bakeries were enclosed and ""would not allow for a loaf consisting solely of crusts to pass through their strict quality control processes"". A spokeswoman said the firm was investigating ""to find out how this particular collection of crusts found its way into Mrs Ganji's shopping"". What can you do with leftover bread? Some ideas fromToo Good To Go,externalandNewsround: Freeze any unused bread before it goes stale and heat it up later Perk up stale bread by sprinkling it with water and heating it in the oven for about 10 minutes Plan ahead and make sure you don't buy more bread than you need Turn it into croutons to put in your soups and salads Make breadcrumbs and use as a topping for macaroni cheese or fish pie Make French toast, bread and butter pudding or Panzanella - an Italian salad.

"This video can not be played Simon Armitage: ""Poetry should respond to climate change"" Poet Simon Armitage, whose ""witty and profound"" work spans sharp observations about modern life and classical myths, is to be the UK's next Poet Laureate. The West Yorkshire writer will hold the historic post for the next decade, taking over from Dame Carol Ann Duffy. Over recent decades, the role has moved away from mainly chronicling royal occasions to promoting poetry and capturing a wider view of British life. Armitage has published 28 collections and is on the national curriculum. His 2017 book The Unaccompaniedwas described by The Guardian,externalas a document of ""a world in social and economic meltdown"". It opens with a poem about climate change called The Last Snowman, and includes another titled Poundland, about ""the Disney design calendar and diary set, three cans of Vimto/cornucopia of potato-based snacks and balm for a sweet tooth"". Carol Ann Duffy began her 10-year stint in 2009 The announcement comes five months after Armitage, from Marsden, won the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry 2018, arguably the most prestigious accolade in poetry behind the laureateship. When that award was announced,Dame Carol Ann noted,externalhow he had ""touched the matter of our lives with characters and subject matter that lived among us: teachers and council tenants, chip shops and television shows, figures who drank in the local pub and shopped in the nearby supermarket"". He has also translated medieval poems about King Arthur and Sir Gawain, retold The Odyssey as a radio play and written Last Days of Troy, a stage play for Shakespeare's Globe and the Manchester Royal Exchange. The 55-year-old is currently professor of poetry at the University of Leeds and served as professor of poetry at the University of Oxford between 2015-2019. He was made a CBE in 2010. His tenure as Poet Laureate will run for a decade. Armitage told BBC News that poetry was ""more valuable and more relevant than it's ever been"". He said: ""I want to celebrate what's best in poetry and build on the work Andrew Motion and Carol Ann Duffy have done over the last two decades in terms of encouraging and identifying talent, particularly among young people, among whom poetry might be a way forward, an outlet."" The poet laureate is an honorary position that is officially appointed by the Queen, acting on advice from the government. He joked that he had ""missed the boat"" to write a poem for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's baby. ""It's been made very clear to me that although the monarch is my line manager, for want of a better word, there are no expectations or obligations in that direction."" He said he planned to use the profile to establish some sort of project or award for writing about climate change, and that he had a dream - ""very possibly completely unrealistic"" - to set up a National Centre for Poetry. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright praised Armitage for his ""witty and profound take on modern life [which] is known and respected across the world"". Mr Wright added: ""He is a very worthy successor to Dame Carol Ann Duffy, who championed the importance of poetry over the past 10 years and made the position relatable to people across the country."" I write in praise of air. I was six or five when a conjurer opened my knotted fist and I held in my palm the whole of the sky. I've carried it with me ever since. Let air be a major god, its being and touch, its breast-milk always tilted to the lips. Both dragonfly and Boeing dangle in its see-through nothingness... Among the jumbled bric-a-brac I keep a padlocked treasure-chest of empty space, and on days when thoughts are fuddled with smog or civilization crosses the street with a white handkerchief over its mouth and cars blow kisses to our lips from theirs I turn the key, throw back the lid, breathe deep. My first word, everyone's first word, was air. By Simon Armitage. Published by Faber & Faber There had been reports that Imtiaz Dharker would be offered the post There had beenreports that Imtiaz Dharker,externalwould be offered the post, buthad decided to turn it down,external. Armitage said he believed there had been ""a lot of discussion behind the scenes"" about whether the job should go to a white man. He stressed that he wanted part of his role to be about amplifying the voices of writers from ""diverse and disadvantaged"" backgrounds. He added that he did not come from the establishment. ""When I grew up in a terraced house on the side of a hill in West Yorkshire, I did not feel like the chosen one,"" he said. ""When I was working as a probation officer in Greater Manchester, dragging junkies out of the gutter and sitting across the table from notorious criminals, it did not feel like a life of privilege. ""I suppose what I'm saying is, I understand to a lesser extent what it means to come from outside the establishment, even if I've arrived at certain established positions, and I need to keep those things in the back of my mind."" The role was established in 1668, and previous Poets Laureate include William Wordsworth, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, John Betjeman and Ted Hughes.

Mr Trump said talks between Washington and Beijing will continue even after a deadline passed on Friday for them to reach an agreement. As a result the US raised tariffs to 25% from 10% on goods from China. China says it ""deeply regrets"" the US action and would have to take ""necessary counter-measures"". However Beijing also confirmed on Friday that further negotiations would take place following two days of what were described as ""honest"" and ""constructive"" talks. The latest US move raises tariffs on $200bn (Â£153.7bn) worth of Chinese imports. On top of the tariffs implemented on Friday, Mr Trump said a process had begun to place the full 25% tariff on a further $325bn of Chinese goods.

Deborah Elms, executive director at the Asian Trade Centre, said: ""It's going to be a big shock to the economy. ""Those are all US companies who are suddenly facing a 25% increase in cost, and then you have to remember that the Chinese are going to retaliate.""

"An election official empties a ballot box at the count in Durban South Africa's African National Congress (ANC) has been returned to office after winning parliamentary election, but with a reduced majority. The ANC secured 58% of the vote, ahead of the Democratic Alliance (DA) on 21%. The radical Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), came third with 11%. A struggling economy and corruption have eroded the ANC's popularity. ANC leader, President Cyril Ramaphosa, called on the people to build a united South Africa. Five things we've learnt Can Ramaphosa call time on corruption? How South Africa has changed since apartheid - in charts In his victory speech, he said the result showed that South Africans still had faith in the ANC - in power since 1994 - to deliver. ""Let us now work together, black and white, men and women, young and old, to build a South Africa that truly belongs to all who live in it as proclaimed by our forebears,"" Mr Ramaphosa told supporters in Pretoria. He called for a South Africa ""which is united, which is non-racial, which is non-sexist, democratic and prosperous"". The BBC's Will Ross says the ANC may not be too disheartened by the reduced majority. He says that although its support has dropped, this was not a disastrous performance and some might even be tempted to call it a fairly successful exercise in damage limitation considering the ANC's corruption scandals and the slow progress in tackling poverty. Turnout was about 65% in the twin parliamentary and provincial elections - a drop compared to the 73% registered five years ago. It was the first time the ANC's share of the vote has fallen below the 60% mark and it will now have 19 fewer seats in the 400-member parliament. This has been a critical election for the man promising to defeat corruption and boost a stagnant economy. Cyril Ramaphosa will now argue that he has a mandate to create a cabinet capable of reducing unemployment that runs at 27% - more than half of it among the young.  That means sidelining allies of his scandal-plagued predecessor Jacob Zuma. They will however remain entrenched in the structures of the ANC, unless prosecutions or the reports of public inquiries into corruption force them to quit. Perceptions of honest government are critical if Mr Ramaphosa is to attract the investment South Africa needs. This is Africa's largest economy and tackling its inability to provide jobs for the young is the great challenge ahead. In a country where the youth have traditionally led rebellions - in 1976 and again in the mid-1980s against apartheid - the most striking statistic in this election is the fall-off in voting by young people. More than six million did not register to take part - roughly half of those in the 18-30 age bracket who were entitled to vote. Disenchantment over corruption and the failure to provide jobs is deep. It is a trend of alienation that Mr Ramaphosa will need to stem if the long-term health of democracy here is to be guaranteed. Young people queuing to vote spoke of their difficulties in finding jobs. One young voter said her future employment prospects were on her mind. ""I don't feel confident about getting the job I want,"" she said. ""I'm a member of the ANC, but I didn't vote for them this time,"" construction worker Thabo Makhene told Reuters news agency. ""They need to catch a wake-up. The way they run the state, mishandling state funds, they've lost their morals."" This video can not be played 'I am not voting - I'm very upset' However, many voters stayed loyal to the ANC, which led the fight against apartheid. Esau Zwane, 90, waiting to vote in Soweto, Johannesburg, lived under white-minority rule. He told the BBC he was celebrating ""that our country is now ruled by black people"".

"Following her mother's death, Hayley Kemp was left at a children's home by her father, who had told her they were going to the dentist. She was seven. Hayley, now 55, went on to have a chaotic childhood - at one point sharing a room with a sex worker after being placed with her by the council. She was also sent to a young offenders institution despite not having committed any crime. However, she remembers her time in the children's home in Plymouth as the happiest period of her childhood - and she explains how her early experiences would later help to give her life meaning. Hayley Kemp pictured with her siblings before she was sent to a residential care home My mum got lung cancer when I was five. One of my memories is of her with a beehive haircut and smoking a Woodbine cigarette. I was the youngest girl of seven children and after she died we managed for a while with my father as a single parent. Then Dad got involved with a woman called Peggy who became our stepmum and she came to live with us and her two daughters. But she was really cruel. I wasn't allowed in the same room as her. I wasn't allowed to talk to her and she used to beat us and starve us. That was quite obvious because when we used to go to school, neighbours used to be outside and brush our hair and give us biscuits, so we must have looked quite emaciated. I don't know if it was because I was the doll of the family, but she took an instant dislike to me. She said I had to go, so my dad took me to a children's home. He said we were going to the dentist on the bus, and I had no idea where we were because I was only seven. I was skipping down the road thinking 'these are really nice houses and there's a park nearby'. It was Parklands Children's Home but I didn't know that then. I just thought 'this is a nice dentist'. These two women came out and he went in with them and I was told to sit on a chair. And then Dad came out and said 'wait there while I go to the bathroom'. Then the two women came out and got me and that was it. I was living there. He just left. There was no cuddle or anything. I just think my dad was quite a weak man, really, because he would give up his children for somebody who obviously had serious mental health issues. The gateposts are all that remains of Parklands In a sense I was completely displaced. I had nothing with me, but they went to this big cupboard and picked out these clothes for me. For me, I'd gone to somewhere lovely. It was like I was on holiday. All the staff were 'aunties' and 'uncles' and there was so much food and so much fun and lots of other kids. Honestly, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. What I loved was that every Saturday morning they took us out, to the zoo, to the cinema. And on Sundays we went to Sunday school and came back and had a roast. You hear that children's homes are awful places - I always want to say there is another side to that story. You don't hear about the people who had a nice time there, but it was a real refuge and sanctuary for me. I was safe. Hayley, right, ran away as a teenager I was in Parklands for seven or eight months, then they brought some foster parents to see me who had a daughter and I eventually went to live with them. I found it really difficult to go from lots of children and a really busy house to just having a room by myself, so I found it really difficult and felt quite isolated and lonely. I live in a house share now and I don't think it's coincidental. I like house shares, I like people around. In my teenage years I started running away a lot. I would go and stay with my sister and brother who were now married and had their own families. I spent the odd night in children's homes, but they didn't have space for me so I'd be one night here and one night there. Then they took me to a borstal (a young offenders institution) in Bristol even though I'd never been arrested and I'd never been to court or charged with anything. It was in the days of the short, sharp shock treatment, so it was really tough. It was a cell where we slept. I was there for a couple of weeks until social services came to get me. I think someone must have kicked off that I was in a borstal. Hayley in the house she shared with sex workers in Emma Place, Plymouth They put me in a bed and breakfast where I had to share a bed with a woman I'd never met before. I really liked her. She was only 19 but to me, at 15, she seemed really grown up. She was a sex worker. She used to call herself Judy Teen after the Steve Harley song. She used to say 'I'm going out to work now Hayley' and meet me after work and she would take me to bars. But she would never encourage me to do sex work or anything. It all kind of went wrong because there was a guy there who threatened me and the police turned up. Social services realised they shouldn't have put me there, with these older men who were trying to get us drunk, so they moved me to Emma Place. It was a thriving red-light district then and every time I went out - I was 15 then with long blonde hair - I used to get people coming up all the time. I got to know all the sex workers. I was lucky because I was a babysitter for them. But when I look at someone who's on drugs or a sex worker I wonder how didn't I end up like that. Moorhaven on Dartmoor, the institution where Hayley was taken after having a breakdown I have one daughter who is 37 now. When she was aged five I had a nervous breakdown and they think it was because she had reached the age at which things started to go wrong in my life. I ended up in an institution [Moorhaven on Dartmoor] for a couple of months. When I was in my 30s I had heard from someone that my father wanted to see us all, so I decided to go and see him. I spoke to him and we met and had a drink together and I just decided I had nothing in common with him and I didn't like him as a person, and I had no respect for him. I had managed so long without him I didn't really feel like he would be a positive influence in my life so I just decided not to see him again. Hayley now works with Iraqi and Palestinian refugees The Death and Life of Jacob Cockle The grieving mum helping underprivileged students 'Ads don't show how traumatic cancer is' I was working in the private sector as a quality assurance manager and when I was 40 I thought 'I just don't want to do this - this is not what I want to be doing.' I always call it my mid-life crisis. I gave it all up and went to work voluntarily with refugees. When I was in foster care we had Uganda-Asian refugees living in a centre nearby. We collected blankets and jumpers and clothes for the families and I remember thinking they were the most courageous people I had ever seen. They had escaped all this horror and here they were making this new life. I don't think that ever left me about how courageous they were. And I think it's because I just have this empathy with people who have been displaced. They don't know when they're going to see their family, they don't know where they're going to end up. Building shelters at the Calais refugee camp I do a lot of work with asylum seekers and refugees and in refugee camps in Iraq. When people grow up in a stable home and they have got this unconditional love, they learn all those things that people take for granted. So they grow up and they watch their mother cooking, or they learn about budgeting, or they see them sewing or ironing. I didn't have a clue how to do any of that. But the childhood I had has given me an empathy with people that I think I wouldn't necessarily otherwise have. I get to work with the most amazing people and they let me into their lives, and that is a massive privilege. It also gives you a resilience and strength that you can't learn because no matter how bad something is, it's not permanent. Things do get better. So I'm very fortunate to have had the childhood that I had, because no-one can teach you that. You have to really feel it. It's given me a real sense of courage and resilience and determination and I'm very lucky to have that.

"Chrissy Archibald's partner told an inquest he frantically tried to revive her The fiance of a woman killed in the London Bridge attack has described ""chaos and mayhem"" at the scene, saying it looked like a ""warzone"". Chrissy Archibald, 30, from Canada, was killed by three men who drove into pedestrians before stabbing passers by. Her partner Tyler Ferguson told the Old Bailey inquests into the eight victims' deaths he frantically tried to revive her, despite knowing she had died. He was ""devastated and inconsolable"" after her death, he said. At the time of the attack, the couple had been visiting the UK from the Netherlands, where they lived. An eight-week inquiry into the deaths of the victims of the terror attack is in its fourth day. Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened In a statement read to the court Mr Ferguson said he saw a man screaming as he ran down the road and heard the screeching of tyres as a ""large transit van"" approached from behind. It was ""immediately clear this was a deliberate act"", he said, recalling the wing mirror brushing past his shoulder. He heard a ""loud thud"" and then ""Chrissie was no longer next to me"", he said. He could see her arms and legs as she was ""pushed and pushed"" down the road under the van. When she was finally released, she had suffered ""devastating injuries"", he said. Chrissy Archibald was visiting the city with her partner Tyler Ferguson CCTV footage played to the court, which was described by counsel to the inquests Jonathan Hough QC as ""graphic and distressing"", showed Ms Archibald being struck by the van on the third time it mounted the curb. Mr Ferguson watched as she ""convulsed and released the physical life from her body"", but he attempted to perform CPR anyway, he said. The court heard Ms Archibald's death was almost instantaneous, although paramedics treated her for more than an hour. Mr Ferguson tried to find her engagement ring on the road but it was an ""impossible task"", he said. It was recovered later. Prior to the attack, the couple had had an ""intense conversation"" where Ms Archibald told him to make up with his father because he ""could get hit by a bus tomorrow"", Mr Ferguson said. By Alice Evans, BBC News Court One in the Old Bailey was eerily quiet as we were shown countless CCTV angles of Ms Archibald and Mr Ferguson before and during the attack on London Bridge. Det Con Alistair Hutchison calmly guided the court through each frame - everyone knowing what the footage was leading up to. Ms Archibald could be seen chatting animatedly to her fiance as they walked together at about 22:05. Watching this footage in court, our attention was brought to one particular moment just before Ms Archibald was killed. The pair switched sides of the pavement, meaning Mr Ferguson was closer to the balustrade and Ms Archibald was closer to the road. When the van careered on to the pavement, Ms Archibald was hit and pulled under the front of the chassis. Her dress was ripped off as she was dragged across the road. Christine Delcros, who we have already heard recount being hit by the van with her fiance Xavier Thomas, was visibly distressed by this part of the footage. She held her head in her hands, her eyes fixed to the footage onscreen. A man on a double-decker bus near Ms Archibald's body attempted to film the aftermath of the attack, the vehicle's driver Anton Sobanski told the inquest. Someone told him to stop the recording, he added. Mr Sobansk, who broke down in court when he was asked to describe Ms Archibald's condition, also said he ""always felt London Bridge was vulnerable to an attack"". ""I was shocked there were no barriers on London Bridge. I thought this was weird, no barriers. I always felt that maybe a vehicle could be used to kill 100, 200, people,"" he said. The inquests were told on Wednesday Ms Archibald might still be aliveif barriers had been put up following the Westminster Bridge attack, which took place two months earlier. The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan The others who were killed in the attack were James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in London, French trio Xavier Thomas, 45, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Sebastien Belanger, 36, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, from Madrid, and Australians Sara Zelenak, 21, and Kirsty Boden, 28. The attackers were shot dead by police, who arrived at the scene of the attack within eight minutes. A pre-inquest hearing at the Old Bailey in February 2018 was told all three men had steroids in their systems when they died. The inquests continue.

"Chrissy Archibald was visiting London with her partner Tyler Ferguson when a van hit her One of the first armed police officers at the London Bridge attack has told how the first thing he did was to treat a dying woman at the scene. PC Andrew Duggan said he went into ""medic mode"" and helped Chrissy Archibald, who died after the attackers' van hit her on the bridge. The officer told an inquest he thought it was a road traffic accident. He stayed with Ms Archibald until an ambulance arrived, the court heard. PC Duggan said he only then realised there was a further incident south of the bridge. Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened Friday was the fourth day of an eight-week inquiry into the deaths of the victims of the attack. Ms Archibald's fiance, Tyler Ferguson, earlier told the inquest hefrantically tried to revive her, despite knowing she was dead. The other victims were: James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in London, French trio Xavier Thomas, 45, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Sebastien Belanger, 36, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, from Madrid, and Australians Sara Zelenak, 21, and Kirsty Boden, 28. Gareth Patterson, the barrister representing the families of some of the people stabbed in Borough Market, asked PC Duggan why he did not realise sooner there had been a terrorist attack. Police shot dead the suspects, Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, around 10 minutes after they began the attack. Floral tributes lie at the south end of London Bridge following the attacks on 3 June 2017 PC Duggan said he initially did not hear messages sent over the radio channel, used by armed officers, suggesting the incident was being treated as terrorism. Mr Patterson asked: ""With the benefit of hindsight, as possibly the first, or certainly a very early armed officer on the scene, would it have been better to have proceeded and investigated and potentially stopped this marauding terrorist attack?"" PC Duggan said: ""With the benefit of hindsight, no. My colleague and I did the best we could."" The barrister then asked: ""Do you think an opportunity might have been missed that night to stop this stabbing attack earlier than it possibly was?"" PC Duggan replied: ""No, I believe we deployed and did the best we could with the information at the time."" He added that it seemed ""like all hell [was] breaking loose"" on London Bridge. After helping the injured people on the bridge, he said he became aware there was another incident in Borough Market. As he rushed to the scene, he could hear gunshots ""echoing off the walls"", he told the court. BBC News reporter Alice Evans PC Andrew Duggan spent almost an hour and a half in the witness box in what, at times, felt like a very heated exchange with Gareth Patterson QC. PC Duggan said he left his main gun locked in his armed response car and headed onto the bridge in ''medic mode'', thinking there had been a car crash. He helped to perform CPR on Ms Archibald until paramedics arrived - before becoming aware he was needed elsewhere. Mr Patterson asked why, despite the Manchester and Westminster Bridge attacks, it had not crossed PC Duggan's mind that the events could have been part of a terrorist attack in which his expertise as a firearms officer might be needed. Secondly, he asked him why he had not heard the request on police radio for armed officers to attend. PC Duggan looked exasperated as he repeatedly told the court the only things he heard on his radio were the initial call - a ""very, very loud shout"" of ""London Bridge"" - the belief there had been a road traffic collision, and the possibility there was more than one casualty. Other information - including that people had been stabbed - had been transmitted on British Transport Police and Met Police radio channels, the court heard. But since PC Duggan had his earpiece radio set to the City Police channel he had not heard these other details, he said. Mr Patterson and the chief coroner, Judge Mark Lucraft QC, also made a point of thanking passers-by and the emergency services who made ""extended efforts"" to save Ms Archibald's life. The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan CCTV footage played to the court earlier on Friday, which was described by counsel to the inquests Jonathan Hough as ""graphic and distressing"", showed the van ploughing into Ms Archibald after mounting the kerb. Her partner heard a ""loud thud"" and then ""Chrissie was no longer next to me"", he said. He could see her arms and legs as she was ""pushed and pushed"" down the road under the van. When she was finally released, she had suffered ""devastating injuries"". He watched as she ""convulsed and released the physical life from her body"", but he attempted to perform CPR anyway, he said. The inquests were told on Wednesdaythat Ms Archibald might still be alive if barriers had been put up following the Westminster Bridge attack, which took place two months earlier.

"Charcoal-based toothpastes, which claim to whiten teeth, are a ""marketing gimmick"" which could increase the risk of tooth decay and staining, says a review in the British Dental Journal. The charcoal products, which are increasingly popular, often contain no fluoride to help protect the teeth. And there is no scientific evidence to back up the claims they make, the authors say. Excessive brushing with them can do more harm than good, they add. They advise people to go to their dentist for advice on bleaching, or whitening, their teeth. And they say it is better to stick to using a regular fluoride-based toothpaste. NHS dentist charges rise by 5% in England 'Misleading' toothpaste TV advert banned by watchdog Charcoal was first used for oral hygiene purposes in ancient Greece, as a way of removing stains from teeth and disguising unpleasant odours from diseased gums. Dr Joseph Greenwall-Cohen, co-author of the study from the University of Manchester Dental School, said ""more and more shops are selling charcoal-based toothpastes and powders"", including Superdrug, Boots and Tesco, after celebrities had started talking about using them. But he said the claims they made had been found to be unproven by a 2017 US review of 50 products. Some said they were ""anti-bacterial"" or ""anti-fungal"", that they helped with ""tooth whitening"" and would ""reduce tooth decay"". The review said people were brushing regularly with the charcoal-based products in the hope that they would offer ""a low cost, quick-fix, tooth-whitening option"". But too much brushing could lead to tooth wear and more sensitive teeth and, with few of the products containing fluoride or making the ingredient inactive, any protection from tooth decay was limited, it said. ""When used too often in people with fillings, it can get into them and become difficult to get out,"" Dr Greenwall-Cohen said. ""Charcoal particles can also get caught up in the gums and irritate them."" He said charcoal toothpastes and powders were more abrasive than regular toothpastes, potentially posing a risk to the enamel and gums. The charcoal contained in today's toothpastes is usually a fine powder form of treated charcoal, the review says. Charcoal can be made from materials including nutshells, coconut husks, bamboo and peat, and possibly wood and coal. Prof Damien Walmsley, from the British Dental Association, said: ""Charcoal-based toothpastes offer no silver bullets for anyone seeking a perfect smile, and come with real risks attached. ""So don't believe the hype. Anyone concerned about staining or discoloured teeth that can't be shifted by a change in diet, or improvements to their oral hygiene, should see their dentist.""

"Plans to extend Edinburgh's tram network to include a hospital and university are being proposed as part of an overhaul of the way people will move around the city. The 10-year city centre transformation project would see the tram extend over North Bridge to the BioQuarter and the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. A tram loop could also be built between Haymarket and University of Edinburgh. The council hopes to reduce city centre traffic by up to 30%. The council said it wanted to treat cars as ""guests"" in a ""pedestrian priority zone"". The plans also include setting up a free city centre hopper bus. Prominent parts of the Old Town would be completely closed to traffic, including Victoria Street, Cockburn Street and a longer stretch of the Royal Mile. Waverley Bridge could become a vehicle-free plaza and a ""centrepiece"" bridge could be built for pedestrians and cyclists, connecting the Old Town and the New Town. Car parking would be gradually reduced across the city centre, with George Street, Victoria Street and Cockburn Street losing parking space altogether. There are also plans for remaining parking areas to be subject to a trial of a ""parking free day"" - where existing spaces are used for alternative uses one day per week. The proposals will go out for a public consultation for approval, subject to the thumbs up by the council's transport and environment committee next week. Lesley Macinnes, City of Edinburgh Council's transport and environment convener, said: ""This is a serious approach to how we equip the city for the future and how we meet the emerging challenges from the climate change emergency, population growth, changing expectations of our city centre and air quality. ""This is a clear statement of intent about what we want to achieve in the city centre. This is our strategy for a city centre that is truly fit for purpose."" As part of the blueprint, there are plans to construct four lifts, situated across the city centre, to help people access Edinburgh's two levels with more ease. The lifts will be provided from Market Street to the top of The Mound, Waverley Station to North Bridge, Cowgate to George IV Bridge and  Grassmarket to Edinburgh Castle and will be used by cyclists and those with wheelchairs. Mrs Macinnes said: ""You will come out the back of Waverley Station and take that lift up to North Bridge. ""Instantly, you have got public transport with buses instantly connected with the train. It's about collapsing the city centre to be able to access both levels."" Improvements will be made to make key routes more attractive to pedestrians and cyclists but key bus routes will remain across North Bridge and South Bridge and up and down The Mound. Mrs Macinnes said: ""This is an exciting and ambitious strategy, one which will deliver transformative benefits across the city and for a whole range of people travelling to and within Edinburgh. ""We want everyone to share in Edinburgh's success and re-imagining our city centre and its purpose will help make this happen. ""Here we have a blueprint to move the city forward. The proposals are designed to prompt debate - they aren't finalised designs or ideas. ""They are examples of what we could do to deliver the city centre that residents are telling us they want.""

"Fashion chain Select has fallen into administration, putting 1,800 jobs at risk at its 169 stores across the UK. The firm, which targets women aged 18-45, has been struggling despite having struck a deal in April last year that cut rents at its stores.

"Chrissy Archibald's partner told an inquest he frantically tried to revive her The fiance of a woman killed in the London Bridge attack has described ""chaos and mayhem"" at the scene, saying it looked like a ""warzone"". Chrissy Archibald, 30, from Canada, was killed by three men who drove into pedestrians before stabbing passers by. Her partner Tyler Ferguson told the Old Bailey inquests into the eight victims' deaths he frantically tried to revive her, despite knowing she had died. He was ""devastated and inconsolable"" after her death, he said. At the time of the attack, the couple had been visiting the UK from the Netherlands, where they lived. An eight-week inquiry into the deaths of the victims of the terror attack is in its fourth day. Victims of the London Bridge attack London Bridge attack: What happened In a statement read to the court Mr Ferguson said he saw a man screaming as he ran down the road and heard the screeching of tyres as a ""large transit van"" approached from behind. It was ""immediately clear this was a deliberate act"", he said, recalling the wing mirror brushing past his shoulder. He heard a ""loud thud"" and then ""Chrissie was no longer next to me"", he said. He could see her arms and legs as she was ""pushed and pushed"" down the road under the van. When she was finally released, she had suffered ""devastating injuries"", he said. Chrissy Archibald was visiting the city with her partner Tyler Ferguson CCTV footage played to the court, which was described by counsel to the inquests Jonathan Hough QC as ""graphic and distressing"", showed Ms Archibald being struck by the van on the third time it mounted the curb. Mr Ferguson watched as she ""convulsed and released the physical life from her body"", but he attempted to perform CPR anyway, he said. The court heard Ms Archibald's death was almost instantaneous, although paramedics treated her for more than an hour. Mr Ferguson tried to find her engagement ring on the road but it was an ""impossible task"", he said. It was recovered later. Prior to the attack, the couple had had an ""intense conversation"" where Ms Archibald told him to make up with his father because he ""could get hit by a bus tomorrow"", Mr Ferguson said. By Alice Evans, BBC News Court One in the Old Bailey was eerily quiet as we were shown countless CCTV angles of Ms Archibald and Mr Ferguson before and during the attack on London Bridge. Det Con Alistair Hutchison calmly guided the court through each frame - everyone knowing what the footage was leading up to. Ms Archibald could be seen chatting animatedly to her fiance as they walked together at about 22:05. Watching this footage in court, our attention was brought to one particular moment just before Ms Archibald was killed. The pair switched sides of the pavement, meaning Mr Ferguson was closer to the balustrade and Ms Archibald was closer to the road. When the van careered on to the pavement, Ms Archibald was hit and pulled under the front of the chassis. Her dress was ripped off as she was dragged across the road. Christine Delcros, who we have already heard recount being hit by the van with her fiance Xavier Thomas, was visibly distressed by this part of the footage. She held her head in her hands, her eyes fixed to the footage onscreen. A man on a double-decker bus near Ms Archibald's body attempted to film the aftermath of the attack, the vehicle's driver Anton Sobanski told the inquest. Someone told him to stop the recording, he added. Mr Sobansk, who broke down in court when he was asked to describe Ms Archibald's condition, also said he ""always felt London Bridge was vulnerable to an attack"". ""I was shocked there were no barriers on London Bridge. I thought this was weird, no barriers. I always felt that maybe a vehicle could be used to kill 100, 200, people,"" he said. The inquests were told on Wednesday Ms Archibald might still be aliveif barriers had been put up following the Westminster Bridge attack, which took place two months earlier. The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan The others who were killed in the attack were James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in London, French trio Xavier Thomas, 45, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Sebastien Belanger, 36, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, from Madrid, and Australians Sara Zelenak, 21, and Kirsty Boden, 28. The attackers were shot dead by police, who arrived at the scene of the attack within eight minutes. A pre-inquest hearing at the Old Bailey in February 2018 was told all three men had steroids in their systems when they died. The inquests continue.

"This video can not be played Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He says talks should progress in a ""principled"" manner President Donald Trump says US-China relations remain ""very strong"" despite the two countries being embroiled in a trade war. Mr Trump said talks between Washington and Beijing will continue even after a deadline passed on Friday for them to reach an agreement. As a result the US raised tariffs to 25% from 10% on goods from China. China says it ""deeply regrets"" the US action and would have to take ""necessary counter-measures"". However Beijing also confirmed on Friday that further negotiations would take place following two days of what were described as ""honest"" and ""constructive"" talks. The latest US move raises tariffs on $200bn (Â£153.7bn) worth of Chinese imports. On top of the tariffs implemented on Friday, Mr Trump said a process had begun to place the full 25% tariff on a further $325bn of Chinese goods. What you asked about US-China trade The US-China trade war in charts US-China trade war in 300 words The tariffs taken in would be used to buy US agricultural goods,external, which would then be used for ""humanitarian assistance"", Mr Trump said. The president tweeted that, depending on the outcome of future negotiations, the tariffs ""may or may not"" be removed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump earlier said he was in ""no rush"" to reach a trade agreement following two days of bilateral talks. Only recently, the US and China appeared to be close to ending months of tensions over trade. The next US-China battleground Critics pointed out on Twitter that it is not China who will pay the taxes, but US importers, and ultimately its consumers. China's Commerce Ministry confirmed the latest US tariff increase on its website. ""It is hoped that the US and the Chinese sides will work together... to resolve existing problems through co-operation and consultation,"" it said in a statement. Chinese stock markets rose on Friday, with the Hang Seng index up less than 1% and the Shanghai Composite more than 3% higher. The US-China trade warhas weighed on the global economyover the past year and created uncertainty for businesses and consumers. Even though Mr Trump has downplayed the impact of tariffs on the US economy, the rise is likely to affect some American companies and consumers as firms may pass on some of the cost, analysts said. Deborah Elms, executive director at the Asian Trade Centre, said: ""It's going to be a big shock to the economy. ""Those are all US companies who are suddenly facing a 25% increase in cost, and then you have to remember that the Chinese are going to retaliate."" US and Chinese officials have held several rounds of talks in an attempt to strike a deal French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned that the trade dispute escalation threatened jobs across Europe. ""There is no greater threat to world growth,"" Mr Le Maire told CNews. BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker said the direct impact of the trade dispute would be on the US and China. There could also be wider implications, he added, saying a softening of demand in the US and China could hurt suppliers elsewhere in the world. Mr Trump's tariff increases have taken many businesses in China and America by surprise, fuelling their anxieties about investment and supply chain viability. Chinese exporters say passing on costs to their US customers may be the only way to compensate for dwindling profit margins. ""The US importers will have to absorb it and transfer it on to consumers,"" Herbert Lun, a Chinese haircare electronics maker, told the Financial Times. America's farmers are suffering too. Shipments of soybeans - one of the most valuable US agricultural export crops - to China have slumped. This video can not be played Will a trade deal end US-China rivalry? A combination of higher tariffs and depressed farm commodity prices are putting US farmers under increasing pressure, economists say. Davie Stephens, a west Kentucky farmer and president of the American Soybean Association, told local media that farmers are ""in a desperate situation"". China has been a frequent target of Mr Trump's anger, with the US president criticising trade imbalances between the two countries and Chinese intellectual property rules, which he says hobble US companies. Some in China see the trade war as part of an attempt by the US to curb its rise, with Western governmentsincreasingly nervousabout China's growing influence in the world. Both sides have already imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. Last year the US imposed a 10% tariff on$200bn worth of Chinese products,external- including fish, handbags, clothing and footwear.

"The trade war between the US and China - which seemed to be nearing an end - has suddenly escalated with the threat of new tariffs. US President Donald Trump vowed to more than double tariffs on $200bn (Â£153bn) of Chinese goods on Friday and to introduce fresh ones ""shortly"". Despite this, the Chinese are starting two days of negotiations with the US. The US president's threat to raise tariffs comes amid claims Beijing is trying to row back on a trade deal. The world's two largest economies have already imposed duties on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. A further escalation in the trade dispute would create renewed uncertainty for businesses and consumers, hurting the world economy. Trump threatens to hike China tariffs The next US-China battleground US-China trade war in 300 words Here are some of the central issues in the US-China trade dispute: The US, which accuses China of unfair trading practices, launched a trade war against China last year. Not only does the US accuse China of stealing intellectual property, but it wants Beijing to make changes to its economic policies, which it says unfairly favour domestic companies through subsidies. The US also wants China to buy more US goods to rein in itslofty $419bn (Â£321.2bn) trade deficitwith China. The trade deficit is the difference between how much the US imports from other countries and how much it exports. Reducing the gap is a key part of Mr Trump's trade policies. TheUS imposed tariffs on $250bnworth of Chinese products last year. Beijing has retaliated with duties on $110bn worth of American products. Tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods were due to rise to 25% from 10% at the start of this year, but this hike was delayed. Now, Mr Trump is saying this increase will go ahead on Friday because talks with Beijing are progressing ""too slowly"". On top of that, he hasvowed to slap 25% duties on another $325bn of Chinese goods""shortly"". The Chinese products hit by US tariffs since the beginning of the trade war have been wide-ranging, frommachinery,externaltomotorcycles,external. In the latest round, the US imposed 10% duties on $200bn worth ofChinese products,externalincluding fish, handbags, clothing and footwear. Those products will be the ones targeted with a tariff hike from 10% to 25%, if it goes ahead this week. China accuses the US of starting the biggest trade war in economic history. It has targeted US goods ranging from chemicals, to vegetables and whiskey. It has also strategically targeted products made in Republican districts, and goods that can be purchased elsewhere,like soybeans. The US-China trade war has been a great source of uncertainty for financial markets over the past year. That uncertainty has weighed on investor confidence around the world, and has contributed to losses. In 2018, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell more than 13% and the Shanghai Composite slumped nearly 25%. Both indices have recovered some ground this year and are up 12% and 16% respectively so far in 2019. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 6% in 2018 and is already up some 11% this year. The yuan fell over 5% against the US dollar last year, before broadly stabilising in 2019, according to Reuters. The US-China trade war has had a knock-on effect on other countries, and the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the escalation of US-China trade tension was one factor to have contributed to a ""significantly weakened global expansion"" late last year as it cut its 2019 global growth forecast. Some countries may also be indirectly impacted - especially those that are important trading partners for the US or China - or play key roles in their supply chains. The battle with China is one of a series of trade fights the US has waged with other countries over the past year. Mr Trump has imposed taxes on imports from Mexico, Canada and the European Union, to encourage consumers to buy American products. All of these countries retaliated with tariffs on US goods.

"The two presidents preside over markedly different national economic models A US-China trade deal - if it happens - is unlikely to end the rivalry between the two economic giants. Both sides have fought a trade war over the past year with damaging consequences for the global economy. But many say their dispute goes well beyond trade - it represents a power-struggle between two very different world views. Deal or no deal, that rivalry is only expected to broaden and become more difficult to resolve. ""We have entered into a new normal in which US-China geopolitical competition has intensified and become more explicit,"" says Michael Hirson, Asia director at consultancy firm Eurasia Group. ""The trade deal will moderate one phase of the US-China power struggle, but only temporarily and with limited effect."" Grappling with China's growing power US-China trade war in 300 words Huawei: The world's most controversial company The US-China rivalry is likely to play out next in the crucial technology sector, analysts say, as both sides try to establish themselves as the world's technology leader. Issues around technology transfer have been key during trade talks between the world's two largest economies in recent months. ""Every country now correctly recognises that their prosperity, their wealth, their economic security, their military security is going to be linked to keeping a technological edge,"" says Stephen Olson, research fellow at global trade advisory body Hinrich Foundation. Many say the US-China technology battle is already under way - and China's tech giant Huawei is at its very centre. Huawei has been the focus of intense international scrutiny lately, with the US and other countries raising security concerns about its products. The US has restricted federal agencies from using Huawei products and hasencouraged allies to shun them. AustraliaandNew Zealandhave both blocked the use of Huawei gear in next-generation 5G mobile networks. The US government has accused Huawei of being a spying risk, something it strongly denies But Huawei has said it is independent from the Chinese government. Its founder Ren Zhengfeitold the BBCin February that his company would never undertake any spying activities. The dispute reached fever pitch withthe arrest of the founder's daughterin December, and more recentlyHuawei's lawsuitagainst the US government. Huawei has also gone on a public relations offensive, placing afull-page ad in the Wall Street Journaltelling Americans not to ""believe everything you hear"". ""The term 'cold war' is overused in the context of overall US-China tensions, but is increasingly accurate in describing their technology competition,"" says Mr Hirson. The dispute over Huawei is ""symptomatic of this intensified geopolitical competition,"" he adds. ""This rivalry is far more difficult to resolve than pure trade issues."" US concerns about China have grown in recent years, along with China's influence around the world. Its massive,externaltheMade in China 2025plans, and the growing importance of companies like Huawei and Alibaba have all contributed to those fears. US Vice President Mike Pence summed up the moodin a speech,externalin October, saying China had chosen ""economic aggression"", rather than ""greater partnership"" as it opened its economy. Hopes China would embrace a more Western model has given way to a recognition that China's economy has boomed alongside a state-run system, not in spite of it. ""China has become much more explicit in its ambitions in the last few years,"" says Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China, at consultancy Control Risks. ""Therefore nobody is imagining that China is going to follow a Western liberal democratic model, or converge towards a market economy in the way that people hoped a few years ago."" China's exports have boomed over the past two decades Some analysts think a stand-off between the two sides was inevitable. Their different systems have always made them awkward bedfellows in the global economy, while clashes between existing and rising powers are common in history. ""What we are dealing with here is friction between traditional free market economics, free trade economics, Washington consensus principles versus - for the first time - a huge, technologically sophisticated, centrally-managed economy that is playing the game by a different set of rules,"" says Mr Olson. As the technology race gathers pace, analysts expect the US to continue to use non-tariff measures to push back against China. Restrictions on Chinese investment into the US, limits on the ability of US firms to export technology to China, and further pressure on Chinese companies are all tools that could be used, they say. ""Non-tariff measures don't get the attention from markets that tariffs do, partly because their impact is harder to quantify, but they can have far-reaching impact,"" says Mr Hirson. More from theBBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:,external Will AI kill developing world growth? Why India is one of world's most protectionist countries Uruguay: The worldâs marijuana pioneer Soft Brexit: What are the options? Anew US law passed last yearcould facilitate this push-back. It strengthened the government's power to review - and potentially block - business deals involving foreign firms by expanding the type of deals that can be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS). The committee vets foreign investments to see if they pose a risk to national security. Last year, even before the new law passed, ahigh-profile dealinvolving the sale of US-based money transfer firm MoneyGram to Alibaba's digital payments arm Ant Financial collapsed when the companies did not get the required approval from CFIUS. How US-China relations develop from here will partly depend on the kind of trade deal they strike. Burdened by tit-for-tat tariffs, both sides have shown a willingness to talk sinceagreeing on a trucein December. President Trump has been talked tough against China over the trade issue But analysts say the relationship between the two giants could look different going forward irrespective of any trade deal. They could have ""an entirely cooperative, flourishing, mutually beneficial relationship"" in certain areas but put up barriers in others in what Mr Olson described as a ""selective decoupling"". An increasing number of areas could be fenced off, particularly those related to technology, he says. ""Is Huawei ever going to, in a significant way, be able to participate in the construction of the 5G network in the United States?  It seems unlikely.""

"It is the job of The Royal Mint to literally make money - and yet in 2017, it did not produce a single 20p or Â£2 coin for general circulation. Mintage figures show that, in 2016, it made 213 million 20p pieces, but the following year it produced none. Millions of Â£2 coins were cut in 2016; the next year - nothing. The riddle is partially answered by the introduction of the 12-sided Â£1 coin. UK consumers emptied jam jars full of saved coins before shops stopped accepting the old round pounds. As a result, they also flooded shops and banks with all their other coins. It meant, for a year at least, there were plenty of 20p and Â£2 coins to go around and no more were needed. The Royal Mint, the cash handling industry, banks and the Post Office regularly review the amount of coins circulating in the system. The Post Office, for example, is a heavy user of coins, and demand tends to increase across the country in the run-up to Christmas. The Mint, a company wholly owned by the Treasury, also makes forecasts for the year ahead on how many of each denomination will be needed. The current backdrop sees a shift among many consumers from cash to contactless card and digital payments. This video can not be played The BBC's Kevin Peachey takes a tour of the Royal Mint Any surpluses of coins are re-circulated first, before new ones made at the Mint in Llantrisant, south Wales, are put into circulation. The 12-sided Â£1 coin entered circulation for the first time in March 2017. For six months, both the old round pound and the new coin were accepted, until the old design lost its legal tender status in October of that year. As a result, there was a high-profile campaign urging people to bank, spend or donate their old Â£1 coins. The old, round Â£1 coin was withdrawn from circulation in 2017 The nation emptied savings jars, checked piggy banks and looked down the back of the sofa for all their loose change that had been lost or hoarded. As a result, there was a glut of coins as people banked or spent all denominations, not just the outgoing Â£1 coin. The Mint had expected it, given evidence from similar cases overseas. It was the main issue that meant enough 20p and Â£2 coins could be re-circulated and that none needed to be minted that year. ""The quantities of UK coins the Royal Mint is asked to produce each year varies according to UK demand for specific denominations at the time. UK coins have an impressive lifespan, so they don't need replacing as often as other forms of currency,"" a Royal Mint spokeswoman said. ""This, together with the ongoing decline in the number of cash transactions in the UK each year, means that the UK Banks and Post Office may not request every denomination every year if there is already sufficient coin in circulation."" Official figures for 2018 have yet to be published. Not quite. Although there were none of these coins minted for general circulation, some commemorative coins were made. However, look through your loose change and you would be unlikely to find a 2017-dated 20p or Â£2 coin. This video can not be played A brief history of decimal coins This is not the first time that the minting of certain denominations of coins has not been required. Few 20p coins were minted in 2012, 5p and 10p pieces were not cut at times in the 1970s and 1980s, as was the case for the old, larger 50p for a while in the 1990s, and the round pounds at times during the same decade. The average coin has a 25 to 30-year lifespan. A week ago, theUK Treasury confirmedthat it would keep all the current denominations of coins. A consultation on the current mix had theoretically threatened the future of 1p and 2p coins, but the Treasury said they would be used ""for years to come"". Your eight uses for 1p and 2p coins Who do you trust after cash? New Â£2 coin released to remember D-Day New Â£1 coin to be rolled out overseas Anindependent review of cashpublished in March suggested that banknotes and coins were a necessity for eight million people. A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""We have no plans to change the current make-up of coins and notes used in the UK - and that includes the Â£2 and 20p pieces.

"Scotland Yard said early investigations suggested that a ""blank firing handgun"" had been discharged A gun was fired outside a mosque in east London during Ramadan prayers. Police were called to reports of a ""masked"" man with a firearm entering the Seven Kings Masjid in Ilford at 22:45 BST on Thursday. Worshippers ushered him out of the building and a gunshot - thought to have come from a ""blank-firing handgun"" - was then heard. No injuries or damage were caused, the Met said, and it did not believe it was terrorism-related. Scotland Yard said it believed it stemmed from an earlier incident in a street close to the mosque off High Road. Worshipper Ibraheem Hussain, 19, described hearing the gunshot about half an hour after prayers began. ""We were upstairs in the classrooms and about 30 minutes into the night prayer a large noise went off"", he said. ""It sounded like a firework or maybe something heavy had been dropped, so no-one really thought anything of it. ""But then someone said it was a gunshot and that someone had come into the mosque and he had a firearm on him. ""The managers had seen him. He was masked and acting suspicious."" Police were called to High Road in Ilford, east London ""At this early stage, ballistic evidence recovered from the scene suggests that the weapon was a blank-firing handgun"", the Met said. ""Officers will continue to work closely with representatives from the mosque and are providing reassurance to the local community."" There have been no arrests. In astatement shared by a Muslim Council spokesman,externalon Twitter, the mosque's imam Mufti Suhail said the suspect's motives had not been established. He asked that people ""avoid speculating and circulating unconfirmed information"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""relieved nobody was injured in the incident"". Allow Twitter content?

The Home Office has said its plans would allow the UK to attract talented workers and deliver on the Brexit vote. But Carolyn Fairbairn told BBC Scotland she believed skilled workers would have to be recruited at lower pay levels. Scotland has a particular problem with an ageing workforce, she said. Ms Fairbairn said: ""The trouble with the current immigration plan the government has put forward is it doesn't work for the whole country, and it certainly doesn't work for Scotland."" In 20 years' time, the CBI expects only one third of the Scottish population to be of working age, causing ""profound implications for Scotland, its tax base and public services"". ""We need the flexibility that allows Scotland to have the people it needs to grow,"" Ms Fairbairn said. ""Scotland has a particularly unusual problem in terms of a falling working age population. ""For many people wanting to come and work in Scotland the salaries are well below that, so we are looking for change and we are looking for a new immigration model that works for the whole country."" The Scottish median salary is less than Â£24,000. Ms Fairbairn, who met First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Thursday ahead of the employers organisation's annual lunch in Edinburgh, has been working with the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) on plans  to tackle automation and the future of work. The two organisations have written to the Scottish government with proposals that they hope could increase ""both the number and quality of jobs"". ""If we get this right, automation and digitisation can be as important an economic leap forward as the industrial revolution,"" Ms Fairbairn said. ""We can build a society in Scotland that cherishes the fundamentally human skills, such as communication, empathy, innovation, and leadership."" The CBI has also called for politicians to set a clear timetable for resolving the ""paralysing"" Brexit deadlock. ""Three years on, the landing zone for a workable deal still feels worrying small, "" she said. ""And let me be crystal clear. Scottish firms, and firms across the UK, want a deal.""

"Uber has been valued at $82bn (Â£63bn) ahead of its share listing in what is expected to be one of the biggest stock market flotations this year. The ride-hailing app is asking investors to pay $45 a share, at the lower end of the price range expected. Uber's conservative price is an attempt to avoid the fate of rival Lyft whose shares fell by up to a third after its recent listing, said analysts. Uber is yet to make a profit and warned recently it may never do so. Since its foundation in 2009, the company has lost about $9bn. Daniel Ives, an analyst at investment company Wedbush Securities, said the lower-than-expected valuation was Uber's attempt to deflect scrutiny of its financial performance. ""They know that they are going to have a target on their back in terms of, not just investors, but regulators as well as drivers, so they need to tread carefully here in terms of how they price it. ""Their success is not going to be determined over the coming days or weeks or months, it's really over the coming years. But the last thing they want is for stock to drop through the IPO price like Lyft has,"" he said. What do drivers think of Uber? Is Uber really worth billions of dollars? Are internet unicorns really worth billions? Uber had originally suggested a price range of between $44-$50 for its share price listing, valuing the company at up to $120bn. Investors are betting on Uber's growth prospects as it diversifies into several other sectors. As well as the original ""ride-hailing"" business, Uber is developing driverless cars, and has a food delivery operation, Uber Eats. Union organiser Lydia Hughes joined Uber drivers in their strike in London on Wednesday Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has emphasised that the firm's future is not as a ride-hailing company, but as a wide technology platform shaping logistics and transportation. But Brian Hamilton, a tech entrepreneur and founder of data firm Sageworks, said its losses were hard to overlook. ""Uber is basically Lyft 2.0. Good model, growing sales. But, yet again, here comes California math once more. It is still losing a ton of money,"" he said. The firm's revenue last year surged 42% to $11.3bn, but its adjusted loss - following a tax benefit - still hit $1.8bn. In the first three months of the year, it was a similar story with the firm reporting a loss of around $1bn. The firm's flotation comesdays after drivers in the US and UK went on strikeover pay and working conditions. Unions are urging Uber to cut the rate of commission it takes, to increase the average fare rate and for better job security. What do drivers think of Uber? Is Uber really worth billions of dollars?

"A replacement for how Britain's emergency services communicate is set to go over budget by at least Â£3.1bn,a spending watchdog has warned,external. The Home Office has already delayed switching off the existing system by three years to 2022. But the National Audit Office (NAO) has raised doubts about whether the project will be ready by then. Ministers say the new service would result in faster response times and better treatment. The Emergency Services Network (ESN) would replace Airwave, a digital radio network introduced in 2000 and used by all 107 police, fire and ambulance services in England, Scotland and Wales. Airwave links control rooms to response teams, as well as to 363 other bodies such as local authorities and train companies. Delay to 999 radio system 'could cost millions' Emergency services 'should share control rooms' The Home Office says ESN will transform what is currently available. Officials believe it would allow users access to high-speed mobile data and save money by sharing an existing commercial 4G network. But the scathing NAO report suggests the Home Office has ""failed"" and that management of the programme has led to delays, increased costs and poor value for taxpayers. Home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the report concludes that key technology is yet to be properly tested, with work not started on upgrading control rooms or providing coverage for police helicopters and air ambulances. One NAO criticism is that work has not yet started on upgrading control rooms The report also reveals that ministers are expected to approve a decision which will mean that the new system would not be ""as resilient to power cuts"" as the existing one. NAO head Sir Amyas Morse said success of the new network was ""critical to the day-to-day operations"" of emergency services. He said the Home Office ""has already been through one costly reset and is in danger of needing another unless it gets its house in order"". A Home Office spokesperson said the ESN was ""on track to deliver an ambitious, world-leading, digital communications network"" by 2022, resulting in savings of Â£200m a year. But the NAO's report said although ESN is expected to be cheaper than Airwave in the long run, savings will not outweigh costs until at least 2029. Criticisms come afterESN was due to be implemented in September 2017, with the transition being complete at the end of this year. But the rollout was delayed and the department announced a ""reset"" of its approach, opting to phase in services - rather than launching the whole programme at once. The watchdog said the reset had addressed some problems but that ""to date, the Home Office's management of this critical programme has represented poor value for money.""

"This video can not be played Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He says talks should progress in a ""principled"" manner President Donald Trump says US-China relations remain ""very strong"" despite the two countries being embroiled in a trade war. Mr Trump said talks between Washington and Beijing will continue even after a deadline passed on Friday for them to reach an agreement. As a result the US raised tariffs to 25% from 10% on goods from China. China says it ""deeply regrets"" the US action and would have to take ""necessary counter-measures"". However Beijing also confirmed on Friday that further negotiations would take place following two days of what were described as ""honest"" and ""constructive"" talks. The latest US move raises tariffs on $200bn (Â£153.7bn) worth of Chinese imports. On top of the tariffs implemented on Friday, Mr Trump said a process had begun to place the full 25% tariff on a further $325bn of Chinese goods. What you asked about US-China trade The US-China trade war in charts US-China trade war in 300 words The tariffs taken in would be used to buy US agricultural goods,external, which would then be used for ""humanitarian assistance"", Mr Trump said. The president tweeted that, depending on the outcome of future negotiations, the tariffs ""may or may not"" be removed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump earlier said he was in ""no rush"" to reach a trade agreement following two days of bilateral talks. Only recently, the US and China appeared to be close to ending months of tensions over trade. The next US-China battleground Critics pointed out on Twitter that it is not China who will pay the taxes, but US importers, and ultimately its consumers. China's Commerce Ministry confirmed the latest US tariff increase on its website. ""It is hoped that the US and the Chinese sides will work together... to resolve existing problems through co-operation and consultation,"" it said in a statement. Chinese stock markets rose on Friday, with the Hang Seng index up less than 1% and the Shanghai Composite more than 3% higher. The US-China trade warhas weighed on the global economyover the past year and created uncertainty for businesses and consumers. Even though Mr Trump has downplayed the impact of tariffs on the US economy, the rise is likely to affect some American companies and consumers as firms may pass on some of the cost, analysts said. Deborah Elms, executive director at the Asian Trade Centre, said: ""It's going to be a big shock to the economy. ""Those are all US companies who are suddenly facing a 25% increase in cost, and then you have to remember that the Chinese are going to retaliate."" US and Chinese officials have held several rounds of talks in an attempt to strike a deal French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned that the trade dispute escalation threatened jobs across Europe. ""There is no greater threat to world growth,"" Mr Le Maire told CNews. BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker said the direct impact of the trade dispute would be on the US and China. There could also be wider implications, he added, saying a softening of demand in the US and China could hurt suppliers elsewhere in the world. Mr Trump's tariff increases have taken many businesses in China and America by surprise, fuelling their anxieties about investment and supply chain viability. Chinese exporters say passing on costs to their US customers may be the only way to compensate for dwindling profit margins. ""The US importers will have to absorb it and transfer it on to consumers,"" Herbert Lun, a Chinese haircare electronics maker, told the Financial Times. America's farmers are suffering too. Shipments of soybeans - one of the most valuable US agricultural export crops - to China have slumped. This video can not be played Will a trade deal end US-China rivalry? A combination of higher tariffs and depressed farm commodity prices are putting US farmers under increasing pressure, economists say. Davie Stephens, a west Kentucky farmer and president of the American Soybean Association, told local media that farmers are ""in a desperate situation"". China has been a frequent target of Mr Trump's anger, with the US president criticising trade imbalances between the two countries and Chinese intellectual property rules, which he says hobble US companies. Some in China see the trade war as part of an attempt by the US to curb its rise, with Western governmentsincreasingly nervousabout China's growing influence in the world. Both sides have already imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. Last year the US imposed a 10% tariff on$200bn worth of Chinese products,external- including fish, handbags, clothing and footwear.

"Delays in introducing a new radio system for emergency services in England, Wales and Scotland may cost taxpayers Â£475m a year, MPs have said. The Public Accounts Committee said the new Emergency Services Network system could require more testing beyond its scheduled start date of December 2019. Contracts for the old network may have to be extended, costing hundreds of millions of pounds, it said. Ministers said the technology would be the ""most advanced of its kind"". Currently the 105 police, fire and ambulance services in England, Scotland and Wales communicate using the radio network Airwave - contracts for which expire in two years. But the Public Accounts Committee said the system due as the replacement, ESN, was ""not yet proven"" and probably would not be ready on time. The MPs said the Home Office had not budgeted for such a lengthy delay and that it must put detailed contingency plans in place. It has also called on ministers to address what it says are ""real security concerns"" about how well ESN will work on underground systems in London, Glasgow and elsewhere. Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: ""It is critical for public safety and achieving value for money that the government has a firm grasp of the implications of delays in its timetable and a costed plan to tackle them. ""We will expect it to demonstrate real progress in this area when it reports back to us later this year."" A Home Office spokesman said ESN was the most advanced communications system of its kind and would deliver ""significant savings for the taxpayer"". He added: ""The timescales are ambitious because we want to get the most from technology that will help save lives, but we are clear that no risks will be taken with public safety and the existing Airwave system will continue until transition on to ESN is completed."" 999 crews 'should share control rooms' Emergency services in telecoms fail Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Police, fire and ambulance services in England should share control rooms to improve their response to 999 calls, a Home Office minister has said. Mike Penning said it did not ""make sense"" to have different premises. It comes asnew plans are published,externalto get the services working more closely. There are also proposals for police and crime commissioners (PCCs) to oversee fire brigades, which could include choosing an officer in charge of hiring and firing fire and police staff. This top officer post would be open to senior officers from both the police and fire service. They would hold the rank of chief constable - and to allow this the government would remove the current rule that holders of the rank must have served as a constable. PCCs would get responsibility for fire services ""where a local case is made"", the Home Office said. In most parts of England, police, fire and ambulance services have separate control centres and when someone rings 999, they have to tell an operator which service they need. Emergency services in some areas - including Northamptonshire and Hampshire - are already working on joint schemes, but the Home Office wants more and is introducing a ""statutory duty"" on the three services to collaborate. In Northamptonshire, police, fire and ambulance services are sharing ""training, premises and a joint operations"", the Home Office said. In Hampshire, senior police officers now operate out of the Hampshire Fire and Rescue HQ. Mr Penning, minister for policing and fire, said: ""It simply doesn't make sense for emergency services to have different premises, different back offices and different IT systems when their work is so closely related and they often share the same boundaries."" He said he would also like PCCs to take responsibility for their local ambulance service, but at this stage the Home Office is only planning to extend PCC powers to fire brigades. The plan for PCCs to oversee fire serviceswas called ""dangerous"" by the Fire Brigades Union (FBU)when it was suggested last year. It said the move would be a ""costly experiment with no guarantee for success"". Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ""Officers from both emergency services already do pull together, working alongside week in, week out, as has been evidenced most recently by the appalling floods. ""So why the burning need to change the law? It's like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut."" Paul Hancock, Cheshire's Chief Fire Officer and president of the Chief Fire Officers Association, said combining control rooms was ""absolutely a good thing"". He said there were ""fantastic examples"" of emergency services working together across the country, and he welcomed PCCs taking control of fire services when there was a ""local case"". But he said there were ""some concerns"" within the fire service about losing its ""unique brand and reputation"" due to being associated with the police. The government's plan also includes abolishing the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and giving its responsibilities to the Greater London Authority.
