"Julie Pomagalski, France's former world champion snowboarder, has been killed in an avalanche in Switzerland, the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF) has announced. Pomagalski, 40, was swept away while skiing off-piste in a group of four in the canton of Uri, officials said. Another French freeride snowboarder was also killed in the avalanche. Pomagalski was a teenager when she became world champion in snowboard cross in 1999. She took the World Cup title for the discipline in 2004 and registered nine wins on the World Cup circuit. In 2002 she competed in the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics and four years later in the Turin Games. ""Julie's tragic disappearance has left the French Olympic team in mourning for one of their own,"" CNOSF said in a post on Twitter. Police said the avalanche struck on Tuesday as the group was descending from the Gemsstock mountain. The 2,961m (10,000ft) summit is popular with off-piste skiers because of its steep slopes and powder snow. ""For reasons still unknown a sheet of snow broke away"", sweeping three of the skiers away, officials said. Pomagalski and the other skier who was killed - named by the French ski federation as Bruno Putelli, a mountain rescuer from Albertville - ""were completely buried"". The third person suffered minor injuries.

"Six big UK investment firms say they will not buy Deliveroo shares after concerns over workers' rights. The delivery company hopes to be valued at up to Â£8.8bn when it lists its shares in April. But Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, CCLA, LGIM and M&G said they were put off by factors including the working conditions of its riders and lack of investor power. Deliveroo said it had seen ""significant demand"" for stock with interest rising. ""We lookÂ forward to welcoming new shareholders next week alongside our currently highly respected existing investors,"" it added. Deliveroo riders are self-employed, meaning they are not entitled to earn a minimum wage from the company, or holiday and sick pay. Rupert Krefting, head of corporate finance and stewardship at M&G, said the company's reliance on gig-economy workers made it a risk for investors. He pointed out that Uber had recently had greater legal rights enforced by the Supreme Court for drivers previously categorised as self-employed. ""Deliveroo's narrow profit margins could be at risk if it is required to change its rider benefits to catch up with peers,"" Mr Krefting added. Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) said it was put off by an ""unequal voting rights"" structure. Deliveroo is planning to let its founder and chief executive Will Shu have more than 50% of shareholder voting rights. ""It is important to protect minority and end-investors against potential poor management behaviour, that could lead to value destruction and avoidable investor loss,"" LGIM said. Phil Webster, a portfolio manager at BMO, said labour issues represented a ""ticking bomb on the side"" for Deliveroo, which contributed to making it ""uninvestable"". Andrew Millington, head of UK Equities at Aberdeen Standard, told the BBC's Today programme that the conditions were a ""red flag"", adding: ""We wouldn't be comfortable that the way in which its workforce is employed is sustainable."" He compared Aberdeen Standard's recent decision to sell off Boohoo shares, following allegations of worker exploitation at suppliers to the online clothing company. Large institutional investors such as Aberdeen Standard can use their financial muscle to try to influence the way firms are run - such as through relationships with managers and shareholder votes. But Mr Millington said that sometimes ""disinvesting or not investing in the first place is our only option"". He added that it would be interesting to see whether Deliveroo can attract investors over the longer term ""without making progress"" on worker rights. One of the biggest-ever floats on the London market of a home-grown technology company should have meant a feeding frenzy among the City's institutional investors, the companies that have the job of putting trillions of pounds of retail and pension investors money to work. For years they have watched with envy as their US counterparts have put cash into a steady stream of technology companies. Not all have been big hits after listing their shares on public markets, but enough of them have been - think Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla and a string of others - to have made it a big source of investment returns. Deliveroo's listing, which could value the company at just short of Â£9bn, should have been a rare similar opportunity on the London market. Instead some big players, including Aviva Investors and Aberdeen Standard, are turning their backs, saying the way the company employs its riders is not socially acceptable, and poses a risk to its future. Deliveroo deems its riders to be self-employed, and points out that the High Court has upheld that view. What is more, Deliveroo says its riders value the flexibility that employment status gives them, although it is worth noting that Uber maintained the same thing until it eventually decided its drivers were in fact workers, not self-employed contractors. There is no danger to Deliveroo's float - there are enough investors around who are happy to buy the shares. The buying strike by large investors could have ramifications well beyond one company, however. Does this mean that all gig economy companies are off limits? Does it signal that all companies on the London market will now have to ensure their worldwide organisations meet the best employment standards? Andrew Millington of Aberdeen Standard told the Today programme that would be the battle to come - that his firm would hold on to a company's shares as long as it was moving in the right directions, and paid proper attention to employment standards. That is a subtle warning to boardrooms that they will in future be judged by the way their treat their most junior staff. David Cumming, chief investment officer at Aviva, said investors were taking social responsibilities ""a lot more seriously"". ""A lot of employers could make a massive difference to workers' lives if they guaranteed working hours or a living wage, and how companies behave is becoming more important."" Deliveroo targets valuation of up to Â£8.8bn Deliveroo boss: 'I was never into start-ups' A report by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism,external(BIJ) - based on thousands of invoices from 300 Deliveroo riders - claims that one in three is earning less than the National Living Wage, which is currently Â£8.72 an hour. However, Deliveroo said the sample of 300 people was ""not a meaningful or representative proportion"" of their riders and that they can earn up to Â£13 an hour ""at our busiest times"". ""These findings [by the BIJ] raise concerns,"" said Tom Powdrill, head of stewardship at shareholder lobby group Pirc. ""Investors considering taking a position in Deliveroo should familiarise themselves with these matters and the risks and responsibilities involved along with all other relevant factors."" Mr Cumming also warned of the risk that drivers will have to be reclassified as workers, which would entitle them to rights such as sick and holiday pay. ""It's an investment risk if the legislation changes,"" said Mr Cumming. Uber recently reclassified its drivers as workers after a landmark UK supreme court case last month. Deliveroo's chief executive, Will Shu, founded the business in 2013 Since losing a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status, Uber has offered holiday pay, a guaranteed minimum wage, and pensions benefits to its drivers. Other gig economy companies have been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February, although it does not directly apply to Uber Eats - the food delivery arm of the business. Deliveroo has set aside more than Â£112m to cover potential legal costs relating to the employment status of its delivery riders. It warned potential investors of the risk of litigation around the world in documents setting out its plans for a stock market debut published on Monday. ""The European Commission is set to draw up new legislation governing how the gig economy model works across the bloc,"" pointed out Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""If Deliveroo is forced to change the way it classifies its riders in the future, it is likely to puncture its profits prospects, and could even derail the delivery giant."" Deliveroo, which was founded in 2013, has said it will hand its riders bonuses of between Â£200 and Â£10,000 when it floats, depending on the number of orders they have delivered.

"The country's largest vaccine maker has already delayed deliveries to Brazil and the UK India has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, foreign ministry sources have told the BBC. They said rising cases meant domestic demand was expected to pick up in the coming weeks, and so the doses were needed for India's own rollout. The move - described as a ""temporary squeeze"" by officials - is expected to affect supplies until the end of April. Some 190 countries under the Covax scheme are likely to be affected. The scheme, which is led by the World Health Organization (WHO), aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations. India's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India (SII), has delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to several countries in recent days, including the UK and Brazil. India has exported more than 60 million vaccine doses to 76 countries so far, with the majority of these being the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. The decision comes as India faces a surge in coronavirus cases. On Wednesday it recorded its sharpest daily rise this year, with more than 47,000 new cases and 275 deaths. It is opening up vaccinations for those over the age of 45 from 1 April, and officials expect demand for vaccinations to increase. India's Covid-19 case spike 'alarming' Can India's vaccine producers meet demand? How will vaccines be shared around the world? ""[The export hold] is a temporary measure. Domestic demand will have to take precedence,"" one foreign ministry source told the BBC's Soutik Biswas. They said there was likely to be a squeeze on vaccine supplies until April, but the situation could ease come May when at least one additional vaccine is expected to be given emergency approval. This video can not be played Watch: The Indian factory making 6,000 syringes a minute There have been no exports from India since Thursday, according to the foreign ministry's website. ""Everything else has taken a backseat, for the time being at least,"" one source at the ministry told Reuters news agency. ""No exports, nothing [until] the India situation stabilises."" There has been no official comment from the government or the SII on the decision. The SII - the world's largest vaccine manufacturer - has already delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to the UK, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Morocco. Last week,the BBC reported that a delivery of five million doses had been held up by four weeks. ""We will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India,"" an SII spokesperson said at the time. The SII has said it will produce one billion doses this year for low- and middle-income countries. And in January, it said it could turn out between 60 and 70 million vaccine doses a month. This figure included the AstraZeneca vaccine as well as the US-developed Novavax jab, which is not yet licensed for use in India. That month, the SII also told the BBC that it was aiming to boost its monthly production to 100 million doses from March. However, a recent check revealed production was still at 60 to 70 million doses and had not increased. The Indian government began its vaccination programme on 16 January, and so far has inoculated over 47 million people amid fears of a possible second wave. The authorities are hoping to administer 600 million doses within seven months - about 85 million doses a month.

"Pat Gelsinger plans to make Intel a major supplier to third-party chip designers Intel's new chief executive has told the BBC it is not ""palatable"" that so many computer chips are made in Asia. The majority of processors are currently manufactured in the region, with Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung the dominant players. US-based Intel plans to set up a new division to make chips for other companies based on their own designs. Until now, its focus had been on manufacturing its own chips in its factories across the world. Pat Gelsinger has said Intel will invest $20bn (Â£14.6bn) in two new fabrication plants in the US state of Arizona, in addition to a major expansion of an existing Irish facility in County Kildare. ""Having 80% of all supply in Asia simply isn't a palatable manner for the world to have its view of the most critical technology,"" Mr Gelsinger said. ""Every smartphone, every telemedicine, every remote worker, every remote education, every autonomous vehicle, every aspect of humanity is becoming more digital. ""And when it becomes digital, it runs on semiconductors. ""This is the heart of every aspect of human existence going forward. And the world needs a more balanced supply chain to accomplish that. We're stepping in."" Intel says the expansion of its facility in Leixlip, County Kildare, will create 1,600 permanent jobs He added that Intel also intended to build a further chip-making foundry in a different European nation, but would not be drawn about exactly where. While these moves will be too late to tackle an existing shortage of chips which is causing problems for car-makers and others, they could help the West avert a future crisis. Politicians in the US and the EU have called for more chip-producing factories to be built locally. This is partly driven by concerns that Beijing aims to reunify mainland China with Taiwan, while North Korea poses a threat to its southern neighbour. However, Intel has repeatedly missed manufacturing targets over recent years. As a consequence, its latest desktop processors use older transistor technology than rival silicon from AMD and Apple, putting the components at a disadvantage. Mr Gelsinger must now prove his company has put these problems behind it if the new business is to thrive. The 60-year-old only returned to Intel last month after his predecessor was ousted over concerns about falling market share, among other problems. Chip manufacturing requires dust-free environments so the transistors and circuits are not damaged But earlier in his career, Mr Gelsinger spent three decades at Intel, including a role as its first chief technical officer. One activist investor had pressed him to go ""fab-less"", and spin off Intel's plants to concentrate on chip designs. But Mr Gelsinger has instead chosen what looks like a tougher challenge in order to restore the company to its past glories. And that includes letting clients order chips that mix together their own technologies with some of Intel's own architectures for an extra fee. ""We're putting it all on the table,"" he said. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity: This video can not be played WATCH: Pat Gelsinger says he hopes Apple will be among third parties to get Intel to make their chips Let's start with the new Intel Foundry Services business. It sounds like you're going all out to make chips for other companies who lack the facilities to do so themselves. But why help the competition? Manufacturing is a capacity game. And if you're not leading in terms of total capacity, you will fall behind. So to some degree it's a necessity. If we're going to be in the manufacturing business, we have to be a foundry for ourselves and for others. Simply put, the world needs more semiconductors. We're in an environment where digitisation was at a strong pace of growth. And then Covid kicked us into a dramatically different gear. The world needs more semiconductors, and we're one of the few companies that have leading-edge technologies to be able to step into that void. And to keep it for our own products simply is not the right thing for the planet, for the industry, and for a globally distributed supply chain. How disruptive do you think it will be, coming in to take business away from Samsung and TSMC? Overall I think everybody is groaning to catch up to the overwhelming demand. And we're going to use Samsung and TSMC for some of our products. So this is about ""co-op-petition"". We expect to have strong partnerships with them as customers, and in some cases we'll compete a little bit. But overall, this is a rapidly growing $100bn market segment that simply needs more supply. It also needs more geographically balanced supply. Today there's a heavy bias to Asia. And as we've seen, coming out of some of the disruptions and challenges, the world needs US and European supply in a more balanced way. It's the right thing for the global supply chain requirements, for both commercial as well as for government and defence use as well. You also have a large chip plant in Dalian, China. Are there any plans to build new ones in China? At this point, we have no expansion plans for what we have there. The announcement yesterday was for two new fabs in Arizona. I already have construction projects going on in Oregon, Ireland and in Israel. And we announced that we expect to open our next sites, in both Europe and the US, within the next year. So at this point, four major sites under construction, and I hope to add two more within the next year. When you say you want to build more in Europe, is that going to just be more in Ireland or Israel? Or are you looking at other countries, the UK perhaps? I fully expect that we'll open up a site in another country in Europe. Could that be the UK? I'm not going to speculate any further right now. But just to put this in context: these are extraordinary capital investments. They're also extraordinary job generators. You've said you hope Apple might be one of your clients, despite its decision to stop using Intel's own chips. Is that realistic? Everybody wants multiple suppliers. So we think there's very real potential. But I have to earn that business. I have to be able to go to my competitors and be able to say: ""I want you to become my customer."" That also includes Nvidia, Qualcomm and Broadcom, in addition to Microsoft and IBM. I want all of them to say: ""I need more technology... and I trust that Intel is going to become one of my key suppliers."" And that includes Apple as one of the biggest users of advanced semiconductor capabilities. Intel is running a series of ads in which Mac computers come off worse against PCs powered by Intel chips Apple can be a little thin-skinned at times. So is it wise to be running a high-profile ad campaign mocking its computers at the same time as saying we'd like to be your partner again? We have great respect for Apple as a company. They're an innovator. They've done incredible things in the industry. Tim Cook is a great leader. At the same time, we're going to be aggressive competitors and we're out to reinvigorate the PC ecosystem. So we're going to enjoy ourselves. We're going to compete aggressively. And I'm also going to take care of my customers. Regarding your own chips, you say you've now mastered your seven nanometre process, which roughly equates to what TSMC and Samsung market as 5nm. But we've heard promises from Intel before, and then things have slipped. What's different this time? We've understood the core issues. What really happened was problems with our 10nm effort caused a domino delay to 7nm. There's an advanced manufacturing technique called extreme ultraviolet lithography. It was immature, and we bet against it. As we shifted in time, it became more mature. Now we've embraced it fully. It's the same thing that TSMC is doing, and leveraging it aggressively. TSMC is currently the world's leading supplier of computer chips So we feel that we're now in a very predictable pace. I have confidence that we're back on track. But not just for 7nm. Our programmes that go for several nodes beyond that are showing very good success. We've also announced a research partnership with IBM. So, we have a rich portfolio of tricks and ideas and innovations to choose from to put us on a course for the long-term leadership of Intel. When you say leadership, just to be clear, do you think you could overtake TSMC and Samsung in chip-making capabilities? Intel led the semiconductor industry for 20-plus years in innovation. We hit a pothole. We're now digging our way out of that pothole. And I'm looking forward to decades of continued leadership in this area. Parity. Parity-plus. And then sustained leadership. That's the path that we're on. Intel chief wants to make chips for Apple again.

"All UK government buildings in England, Wales and Scotland will fly the union flag every day, following new guidance from the culture department. Currently flags are only required to be flown on certain days such as the Queen's birthday. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden described the flag as ""a proud reminder of our history and the ties that bind us"". Government buildings in Northern Ireland are covered by a separate law. The guidance released by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport department says the union flag should be flown every day - except on those occasions where another flag is being flown. The guidance will only apply from the summer. The announcement comes after BBC Breakfast host Charlie Stayt received criticism for joking during a TV interview about the size of the union flag behind Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick. This video can not be played Could you draw the Union Jack? The union flag first appeared in 1606, after James VI of Scotland ascended to the throne in England in 1603 to become James I. The flag combined the two flags of England and Scotland's patron saints -  the red cross of Saint George and the white cross of Saint Andrew. The red cross of Saint Patrick was later added. Back in 2007, Labour MP Ian Lucas unsuccessfully campaigned for the Welsh dragon to be added to the flag. In 2008, then-Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown scrapped a rule that said the union flag could only be flown on certain days. He said it should be left to individual public offices to decide if and when to fly flag. Other countries such as Australia and New Zealand - who are members of the Commonwealth -  feature the union flag on their own flag. Announcing the new guidance, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""The union flag unites us as a nation and people rightly expect it to be flown above UK government buildings - this guidance will ensure that happens every day."" Ministers are also urging all local councils to fly the flag, and buildings will also be able to fly the NHS flag without seeking planning permission. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Conservative MP Sir John Hayes welcomed the move saying: ""I think we just don't fly our flag enough - if you go to capitals of other countries, around the heart of those capitals, particularly government buildings, you routinely see the flag of that country flying. ""So it does seem to me something that unifies the country, that brings us together, that allows us to share in our national pride - what's wrong with that? And after this year, bringing the country together around the flag couldn't be more apposite."" However the SNP's Mhairi Black said: ""If the Tories think an overload of union jacks on buildings is the answer to promote the strength of the union, then it shows how thin the case for the union is. In 2013, protests were triggered by the removal of the Union flag from the Belfast City Hall ""Flags won't undo the poverty and hardship the Tories have created over the last decade,"" she said. Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said: ""The Tories know that independence for Scotland is inevitable and that Wales will be hot on their heels. ""Sticking flags on every street corner will not change that fact, and rather, only reveals their desperate insecurity about the future of the UK"", she said. Flag-flying is a contentious issue in Northern Ireland and in 2015 a commission was set up to help find a consensus on flags, emblems and identity. The commission's report was delayed when devolution in Northern Ireland collapsed and although the findings have been submitted they have not yet been published -despite calls fromassembly members in Stormont.

"Tougher measures on hauliers travelling from France to the UK are to be considered to stop Covid variants being imported, Boris Johnson has said. At an MPs' hearing, the prime minister was asked why France had not been added to the UK's travel ""red list"". Mr Johnson said there was a balance needed between protecting public health and keeping trade flowing. His comments come amid concerns about the spread of South African, UK and Brazilian variants in France. The ""red list"", which requires arriving people to pay to quarantine in a hotel, is part of travel regulations aimed at stopping Covid variants entering the country. What is the government doing about the South Africa variant? When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? What are the rules about travelling to the UK? How are European countries tackling the pandemic? Questioning the PM at the Liaison Committee, Labour's Yvette Cooper said every week 20,000 people - such as lorry drivers - were coming to the UK from France - and two-thirds of them were exempt from restrictions. She said France had up to 3,000 cases of the South African and Brazilian variants and questioned why it was not on the ""red list"" of countries from which travel is effectively banned. She acknowledged the need for trade would mean quarantine was not appropriate for hauliers but questioned why they were not being tested for coronavirus. Boris Johnson said there was a balance to achieve Mr Johnson said putting France on the ""red list"" was ""something that we will have to look at"". When pushed on whether hauliers should be tested, Mr Johnson said the decision required weighing up the efficacy of current vaccines on the variants of concern and the disruption that would cause to goods being brought across to the UK. He pointed out that 75% of the UK's medicines and 50% of its food comes through short straits (Dover-Calais, ferry and tunnel). ""We will take a decision, no matter how tough, to interrupt those flows, if we think it is necessary to protect public health. It may be that we have to do that very soon,"" he told the committee. On Tuesday, health minister Lord Bethell said the UK's nearest neighbours could join other nations on the country's ""red list"". There was a ""possibility"" that every European country could face a ban, he added, but that would be done ""with huge regret"". In December, France closed its border to arrivals from the UK including hauliers. The two-day closure led to queues of thousands of lorries trying to cross the channel, which was eased after France agreed to allow hauliers to cross once they had a negative Covid test result.

"Tracey Davies says dealing with abuse every day is exhausting A supermarket worker has received abuse ""every day"" for the past year from customers over social distancing requests. Tracey Davies, who works in Neath Port Talbot, said it was ""non-acceptable"" to have to face abuse just for going to work. An Usdaw union representative, she said members at stores across the area had reported similar experiences. On Monday,supermarkets were allowed to resume selling non-essential goods. The re-opening of aisles and reductions in clothing prices saw queues around the stores in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot, Ms Davies told Radio Wales. She said the situation was ""manic"", with people buying in bulk and the extra customer numbers making social distancing difficult. Non-essential aisles reopened on Monday People had to be asked to maintain a two-metre gap ""all the time,"" she said. ""That is the worrying part. We continue to get abuse just simply by asking the question, can you please maintain a safe social distance?"" ""Some people come back and say mind your own business. Some people swear. It was getting to be just the norm. ""It's non-acceptable. You shouldn't have to go to work to be abused."" 'Loads of shoppers breaking rules' in supermarkets Supermarket staff 'having to referee' Covid rules Supermarket workers facing coronavirus 'abuse' Asked how often it happened she replied: ""Every day. From checkout to shop floor staff to a filler - everything. For the last year. ""It is exhausting. It just makes you think why am I bothering? I had a lady yesterday tell me she's had the two vaccines so she's totally covered and nothing is going to happen to her. ""A lot of customers have got the same sort of outlook. I don't think people read and listen to the media as much as each other."" One Usdaw member had contacted her on Monday in tears because she had been reported to head office after asking a customer to maintain social distancing. Ms Davies added: ""She [the customer] was less than a foot from the customer in front.""

"NHS staff in Scotland are to be offered a pay rise of at least 4%, the Scottish government has confirmed. Nurses, paramedics and domestic staff are among those who could receive the boost to their salaries. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the average pay of a front-line NHS nurse would rise by over Â£1,200 a year. She said the offer - which does not apply to doctors - recognised the ""service and dedication"" of staff during the pandemic The settlement will be backdated to 1 December 2020 in recognition of an ""exceptional year of significant pressure"". It follows theÂ£500 thank you paymentfor all health and social care workers which was announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in November. Earlier this month Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended plans to give some NHS staff in England a1% pay rise. He praised ""heroic"" health and social care workers but said the rise was as much as the government could afford during the ""tough times"" of the pandemic. Ms Freeman described the Scottish government's offer as ""the biggest single pay uplift since devolution"" for NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) staff. AfC is the current grading and pay system forÂ NHSÂ staff. It does not include doctors, dentists, executives and senior managers. Across cycles of economic growth and contraction, public sector pay remains stable while private sector pay is more volatile - racing ahead in the good times, taking the bigger hit and redundancies when they turn tough. So when private employer competition for skilled workers is lower, public sector pay increases can be reined in. However, the Scottish government has opted to boost pay, going against that cycle and in contrast with the 1% offered to NHS staff in England. Coming at the end of a three-year 9% pay deal, the cost looks to be about Â£135m next year, and unlike the Â£500 one-off NHS payment last year, it is baked in to future pay rises. NHS staff have political support, so it makes sense ahead of an election. However, with a balanced budget required, a pound spent on pay cannot be spent on others who have been at the Covid battlefront - for instance, care home workers, those in the voluntary sector, welfare benefits for unpaid carers. A further consideration in NHS pay is that demand for scarce skills is on the rise, without easy access to EU labour, with doctor retirement, many GPs working part-time and loss of medical expertise overseas. This is one sign of the measures the NHS has to take to ensure it recruits and retains the staff it needs. She added that it would benefit 154,000 staff and including domestic staff, porters and health care support workers. This group, which she described as ""the backbone of our services"" would see pay rises of more than Â£1,000, the equivalent of between 4% and 5.4%. Those on the highest salaries will receive a Â£800 pay rise. Ms Freeman said: ""This has been an exceptionally challenging year for our health service and I am pleased that the Scottish government is able to recognise the service and dedication of our healthcare staff."" The announcement follows ongoing negotiations between the Scottish government, NHS employers and unions, who will now consult their members on the offer. And the offer is significantly higher than the pay rise proposals for other public sector workers. This is not just a bumper pay offer for many NHS workers in Scotland, it is a powerful negotiating tool for health unions trying to prise more cash from the UK government. It is hard to imagine nurses and other healthcare staff in England settling for a proposed 1% rise when their colleagues in Scotland are receiving 4%. That contrast will presumably not go unnoticed by the independent pay review panel in England which is due to make its recommendations in May. In Scotland, details of the new pay offer were released just hours before the start of the Holyrood election campaign, during which governments are obliged to avoid making big spending announcements. It may lead to a wider debate in the campaign about how other public sector workers are rewarded and the support available to those in the private sector struggling as a result of the Covid crisis. In her budget, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes announced a 3% rise for people earning under Â£25,000, with 1% for people earning up to Â£80,000 a year. She called it a ""progressive and restorative approach"" but unions said it was disappointing after a year of working through the pandemic. Colin Poolman, Royal College of Nursing Scotland senior officer, said: ""The timescale for negotiations was tight as a result of the forthcoming election but we have now received an offer for a one year pay deal."" Willie Duffy, Unison regional organiser, said that each of the individual trade unions would now enter into discussions with their members on the offer. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""There will be a view that it's not enough but we managed through the negotiations to get extra money into the pay envelope."" He also compared the offer to the 1% offered in England by the Westminster government. He said: ""It shows the stark difference between the two governments and their attitude to trying to deal with health service workers."" All of Scotland's main opposition parties have made the NHS a central part of their appeals in the forthcoming Holyrood election. The Scottish Conservatives have promised to deliver an increased share of funding to GPs. Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the NHS pay offer was welcome but it did not consider social care workers, whom she called ""the unsung heroes of the pandemic"". Ms Baillie said Scottish Labour was committed to a wage rise to Â£15 an hour for the social care workforce, with an immediate increase to Â£12 an hour. The Scottish Greens have pledged support for a properly funded publicly-owned NHS Scotland while the Scottish Liberal Democrats are promising a ""decent"" pay rise for NHS staff.

"The Tunbridge Wells store, on the list to stay closed permanently John Lewis has said it will not reopen eight of its stores once lockdown eases, putting 1,465 jobs at risk. The retail giant said some locations could not sustain a large store. Four ""At Home"" shops in Ashford, Tunbridge Wells, Basingstoke, and Chester will close - as well as department stores in Aberdeen, Peterborough, Sheffield and York. John Lewis said the eight shops were ""financially challenged prior to the pandemic"". Earlier this month,the retailer warned it would be making more store closuresafter the impact of the pandemic led it to report a hefty annual loss. The latest move comes on top of the closure of eight stores that John Lewis announced last year. The chain has now axed around a third of its stores in less than a year. James Morrell says it could present an opportunity for small independent stores For almost 40 years the John Lewis store in Peterborough has been the flagship of the city's shopping centre, but along with seven other branches it looks sets to close. Shopper James Morrell says he usually goes to John Lewis to look at the ""tech"" and says it will be a shame to not see it reopen after lockdown. ""This is pretty much all we've got in Peterborough really, it's our main selling point,"" he says. But he says it ""might be nice for little independent shops to come along and take up the space"". Read more here. The company said it planned to create more places to shop for John Lewis products across the UK. It suggested it would not entirely move out of areas where the main store was closing. ""In areas where we propose not to reopen stores, we will look at the right combination of options for that location to ensure we remain convenient for our customers, so they can continue to access John Lewis products and services."" It added it would invest in improving click-and-collect in its Waitrose stores and offer more local collection points through third parties. It also will continue experimenting with John Lewis shopping areas in Waitrose stores, as well as trying out smaller, local neighbourhood shops. John Lewis said 34 stores would start reopening from 12 April, subject to government guidance, with the exception of Glasgow, which will reopen from 26 April, and Edinburgh, which will reopen on 14 May. John Lewis expects 60-70% of its sales to take place online in future The company said it would ""enter into consultation with the 1,465 affected partners"" about the proposals. Should it proceed, it said it would make ""every effort"" to find alternative roles for as many as possible. John Lewis has a unique structure in that its staff are also partners in the business, and receive a share in the profits in good years. It said the stores that were closing were in locations where it did not have enough customers. ""Given the significant shift to online shopping in recent years - and our belief that this trend will not materially reverse - we do not think the performance of these eight stores can be substantially improved."" Andrew Taylor Andrew worked at the John Lewis store in Birmingham for five years before being made redundant last year. He has worked in the retail industry for 20 years. ""I'm not surprised by today's announcement,"" he said. ""While it's true that customer shopping habits have changed, I believe the partnership was in the middle of an identity crisis before the pandemic."" Mr Taylor said the company has ""struggled to adapt and needs to work on diversity and inclusion as a business to reflect modern-day Britain."" Dan Jarvis, the mayor for Sheffield, saidlosing the store in Sheffield would be a heavy blow to the area. ""The store has been a cornerstone of the city's retail offer for more than a century,"" he said. ""I am working with John Lewis and Sheffield City Council to determine what this means for those whose jobs are now on the line and what can be done to support them."" John Lewis has now axed around a third of its stores in less than a year. It wasn't all that long ago that the chain was opening stores. In 2007, it had 26 when it decided to embark on an aggressive expansion plan, almost doubling the number of stores in a decade, even though internet sales were starting to climb. This is now a painful correction. Of the 23 department stores it went on to open, only 12 will still be trading when lockdown ends. Its Birmingham store was the most high-profile casualty last year. The company is also reining back on its smaller ""John Lewis at home"" stores. Only four of the original 12 remain. But it's also losing some older main department stores in regional cities, which will have a huge impact. John Lewis has been a presence in Sheffield for some 80 years, for instance. The business insists that as the High Street changes, it has to change with it, reflecting changing shopping habits. It expects 70% of its sales to be online by 2025. John Lewis is betting on fewer bigger ""destination"" shops as well as relying far less on retail in the future for its overall profits - from expanding financial services to using excess space for housing. Some bold decisions are being made across retail given the turmoil over the past 12 months, but the question is whether John Lewis can pull off its turnaround plan without losing its competitive edge. John Lewis said it expects from 60-70% of John Lewis sales to be made online in the future. Nearly 50% of its customers have been using a combination of store and online when making their purchases. Despite the expected further shift to online, John Lewis said that stores were essential to its business, as people still wanted physical proximity: ""They provide a sensory experience that online cannot, supported by the expertise of our partners."" The pandemic caused the chain's first ever annual loss of Â£517m for the year to January, against profits of Â£146m the previous year. At the time of that announcement earlier this month, the firm said it would reshape its business in response to the change in customer shopping habits. Much of that loss was due to a write down in the value of its stores because of the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs.

"This video can not be played The giant ship is causing a traffic jam in one of the world's busiest waterways A giant container ship the length of four football pitches has become wedged across Egypt's Suez Canal, blocking one of the world's busiest trade routes. Dozens of vessels are stuck, waiting for rescue boats to free the 400m-long (1,312ft) ship, which was knocked off course by strong winds. Egypt has reopened the canal's older channel to divert some traffic until the grounded ship can move again. The blockage sent oil prices climbing on international markets. In pictures: Container ship blocks Egypt's Suez Canal About 12% of global trade passes through the Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. The Ever Given, registered in Panama and operated by the shipping company Evergreen,was bound for the port city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands from China,externaland was passing northwards through the canal on its way to the Mediterranean. The 200,000 tonne vessel got stuck amid high winds The 200,000 tonne ship, built in 2018 and operated by Taiwanese transport company Evergreen Marine, ran aground and became lodged sideways across the waterway at about 07:40 local time (05:40 GMT) on Tuesday. At 400m long and 59m wide, the ship has blocked the path of other vessels which are now trapped in lines in both directions. The company that manages the container ship, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), has denied earlier reports that the ship had already been partially refloated. In a statement,external, it said its ""immediate priorities are to safely re-float the vessel and for marine traffic in the Suez Canal to safely resume"". Experts have warned the process could take several days. Reuters, quoting local sources, says there are at least 30 ships blocked to the north of the Ever Given, and three to the south. Evergreen Marine said the ship was ""suspected of being hit by a sudden strong wind, causing the hull to deviate... and accidentally hit the bottom and run aground"". BSM confirmed on Wednesday that all crew were ""safe and accounted for"", with no reports of injuries. Eight tug boats are working to refloat the ship, and diggers on the ground have been removing sand from where it is wedged into the side of the canal bank. Dr Sal Mercogliano, a maritime historian based in the US state of North Carolina, told the BBC that incidents such as this were rare, but could have ""huge ramifications for global trade"". Fears that the blockage could tie up shipments of crude oil caused prices to rise by 4% on international markets on Wednesday, Reuters reported. The Kpler energy intelligence service said that more than 20 oil tankers carrying crude and refined products were affected by the jam. ""This is the largest vessel ever to go aground in the Suez Canal,"" he said, adding that the ship got lodged in the embankment and would have lost power and its ability to steer. ""If they are unable to pull her free... in a high tide, they are going to have to start removing cargo."" Julianna Cona, who says she is on board another ship located directly behind the Ever Given,wrote on Instagram,external: ""Ship in front of us ran aground while going through the canal and is now stuck sideways looks like we might be here for a little bit..."" The Suez Canal is an artery of world trade, connecting the Mediterranean with the Red Sea, and providing an avenue for vessels to pass between Asia and the Middle East and Europe. The main alternative, a passage round the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, takes considerably longer. On average, nearly 50 vessels per day pass along the canal, although at times the number can be much higher - accounting for some 12% of world trade. It is particularly important as an avenue for oil and liquified natural gas, enabling shipments to get from the Middle East to Europe. The nightmare scenario, then, is for this crucial route to be blocked - which is exactly what has now happened with the stranding of the Ever Given. The question now is how long the route remains impassable, as a long delay would create serious problems for shippers, delaying consignments of goods and fuel. On this occasion, reports suggest traffic could be flowing again relatively quickly, in which case the impact will be limited, although there has been a rise in the oil price. But the incident has shown what can go wrong when the new generation of ultra-large vessels like the Ever Given have to pass through the relatively tight confines of the canal. Although parts of it were expanded as part of a major modernisation programme in the middle of the last decade, it remains tricky to navigate - and accidents can happen. The ship has the capacity to carry 20,000 20-ft shipping containers, according to Reuters news agency. Nearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal in 2020, according to the Suez Canal Authority - an average of 51.5 ships per day. In 2017, a Japanese container vessel blocked the canal after it ran aground following reported mechanical issues. The Egyptian authorities deployed tug boats and the ship was refloated within hours.  1869waterway first opened 2015canal expanded to include a 22 mile parallel channel 120miles long 205m wide 24m deep The Suez Canal crosses the Suez Isthmus in Egypt - a strip of land between the Mediterranean and Red Sea. The canal is 193km (120 miles) long and incorporates three natural lakes.

"All UK government buildings in England, Wales and Scotland will fly the union flag every day, following new guidance from the culture department. Currently flags are only required to be flown on certain days such as the Queen's birthday. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden described the flag as ""a proud reminder of our history and the ties that bind us"". Government buildings in Northern Ireland are covered by a separate law. The guidance released by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport department says the union flag should be flown every day - except on those occasions where another flag is being flown. The guidance will only apply from the summer. The announcement comes after BBC Breakfast host Charlie Stayt received criticism for joking during a TV interview about the size of the union flag behind Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick. This video can not be played Could you draw the Union Jack? The union flag first appeared in 1606, after James VI of Scotland ascended to the throne in England in 1603 to become James I. The flag combined the two flags of England and Scotland's patron saints -  the red cross of Saint George and the white cross of Saint Andrew. The red cross of Saint Patrick was later added. Back in 2007, Labour MP Ian Lucas unsuccessfully campaigned for the Welsh dragon to be added to the flag. In 2008, then-Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown scrapped a rule that said the union flag could only be flown on certain days. He said it should be left to individual public offices to decide if and when to fly flag. Other countries such as Australia and New Zealand - who are members of the Commonwealth -  feature the union flag on their own flag. Announcing the new guidance, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""The union flag unites us as a nation and people rightly expect it to be flown above UK government buildings - this guidance will ensure that happens every day."" Ministers are also urging all local councils to fly the flag, and buildings will also be able to fly the NHS flag without seeking planning permission. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Conservative MP Sir John Hayes welcomed the move saying: ""I think we just don't fly our flag enough - if you go to capitals of other countries, around the heart of those capitals, particularly government buildings, you routinely see the flag of that country flying. ""So it does seem to me something that unifies the country, that brings us together, that allows us to share in our national pride - what's wrong with that? And after this year, bringing the country together around the flag couldn't be more apposite."" However the SNP's Mhairi Black said: ""If the Tories think an overload of union jacks on buildings is the answer to promote the strength of the union, then it shows how thin the case for the union is. In 2013, protests were triggered by the removal of the Union flag from the Belfast City Hall ""Flags won't undo the poverty and hardship the Tories have created over the last decade,"" she said. Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said: ""The Tories know that independence for Scotland is inevitable and that Wales will be hot on their heels. ""Sticking flags on every street corner will not change that fact, and rather, only reveals their desperate insecurity about the future of the UK"", she said. Flag-flying is a contentious issue in Northern Ireland and in 2015 a commission was set up to help find a consensus on flags, emblems and identity. The commission's report was delayed when devolution in Northern Ireland collapsed and although the findings have been submitted they have not yet been published -despite calls fromassembly members in Stormont.

"The country's largest vaccine maker has already delayed deliveries to Brazil and the UK India has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, foreign ministry sources have told the BBC. They said rising cases meant domestic demand was expected to pick up in the coming weeks, and so the doses were needed for India's own rollout. The move - described as a ""temporary squeeze"" by officials - is expected to affect supplies until the end of April. Some 190 countries under the Covax scheme are likely to be affected. The scheme, which is led by the World Health Organization (WHO), aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations. India's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India (SII), has delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to several countries in recent days, including the UK and Brazil. India has exported more than 60 million vaccine doses to 76 countries so far, with the majority of these being the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. The decision comes as India faces a surge in coronavirus cases. On Wednesday it recorded its sharpest daily rise this year, with more than 47,000 new cases and 275 deaths. It is opening up vaccinations for those over the age of 45 from 1 April, and officials expect demand for vaccinations to increase. India's Covid-19 case spike 'alarming' Can India's vaccine producers meet demand? How will vaccines be shared around the world? ""[The export hold] is a temporary measure. Domestic demand will have to take precedence,"" one foreign ministry source told the BBC's Soutik Biswas. They said there was likely to be a squeeze on vaccine supplies until April, but the situation could ease come May when at least one additional vaccine is expected to be given emergency approval. This video can not be played Watch: The Indian factory making 6,000 syringes a minute There have been no exports from India since Thursday, according to the foreign ministry's website. ""Everything else has taken a backseat, for the time being at least,"" one source at the ministry told Reuters news agency. ""No exports, nothing [until] the India situation stabilises."" There has been no official comment from the government or the SII on the decision. The SII - the world's largest vaccine manufacturer - has already delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to the UK, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Morocco. Last week,the BBC reported that a delivery of five million doses had been held up by four weeks. ""We will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India,"" an SII spokesperson said at the time. The SII has said it will produce one billion doses this year for low- and middle-income countries. And in January, it said it could turn out between 60 and 70 million vaccine doses a month. This figure included the AstraZeneca vaccine as well as the US-developed Novavax jab, which is not yet licensed for use in India. That month, the SII also told the BBC that it was aiming to boost its monthly production to 100 million doses from March. However, a recent check revealed production was still at 60 to 70 million doses and had not increased. The Indian government began its vaccination programme on 16 January, and so far has inoculated over 47 million people amid fears of a possible second wave. The authorities are hoping to administer 600 million doses within seven months - about 85 million doses a month.

Thanks for joining us. Your writers today were Jen Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea, Penny Spiller and Fran Gillett. The editors were James Clarke and Rob Corp. We'll be back again tomorrow morning with all the coronavirus news as it happens. See you then. TheUK and EU say they are working on creating a ""win-win"" situation to expand vaccine supplyfor all citizens. A joint statement says co-operation is ""even more important"" as Europe faces a third wave of coronavirus. India has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, sources have told the BBC. Rising cases in India are putting pressure on the domestic supply chain - but there has been no official comment from the Indian government. China is stepping up its vaccine rollout, with plans to inoculate 40% of its 1.4 billion population by the end of June. So far,82.8 million people have received jabs,external, with China currently focusing on vaccinating people aged between 18 and 59. Chancellor Angela Merkel has made an extraordinary plea to the German people to forgive her,after she cancelled a strict Easter lockdown just a day after announcing it.She admitted there was not enough time to implement the shutdown; it had been met with resistance from business leaders. Brazil has, for the first time, recorded a daily coronavirus death toll of more than 3,000as the virus continues its rapid spread across the country. Health experts say the pandemic is virtually out of control and hospitals report being close to collapse.   We've heard a lot about the Covid variant that was first identified in South Africa - whichscientists believe could be more contagiousor more resistant to current vaccines. The strain has now been detected in dozens of other countries. In the UK, there have been 360 cases of the variant. A travel ban is currently in place for South Africa and nine other southern African countries and, while UK residents and Irish nationals are exempt, those arrivals must still quarantine. But is the government targeting enough countries with travel bans? On 16 March,external, the World Health Organisation identified 64 countries where the South Africa variant had been found. Of those, only 11 are on the ""red list"" which bans arrivals. According to Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial College, some countries - including France - are seeing that a significant fraction of their cases are the South Africa variant. He suggested that as there is ""a lot of essential travel"" between the UK and France, the government should consider further measures to reduce the risk of more of the variant reaching the UK.

Olga RobinsonBBC Monitoring Online communities sharing harmful anti-vaccine content have grown significantly during the pandemic,according to new BBC Monitoring researchon seven countries across Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe. Facebook accounts promoting false information about vaccines saw a boost in followers in Brazil, Mexico, India, Ukraine, France, Tanzania and Kenya over the past year. Vaccine misinformation in these countries appears to mainly spread in groups where a range of topics such as health, religion, politics and conspiracy theories are discussed. In Brazil, Mexico, Tanzania and Kenya some religious pages promoted misleading claims and conspiracy theories about vaccines to their large online audiences. In India we found anti-vaccine content was largely driven by individuals promoting traditional medicine. Our research also showed a political and nationalistic dimension to online debates about vaccination in some countries, which often featured criticism of and misleading claims about foreign vaccines. The findings were released on the final day of theBBC's Trust in News conference, at which technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones questioned social media companies about what they have done to tackle disinformation on their platforms. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Prime Minister Boris Johnson has plunged
headlong into an issue thatâs proving controversial within his own party. Speaking to a group of senior MPs earlier this afternoon, Mr Johnson suggested that, as restrictions
ease, people may have to provide proof of vaccination to visit a pub. This, he suggested, would be up to
individual publicans. The prime minister said the
""basic concept of a vaccine certification should not be totally alien to
us"". But the use of vaccine passports, or
certificates, domestically has previously been denounced as ""divisive"" - by none other than Mr Johnsonâs own
vaccines minister. At the same meeting, in answer to another question, Mr Johnson declared that
care home companies would be acting âresponsiblyâ if they required all staff
to be vaccinated. â""It doesnât seem to me to be
irresponsible at all â far from it, it's highly responsible â for care
home companies to think about requiring vaccinations,"" he said, speaking to the Liaisons Committee. There is an ongoing debate inside government over whether to make Covid vaccinations compulsory for social
care workers, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock setting out some of the benefits of this approach, But Unison, which represents staff, opposes mandatory vaccination. Now the prime minister seems to be floating a slightly different solution â by placing responsibility on employers to require that their staff be vaccinated. This will seen by some as
compulsion by the back door -  or what critics have called ""jabs for jobs"". India will open up vaccinations for those over the age of 45 from 1 April India has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, foreign ministry sources have told the BBC. They said rising cases meant domestic demand was expected to pick up in the coming weeks, and so the doses were needed for India's own rollout. The move - described as a ""temporary squeeze"" by officials - is expected to affect supplies until the end of April. Some 190 countries under the Covax scheme are likely to be affected. India's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India (SII), has delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to several countries in recent days, including the UK and Brazil. India has exported more than 60 million vaccine doses to 76 countries so far, with the majority of these being the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. The decision comes as India faces a surge in coronavirus cases. On Wednesday it recorded its sharpest daily rise this year, with more than 47,000 new cases and 275 deaths. There has been no official comment from the government or the Serum Institute on the decision. Read more. Some countries and travel firms are looking at whether people could be asked to prove their Covid status with a vaccine passport Earlier,we heard from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnsonwho was asked about whether Covid vaccination certificates or passports could be used to help British society open up. Asked whether they could be used by pubs to allow people in, Mr Johnson said ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". But the idea has been met with some criticism. Mr Johnson's fellow Conservative MP Steve Baker - a member of the lockdown-sceptic Coronavirus Research Group - has warned that the prime minister âbegan to tread a dangerous path when he opened the door to domestic Covid certificatesâ today. âFirst they said weâll need them to watch the football, and today that it may be papers for the pub. âWhether the state legislates for it, recommends it or simply allows it the result will be the same: a two-tier Britain that prevents pregnant women from taking part in society, given that the government is telling them not to take the vaccine, or one where we turn back the clock and tolerate businesses turning away customers from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine. âWe must not fall into this ghastly trap.â Laura GoodwinBBC Scotland Two separate studies have found that women under the age of 50 had worse long-term outcomes after being in hospital with Covid-19. Research led by Glasgow University followed 327 adults from around the UK who were admitted to hospital between 5 February and 5 October last year. Participants were followed for between three and 11 months. It found that women under 50 had higher odds of worse outcomes when compared with men and older participants - and this was even if the woman had no previous health problems, the study found. They were five times less likely to report feeling fully recovered three months or more after the onset of their infection, twice as likely to report worse fatigue and seven times more likely to be more breathless. We've got more on the findings here. We've found out some more about how the NHS coped during the second wave of the pandemic - and in particular, how intensive care units fared. Two patients were moved to a hospital 300 miles away because of an intensive care bed shortage - and an unprecedented 2,300 intensive care patients were moved between UK hospitals. The data covers the period from September 2020 to March 2021. Front-line doctors, speaking for the first time, say these transfers were the only way to care for patients. And NHS England said the health service had responded well under intense pressure. Read the full story here. The UK and EU have said they are working on creating a ""win-win"" situation and to expand vaccine supply for all citizens, as the row involving demand for the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab continues. The UK government and European Commission have just released a joint statement. âWe are all facing the same pandemic and
the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,"" it reads. ""We have been discussing what more we can
do to ensure a reciprocally beneficial relationship between the UK and EU on
Covid-19. ""Given our interdependencies, we are
working on specific steps we can take - in the short-, medium - and long term -
to create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all our citizens. ""In the end, openness and global
co-operation of all countries will be key to finally overcome this pandemic and
ensure better preparation for meeting future challenges. ""We will continue our discussions.â Earlier the government published its daily coronavirus figures, showing another 5,605 cases had been confirmed and a further 98 people had died with the virus. This continues the trend of a falling number of deaths, although the decline in cases has slowed. Meanwhile, the vaccine rollout continues. As our graphs show, more than 31 million jabs have now been administered of which more than 28 million are people's first doses. The Vatican said cuts were being made ""with the aim of safeguarding current jobs"" The Vatican's income has plummeted during the pandemic as museums and other attractions such as St Peter's Basilica have been forced to close. It's now expecting a deficit of â¬50m (Â£43m) this year. Pope Francis has now ordered pay cuts for cardinals and other clerics starting from next month. Cardinals are believed to receive up to â¬5,000 (Â£4,300) a month and often live in subsidised accommodation - but will now have their pay reduced by 10%. Priests and other clerics will see their salaries cut by between 3% and 8% and planned salary increases will be suspended until March 2023. The pope, who is the head of the Catholic Church, has previously said he does not want to fire people in difficult economic times. Read the full story here. Boris Johnson has been answering questions from a committee of senior MPs As we've been reporting, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been facing questions from MPs this afternoon about a whole range of issues - including about the government's handling of the pandemic. He is up in front of the liaison committee, which is made up of all the MPs who lead the different parliamentary committees, and which gets to grill the PM a few times each year. Conservative MP William Wragg asks what Johnson's thoughts are on vaccine certificates, for example proof of a vaccine that could allow someone to do certain things. Could they be used for ordinary people to be allowed into pub, for example? The prime minister says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". You can read more about vaccine passports here.A government review, which is being led by Michael Gove, is due to consider whether a vaccine passport could be also be used to allow visitors entry to venues such as bars, theatres or sports stadiums. Today's daily coronavirus figures have beenpublished by the government.,external They show another 5,605 cases have been recorded, and a further 98 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. Meanwhile the latest vaccination figures show that more than 28.6 million people have now had their first dose, after another 325,650 first doses given yesterday. Fellow Conservative William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee - has asked the PM about the possibility of international travel this summer. The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and thereafter he will ""be setting out what may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". He agrees there is a wide spectrum of scientific opinion on the matter, but assures his colleague advisors advise but ministers will decide. The Labour chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Yvette Cooper, has asked Boris Johnson why France has not been put on the UK's red list, given the rise in cases and new variants. The prime minister explains that putting a countryon the ""red list"",externalhas consequences for the supply of medicines and foods to the UK - a nod to the huge haulage industry that sees goods crossing the channel -  but the PM concedes ""we will have to look at tougher measures"" if the circumstances change. Cooper says 20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two-thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions - she wants to know why hauliers are not being tested in the UK. Johnson says the numbers have ""massively diminished"" in recent months - but says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel"" and ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Why is the PM not taking action now, asks Cooper? Johnson says there is ""a balance to be struck"" given the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Labour MP Meg Hillier asks Boris Johnson what his biggest regret is over the past year. The prime minister prevaricates, saying he ""wouldn't want to make a mistake about my biggest mistake and single out the wrong one"" but commits once again to ""a proper inquiry in due course"". Hillier homes in on the Test and Trace programme and asks the prime minister if he is ""content"" with having committed Â£37bn to it. Johnson says Test and Trace has been ""an extraordinary achievement"", adding 80% of the money goes on labs and testing, which is ""desperately needed"". It has given us ""the tools to fight"" the virus, he states. He says the data derived from the Test and Trace programme, in terms of new variants and where they have been arisen, has allowed the government to study ""what is happening with the pandemic in a very granular way"". He insists it has been of ""crucial importance"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is appearing before a special House of Commons committee made up of senior politicians who have been grilling him on a range of issues. Asked about the potential threat of the European Union restricting Covid vaccine exports, he said the co-operation the UK has with the EU is ""very important"" and he doesn't believe blockades ""are sensible"". Long-term damage done by blockades can be ""very considerable"", he told the chairman of the Health Committee Conservative Jeremy Hunt. Anyone considering a blockade may want to think about how companies would view a country where such things are imposed, he warns. Hunt asks if nothing will be ""taken off the table"" to make sure the UK gets vaccines. Johnson says ""we will do everything that is necessary"" to make sure that people get their vaccines. Would you like a Covid test with your chips? Some US residents can now get one alongside a meal after food ordering service DoorDash announced they'll deliver at-home tests to cities across the country. Two types of tests will be available - a nasal swab or a saliva sample - the company said. Both can yield results within 24 to 48 hours. It is the first such scheme to be launched by a delivery service. ""Amidst the pandemic, one of our priorities has been to make health and wellness essentials more accessible for customers, and we will continue to expand our offerings in the healthcare space,"" a spokesperson for DoorDash said. The prices and availability of testing kits in the US vary, though the ones offered by DoorDash range in price from $109 (Â£79) to $119 (Â£87) and may require a video call with medical personnel during the test.

"This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel says the new rules are based on the principle of fairness The home secretary has set out what she has called a ""fair but firm"" overhaul to the way people applying for asylum in the UK are treated. Priti Patel said, for the first time, people seeking protection as refugees would have their claim assessed based on how they arrive in the UK. She said ministers would crack down on people smugglers because ""enough is enough"". Labour said the plans lacked compassion and competence. Under the changes, people who arrive in the UK by what the government call illegal means to claim asylum will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive through proper channels. There were35,099 asylum claims,externalmade in the UK during the year ending March 2020, with Iran, Albania and Iraq providing the most applicants. More than 8,000 people crossed the Channel in small boats, with the help of people smugglers. What happens to migrants who reach the UK? UK to consider sending asylum seekers abroad Asylum seekers could be processed on old ferries Setting out the plans to MPs, Ms Patel said the government would introduce a ""faster and fairer"" system that would ""better support the most vulnerable"". Ms Patel said ""serious organised criminal gangs"" were exploiting people trying to get to the UK, and that it was these same gangs who were also involved in ""serious violent crimes"" in the UK such as trafficking guns and drugs. ""Families and young children have lost their lives at sea, in lorries and in shipping containers having put their trust in the hands of criminals,"" she added. ""The way to stop these deaths is to stop the trade in people that causes them."" She said the new measures will create ""safe and legal routes"", and that people should be claiming asylum in the EU country in which they first arrive, rather than using it as a springboard to reach the UK. ""If you illegally enter the UK via a safe country in which you could have claimed asylum, you are not seeking refuge from imminent peril, as is the intended purpose of the asylum system, but are picking the UK as a preferred destination over others,"" she said. This video can not be played Labour's shadow home secretary says the asylum plans are ""lacking in compassion"" She said the system was currently ""clogged up"" with bogus claims and legal wrangles. But human rights lawyers have warned the plans are unlawful because they ignore Britain's international obligations under the Refugee Convention. Labour said the proposals would do ""next to nothing to stop people making dangerous crossings"" or to deal with criminal gangs. There are two enormous legal elephants trumpeting away in the shiny glass atrium of the Home Office that are casting some really significant doubts on whether the home secretary's plan is deliverable. Firstly, can she treat some refugees who have a recognised case for protection differently from others, purely based on how they reached the UK? Under the UN Refugee Convention (which, history fans, the UK government helped write in 1951) states can't penalise people in need who come ""directly"" from their homeland - or anyone who has ""good cause"" to enter a nation illegally. Official sources say Ms Patel's restrictions would be legally possible because asylum seekers are not allowed to go ""shopping"" for the best destination. But even if the restrictions are introduced, and the Home Office wants to send people back to France or elsewhere, how is that going to happen? The UK has no legal agreement with EU nations to take these people back. And that's because we chose to leave it as part of Brexit. The BBC has learnt that the Home Office has not sent any failed asylum seekers back to EU states since the end of the Brexit transition three months ago. The home secretary's plans for asylum rely on striking agreements with other safe countries who would be willing to take people who have passed through their territory on the way to the UK. Many people smugglers send asylum seekers across the Channel in dangerously small boats Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told MPs the changes proposed by the government ""risk making the situation even worse for victims of human trafficking as it would make seeking help in the UK even harder"". ""The government policy is defined by a lack of compassion and a lack of competence, the plans risk baking in to the UK system the callousness of this government's approach,"" he said. Responding to Ms Patel's pledges, Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon accused the government of ""seeking to unjustly differentiate between the deserving and undeserving refugee"" by giving protection ""based on how they travel to the UK"". Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said it was ""slightly misleading to say people have a choice between the legal and illegal route"" adding ""for many people the clandestine means will be their only way to get to the UK"". She also said there would be ""complex issues"" about whether other countries would be willing to take back asylum seekers deemed to have arrived in the UK via irregular routes. Asked if any EU states had agreed to take people back, Ms Patel replied that she was currently in discussions with those countries. There was support from Conservative MPs in the Commons, including West Bromwich MP Shaun Bailey who said: ""Just like my constituents, I'm angry at the images that we're seeing of small boats coming into the Channel and the sky-rocketing costs of our asylum system. ""The broader issue here is this: our European neighbours need to step up. It's as simple as that."" This video can not be played 'Nobody chooses persecution' - criticism of asylum changes from an asylum seeker The Home Office said that ""for the first time"" the question of whether asylum seekers enter the UK via another ""safe"" country, such as France would ""have an impact"" on how it dealt with claims. The government would seek the ""rapid removal from the UK"" of rejected applicants, with appeals ""reformed to speed up"" the process, it added. But asylum seekers fleeing persecution or violence and coming to the UK via the ""legal resettlement"" route from countries such as Syria and Iran would straight away get permission to remain in the UK indefinitely, the Home Office said. Under the new plans, anyone who pays criminal gangs to bring them to the UK would only ever receive temporary permission to remain and would be regularly assessed for removal from the UK. Other proposals include bringing in ""rigorous"" age checks to stop adults entering the country by pretending to be children. The use of hotels to accommodate arrivals will end and the government will bring forward plans to expand the ""asylum estate"". Ms Patel said asylum applicants with criminal records who returned to the UK after being deported would receive a jail sentence of up to five years. The current maximum is six months. And people smugglers - responsible for shipping many of the 8,500 people who crossed the English Channel in small boats last year - could get life sentences.

Parliament goes in to recess for the Easter break after tomorrow's sitting.  So we'll be back with our regular coverage of Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday 14 April. Thanks for following along with us. That was a wide-ranging 90 minutes in front of the committee for Boris Johnson. But here are some of the key points from the session: Reality Check Boris Johnson faced lots of question today on defence spending - in PMQs and in his session with the Liaison Committee. The
prime minister said recent spending pledges were âthe biggest investment in
defence since the Cold War.â Looking
back at figures since 1990 - seen by many as the end of the Cold War, with the
Berlin Wall coming down in November 1989 - it is clear military spending has
fallen considerably. The
proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of
everything produced by the economy in any particular year, was 3.5% in 1990 .
It was 2.1% in 2018/19. The
boostannounced in Novembermeans by
2024-25, defence spending will be Â£7bn a year higher than it would have been
under previous plans. But
with Â£7bn worth about 0.35% of GDP, this extra money is not enough to push
defence spending above the 3.5% of GDP it represented in 1990. The
government has previously phrased this claim differently, though, calling the
boost that will see defence spending rise by Â£7bn a year by 2024-25, the
""biggest sustained increase in 30 years"". And
as defence spending has not increased for more than three years in a row since
1990, this will probably turn out to be true. Read more here.  Bernard Jenkin thanks the prime minister for the time he has given to the committee, and he closes the session in the tradition of parliamentary proceedings: ""Order, order"". And that's it. We'll bring you a quick summary of the key points next.... Before the chair of the Liaison Committee, Bernard Jenkin, brings the session to a close he returns to questions about the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. He says he is concerned that ""it doesn't look like the same consuming priority as other policies"". Can the PM do more to secure the agreement of all those countries due to attend? Mr Johnson says he is ""engaged in some kind of COP conversation virtually every day"". He says it is a ""big cross-government effort"" to get ready for it.  It is led by Alok Sharma, he says, but everyone is ""gripping it across Whitehall"". Mr Jenkin asks how often the Climate Action Strategy Committee is meeting in preparation? Mr Johnson says ""to be frank"" it has ""not met a great deal"" but that is because a lot is happening already on ""an ad hoc level"". Ms Bradley asks if there are any procedural changes the prime minister would like to see to enable more women to make successful careers in Parliament. Mr Johnson says technology has ""definitely been our friend"" during the pandemic. He says it is not for him to dictate, but it is for MPs and the Speaker to see how things can be improved for work and family balances. ""There are still very considerable barriers"" he states, and there are some deterrents that female MPs face, such as ""absolutely appalling"" online trolling. Ms Bradley asks if there are any particular innovations which he'd like to see continue after the pandemic, such as virtual voting. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to commit to any particular change, but he says he's open to different ideas. He says he ""wants the chamber to be full again"" and he wants the public to see where the ""sentiment"" is in Parliament by seeing and hearing how MPs are responding to a debate. He also wants to see MPs be able to ""mingle again in the lobbies,"" ""voting as a communal act, together, has immense benefits,"" he states. Ms Bradley asks her final question, she says the government has to provide time in Parliament to allow MPs to debate changes to how they work. Mr Johnson says this is a ""necessity"" and he has ""no doubt"" that this can be organised. Sir Bernard Jenkin says proxy voting has been beneficial for lots of women who often have caring responsibilities, he asks if the PM has an open mind on such things. Mr Johnson says he wants to see Parliament become more family friendly. Chair of the Commons Procedure Committee Conservative Karen Bradley asks the final set of questions, this time on lifting Covid-19 restrictions in Parliament. She says the House of Commons has been able to operate and sit throughout the whole pandemic, unlike many other parliaments in the world, she states. She asks how the PM thinks Parliament has operated over the past twelve months. Boris Johnson says some professions have been really badly hit by the disease, but he thanks the workers who have managed to make Parliament continue to sit. He says he thinks the public want to see MPs return to their place of work in person. Ms Bradley asks what his view is on social distancing in the Commons chamber. Mr Johnson says he wants to see an approach for the Commons which is adopted everywhere, as he wants Westminster to be like ""every other part of the UK"". Mr Merriman asks how discussions with other international leaders are going - such as talking to President Biden about travel between the UK and US restarting. The PM says leaders ""around the world"" are looking at ""when can get things moving"". But he says there is ""no doubt a growing global consensus for the purposes of aviation that evidence of a vaccination or immunity, that you have had the disease, or have taken a negative test... will be valuable"" for travel. Finally Mr Merriman asks when Brits will feel ready to travel again - and if the PM will be going abroad this summer. Mr Johnson says we should not ""underestimate the natural wanderlust of spiritual inquiry"" of the British people, adding: ""As soon as people feel it is safe, you will see a miraculous change in the mood."" He won't reveal his own holiday destination, but says: ""I think whatever I do, I will be making sure to tell the British public what I think is safe."" Now Huw Merriman gets his turn - he had tried to join the committee earlier via Zoom but had issues with his mute button - something we are all too familiar with. But there is plenty space in the room for him to join in person at a safe distance, so after a suggestion from Boris Johnson he should run across Parliament, he now gets to his questions. The Tory MP asks about international travel and how detailed the announcement on 5 April will be. Boris Johnson says he will have to wait and see but adds: ""We hope we can get people moving again by 17 May.... [but] we will just have to see where we get to, where other countries get to and what the data is telling us."" Mr Knight says it is not enough to say that talks are taking place with the EU on visa fees for performers. He wants ministers to get involved to ""short circuit"" discussions with countries that ""seem to be the most recalcitrant"" such as Italy, Spain and Greece. Mr Johnson says he agrees things ""must get ironed out"". He says it needs to be ""a two way street"" with the EU. On the issue of festivals taking place in the UK this summer, Mr Knight says organisers are nervous because of problems with Covid cancellation insurance. Will the PM get involved to ""back a Covid secure summer of fun rather than condemning us to a summer of none"" he asks? Mr Johnson says the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, has done a ""huge amount of work"" to get the sector ready for reopening. He says he does not want to see people unwilling to take risks when putting on events this year because they are scarred by memories of last year. Glastonbury has already announced it will not go ahead this summer, but will other festivals? Lead singer of The Darkness, Justin Hawkins, told the BBC he ""remains pessimistic"", while some in the industry are calling for government-backed insurance to renew confidence and enable the sector to ""get going again"". This video can not be played Music festivals and Covid: Could some events still go ahead this year? Julian Knight who chairs the Culture Committee jumps the queue because the chair of the Transport Committee is having technical problems. Mr Knight says the culture, media and sport sector is worth a quarter of the UK economy but visa fees to work in the EU mean musicians are performers are suffering. Why has no other sector been allowed to suffer from Brexit, he asks. Mr Johnson says he ""shares the frustration"" and agrees the sector is ""massively important"" and brings billions of tax revenue and employment to the UK. But he says EU restrictions are to blame and the situation is unlike that in ""global Britain"" which welcomes people from around the world. He adds that the government is working ""flat out"" with each individual government but ""some are much better than others"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There was never a simple binary trade-off between the two factors: those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths, also had the biggest hits to the economy and the UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. Read Faisal's full analysis here. Mr Stride says many economists think the spending forecasts in thatOBR report,externalare ""unrealistic"" and there are many more costs expected in the coming years which are not ""baked in to the budget"". There is, for instance, no additional spending outlined for the vaccine or test and trace beyond this summer. He asks if this leaves him feeling ""queasy"" over spending. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to make predictions now about  future spending reviews, but he says he there's no sign in the data that ""at this stage"" the UK will have to ""deviate from our path to freedom"" from lockdown. Mr Stride says there's no money in the forecast to fix and change social care. He asks if the tax burden can be expected not to rise. Mr Johnson says he ""strongly believes in a low-tax government, and I'm a low tax Conservative"". He says as the UK emerges from Covid-19, tax rates will keep the UK ""competitive"". Mr Stride says there will be a situation where tax benefits to corporations will end at the same time as corporation taxes will rise, he asks if this will damage such companies. Mr Johnson lists all of the help available to businesses during the pandemic, which he describes as a ""huge package"" over the past year. Chair of the Treasury committee Conservative MP Mel Stride asks if the spending assumptions from the Office for Budget Responsibility are ""realistic"". Mr Johnson says he thinks the OBR is ""right to think that the public finances are under very considerable pressure as a result of Covid"". Mr Stride asks if the forecast for the next five years from the OBR on government spending is correct. Mr Johnson says ""things are very tough"" and ""spending has been necessarily very extensive"" but the Chancellor's Budget is set to work in the medium term. Mr Stride asks if the PM is happy with the assumption of spending levels over the coming years. Mr Johnson says he wishes ""we weren't in this position"" and had to ""firehose so much money"" following Covid-19. Onto vaccines, Mr Wragg asks whether certificates proving you have had your jab are ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". The PM seems to answer a different question after discussions yesterday about care homes making vaccines mandatory for their staff. He says the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" as doctors already have to have Hepatitis B jabs, adding the idea ""doesn't seem to me to be irresponsible at all, far from it, it is wholly responsible for care home companies to think about requiring vaccinations"". But Mr Wragg asks, what about ""ordinary citizens going to the pub?"" Mr Johnson says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". Pushed further, the PM says other MPs want tougher restrictions, adding: ""I find myself in this long national conversation thinking very deeply about it, and the public have been thinking very deeply. ""They want us as their government and me as prime minister to take all the action I can to protect them."" Mr Wragg then asks about comments made by scientific advisers at the weekend that Brits won't be able to go abroad for their holidays - ""is that the government's policy?"" The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and he will ""set out what I see may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". Asked by Mr Wragg if he finds advisers ""freelancing across the media before decisions have been made"" helpful, the PM says: ""It is one of those things we just have to get used to. It has been a feature of life for quite some time."" But he assures his Tory colleague that advisers advise and ministers decide. The next MP to question the prime minister is Tory William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He asks why the Coronavirus Act - which gives the government emergency powers amid the pandemic - is being extended for six months on Thursday, past the final roadmap step out of lockdown. Boris Johnson says they need the act ""to deal with backlogs we have built up"" - such as allowing remote court hearings or letting NHS volunteers continue to serve. He adds: ""Be in no doubt after 21 June, all the restrictions we have, we hope, will be gone. ""But remember this is a 'not before' date."" Mr Wragg says some provisions in the law ""still haven't been used"" so questions why wont they be dropped. The PM says the government have ""already weeded out quite a few"", adding: ""anything redundant will go."" Yvette Cooper continues her questions and says  20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions. She says everyone understands the importance of hauliers being able to do their job but she wants to know why are they not being tested in the UK. Mr Johnson says the numbers coming in overall from France have ""massively diminished"". It ""was colossal"" the PM admits. He says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel""  and says he ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Ms Cooper says scientists and medics agree that the ""biggest threat to keeping the roadmap on track"" in the UK is the spread of new variants from South Africa and Brazil. Why is the PM not taking action now, she asks, when we know cases have been rising since February? Mr Johnson says that is because there is ""a balance to be struck"". He says it is not clear how the vaccines will work against the new variants and that the government has to balance taking action now against the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Anyone in England who travels abroad without good reasoncould soon be fined Â£5,000, under the coronavirus regulations. It comes amidst growing uncertainty about whether people will be able to take foreign holidays this summer. Holiday travel is not currently allowed - either in the UK or abroad - under lockdown rules. So when can you go on holiday again?Read our guide here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel says the new rules are based on the principle of fairness The home secretary has set out what she has called a ""fair but firm"" overhaul to the way people applying for asylum in the UK are treated. Priti Patel said, for the first time, people seeking protection as refugees would have their claim assessed based on how they arrive in the UK. She said ministers would crack down on people smugglers because ""enough is enough"". Labour said the plans lacked compassion and competence. Under the changes, people who arrive in the UK by what the government call illegal means to claim asylum will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive through proper channels. There were35,099 asylum claims,externalmade in the UK during the year ending March 2020, with Iran, Albania and Iraq providing the most applicants. More than 8,000 people crossed the Channel in small boats, with the help of people smugglers. What happens to migrants who reach the UK? UK to consider sending asylum seekers abroad Asylum seekers could be processed on old ferries Setting out the plans to MPs, Ms Patel said the government would introduce a ""faster and fairer"" system that would ""better support the most vulnerable"". Ms Patel said ""serious organised criminal gangs"" were exploiting people trying to get to the UK, and that it was these same gangs who were also involved in ""serious violent crimes"" in the UK such as trafficking guns and drugs. ""Families and young children have lost their lives at sea, in lorries and in shipping containers having put their trust in the hands of criminals,"" she added. ""The way to stop these deaths is to stop the trade in people that causes them."" She said the new measures will create ""safe and legal routes"", and that people should be claiming asylum in the EU country in which they first arrive, rather than using it as a springboard to reach the UK. ""If you illegally enter the UK via a safe country in which you could have claimed asylum, you are not seeking refuge from imminent peril, as is the intended purpose of the asylum system, but are picking the UK as a preferred destination over others,"" she said. This video can not be played Labour's shadow home secretary says the asylum plans are ""lacking in compassion"" She said the system was currently ""clogged up"" with bogus claims and legal wrangles. But human rights lawyers have warned the plans are unlawful because they ignore Britain's international obligations under the Refugee Convention. Labour said the proposals would do ""next to nothing to stop people making dangerous crossings"" or to deal with criminal gangs. There are two enormous legal elephants trumpeting away in the shiny glass atrium of the Home Office that are casting some really significant doubts on whether the home secretary's plan is deliverable. Firstly, can she treat some refugees who have a recognised case for protection differently from others, purely based on how they reached the UK? Under the UN Refugee Convention (which, history fans, the UK government helped write in 1951) states can't penalise people in need who come ""directly"" from their homeland - or anyone who has ""good cause"" to enter a nation illegally. Official sources say Ms Patel's restrictions would be legally possible because asylum seekers are not allowed to go ""shopping"" for the best destination. But even if the restrictions are introduced, and the Home Office wants to send people back to France or elsewhere, how is that going to happen? The UK has no legal agreement with EU nations to take these people back. And that's because we chose to leave it as part of Brexit. The BBC has learnt that the Home Office has not sent any failed asylum seekers back to EU states since the end of the Brexit transition three months ago. The home secretary's plans for asylum rely on striking agreements with other safe countries who would be willing to take people who have passed through their territory on the way to the UK. Many people smugglers send asylum seekers across the Channel in dangerously small boats Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told MPs the changes proposed by the government ""risk making the situation even worse for victims of human trafficking as it would make seeking help in the UK even harder"". ""The government policy is defined by a lack of compassion and a lack of competence, the plans risk baking in to the UK system the callousness of this government's approach,"" he said. Responding to Ms Patel's pledges, Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon accused the government of ""seeking to unjustly differentiate between the deserving and undeserving refugee"" by giving protection ""based on how they travel to the UK"". Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said it was ""slightly misleading to say people have a choice between the legal and illegal route"" adding ""for many people the clandestine means will be their only way to get to the UK"". She also said there would be ""complex issues"" about whether other countries would be willing to take back asylum seekers deemed to have arrived in the UK via irregular routes. Asked if any EU states had agreed to take people back, Ms Patel replied that she was currently in discussions with those countries. There was support from Conservative MPs in the Commons, including West Bromwich MP Shaun Bailey who said: ""Just like my constituents, I'm angry at the images that we're seeing of small boats coming into the Channel and the sky-rocketing costs of our asylum system. ""The broader issue here is this: our European neighbours need to step up. It's as simple as that."" This video can not be played 'Nobody chooses persecution' - criticism of asylum changes from an asylum seeker The Home Office said that ""for the first time"" the question of whether asylum seekers enter the UK via another ""safe"" country, such as France would ""have an impact"" on how it dealt with claims. The government would seek the ""rapid removal from the UK"" of rejected applicants, with appeals ""reformed to speed up"" the process, it added. But asylum seekers fleeing persecution or violence and coming to the UK via the ""legal resettlement"" route from countries such as Syria and Iran would straight away get permission to remain in the UK indefinitely, the Home Office said. Under the new plans, anyone who pays criminal gangs to bring them to the UK would only ever receive temporary permission to remain and would be regularly assessed for removal from the UK. Other proposals include bringing in ""rigorous"" age checks to stop adults entering the country by pretending to be children. The use of hotels to accommodate arrivals will end and the government will bring forward plans to expand the ""asylum estate"". Ms Patel said asylum applicants with criminal records who returned to the UK after being deported would receive a jail sentence of up to five years. The current maximum is six months. And people smugglers - responsible for shipping many of the 8,500 people who crossed the English Channel in small boats last year - could get life sentences.

"The Tunbridge Wells store, on the list to stay closed permanently John Lewis has said it will not reopen eight of its stores once lockdown eases, putting 1,465 jobs at risk. The retail giant said some locations could not sustain a large store. Four ""At Home"" shops in Ashford, Tunbridge Wells, Basingstoke, and Chester will close - as well as department stores in Aberdeen, Peterborough, Sheffield and York. John Lewis said the eight shops were ""financially challenged prior to the pandemic"". Earlier this month,the retailer warned it would be making more store closuresafter the impact of the pandemic led it to report a hefty annual loss. The latest move comes on top of the closure of eight stores that John Lewis announced last year. The chain has now axed around a third of its stores in less than a year. James Morrell says it could present an opportunity for small independent stores For almost 40 years the John Lewis store in Peterborough has been the flagship of the city's shopping centre, but along with seven other branches it looks sets to close. Shopper James Morrell says he usually goes to John Lewis to look at the ""tech"" and says it will be a shame to not see it reopen after lockdown. ""This is pretty much all we've got in Peterborough really, it's our main selling point,"" he says. But he says it ""might be nice for little independent shops to come along and take up the space"". Read more here. The company said it planned to create more places to shop for John Lewis products across the UK. It suggested it would not entirely move out of areas where the main store was closing. ""In areas where we propose not to reopen stores, we will look at the right combination of options for that location to ensure we remain convenient for our customers, so they can continue to access John Lewis products and services."" It added it would invest in improving click-and-collect in its Waitrose stores and offer more local collection points through third parties. It also will continue experimenting with John Lewis shopping areas in Waitrose stores, as well as trying out smaller, local neighbourhood shops. John Lewis said 34 stores would start reopening from 12 April, subject to government guidance, with the exception of Glasgow, which will reopen from 26 April, and Edinburgh, which will reopen on 14 May. John Lewis expects 60-70% of its sales to take place online in future The company said it would ""enter into consultation with the 1,465 affected partners"" about the proposals. Should it proceed, it said it would make ""every effort"" to find alternative roles for as many as possible. John Lewis has a unique structure in that its staff are also partners in the business, and receive a share in the profits in good years. It said the stores that were closing were in locations where it did not have enough customers. ""Given the significant shift to online shopping in recent years - and our belief that this trend will not materially reverse - we do not think the performance of these eight stores can be substantially improved."" Andrew Taylor Andrew worked at the John Lewis store in Birmingham for five years before being made redundant last year. He has worked in the retail industry for 20 years. ""I'm not surprised by today's announcement,"" he said. ""While it's true that customer shopping habits have changed, I believe the partnership was in the middle of an identity crisis before the pandemic."" Mr Taylor said the company has ""struggled to adapt and needs to work on diversity and inclusion as a business to reflect modern-day Britain."" Dan Jarvis, the mayor for Sheffield, saidlosing the store in Sheffield would be a heavy blow to the area. ""The store has been a cornerstone of the city's retail offer for more than a century,"" he said. ""I am working with John Lewis and Sheffield City Council to determine what this means for those whose jobs are now on the line and what can be done to support them."" John Lewis has now axed around a third of its stores in less than a year. It wasn't all that long ago that the chain was opening stores. In 2007, it had 26 when it decided to embark on an aggressive expansion plan, almost doubling the number of stores in a decade, even though internet sales were starting to climb. This is now a painful correction. Of the 23 department stores it went on to open, only 12 will still be trading when lockdown ends. Its Birmingham store was the most high-profile casualty last year. The company is also reining back on its smaller ""John Lewis at home"" stores. Only four of the original 12 remain. But it's also losing some older main department stores in regional cities, which will have a huge impact. John Lewis has been a presence in Sheffield for some 80 years, for instance. The business insists that as the High Street changes, it has to change with it, reflecting changing shopping habits. It expects 70% of its sales to be online by 2025. John Lewis is betting on fewer bigger ""destination"" shops as well as relying far less on retail in the future for its overall profits - from expanding financial services to using excess space for housing. Some bold decisions are being made across retail given the turmoil over the past 12 months, but the question is whether John Lewis can pull off its turnaround plan without losing its competitive edge. John Lewis said it expects from 60-70% of John Lewis sales to be made online in the future. Nearly 50% of its customers have been using a combination of store and online when making their purchases. Despite the expected further shift to online, John Lewis said that stores were essential to its business, as people still wanted physical proximity: ""They provide a sensory experience that online cannot, supported by the expertise of our partners."" The pandemic caused the chain's first ever annual loss of Â£517m for the year to January, against profits of Â£146m the previous year. At the time of that announcement earlier this month, the firm said it would reshape its business in response to the change in customer shopping habits. Much of that loss was due to a write down in the value of its stores because of the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs.

2024-25, defence spending will be Â£7bn a year higher than it would have been
under previous plans. But
with Â£7bn worth about 0.35% of GDP, this extra money is not enough to push
defence spending above the 3.5% of GDP it represented in 1990. The
government has previously phrased this claim differently, though, calling the
boost that will see defence spending rise by Â£7bn a year by 2024-25, the
""biggest sustained increase in 30 years"". And
as defence spending has not increased for more than three years in a row since
1990, this will probably turn out to be true. Read more here.  Bernard Jenkin thanks the prime minister for the time he has given to the committee, and he closes the session in the tradition of parliamentary proceedings: ""Order, order"". And that's it. We'll bring you a quick summary of the key points next.... Before the chair of the Liaison Committee, Bernard Jenkin, brings the session to a close he returns to questions about the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. He says he is concerned that ""it doesn't look like the same consuming priority as other policies"". Can the PM do more to secure the agreement of all those countries due to attend? Mr Johnson says he is ""engaged in some kind of COP conversation virtually every day"". He says it is a ""big cross-government effort"" to get ready for it.  It is led by Alok Sharma, he says, but everyone is ""gripping it across Whitehall"". Mr Jenkin asks how often the Climate Action Strategy Committee is meeting in preparation? Mr Johnson says ""to be frank"" it has ""not met a great deal"" but that is because a lot is happening already on ""an ad hoc level"". Ms Bradley asks if there are any procedural changes the prime minister would like to see to enable more women to make successful careers in Parliament. Mr Johnson says technology has ""definitely been our friend"" during the pandemic. He says it is not for him to dictate, but it is for MPs and the Speaker to see how things can be improved for work and family balances. ""There are still very considerable barriers"" he states, and there are some deterrents that female MPs face, such as ""absolutely appalling"" online trolling. Ms Bradley asks if there are any particular innovations which he'd like to see continue after the pandemic, such as virtual voting. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to commit to any particular change, but he says he's open to different ideas. He says he ""wants the chamber to be full again"" and he wants the public to see where the ""sentiment"" is in Parliament by seeing and hearing how MPs are responding to a debate. He also wants to see MPs be able to ""mingle again in the lobbies,"" ""voting as a communal act, together, has immense benefits,"" he states. Ms Bradley asks her final question, she says the government has to provide time in Parliament to allow MPs to debate changes to how they work. Mr Johnson says this is a ""necessity"" and he has ""no doubt"" that this can be organised. Sir Bernard Jenkin says proxy voting has been beneficial for lots of women who often have caring responsibilities, he asks if the PM has an open mind on such things. Mr Johnson says he wants to see Parliament become more family friendly. Chair of the Commons Procedure Committee Conservative Karen Bradley asks the final set of questions, this time on lifting Covid-19 restrictions in Parliament. She says the House of Commons has been able to operate and sit throughout the whole pandemic, unlike many other parliaments in the world, she states. She asks how the PM thinks Parliament has operated over the past twelve months. Boris Johnson says some professions have been really badly hit by the disease, but he thanks the workers who have managed to make Parliament continue to sit. He says he thinks the public want to see MPs return to their place of work in person. Ms Bradley asks what his view is on social distancing in the Commons chamber. Mr Johnson says he wants to see an approach for the Commons which is adopted everywhere, as he wants Westminster to be like ""every other part of the UK"". Mr Merriman asks how discussions with other international leaders are going - such as talking to President Biden about travel between the UK and US restarting. The PM says leaders ""around the world"" are looking at ""when can get things moving"". But he says there is ""no doubt a growing global consensus for the purposes of aviation that evidence of a vaccination or immunity, that you have had the disease, or have taken a negative test... will be valuable"" for travel. Finally Mr Merriman asks when Brits will feel ready to travel again - and if the PM will be going abroad this summer. Mr Johnson says we should not ""underestimate the natural wanderlust of spiritual inquiry"" of the British people, adding: ""As soon as people feel it is safe, you will see a miraculous change in the mood."" He won't reveal his own holiday destination, but says: ""I think whatever I do, I will be making sure to tell the British public what I think is safe."" Now Huw Merriman gets his turn - he had tried to join the committee earlier via Zoom but had issues with his mute button - something we are all too familiar with. But there is plenty space in the room for him to join in person at a safe distance, so after a suggestion from Boris Johnson he should run across Parliament, he now gets to his questions. The Tory MP asks about international travel and how detailed the announcement on 5 April will be. Boris Johnson says he will have to wait and see but adds: ""We hope we can get people moving again by 17 May.... [but] we will just have to see where we get to, where other countries get to and what the data is telling us."" Mr Knight says it is not enough to say that talks are taking place with the EU on visa fees for performers. He wants ministers to get involved to ""short circuit"" discussions with countries that ""seem to be the most recalcitrant"" such as Italy, Spain and Greece. Mr Johnson says he agrees things ""must get ironed out"". He says it needs to be ""a two way street"" with the EU. On the issue of festivals taking place in the UK this summer, Mr Knight says organisers are nervous because of problems with Covid cancellation insurance. Will the PM get involved to ""back a Covid secure summer of fun rather than condemning us to a summer of none"" he asks? Mr Johnson says the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, has done a ""huge amount of work"" to get the sector ready for reopening. He says he does not want to see people unwilling to take risks when putting on events this year because they are scarred by memories of last year. Glastonbury has already announced it will not go ahead this summer, but will other festivals? Lead singer of The Darkness, Justin Hawkins, told the BBC he ""remains pessimistic"", while some in the industry are calling for government-backed insurance to renew confidence and enable the sector to ""get going again"". This video can not be played Music festivals and Covid: Could some events still go ahead this year? Julian Knight who chairs the Culture Committee jumps the queue because the chair of the Transport Committee is having technical problems. Mr Knight says the culture, media and sport sector is worth a quarter of the UK economy but visa fees to work in the EU mean musicians are performers are suffering. Why has no other sector been allowed to suffer from Brexit, he asks. Mr Johnson says he ""shares the frustration"" and agrees the sector is ""massively important"" and brings billions of tax revenue and employment to the UK. But he says EU restrictions are to blame and the situation is unlike that in ""global Britain"" which welcomes people from around the world. He adds that the government is working ""flat out"" with each individual government but ""some are much better than others"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There was never a simple binary trade-off between the two factors: those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths, also had the biggest hits to the economy and the UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. Read Faisal's full analysis here. Mr Stride says many economists think the spending forecasts in thatOBR report,externalare ""unrealistic"" and there are many more costs expected in the coming years which are not ""baked in to the budget"". There is, for instance, no additional spending outlined for the vaccine or test and trace beyond this summer. He asks if this leaves him feeling ""queasy"" over spending. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to make predictions now about  future spending reviews, but he says he there's no sign in the data that ""at this stage"" the UK will have to ""deviate from our path to freedom"" from lockdown. Mr Stride says there's no money in the forecast to fix and change social care. He asks if the tax burden can be expected not to rise. Mr Johnson says he ""strongly believes in a low-tax government, and I'm a low tax Conservative"". He says as the UK emerges from Covid-19, tax rates will keep the UK ""competitive"". Mr Stride says there will be a situation where tax benefits to corporations will end at the same time as corporation taxes will rise, he asks if this will damage such companies. Mr Johnson lists all of the help available to businesses during the pandemic, which he describes as a ""huge package"" over the past year. Chair of the Treasury committee Conservative MP Mel Stride asks if the spending assumptions from the Office for Budget Responsibility are ""realistic"". Mr Johnson says he thinks the OBR is ""right to think that the public finances are under very considerable pressure as a result of Covid"". Mr Stride asks if the forecast for the next five years from the OBR on government spending is correct. Mr Johnson says ""things are very tough"" and ""spending has been necessarily very extensive"" but the Chancellor's Budget is set to work in the medium term. Mr Stride asks if the PM is happy with the assumption of spending levels over the coming years. Mr Johnson says he wishes ""we weren't in this position"" and had to ""firehose so much money"" following Covid-19. Onto vaccines, Mr Wragg asks whether certificates proving you have had your jab are ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". The PM seems to answer a different question after discussions yesterday about care homes making vaccines mandatory for their staff. He says the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" as doctors already have to have Hepatitis B jabs, adding the idea ""doesn't seem to me to be irresponsible at all, far from it, it is wholly responsible for care home companies to think about requiring vaccinations"". But Mr Wragg asks, what about ""ordinary citizens going to the pub?"" Mr Johnson says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". Pushed further, the PM says other MPs want tougher restrictions, adding: ""I find myself in this long national conversation thinking very deeply about it, and the public have been thinking very deeply. ""They want us as their government and me as prime minister to take all the action I can to protect them."" Mr Wragg then asks about comments made by scientific advisers at the weekend that Brits won't be able to go abroad for their holidays - ""is that the government's policy?"" The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and he will ""set out what I see may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". Asked by Mr Wragg if he finds advisers ""freelancing across the media before decisions have been made"" helpful, the PM says: ""It is one of those things we just have to get used to. It has been a feature of life for quite some time."" But he assures his Tory colleague that advisers advise and ministers decide. The next MP to question the prime minister is Tory William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He asks why the Coronavirus Act - which gives the government emergency powers amid the pandemic - is being extended for six months on Thursday, past the final roadmap step out of lockdown. Boris Johnson says they need the act ""to deal with backlogs we have built up"" - such as allowing remote court hearings or letting NHS volunteers continue to serve. He adds: ""Be in no doubt after 21 June, all the restrictions we have, we hope, will be gone. ""But remember this is a 'not before' date."" Mr Wragg says some provisions in the law ""still haven't been used"" so questions why wont they be dropped. The PM says the government have ""already weeded out quite a few"", adding: ""anything redundant will go."" Yvette Cooper continues her questions and says  20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions. She says everyone understands the importance of hauliers being able to do their job but she wants to know why are they not being tested in the UK. Mr Johnson says the numbers coming in overall from France have ""massively diminished"". It ""was colossal"" the PM admits. He says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel""  and says he ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Ms Cooper says scientists and medics agree that the ""biggest threat to keeping the roadmap on track"" in the UK is the spread of new variants from South Africa and Brazil. Why is the PM not taking action now, she asks, when we know cases have been rising since February? Mr Johnson says that is because there is ""a balance to be struck"". He says it is not clear how the vaccines will work against the new variants and that the government has to balance taking action now against the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Anyone in England who travels abroad without good reasoncould soon be fined Â£5,000, under the coronavirus regulations. It comes amidst growing uncertainty about whether people will be able to take foreign holidays this summer. Holiday travel is not currently allowed - either in the UK or abroad - under lockdown rules. So when can you go on holiday again?Read our guide here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The prime minister has given evidence to a committee of senior MPs Mr Johnson faced questions from the Liaison Committee on the UKâs place in the world, the governmentâs response to the coronavirus pandemic, and the economy. The PM suggested that care home companies would be acting âresponsiblyâ if they required staff to be vaccinated. He also said that people may have to provide proof of vaccination to visit a pub Home Secretary Priti Patel has set out government plans to tighten the rules for asylum seekers staying the UK At PMQs, Boris Johnson said the work of the UK vaccine programme has ""brought hope"" and allowed the UK to set out a cautious roadmap The PM and Keir Starmer clashed on government plans for the armed forces On Tuesday, the PM has told a private meeting of Tory MPs the UK's coronavirus vaccine programme was a success because of ""capitalism"" and ""greed"" A government source said the PM was referring to the profit motive driving companies to develop new products and were not about the row over vaccine supply with the EU Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll end our coverage now on today's proceedings in the Commons. The team on board with you today were Hazel Shearing, Jennifer Scott, Richard Morris, and Sinead Wilson, with Johanna Howitt editing. Parliament goes in to recess for the Easter break after tomorrow's sitting.  So we'll be back with our regular coverage of Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday 14 April. Thanks for following along with us. That was a wide-ranging 90 minutes in front of the committee for Boris Johnson. But here are some of the key points from the session: Reality Check Boris Johnson faced lots of question today on defence spending - in PMQs and in his session with the Liaison Committee. The
prime minister said recent spending pledges were âthe biggest investment in
defence since the Cold War.â Looking
back at figures since 1990 - seen by many as the end of the Cold War, with the
Berlin Wall coming down in November 1989 - it is clear military spending has
fallen considerably. The
proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of
everything produced by the economy in any particular year, was 3.5% in 1990 .
It was 2.1% in 2018/19. The
boostannounced in Novembermeans by
2024-25, defence spending will be Â£7bn a year higher than it would have been
under previous plans. But
with Â£7bn worth about 0.35% of GDP, this extra money is not enough to push
defence spending above the 3.5% of GDP it represented in 1990. The
government has previously phrased this claim differently, though, calling the

"The government appointed an inspector to scrutinise Liverpool City Council in December Government-appointed commissioners will oversee parts of Liverpool City Council following a highly critical report, the local government secretary has said. Robert Jenrick told Parliament inspectors found a ""serious breakdown of governance"" and ""multiple apparent failures"" which meant he had to act. The authority has been under scrutiny since police began investigating building and development contracts. The probe has seenfive men, including then mayor Joe Anderson, arrested. Mr Anderson denies any wrongdoing. Mr Jenrick said the ""Best Value inspection"", commissioned in December, had found ""multiple apparent failures"" and a ""deeply concerning picture of mismanagement"" in some functions at the Labour-run authority. Mr Jenrick said it was only the fifth time a statutory intervention had happened Ina statement to the House of Commons,external, he said: Inspectors had found failures in the planning and regeneration departments, including a ""worrying lack of record-keeping"" and documents ""created retrospectively, discarded in skips or even destroyed"" There had been a lack of scrutiny in the highways department, with dysfunctional management, ""no coherent business plan"" and ""dubious"" contract deals There had been issues in property management that had led to ""a continued failure to correctly value land and assets"", meaning taxpayers had ""frequently lost out"" There was a ""fundamental failure... to understand and appreciate the basic standards governing those in public service"" and ""no established way to hold those falling below those acceptable standards to account"" ""Given the gravity of the inspection findings, I must consider what would happen if the council fails to deliver the necessary changes at the necessary speed,"" he said. Mr Jenrick is proposing to appoint commissioners to run some aspects at the city council for a minimum of three years. He added it was only the fifth time a ""statutory intervention"" had happened, as the move was regarded as a ""last resort"". ""I want to underline the report is not a verdict on all the staff working at Liverpool City Council - in fact, [it] commends the hard work and dedication of many,"" Mr Jenrick said. Liverpool City Council: What does the future hold? Shadow local government secretary Steve Reed said the Labour party accepted the report ""in full"" and would hold a review into what he called ""severe institutional weaknesses"". He welcomed Mr Jenrick's ""measured and appropriate approach"" to the council's problems and said he wanted ""to reassure people in Liverpool that this does not mean government ministers are coming in to run their city directly"". ""This is not, as some would put it, a Tory takeover,"" he added. By Claire Hamilton, BBC Merseyside political reporter The bitter fallout from Robert Jenrick's announcement is only just beginning. From those who see this as a power grab in Labour's reddest city by a party which hasn't won an election at any level here in decades, to those furious that the behaviour described in the report may have been allowed to fester, there's a lot of anger, uncertainty and sadness. It's rare for a government to take action in this way. It's unlikely residents will notice any difference as they go about their daily lives - the bins will still get emptied, the pot holes will still get filled in (although not as quickly as some would like). But behind the scenes, one of the key stipulations is that the elected mayor and council might be unable to spend cash on property transactions without the formal consent of the commissioner, which could have significant ramifications. Another dramatic change is also to come: the proposed shrinking of the council chamber from 90 to just 30 elected councillors, who would all face elections at the same time. In a statement, a Liverpool City Council spokesman said the authority took the report's findings into its highways, regeneration and property management functions ""extremely seriously"" and was committed to addressing ""all the concerns raised"".

"The government appointed an inspector to scrutinise Liverpool City Council in December Government-appointed commissioners will oversee parts of Liverpool City Council following a highly critical report, the local government secretary has said. Robert Jenrick told Parliament inspectors found a ""serious breakdown of governance"" and ""multiple apparent failures"" which meant he had to act. The authority has been under scrutiny since police began investigating building and development contracts. The probe has seenfive men, including then mayor Joe Anderson, arrested. Mr Anderson denies any wrongdoing. Mr Jenrick said the ""Best Value inspection"", commissioned in December, had found ""multiple apparent failures"" and a ""deeply concerning picture of mismanagement"" in some functions at the Labour-run authority. Mr Jenrick said it was only the fifth time a statutory intervention had happened Ina statement to the House of Commons,external, he said: Inspectors had found failures in the planning and regeneration departments, including a ""worrying lack of record-keeping"" and documents ""created retrospectively, discarded in skips or even destroyed"" There had been a lack of scrutiny in the highways department, with dysfunctional management, ""no coherent business plan"" and ""dubious"" contract deals There had been issues in property management that had led to ""a continued failure to correctly value land and assets"", meaning taxpayers had ""frequently lost out"" There was a ""fundamental failure... to understand and appreciate the basic standards governing those in public service"" and ""no established way to hold those falling below those acceptable standards to account"" ""Given the gravity of the inspection findings, I must consider what would happen if the council fails to deliver the necessary changes at the necessary speed,"" he said. Mr Jenrick is proposing to appoint commissioners to run some aspects at the city council for a minimum of three years. He added it was only the fifth time a ""statutory intervention"" had happened, as the move was regarded as a ""last resort"". ""I want to underline the report is not a verdict on all the staff working at Liverpool City Council - in fact, [it] commends the hard work and dedication of many,"" Mr Jenrick said. Liverpool City Council: What does the future hold? Shadow local government secretary Steve Reed said the Labour party accepted the report ""in full"" and would hold a review into what he called ""severe institutional weaknesses"". He welcomed Mr Jenrick's ""measured and appropriate approach"" to the council's problems and said he wanted ""to reassure people in Liverpool that this does not mean government ministers are coming in to run their city directly"". ""This is not, as some would put it, a Tory takeover,"" he added. By Claire Hamilton, BBC Merseyside political reporter The bitter fallout from Robert Jenrick's announcement is only just beginning. From those who see this as a power grab in Labour's reddest city by a party which hasn't won an election at any level here in decades, to those furious that the behaviour described in the report may have been allowed to fester, there's a lot of anger, uncertainty and sadness. It's rare for a government to take action in this way. It's unlikely residents will notice any difference as they go about their daily lives - the bins will still get emptied, the pot holes will still get filled in (although not as quickly as some would like). But behind the scenes, one of the key stipulations is that the elected mayor and council might be unable to spend cash on property transactions without the formal consent of the commissioner, which could have significant ramifications.

"The prime minister has given evidence to a committee of senior MPs Mr Johnson faced questions from the Liaison Committee on the UKâs place in the world, the governmentâs response to the coronavirus pandemic, and the economy. The PM suggested that care home companies would be acting âresponsiblyâ if they required staff to be vaccinated. He also said that people may have to provide proof of vaccination to visit a pub Home Secretary Priti Patel has set out government plans to tighten the rules for asylum seekers staying the UK At PMQs, Boris Johnson said the work of the UK vaccine programme has ""brought hope"" and allowed the UK to set out a cautious roadmap The PM and Keir Starmer clashed on government plans for the armed forces On Tuesday, the PM has told a private meeting of Tory MPs the UK's coronavirus vaccine programme was a success because of ""capitalism"" and ""greed"" A government source said the PM was referring to the profit motive driving companies to develop new products and were not about the row over vaccine supply with the EU Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll end our coverage now on today's proceedings in the Commons. The team on board with you today were Hazel Shearing, Jennifer Scott, Richard Morris, and Sinead Wilson, with Johanna Howitt editing. Parliament goes in to recess for the Easter break after tomorrow's sitting.  So we'll be back with our regular coverage of Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday 14 April. Thanks for following along with us. That was a wide-ranging 90 minutes in front of the committee for Boris Johnson. But here are some of the key points from the session: Reality Check Boris Johnson faced lots of question today on defence spending - in PMQs and in his session with the Liaison Committee. The
prime minister said recent spending pledges were âthe biggest investment in
defence since the Cold War.â Looking
back at figures since 1990 - seen by many as the end of the Cold War, with the
Berlin Wall coming down in November 1989 - it is clear military spending has
fallen considerably. The
proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of
everything produced by the economy in any particular year, was 3.5% in 1990 .
It was 2.1% in 2018/19. The
boostannounced in Novembermeans by
2024-25, defence spending will be Â£7bn a year higher than it would have been
under previous plans. But
with Â£7bn worth about 0.35% of GDP, this extra money is not enough to push
defence spending above the 3.5% of GDP it represented in 1990. The
government has previously phrased this claim differently, though, calling the
boost that will see defence spending rise by Â£7bn a year by 2024-25, the
""biggest sustained increase in 30 years"". And
as defence spending has not increased for more than three years in a row since
1990, this will probably turn out to be true. Read more here.  Bernard Jenkin thanks the prime minister for the time he has given to the committee, and he closes the session in the tradition of parliamentary proceedings: ""Order, order"". And that's it. We'll bring you a quick summary of the key points next.... Before the chair of the Liaison Committee, Bernard Jenkin, brings the session to a close he returns to questions about the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. He says he is concerned that ""it doesn't look like the same consuming priority as other policies"". Can the PM do more to secure the agreement of all those countries due to attend? Mr Johnson says he is ""engaged in some kind of COP conversation virtually every day"". He says it is a ""big cross-government effort"" to get ready for it.  It is led by Alok Sharma, he says, but everyone is ""gripping it across Whitehall"". Mr Jenkin asks how often the Climate Action Strategy Committee is meeting in preparation? Mr Johnson says ""to be frank"" it has ""not met a great deal"" but that is because a lot is happening already on ""an ad hoc level"". Ms Bradley asks if there are any procedural changes the prime minister would like to see to enable more women to make successful careers in Parliament. Mr Johnson says technology has ""definitely been our friend"" during the pandemic. He says it is not for him to dictate, but it is for MPs and the Speaker to see how things can be improved for work and family balances. ""There are still very considerable barriers"" he states, and there are some deterrents that female MPs face, such as ""absolutely appalling"" online trolling. Ms Bradley asks if there are any particular innovations which he'd like to see continue after the pandemic, such as virtual voting. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to commit to any particular change, but he says he's open to different ideas. He says he ""wants the chamber to be full again"" and he wants the public to see where the ""sentiment"" is in Parliament by seeing and hearing how MPs are responding to a debate. He also wants to see MPs be able to ""mingle again in the lobbies,"" ""voting as a communal act, together, has immense benefits,"" he states. Ms Bradley asks her final question, she says the government has to provide time in Parliament to allow MPs to debate changes to how they work. Mr Johnson says this is a ""necessity"" and he has ""no doubt"" that this can be organised. Sir Bernard Jenkin says proxy voting has been beneficial for lots of women who often have caring responsibilities, he asks if the PM has an open mind on such things. Mr Johnson says he wants to see Parliament become more family friendly. Chair of the Commons Procedure Committee Conservative Karen Bradley asks the final set of questions, this time on lifting Covid-19 restrictions in Parliament. She says the House of Commons has been able to operate and sit throughout the whole pandemic, unlike many other parliaments in the world, she states. She asks how the PM thinks Parliament has operated over the past twelve months. Boris Johnson says some professions have been really badly hit by the disease, but he thanks the workers who have managed to make Parliament continue to sit. He says he thinks the public want to see MPs return to their place of work in person. Ms Bradley asks what his view is on social distancing in the Commons chamber. Mr Johnson says he wants to see an approach for the Commons which is adopted everywhere, as he wants Westminster to be like ""every other part of the UK"". Mr Merriman asks how discussions with other international leaders are going - such as talking to President Biden about travel between the UK and US restarting. The PM says leaders ""around the world"" are looking at ""when can get things moving"". But he says there is ""no doubt a growing global consensus for the purposes of aviation that evidence of a vaccination or immunity, that you have had the disease, or have taken a negative test... will be valuable"" for travel. Finally Mr Merriman asks when Brits will feel ready to travel again - and if the PM will be going abroad this summer. Mr Johnson says we should not ""underestimate the natural wanderlust of spiritual inquiry"" of the British people, adding: ""As soon as people feel it is safe, you will see a miraculous change in the mood."" He won't reveal his own holiday destination, but says: ""I think whatever I do, I will be making sure to tell the British public what I think is safe."" Now Huw Merriman gets his turn - he had tried to join the committee earlier via Zoom but had issues with his mute button - something we are all too familiar with. But there is plenty space in the room for him to join in person at a safe distance, so after a suggestion from Boris Johnson he should run across Parliament, he now gets to his questions. The Tory MP asks about international travel and how detailed the announcement on 5 April will be. Boris Johnson says he will have to wait and see but adds: ""We hope we can get people moving again by 17 May.... [but] we will just have to see where we get to, where other countries get to and what the data is telling us."" Mr Knight says it is not enough to say that talks are taking place with the EU on visa fees for performers. He wants ministers to get involved to ""short circuit"" discussions with countries that ""seem to be the most recalcitrant"" such as Italy, Spain and Greece. Mr Johnson says he agrees things ""must get ironed out"". He says it needs to be ""a two way street"" with the EU. On the issue of festivals taking place in the UK this summer, Mr Knight says organisers are nervous because of problems with Covid cancellation insurance. Will the PM get involved to ""back a Covid secure summer of fun rather than condemning us to a summer of none"" he asks? Mr Johnson says the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, has done a ""huge amount of work"" to get the sector ready for reopening. He says he does not want to see people unwilling to take risks when putting on events this year because they are scarred by memories of last year. Glastonbury has already announced it will not go ahead this summer, but will other festivals? Lead singer of The Darkness, Justin Hawkins, told the BBC he ""remains pessimistic"", while some in the industry are calling for government-backed insurance to renew confidence and enable the sector to ""get going again"". This video can not be played Music festivals and Covid: Could some events still go ahead this year? Julian Knight who chairs the Culture Committee jumps the queue because the chair of the Transport Committee is having technical problems. Mr Knight says the culture, media and sport sector is worth a quarter of the UK economy but visa fees to work in the EU mean musicians are performers are suffering. Why has no other sector been allowed to suffer from Brexit, he asks. Mr Johnson says he ""shares the frustration"" and agrees the sector is ""massively important"" and brings billions of tax revenue and employment to the UK. But he says EU restrictions are to blame and the situation is unlike that in ""global Britain"" which welcomes people from around the world. He adds that the government is working ""flat out"" with each individual government but ""some are much better than others"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There was never a simple binary trade-off between the two factors: those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths, also had the biggest hits to the economy and the UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. Read Faisal's full analysis here. Mr Stride says many economists think the spending forecasts in thatOBR report,externalare ""unrealistic"" and there are many more costs expected in the coming years which are not ""baked in to the budget"". There is, for instance, no additional spending outlined for the vaccine or test and trace beyond this summer. He asks if this leaves him feeling ""queasy"" over spending. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to make predictions now about  future spending reviews, but he says he there's no sign in the data that ""at this stage"" the UK will have to ""deviate from our path to freedom"" from lockdown. Mr Stride says there's no money in the forecast to fix and change social care. He asks if the tax burden can be expected not to rise. Mr Johnson says he ""strongly believes in a low-tax government, and I'm a low tax Conservative"". He says as the UK emerges from Covid-19, tax rates will keep the UK ""competitive"". Mr Stride says there will be a situation where tax benefits to corporations will end at the same time as corporation taxes will rise, he asks if this will damage such companies. Mr Johnson lists all of the help available to businesses during the pandemic, which he describes as a ""huge package"" over the past year. Chair of the Treasury committee Conservative MP Mel Stride asks if the spending assumptions from the Office for Budget Responsibility are ""realistic"". Mr Johnson says he thinks the OBR is ""right to think that the public finances are under very considerable pressure as a result of Covid"". Mr Stride asks if the forecast for the next five years from the OBR on government spending is correct. Mr Johnson says ""things are very tough"" and ""spending has been necessarily very extensive"" but the Chancellor's Budget is set to work in the medium term. Mr Stride asks if the PM is happy with the assumption of spending levels over the coming years. Mr Johnson says he wishes ""we weren't in this position"" and had to ""firehose so much money"" following Covid-19. Onto vaccines, Mr Wragg asks whether certificates proving you have had your jab are ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". The PM seems to answer a different question after discussions yesterday about care homes making vaccines mandatory for their staff. He says the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" as doctors already have to have Hepatitis B jabs, adding the idea ""doesn't seem to me to be irresponsible at all, far from it, it is wholly responsible for care home companies to think about requiring vaccinations"". But Mr Wragg asks, what about ""ordinary citizens going to the pub?"" Mr Johnson says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". Pushed further, the PM says other MPs want tougher restrictions, adding: ""I find myself in this long national conversation thinking very deeply about it, and the public have been thinking very deeply. ""They want us as their government and me as prime minister to take all the action I can to protect them."" Mr Wragg then asks about comments made by scientific advisers at the weekend that Brits won't be able to go abroad for their holidays - ""is that the government's policy?"" The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and he will ""set out what I see may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". Asked by Mr Wragg if he finds advisers ""freelancing across the media before decisions have been made"" helpful, the PM says: ""It is one of those things we just have to get used to. It has been a feature of life for quite some time."" But he assures his Tory colleague that advisers advise and ministers decide. The next MP to question the prime minister is Tory William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He asks why the Coronavirus Act - which gives the government emergency powers amid the pandemic - is being extended for six months on Thursday, past the final roadmap step out of lockdown. Boris Johnson says they need the act ""to deal with backlogs we have built up"" - such as allowing remote court hearings or letting NHS volunteers continue to serve. He adds: ""Be in no doubt after 21 June, all the restrictions we have, we hope, will be gone. ""But remember this is a 'not before' date."" Mr Wragg says some provisions in the law ""still haven't been used"" so questions why wont they be dropped. The PM says the government have ""already weeded out quite a few"", adding: ""anything redundant will go."" Yvette Cooper continues her questions and says  20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions. She says everyone understands the importance of hauliers being able to do their job but she wants to know why are they not being tested in the UK. Mr Johnson says the numbers coming in overall from France have ""massively diminished"". It ""was colossal"" the PM admits. He says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel""  and says he ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Ms Cooper says scientists and medics agree that the ""biggest threat to keeping the roadmap on track"" in the UK is the spread of new variants from South Africa and Brazil. Why is the PM not taking action now, she asks, when we know cases have been rising since February? Mr Johnson says that is because there is ""a balance to be struck"". He says it is not clear how the vaccines will work against the new variants and that the government has to balance taking action now against the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Anyone in England who travels abroad without good reasoncould soon be fined Â£5,000, under the coronavirus regulations. It comes amidst growing uncertainty about whether people will be able to take foreign holidays this summer. Holiday travel is not currently allowed - either in the UK or abroad - under lockdown rules. So when can you go on holiday again?Read our guide here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Before the chair of the Liaison Committee, Bernard Jenkin, brings the session to a close he returns to questions about the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. He says he is concerned that ""it doesn't look like the same consuming priority as other policies"". Can the PM do more to secure the agreement of all those countries due to attend? Mr Johnson says he is ""engaged in some kind of COP conversation virtually every day"". He says it is a ""big cross-government effort"" to get ready for it.  It is led by Alok Sharma, he says, but everyone is ""gripping it across Whitehall"". Mr Jenkin asks how often the Climate Action Strategy Committee is meeting in preparation? Mr Johnson says ""to be frank"" it has ""not met a great deal"" but that is because a lot is happening already on ""an ad hoc level"". Ms Bradley asks if there are any procedural changes the prime minister would like to see to enable more women to make successful careers in Parliament. Mr Johnson says technology has ""definitely been our friend"" during the pandemic. He says it is not for him to dictate, but it is for MPs and the Speaker to see how things can be improved for work and family balances. ""There are still very considerable barriers"" he states, and there are some deterrents that female MPs face, such as ""absolutely appalling"" online trolling. Ms Bradley asks if there are any particular innovations which he'd like to see continue after the pandemic, such as virtual voting. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to commit to any particular change, but he says he's open to different ideas. He says he ""wants the chamber to be full again"" and he wants the public to see where the ""sentiment"" is in Parliament by seeing and hearing how MPs are responding to a debate. He also wants to see MPs be able to ""mingle again in the lobbies,"" ""voting as a communal act, together, has immense benefits,"" he states. Ms Bradley asks her final question, she says the government has to provide time in Parliament to allow MPs to debate changes to how they work. Mr Johnson says this is a ""necessity"" and he has ""no doubt"" that this can be organised. Sir Bernard Jenkin says proxy voting has been beneficial for lots of women who often have caring responsibilities, he asks if the PM has an open mind on such things. Mr Johnson says he wants to see Parliament become more family friendly. Chair of the Commons Procedure Committee Conservative Karen Bradley asks the final set of questions, this time on lifting Covid-19 restrictions in Parliament. She says the House of Commons has been able to operate and sit throughout the whole pandemic, unlike many other parliaments in the world, she states. She asks how the PM thinks Parliament has operated over the past twelve months. Boris Johnson says some professions have been really badly hit by the disease, but he thanks the workers who have managed to make Parliament continue to sit. He says he thinks the public want to see MPs return to their place of work in person. Ms Bradley asks what his view is on social distancing in the Commons chamber. Mr Johnson says he wants to see an approach for the Commons which is adopted everywhere, as he wants Westminster to be like ""every other part of the UK"". Mr Merriman asks how discussions with other international leaders are going - such as talking to President Biden about travel between the UK and US restarting. The PM says leaders ""around the world"" are looking at ""when can get things moving"". But he says there is ""no doubt a growing global consensus for the purposes of aviation that evidence of a vaccination or immunity, that you have had the disease, or have taken a negative test... will be valuable"" for travel. Finally Mr Merriman asks when Brits will feel ready to travel again - and if the PM will be going abroad this summer. Mr Johnson says we should not ""underestimate the natural wanderlust of spiritual inquiry"" of the British people, adding: ""As soon as people feel it is safe, you will see a miraculous change in the mood."" He won't reveal his own holiday destination, but says: ""I think whatever I do, I will be making sure to tell the British public what I think is safe."" Now Huw Merriman gets his turn - he had tried to join the committee earlier via Zoom but had issues with his mute button - something we are all too familiar with. But there is plenty space in the room for him to join in person at a safe distance, so after a suggestion from Boris Johnson he should run across Parliament, he now gets to his questions. The Tory MP asks about international travel and how detailed the announcement on 5 April will be. Boris Johnson says he will have to wait and see but adds: ""We hope we can get people moving again by 17 May.... [but] we will just have to see where we get to, where other countries get to and what the data is telling us."" Mr Knight says it is not enough to say that talks are taking place with the EU on visa fees for performers. He wants ministers to get involved to ""short circuit"" discussions with countries that ""seem to be the most recalcitrant"" such as Italy, Spain and Greece. Mr Johnson says he agrees things ""must get ironed out"". He says it needs to be ""a two way street"" with the EU. On the issue of festivals taking place in the UK this summer, Mr Knight says organisers are nervous because of problems with Covid cancellation insurance. Will the PM get involved to ""back a Covid secure summer of fun rather than condemning us to a summer of none"" he asks? Mr Johnson says the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, has done a ""huge amount of work"" to get the sector ready for reopening. He says he does not want to see people unwilling to take risks when putting on events this year because they are scarred by memories of last year. Glastonbury has already announced it will not go ahead this summer, but will other festivals? Lead singer of The Darkness, Justin Hawkins, told the BBC he ""remains pessimistic"", while some in the industry are calling for government-backed insurance to renew confidence and enable the sector to ""get going again"". This video can not be played Music festivals and Covid: Could some events still go ahead this year? Julian Knight who chairs the Culture Committee jumps the queue because the chair of the Transport Committee is having technical problems. Mr Knight says the culture, media and sport sector is worth a quarter of the UK economy but visa fees to work in the EU mean musicians are performers are suffering. Why has no other sector been allowed to suffer from Brexit, he asks. Mr Johnson says he ""shares the frustration"" and agrees the sector is ""massively important"" and brings billions of tax revenue and employment to the UK. But he says EU restrictions are to blame and the situation is unlike that in ""global Britain"" which welcomes people from around the world. He adds that the government is working ""flat out"" with each individual government but ""some are much better than others"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There was never a simple binary trade-off between the two factors: those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths, also had the biggest hits to the economy and the UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. Read Faisal's full analysis here. Mr Stride says many economists think the spending forecasts in thatOBR report,externalare ""unrealistic"" and there are many more costs expected in the coming years which are not ""baked in to the budget"". There is, for instance, no additional spending outlined for the vaccine or test and trace beyond this summer. He asks if this leaves him feeling ""queasy"" over spending. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to make predictions now about  future spending reviews, but he says he there's no sign in the data that ""at this stage"" the UK will have to ""deviate from our path to freedom"" from lockdown. Mr Stride says there's no money in the forecast to fix and change social care. He asks if the tax burden can be expected not to rise. Mr Johnson says he ""strongly believes in a low-tax government, and I'm a low tax Conservative"". He says as the UK emerges from Covid-19, tax rates will keep the UK ""competitive"". Mr Stride says there will be a situation where tax benefits to corporations will end at the same time as corporation taxes will rise, he asks if this will damage such companies. Mr Johnson lists all of the help available to businesses during the pandemic, which he describes as a ""huge package"" over the past year. Chair of the Treasury committee Conservative MP Mel Stride asks if the spending assumptions from the Office for Budget Responsibility are ""realistic"". Mr Johnson says he thinks the OBR is ""right to think that the public finances are under very considerable pressure as a result of Covid"". Mr Stride asks if the forecast for the next five years from the OBR on government spending is correct. Mr Johnson says ""things are very tough"" and ""spending has been necessarily very extensive"" but the Chancellor's Budget is set to work in the medium term. Mr Stride asks if the PM is happy with the assumption of spending levels over the coming years. Mr Johnson says he wishes ""we weren't in this position"" and had to ""firehose so much money"" following Covid-19. Onto vaccines, Mr Wragg asks whether certificates proving you have had your jab are ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". The PM seems to answer a different question after discussions yesterday about care homes making vaccines mandatory for their staff. He says the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" as doctors already have to have Hepatitis B jabs, adding the idea ""doesn't seem to me to be irresponsible at all, far from it, it is wholly responsible for care home companies to think about requiring vaccinations"". But Mr Wragg asks, what about ""ordinary citizens going to the pub?"" Mr Johnson says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". Pushed further, the PM says other MPs want tougher restrictions, adding: ""I find myself in this long national conversation thinking very deeply about it, and the public have been thinking very deeply. ""They want us as their government and me as prime minister to take all the action I can to protect them."" Mr Wragg then asks about comments made by scientific advisers at the weekend that Brits won't be able to go abroad for their holidays - ""is that the government's policy?"" The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and he will ""set out what I see may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". Asked by Mr Wragg if he finds advisers ""freelancing across the media before decisions have been made"" helpful, the PM says: ""It is one of those things we just have to get used to. It has been a feature of life for quite some time."" But he assures his Tory colleague that advisers advise and ministers decide. The next MP to question the prime minister is Tory William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He asks why the Coronavirus Act - which gives the government emergency powers amid the pandemic - is being extended for six months on Thursday, past the final roadmap step out of lockdown. Boris Johnson says they need the act ""to deal with backlogs we have built up"" - such as allowing remote court hearings or letting NHS volunteers continue to serve. He adds: ""Be in no doubt after 21 June, all the restrictions we have, we hope, will be gone. ""But remember this is a 'not before' date."" Mr Wragg says some provisions in the law ""still haven't been used"" so questions why wont they be dropped. The PM says the government have ""already weeded out quite a few"", adding: ""anything redundant will go."" Yvette Cooper continues her questions and says  20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions. She says everyone understands the importance of hauliers being able to do their job but she wants to know why are they not being tested in the UK. Mr Johnson says the numbers coming in overall from France have ""massively diminished"". It ""was colossal"" the PM admits. He says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel""  and says he ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Ms Cooper says scientists and medics agree that the ""biggest threat to keeping the roadmap on track"" in the UK is the spread of new variants from South Africa and Brazil. Why is the PM not taking action now, she asks, when we know cases have been rising since February? Mr Johnson says that is because there is ""a balance to be struck"". He says it is not clear how the vaccines will work against the new variants and that the government has to balance taking action now against the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Anyone in England who travels abroad without good reasoncould soon be fined Â£5,000, under the coronavirus regulations. It comes amidst growing uncertainty about whether people will be able to take foreign holidays this summer. Holiday travel is not currently allowed - either in the UK or abroad - under lockdown rules. So when can you go on holiday again?Read our guide here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The prime minister has given evidence to a committee of senior MPs Mr Johnson faced questions from the Liaison Committee on the UKâs place in the world, the governmentâs response to the coronavirus pandemic, and the economy. The PM suggested that care home companies would be acting âresponsiblyâ if they required staff to be vaccinated. He also said that people may have to provide proof of vaccination to visit a pub Home Secretary Priti Patel has set out government plans to tighten the rules for asylum seekers staying the UK At PMQs, Boris Johnson said the work of the UK vaccine programme has ""brought hope"" and allowed the UK to set out a cautious roadmap The PM and Keir Starmer clashed on government plans for the armed forces On Tuesday, the PM has told a private meeting of Tory MPs the UK's coronavirus vaccine programme was a success because of ""capitalism"" and ""greed"" A government source said the PM was referring to the profit motive driving companies to develop new products and were not about the row over vaccine supply with the EU Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll end our coverage now on today's proceedings in the Commons. The team on board with you today were Hazel Shearing, Jennifer Scott, Richard Morris, and Sinead Wilson, with Johanna Howitt editing. Parliament goes in to recess for the Easter break after tomorrow's sitting.  So we'll be back with our regular coverage of Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday 14 April. Thanks for following along with us. That was a wide-ranging 90 minutes in front of the committee for Boris Johnson. But here are some of the key points from the session: Reality Check Boris Johnson faced lots of question today on defence spending - in PMQs and in his session with the Liaison Committee. The
prime minister said recent spending pledges were âthe biggest investment in
defence since the Cold War.â Looking
back at figures since 1990 - seen by many as the end of the Cold War, with the
Berlin Wall coming down in November 1989 - it is clear military spending has
fallen considerably. The
proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of
everything produced by the economy in any particular year, was 3.5% in 1990 .
It was 2.1% in 2018/19. The
boostannounced in Novembermeans by
2024-25, defence spending will be Â£7bn a year higher than it would have been
under previous plans. But
with Â£7bn worth about 0.35% of GDP, this extra money is not enough to push
defence spending above the 3.5% of GDP it represented in 1990. The
government has previously phrased this claim differently, though, calling the
boost that will see defence spending rise by Â£7bn a year by 2024-25, the
""biggest sustained increase in 30 years"". And
as defence spending has not increased for more than three years in a row since
1990, this will probably turn out to be true. Read more here.

"This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel says the new rules are based on the principle of fairness The home secretary has set out what she has called a ""fair but firm"" overhaul to the way people applying for asylum in the UK are treated. Priti Patel said, for the first time, people seeking protection as refugees would have their claim assessed based on how they arrive in the UK. She said ministers would crack down on people smugglers because ""enough is enough"". Labour said the plans lacked compassion and competence. Under the changes, people who arrive in the UK by what the government call illegal means to claim asylum will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive through proper channels. There were35,099 asylum claims,externalmade in the UK during the year ending March 2020, with Iran, Albania and Iraq providing the most applicants. More than 8,000 people crossed the Channel in small boats, with the help of people smugglers. What happens to migrants who reach the UK? UK to consider sending asylum seekers abroad Asylum seekers could be processed on old ferries Setting out the plans to MPs, Ms Patel said the government would introduce a ""faster and fairer"" system that would ""better support the most vulnerable"". Ms Patel said ""serious organised criminal gangs"" were exploiting people trying to get to the UK, and that it was these same gangs who were also involved in ""serious violent crimes"" in the UK such as trafficking guns and drugs. ""Families and young children have lost their lives at sea, in lorries and in shipping containers having put their trust in the hands of criminals,"" she added. ""The way to stop these deaths is to stop the trade in people that causes them."" She said the new measures will create ""safe and legal routes"", and that people should be claiming asylum in the EU country in which they first arrive, rather than using it as a springboard to reach the UK. ""If you illegally enter the UK via a safe country in which you could have claimed asylum, you are not seeking refuge from imminent peril, as is the intended purpose of the asylum system, but are picking the UK as a preferred destination over others,"" she said. This video can not be played Labour's shadow home secretary says the asylum plans are ""lacking in compassion"" She said the system was currently ""clogged up"" with bogus claims and legal wrangles. But human rights lawyers have warned the plans are unlawful because they ignore Britain's international obligations under the Refugee Convention. Labour said the proposals would do ""next to nothing to stop people making dangerous crossings"" or to deal with criminal gangs. There are two enormous legal elephants trumpeting away in the shiny glass atrium of the Home Office that are casting some really significant doubts on whether the home secretary's plan is deliverable. Firstly, can she treat some refugees who have a recognised case for protection differently from others, purely based on how they reached the UK? Under the UN Refugee Convention (which, history fans, the UK government helped write in 1951) states can't penalise people in need who come ""directly"" from their homeland - or anyone who has ""good cause"" to enter a nation illegally. Official sources say Ms Patel's restrictions would be legally possible because asylum seekers are not allowed to go ""shopping"" for the best destination. But even if the restrictions are introduced, and the Home Office wants to send people back to France or elsewhere, how is that going to happen? The UK has no legal agreement with EU nations to take these people back. And that's because we chose to leave it as part of Brexit. The BBC has learnt that the Home Office has not sent any failed asylum seekers back to EU states since the end of the Brexit transition three months ago. The home secretary's plans for asylum rely on striking agreements with other safe countries who would be willing to take people who have passed through their territory on the way to the UK. Many people smugglers send asylum seekers across the Channel in dangerously small boats Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told MPs the changes proposed by the government ""risk making the situation even worse for victims of human trafficking as it would make seeking help in the UK even harder"". ""The government policy is defined by a lack of compassion and a lack of competence, the plans risk baking in to the UK system the callousness of this government's approach,"" he said. Responding to Ms Patel's pledges, Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon accused the government of ""seeking to unjustly differentiate between the deserving and undeserving refugee"" by giving protection ""based on how they travel to the UK"". Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said it was ""slightly misleading to say people have a choice between the legal and illegal route"" adding ""for many people the clandestine means will be their only way to get to the UK"". She also said there would be ""complex issues"" about whether other countries would be willing to take back asylum seekers deemed to have arrived in the UK via irregular routes. Asked if any EU states had agreed to take people back, Ms Patel replied that she was currently in discussions with those countries. There was support from Conservative MPs in the Commons, including West Bromwich MP Shaun Bailey who said: ""Just like my constituents, I'm angry at the images that we're seeing of small boats coming into the Channel and the sky-rocketing costs of our asylum system. ""The broader issue here is this: our European neighbours need to step up. It's as simple as that."" This video can not be played 'Nobody chooses persecution' - criticism of asylum changes from an asylum seeker The Home Office said that ""for the first time"" the question of whether asylum seekers enter the UK via another ""safe"" country, such as France would ""have an impact"" on how it dealt with claims. The government would seek the ""rapid removal from the UK"" of rejected applicants, with appeals ""reformed to speed up"" the process, it added. But asylum seekers fleeing persecution or violence and coming to the UK via the ""legal resettlement"" route from countries such as Syria and Iran would straight away get permission to remain in the UK indefinitely, the Home Office said. Under the new plans, anyone who pays criminal gangs to bring them to the UK would only ever receive temporary permission to remain and would be regularly assessed for removal from the UK. Other proposals include bringing in ""rigorous"" age checks to stop adults entering the country by pretending to be children. The use of hotels to accommodate arrivals will end and the government will bring forward plans to expand the ""asylum estate"". Ms Patel said asylum applicants with criminal records who returned to the UK after being deported would receive a jail sentence of up to five years. The current maximum is six months. And people smugglers - responsible for shipping many of the 8,500 people who crossed the English Channel in small boats last year - could get life sentences.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer challenges Boris Johnson on previous commitments on Army numbers Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the prime minister for ""breaking a promise"" not to cut British Army troops. During Prime Minister's Questions, the Labour leader quoted Boris Johnson from the 2019 election campaign, where he pledged to maintain the Army's size. But Sir Keir saidthis week's defence reviewwould now see numbers fall by 10,000 as part of government plans. Mr Johnson said the government was increasing spending on defence ""by the biggest amount since the Cold War"". Defence Secretary Ben Wallace confirmed on Monday that the size of the Army will be reduced to 72,500 soldiers by 2025 as part of a major overhaul of the Armed Services. He said a move towards drones and cyber warfare would mean an ""increased deployability and technological advantage"" for the UK, and see a greater effect delivered by fewer people. But the SNP said the reduction in troop numbers ""undermines our Armed forces"" and sees the Tories ""break their election commitment"". British army to be cut to 72,500 troops by 2025 Defence reforms 'will help make UK match-fit' Ageing equipment puts Army at risk, MPs warn The 2019 Conservative manifesto itself does not mention troop numbers, but pledges to ""continue to exceed the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence and increase the budget by at least 0.5% above inflation every year of the new Parliament"". However, during the manifesto launch in the general election campaign,Mr Johnson said that his party would ""not be cutting our Armed Services in any form"" if they won the vote. Sir Keir began PMQs by asking him why he made the promise. Mr Johnson said: ""That was because what we were going to do was actually increase spending on our Armed Services by the biggest amount since the Cold War - Â£24bn modernising our Armed Forces with no redundancies, keeping our Army at 100,000 if you include the reserves."" But Sir Keir said the defence secretary had been ""absolutely clear"" in his statement this week that numbers would fall, adding: ""Only this prime minister could suggest that a reduction from 82,000 to 72,000 is somehow not a cut."" Mr Johnson insisted his government had ""kept our promise"" and attacked members of Labour's frontbench for their position on renewing the UK's nuclear deterrent. He added: ""There will be no redundancies, and if you include reserves, we are even keeping the Army at 100,000. ""But on top of that we are doing what is needed to modernise our Armed Forces, taking them into the 21st century. ""We are doing all the difficult things Labour shirked during their time in office."" Sir Keir accused him of ""playing with the numbers"", adding: ""You just cant trust the Conservatives to protect our Armed Forces."" And responding to the PM's accusation that Labour had been ""consistently weak on protecting this country"", the Labour leader said: ""What's weaker is making a promise to our Armed Forces just before the election, then breaking it and not being prepared to admit it - not having the courage to admit it."" He called on Mr Johnson to put his defence policy to a vote in the Commons. In response, Mr Johnson said the Tories were ""pro-vax, low tax and when it comes to defence, we've got your backs"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer raised Monday's announcement of a reduction to the size of the Army, saying Boris Johnson had promised at the last election not to cut the armed forces ""in any form"". He's right. In November 2019, at the launch of the Conservative manifesto - when answering questions after his speech - Mr Johnson said: ""We will not be cutting our armed services in any form - we will be maintaining the size of our armed services."" This wasreported by several papers, including The Sun, which also included the video of Mr Johnson saying it,external. But that promise wasn't in the 2019 Conservative manifesto. On Monday, the Defence SecretaryBen Wallace announcedthat: ""I have therefore taken the decision to reduce the size of the Army from today's current strength of 76,500 trained personnel to 72,500 by 2025"". In his reply to Sir Keir, the prime minister spoke of increased defence spending. There was a pledge in the 2019 manifesto to ""increase the [defence] budget by at least 0.5% above inflation every year of the new Parliament"". The spending plan for the Ministry of Defence announced last November will achieve that on average until 2025, based on inflation forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility.

"The prime minister has given evidence to a committee of senior MPs Mr Johnson faced questions from the Liaison Committee on the UKâs place in the world, the governmentâs response to the coronavirus pandemic, and the economy. The PM suggested that care home companies would be acting âresponsiblyâ if they required staff to be vaccinated. He also said that people may have to provide proof of vaccination to visit a pub Home Secretary Priti Patel has set out government plans to tighten the rules for asylum seekers staying the UK At PMQs, Boris Johnson said the work of the UK vaccine programme has ""brought hope"" and allowed the UK to set out a cautious roadmap The PM and Keir Starmer clashed on government plans for the armed forces On Tuesday, the PM has told a private meeting of Tory MPs the UK's coronavirus vaccine programme was a success because of ""capitalism"" and ""greed"" A government source said the PM was referring to the profit motive driving companies to develop new products and were not about the row over vaccine supply with the EU Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll end our coverage now on today's proceedings in the Commons. The team on board with you today were Hazel Shearing, Jennifer Scott, Richard Morris, and Sinead Wilson, with Johanna Howitt editing. Parliament goes in to recess for the Easter break after tomorrow's sitting.  So we'll be back with our regular coverage of Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday 14 April. Thanks for following along with us. That was a wide-ranging 90 minutes in front of the committee for Boris Johnson. But here are some of the key points from the session: Reality Check Boris Johnson faced lots of question today on defence spending - in PMQs and in his session with the Liaison Committee. The
prime minister said recent spending pledges were âthe biggest investment in
defence since the Cold War.â Looking
back at figures since 1990 - seen by many as the end of the Cold War, with the
Berlin Wall coming down in November 1989 - it is clear military spending has
fallen considerably. The
proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of
everything produced by the economy in any particular year, was 3.5% in 1990 .
It was 2.1% in 2018/19. The
boostannounced in Novembermeans by
2024-25, defence spending will be Â£7bn a year higher than it would have been
under previous plans. But
with Â£7bn worth about 0.35% of GDP, this extra money is not enough to push
defence spending above the 3.5% of GDP it represented in 1990. The
government has previously phrased this claim differently, though, calling the
boost that will see defence spending rise by Â£7bn a year by 2024-25, the
""biggest sustained increase in 30 years"". And
as defence spending has not increased for more than three years in a row since
1990, this will probably turn out to be true. Read more here.  Bernard Jenkin thanks the prime minister for the time he has given to the committee, and he closes the session in the tradition of parliamentary proceedings: ""Order, order"". And that's it. We'll bring you a quick summary of the key points next.... Before the chair of the Liaison Committee, Bernard Jenkin, brings the session to a close he returns to questions about the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. He says he is concerned that ""it doesn't look like the same consuming priority as other policies"". Can the PM do more to secure the agreement of all those countries due to attend? Mr Johnson says he is ""engaged in some kind of COP conversation virtually every day"". He says it is a ""big cross-government effort"" to get ready for it.  It is led by Alok Sharma, he says, but everyone is ""gripping it across Whitehall"". Mr Jenkin asks how often the Climate Action Strategy Committee is meeting in preparation? Mr Johnson says ""to be frank"" it has ""not met a great deal"" but that is because a lot is happening already on ""an ad hoc level"". Ms Bradley asks if there are any procedural changes the prime minister would like to see to enable more women to make successful careers in Parliament. Mr Johnson says technology has ""definitely been our friend"" during the pandemic. He says it is not for him to dictate, but it is for MPs and the Speaker to see how things can be improved for work and family balances. ""There are still very considerable barriers"" he states, and there are some deterrents that female MPs face, such as ""absolutely appalling"" online trolling. Ms Bradley asks if there are any particular innovations which he'd like to see continue after the pandemic, such as virtual voting. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to commit to any particular change, but he says he's open to different ideas. He says he ""wants the chamber to be full again"" and he wants the public to see where the ""sentiment"" is in Parliament by seeing and hearing how MPs are responding to a debate. He also wants to see MPs be able to ""mingle again in the lobbies,"" ""voting as a communal act, together, has immense benefits,"" he states. Ms Bradley asks her final question, she says the government has to provide time in Parliament to allow MPs to debate changes to how they work. Mr Johnson says this is a ""necessity"" and he has ""no doubt"" that this can be organised. Sir Bernard Jenkin says proxy voting has been beneficial for lots of women who often have caring responsibilities, he asks if the PM has an open mind on such things. Mr Johnson says he wants to see Parliament become more family friendly. Chair of the Commons Procedure Committee Conservative Karen Bradley asks the final set of questions, this time on lifting Covid-19 restrictions in Parliament. She says the House of Commons has been able to operate and sit throughout the whole pandemic, unlike many other parliaments in the world, she states. She asks how the PM thinks Parliament has operated over the past twelve months. Boris Johnson says some professions have been really badly hit by the disease, but he thanks the workers who have managed to make Parliament continue to sit. He says he thinks the public want to see MPs return to their place of work in person. Ms Bradley asks what his view is on social distancing in the Commons chamber. Mr Johnson says he wants to see an approach for the Commons which is adopted everywhere, as he wants Westminster to be like ""every other part of the UK"". Mr Merriman asks how discussions with other international leaders are going - such as talking to President Biden about travel between the UK and US restarting. The PM says leaders ""around the world"" are looking at ""when can get things moving"". But he says there is ""no doubt a growing global consensus for the purposes of aviation that evidence of a vaccination or immunity, that you have had the disease, or have taken a negative test... will be valuable"" for travel. Finally Mr Merriman asks when Brits will feel ready to travel again - and if the PM will be going abroad this summer. Mr Johnson says we should not ""underestimate the natural wanderlust of spiritual inquiry"" of the British people, adding: ""As soon as people feel it is safe, you will see a miraculous change in the mood."" He won't reveal his own holiday destination, but says: ""I think whatever I do, I will be making sure to tell the British public what I think is safe."" Now Huw Merriman gets his turn - he had tried to join the committee earlier via Zoom but had issues with his mute button - something we are all too familiar with. But there is plenty space in the room for him to join in person at a safe distance, so after a suggestion from Boris Johnson he should run across Parliament, he now gets to his questions. The Tory MP asks about international travel and how detailed the announcement on 5 April will be. Boris Johnson says he will have to wait and see but adds: ""We hope we can get people moving again by 17 May.... [but] we will just have to see where we get to, where other countries get to and what the data is telling us."" Mr Knight says it is not enough to say that talks are taking place with the EU on visa fees for performers. He wants ministers to get involved to ""short circuit"" discussions with countries that ""seem to be the most recalcitrant"" such as Italy, Spain and Greece. Mr Johnson says he agrees things ""must get ironed out"". He says it needs to be ""a two way street"" with the EU. On the issue of festivals taking place in the UK this summer, Mr Knight says organisers are nervous because of problems with Covid cancellation insurance. Will the PM get involved to ""back a Covid secure summer of fun rather than condemning us to a summer of none"" he asks? Mr Johnson says the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, has done a ""huge amount of work"" to get the sector ready for reopening. He says he does not want to see people unwilling to take risks when putting on events this year because they are scarred by memories of last year. Glastonbury has already announced it will not go ahead this summer, but will other festivals? Lead singer of The Darkness, Justin Hawkins, told the BBC he ""remains pessimistic"", while some in the industry are calling for government-backed insurance to renew confidence and enable the sector to ""get going again"". This video can not be played Music festivals and Covid: Could some events still go ahead this year? Julian Knight who chairs the Culture Committee jumps the queue because the chair of the Transport Committee is having technical problems. Mr Knight says the culture, media and sport sector is worth a quarter of the UK economy but visa fees to work in the EU mean musicians are performers are suffering. Why has no other sector been allowed to suffer from Brexit, he asks. Mr Johnson says he ""shares the frustration"" and agrees the sector is ""massively important"" and brings billions of tax revenue and employment to the UK. But he says EU restrictions are to blame and the situation is unlike that in ""global Britain"" which welcomes people from around the world. He adds that the government is working ""flat out"" with each individual government but ""some are much better than others"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There was never a simple binary trade-off between the two factors: those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths, also had the biggest hits to the economy and the UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. Read Faisal's full analysis here. Mr Stride says many economists think the spending forecasts in thatOBR report,externalare ""unrealistic"" and there are many more costs expected in the coming years which are not ""baked in to the budget"". There is, for instance, no additional spending outlined for the vaccine or test and trace beyond this summer. He asks if this leaves him feeling ""queasy"" over spending. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to make predictions now about  future spending reviews, but he says he there's no sign in the data that ""at this stage"" the UK will have to ""deviate from our path to freedom"" from lockdown. Mr Stride says there's no money in the forecast to fix and change social care. He asks if the tax burden can be expected not to rise. Mr Johnson says he ""strongly believes in a low-tax government, and I'm a low tax Conservative"". He says as the UK emerges from Covid-19, tax rates will keep the UK ""competitive"". Mr Stride says there will be a situation where tax benefits to corporations will end at the same time as corporation taxes will rise, he asks if this will damage such companies. Mr Johnson lists all of the help available to businesses during the pandemic, which he describes as a ""huge package"" over the past year. Chair of the Treasury committee Conservative MP Mel Stride asks if the spending assumptions from the Office for Budget Responsibility are ""realistic"". Mr Johnson says he thinks the OBR is ""right to think that the public finances are under very considerable pressure as a result of Covid"". Mr Stride asks if the forecast for the next five years from the OBR on government spending is correct. Mr Johnson says ""things are very tough"" and ""spending has been necessarily very extensive"" but the Chancellor's Budget is set to work in the medium term. Mr Stride asks if the PM is happy with the assumption of spending levels over the coming years. Mr Johnson says he wishes ""we weren't in this position"" and had to ""firehose so much money"" following Covid-19. Onto vaccines, Mr Wragg asks whether certificates proving you have had your jab are ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". The PM seems to answer a different question after discussions yesterday about care homes making vaccines mandatory for their staff. He says the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" as doctors already have to have Hepatitis B jabs, adding the idea ""doesn't seem to me to be irresponsible at all, far from it, it is wholly responsible for care home companies to think about requiring vaccinations"". But Mr Wragg asks, what about ""ordinary citizens going to the pub?"" Mr Johnson says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". Pushed further, the PM says other MPs want tougher restrictions, adding: ""I find myself in this long national conversation thinking very deeply about it, and the public have been thinking very deeply. ""They want us as their government and me as prime minister to take all the action I can to protect them."" Mr Wragg then asks about comments made by scientific advisers at the weekend that Brits won't be able to go abroad for their holidays - ""is that the government's policy?"" The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and he will ""set out what I see may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". Asked by Mr Wragg if he finds advisers ""freelancing across the media before decisions have been made"" helpful, the PM says: ""It is one of those things we just have to get used to. It has been a feature of life for quite some time."" But he assures his Tory colleague that advisers advise and ministers decide. The next MP to question the prime minister is Tory William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He asks why the Coronavirus Act - which gives the government emergency powers amid the pandemic - is being extended for six months on Thursday, past the final roadmap step out of lockdown. Boris Johnson says they need the act ""to deal with backlogs we have built up"" - such as allowing remote court hearings or letting NHS volunteers continue to serve. He adds: ""Be in no doubt after 21 June, all the restrictions we have, we hope, will be gone. ""But remember this is a 'not before' date."" Mr Wragg says some provisions in the law ""still haven't been used"" so questions why wont they be dropped. The PM says the government have ""already weeded out quite a few"", adding: ""anything redundant will go."" Yvette Cooper continues her questions and says  20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions. She says everyone understands the importance of hauliers being able to do their job but she wants to know why are they not being tested in the UK. Mr Johnson says the numbers coming in overall from France have ""massively diminished"". It ""was colossal"" the PM admits. He says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel""  and says he ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Ms Cooper says scientists and medics agree that the ""biggest threat to keeping the roadmap on track"" in the UK is the spread of new variants from South Africa and Brazil. Why is the PM not taking action now, she asks, when we know cases have been rising since February? Mr Johnson says that is because there is ""a balance to be struck"". He says it is not clear how the vaccines will work against the new variants and that the government has to balance taking action now against the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Anyone in England who travels abroad without good reasoncould soon be fined Â£5,000, under the coronavirus regulations. It comes amidst growing uncertainty about whether people will be able to take foreign holidays this summer. Holiday travel is not currently allowed - either in the UK or abroad - under lockdown rules. So when can you go on holiday again?Read our guide here. Â© 2025 BBC.

The Tory MP asks about international travel and how detailed the announcement on 5 April will be. Boris Johnson says he will have to wait and see but adds: ""We hope we can get people moving again by 17 May.... [but] we will just have to see where we get to, where other countries get to and what the data is telling us."" Mr Knight says it is not enough to say that talks are taking place with the EU on visa fees for performers. He wants ministers to get involved to ""short circuit"" discussions with countries that ""seem to be the most recalcitrant"" such as Italy, Spain and Greece. Mr Johnson says he agrees things ""must get ironed out"". He says it needs to be ""a two way street"" with the EU. On the issue of festivals taking place in the UK this summer, Mr Knight says organisers are nervous because of problems with Covid cancellation insurance. Will the PM get involved to ""back a Covid secure summer of fun rather than condemning us to a summer of none"" he asks? Mr Johnson says the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, has done a ""huge amount of work"" to get the sector ready for reopening. He says he does not want to see people unwilling to take risks when putting on events this year because they are scarred by memories of last year. Glastonbury has already announced it will not go ahead this summer, but will other festivals? Lead singer of The Darkness, Justin Hawkins, told the BBC he ""remains pessimistic"", while some in the industry are calling for government-backed insurance to renew confidence and enable the sector to ""get going again"". This video can not be played Music festivals and Covid: Could some events still go ahead this year? Julian Knight who chairs the Culture Committee jumps the queue because the chair of the Transport Committee is having technical problems. Mr Knight says the culture, media and sport sector is worth a quarter of the UK economy but visa fees to work in the EU mean musicians are performers are suffering. Why has no other sector been allowed to suffer from Brexit, he asks. Mr Johnson says he ""shares the frustration"" and agrees the sector is ""massively important"" and brings billions of tax revenue and employment to the UK. But he says EU restrictions are to blame and the situation is unlike that in ""global Britain"" which welcomes people from around the world. He adds that the government is working ""flat out"" with each individual government but ""some are much better than others"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There was never a simple binary trade-off between the two factors: those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths, also had the biggest hits to the economy and the UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. Read Faisal's full analysis here. Mr Stride says many economists think the spending forecasts in thatOBR report,externalare ""unrealistic"" and there are many more costs expected in the coming years which are not ""baked in to the budget"". There is, for instance, no additional spending outlined for the vaccine or test and trace beyond this summer. He asks if this leaves him feeling ""queasy"" over spending. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to make predictions now about  future spending reviews, but he says he there's no sign in the data that ""at this stage"" the UK will have to ""deviate from our path to freedom"" from lockdown. Mr Stride says there's no money in the forecast to fix and change social care. He asks if the tax burden can be expected not to rise. Mr Johnson says he ""strongly believes in a low-tax government, and I'm a low tax Conservative"". He says as the UK emerges from Covid-19, tax rates will keep the UK ""competitive"". Mr Stride says there will be a situation where tax benefits to corporations will end at the same time as corporation taxes will rise, he asks if this will damage such companies. Mr Johnson lists all of the help available to businesses during the pandemic, which he describes as a ""huge package"" over the past year. Chair of the Treasury committee Conservative MP Mel Stride asks if the spending assumptions from the Office for Budget Responsibility are ""realistic"". Mr Johnson says he thinks the OBR is ""right to think that the public finances are under very considerable pressure as a result of Covid"". Mr Stride asks if the forecast for the next five years from the OBR on government spending is correct. Mr Johnson says ""things are very tough"" and ""spending has been necessarily very extensive"" but the Chancellor's Budget is set to work in the medium term. Mr Stride asks if the PM is happy with the assumption of spending levels over the coming years. Mr Johnson says he wishes ""we weren't in this position"" and had to ""firehose so much money"" following Covid-19. Onto vaccines, Mr Wragg asks whether certificates proving you have had your jab are ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". The PM seems to answer a different question after discussions yesterday about care homes making vaccines mandatory for their staff. He says the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" as doctors already have to have Hepatitis B jabs, adding the idea ""doesn't seem to me to be irresponsible at all, far from it, it is wholly responsible for care home companies to think about requiring vaccinations"". But Mr Wragg asks, what about ""ordinary citizens going to the pub?"" Mr Johnson says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". Pushed further, the PM says other MPs want tougher restrictions, adding: ""I find myself in this long national conversation thinking very deeply about it, and the public have been thinking very deeply. ""They want us as their government and me as prime minister to take all the action I can to protect them."" Mr Wragg then asks about comments made by scientific advisers at the weekend that Brits won't be able to go abroad for their holidays - ""is that the government's policy?"" The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and he will ""set out what I see may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". Asked by Mr Wragg if he finds advisers ""freelancing across the media before decisions have been made"" helpful, the PM says: ""It is one of those things we just have to get used to. It has been a feature of life for quite some time."" But he assures his Tory colleague that advisers advise and ministers decide. The next MP to question the prime minister is Tory William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He asks why the Coronavirus Act - which gives the government emergency powers amid the pandemic - is being extended for six months on Thursday, past the final roadmap step out of lockdown. Boris Johnson says they need the act ""to deal with backlogs we have built up"" - such as allowing remote court hearings or letting NHS volunteers continue to serve. He adds: ""Be in no doubt after 21 June, all the restrictions we have, we hope, will be gone. ""But remember this is a 'not before' date."" Mr Wragg says some provisions in the law ""still haven't been used"" so questions why wont they be dropped. The PM says the government have ""already weeded out quite a few"", adding: ""anything redundant will go."" Yvette Cooper continues her questions and says  20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions. She says everyone understands the importance of hauliers being able to do their job but she wants to know why are they not being tested in the UK. Mr Johnson says the numbers coming in overall from France have ""massively diminished"". It ""was colossal"" the PM admits. He says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel""  and says he ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Ms Cooper says scientists and medics agree that the ""biggest threat to keeping the roadmap on track"" in the UK is the spread of new variants from South Africa and Brazil. Why is the PM not taking action now, she asks, when we know cases have been rising since February? Mr Johnson says that is because there is ""a balance to be struck"". He says it is not clear how the vaccines will work against the new variants and that the government has to balance taking action now against the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Anyone in England who travels abroad without good reasoncould soon be fined Â£5,000, under the coronavirus regulations. It comes amidst growing uncertainty about whether people will be able to take foreign holidays this summer. Holiday travel is not currently allowed - either in the UK or abroad - under lockdown rules. So when can you go on holiday again?Read our guide here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The government appointed an inspector to scrutinise Liverpool City Council in December Government-appointed commissioners will oversee parts of Liverpool City Council following a highly critical report, the local government secretary has said. Robert Jenrick told Parliament inspectors found a ""serious breakdown of governance"" and ""multiple apparent failures"" which meant he had to act. The authority has been under scrutiny since police began investigating building and development contracts. The probe has seenfive men, including then mayor Joe Anderson, arrested. Mr Anderson denies any wrongdoing. Mr Jenrick said the ""Best Value inspection"", commissioned in December, had found ""multiple apparent failures"" and a ""deeply concerning picture of mismanagement"" in some functions at the Labour-run authority. Mr Jenrick said it was only the fifth time a statutory intervention had happened Ina statement to the House of Commons,external, he said: Inspectors had found failures in the planning and regeneration departments, including a ""worrying lack of record-keeping"" and documents ""created retrospectively, discarded in skips or even destroyed"" There had been a lack of scrutiny in the highways department, with dysfunctional management, ""no coherent business plan"" and ""dubious"" contract deals There had been issues in property management that had led to ""a continued failure to correctly value land and assets"", meaning taxpayers had ""frequently lost out"" There was a ""fundamental failure... to understand and appreciate the basic standards governing those in public service"" and ""no established way to hold those falling below those acceptable standards to account"" ""Given the gravity of the inspection findings, I must consider what would happen if the council fails to deliver the necessary changes at the necessary speed,"" he said. Mr Jenrick is proposing to appoint commissioners to run some aspects at the city council for a minimum of three years. He added it was only the fifth time a ""statutory intervention"" had happened, as the move was regarded as a ""last resort"". ""I want to underline the report is not a verdict on all the staff working at Liverpool City Council - in fact, [it] commends the hard work and dedication of many,"" Mr Jenrick said. Liverpool City Council: What does the future hold? Shadow local government secretary Steve Reed said the Labour party accepted the report ""in full"" and would hold a review into what he called ""severe institutional weaknesses"". He welcomed Mr Jenrick's ""measured and appropriate approach"" to the council's problems and said he wanted ""to reassure people in Liverpool that this does not mean government ministers are coming in to run their city directly"". ""This is not, as some would put it, a Tory takeover,"" he added. By Claire Hamilton, BBC Merseyside political reporter The bitter fallout from Robert Jenrick's announcement is only just beginning. From those who see this as a power grab in Labour's reddest city by a party which hasn't won an election at any level here in decades, to those furious that the behaviour described in the report may have been allowed to fester, there's a lot of anger, uncertainty and sadness. It's rare for a government to take action in this way. It's unlikely residents will notice any difference as they go about their daily lives - the bins will still get emptied, the pot holes will still get filled in (although not as quickly as some would like). But behind the scenes, one of the key stipulations is that the elected mayor and council might be unable to spend cash on property transactions without the formal consent of the commissioner, which could have significant ramifications. Another dramatic change is also to come: the proposed shrinking of the council chamber from 90 to just 30 elected councillors, who would all face elections at the same time. In a statement, a Liverpool City Council spokesman said the authority took the report's findings into its highways, regeneration and property management functions ""extremely seriously"" and was committed to addressing ""all the concerns raised"". He added that the report made clear that since the arrival of chief executive Tony Reeves in 2018, the council had ""already taken steps to address the issues"". Steve Reed said the intervention at the council was not ""a Tory takeover"" of the city Mr Reed told the BBC the public would be ""rightly shocked"" about the report. He said Mr Jenrick made it clear that the ""vast majority"" of the council's politicians and staff were ""honest hard-working, dedicated public servants"". He added that he was ""determined to make sure the council continues to run its own business,"" adding: ""We do not want this to define the council or the city."" Acting mayor Wendy Simon said the report was ""deeply unsettling"" and she was ""truly shocked"" by the contents. But she was ""really pleased"" at the level of commissioners coming in and ""that they are coming in at an advisory manner"". She said it was important to ""take collective responsibility"" and for all councillors, regardless of political party, come together. ""We know it is a long road ahead to build that trust."" Mr Anderson said: ""Under my leadership of eleven years as leader and as the mayor of Liverpool, our city has been transformed... into a northern powerhouse. ""Today's headlines do not reflect the dramatic success that we have generated. I want to digest fully today's report before commenting on specific details."" Councillor Richard Kemp, leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition group at the council, said the inspection had ""exposed grotesque practices"". Councillor Tom Crone, leader of the council's Green Party group, said the city's Labour leaders should ""resign as one"". ""Any administration with even an ounce of shame would resign immediately and allow the city to start afresh,"" he added. Conservative mayoral candidate Katie Burgess said it was ""disappointing that Labour mismanagement has seen the government have to take action to protect the people of Liverpool"". Independent mayoral candidate Stephen Yip said the findings painted an ""appalling picture"" but applauded the ""courageous and honest"" council staff who provided evidence to inspectors. He added he was grateful there was no ""Whitehall takeover"". Trade Union and Socialist Coalition candidate Roger Bannister said while he had ""great concerns"", he was ""opposed to the imposition of unelected commissioners taking power away from democratically elected representatives"". Liberal Party candidate Steve Radford told theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicethere were ""no great shocks"" in the report and he ""did not need a government inspector to tell me that intimidation has been going on for decades"". Inspectors were sent in by the local government secretary following allegations of fraud, bribery, corruption, misconduct in public office and witness intimidation at the council. All five men who were arrested deny any wrongdoing and have not been charged with any offence. Merseyside Police said the men were no longer on bail, but remained under investigation. Mr Jenrick reiterated elections would still go ahead in Liverpool in May, with the following candidates for mayor announced so far: Roger Bannister (TUSC) Katie Burgess (Conservative) Tom Crone (Green) Richard Kemp (Liberal Democrat) Steve Radford (Liberal Party) Stephen Yip (Independent) The Labour party is due to announce its candidate on 29 March.

"Vaccine campaigns across Europe have started slowly, blamed partly on delayed deliveries The UK and the European Union have said they are working together to improve their relationship, after weeks of tensions over Covid vaccine supplies. In a joint statement, they said they wanted to ""create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all"". The European Commission earlier proposed tougher export controls on vaccines, amid tensions over supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that ""blockades"" were not ""sensible"". The joint UK-EU statement said that ""openness and global co-operation"" would be key to tackling the pandemic. ""We are all facing the same pandemic and the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,"" it said. ""We will continue our discussions."" Why is the EU having vaccine problems? EU tussle with UK over AstraZeneca jabs escalates PM's vaccines comments set tongues wagging But there was little harmony earlier on Wednesday when the Commission announced plans for all vaccine shipments to be assessed on the destination country's rate of vaccinations and exports. The proposals, which will be put before EU leaders on Thursday, are seen as focused on the UK and US in particular. The tone of the EU-UK statement was positive, but actual progress between the two sides was described to me by an EU diplomat as ""slow, cumbersome and difficult"". On both sides. That doesn't mean impossible, but at their summit on Thursday, some EU leaders - along with the European Commission - will still be pushing for tougher controls on vaccine exports. And they could hit the UK. EU insiders say they had hoped never to use the controls. They say they want them as a means of exerting pressure on vaccine companies and on countries with vaccine production sites that are not exporting to the EU. With a third wave of the pandemic hitting much of mainland Europe, EU leaders are coming under increasing pressure to show voters they are taking action to ramp up both the supply of jabs and their vaccine rollout, on both of which they are trailing behind the UK. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides rejected a suggestion that the aim was to punish the UK. ""We're dealing with a pandemic and this is not seeking to punish any countries,"" she said. Asked whether the UK might retaliate, Mr Johnson told MPs he did not believe ""that blockades of either vaccines or of medicines, of ingredients for vaccines"" would be ""sensible"". Companies might draw conclusions about future investments ""in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed"", he added. Meanwhile, in other developments: Amid continuing anger in Europe at AstraZeneca, aFrenchgovernment spokesman said the UK-Swedish company's failure to deliver on its commitments was ""totally unacceptable"" InItaly, police raided a plant where 29 million AstraZeneca doses had been processed. An EU official told the BBC he asked for the weekend raid to ensure everything was on track Meanwhile inGermany,Chancellor Angela Merkel made a dramatic U-turnand cancelled a planned five-day lockdown over Easter following widespread criticism. ""This mistake is my mistake alone,"" she said EU states are trying to speed up their vaccination campaigns after a sluggish start. Italy's PM said he wanted to increase the country's rate of inoculations per day from 170,000 to half a million Some 19 EU states are recording a rise in infections - these includePoland, SpainandFrance The tougher export controls are most like to affect countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US. The key criteria for the proposed regulations are ""reciprocity"" and ""proportionality"": The EU says there is no reciprocity if a country importing vaccines from the EU restricts exports itself either by law or other means, so ""it may be appropriate to consider whether exports to this country are justified"" Member states and the Commission will also consider the epidemiological situation in that non-EU country, its vaccination rate and existing availability of Covid-19 vaccines There will be no outright export bans, which are opposed by countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium. Vaccine manufacturers would be assessed to see if they were fulfilling their contract with the EU, although no specific algorithm is planned. In an interview with the BBC, the EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton insisted the bloc's issues were with AstraZeneca and not the UK government. ""I know that there's some tension... but as long as we have transparency, I think [relations] will be able to be normalised,"" he said. He said if AstraZeneca had provided the agreed 120 million doses to the EU, member states would have been at the same rate of vaccination as the UK: ""We have been heavily penalised and we just want to understand why"". AstraZeneca denies that it is failing to honour its contract with the EU. This video can not be played Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton says the EU has been ""heavily penalised"" and wants to know why A UK government spokesperson said: ""We are all fighting the same pandemic. Vaccines are an international operation; they are produced by collaboration by great scientists around the world. And we will continue to work with our European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout."" Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen complained that the EU had exported more than 10 million doses to the UK, but the UK had so far exported none in return. Her colleagues added that this had to be seen in the context of the EU being both a global Covid hotspot and also the biggest exporter of vaccines. Since the end of January, EU countries have exported 43 million doses of vaccine to 33 countries not subject to export authorisation, they say. UK sources insist vital components are being sent to the continent, for example for the Pfizer vaccine, and they have emphasised the UK's role in investing early in vaccine development, BBC correspondent Nick Beake reports.

"The prime minister has given evidence to a committee of senior MPs Mr Johnson faced questions from the Liaison Committee on the UKâs place in the world, the governmentâs response to the coronavirus pandemic, and the economy. The PM suggested that care home companies would be acting âresponsiblyâ if they required staff to be vaccinated. He also said that people may have to provide proof of vaccination to visit a pub Home Secretary Priti Patel has set out government plans to tighten the rules for asylum seekers staying the UK At PMQs, Boris Johnson said the work of the UK vaccine programme has ""brought hope"" and allowed the UK to set out a cautious roadmap The PM and Keir Starmer clashed on government plans for the armed forces On Tuesday, the PM has told a private meeting of Tory MPs the UK's coronavirus vaccine programme was a success because of ""capitalism"" and ""greed"" A government source said the PM was referring to the profit motive driving companies to develop new products and were not about the row over vaccine supply with the EU Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll end our coverage now on today's proceedings in the Commons. The team on board with you today were Hazel Shearing, Jennifer Scott, Richard Morris, and Sinead Wilson, with Johanna Howitt editing. Parliament goes in to recess for the Easter break after tomorrow's sitting.  So we'll be back with our regular coverage of Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday 14 April. Thanks for following along with us. That was a wide-ranging 90 minutes in front of the committee for Boris Johnson. But here are some of the key points from the session: Reality Check Boris Johnson faced lots of question today on defence spending - in PMQs and in his session with the Liaison Committee. The
prime minister said recent spending pledges were âthe biggest investment in
defence since the Cold War.â Looking
back at figures since 1990 - seen by many as the end of the Cold War, with the
Berlin Wall coming down in November 1989 - it is clear military spending has
fallen considerably. The
proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of
everything produced by the economy in any particular year, was 3.5% in 1990 .
It was 2.1% in 2018/19. The
boostannounced in Novembermeans by
2024-25, defence spending will be Â£7bn a year higher than it would have been
under previous plans. But
with Â£7bn worth about 0.35% of GDP, this extra money is not enough to push
defence spending above the 3.5% of GDP it represented in 1990. The
government has previously phrased this claim differently, though, calling the
boost that will see defence spending rise by Â£7bn a year by 2024-25, the
""biggest sustained increase in 30 years"". And
as defence spending has not increased for more than three years in a row since
1990, this will probably turn out to be true. Read more here.  Bernard Jenkin thanks the prime minister for the time he has given to the committee, and he closes the session in the tradition of parliamentary proceedings: ""Order, order"". And that's it. We'll bring you a quick summary of the key points next.... Before the chair of the Liaison Committee, Bernard Jenkin, brings the session to a close he returns to questions about the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. He says he is concerned that ""it doesn't look like the same consuming priority as other policies"". Can the PM do more to secure the agreement of all those countries due to attend? Mr Johnson says he is ""engaged in some kind of COP conversation virtually every day"". He says it is a ""big cross-government effort"" to get ready for it.  It is led by Alok Sharma, he says, but everyone is ""gripping it across Whitehall"". Mr Jenkin asks how often the Climate Action Strategy Committee is meeting in preparation? Mr Johnson says ""to be frank"" it has ""not met a great deal"" but that is because a lot is happening already on ""an ad hoc level"". Ms Bradley asks if there are any procedural changes the prime minister would like to see to enable more women to make successful careers in Parliament. Mr Johnson says technology has ""definitely been our friend"" during the pandemic. He says it is not for him to dictate, but it is for MPs and the Speaker to see how things can be improved for work and family balances. ""There are still very considerable barriers"" he states, and there are some deterrents that female MPs face, such as ""absolutely appalling"" online trolling. Ms Bradley asks if there are any particular innovations which he'd like to see continue after the pandemic, such as virtual voting. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to commit to any particular change, but he says he's open to different ideas. He says he ""wants the chamber to be full again"" and he wants the public to see where the ""sentiment"" is in Parliament by seeing and hearing how MPs are responding to a debate. He also wants to see MPs be able to ""mingle again in the lobbies,"" ""voting as a communal act, together, has immense benefits,"" he states. Ms Bradley asks her final question, she says the government has to provide time in Parliament to allow MPs to debate changes to how they work. Mr Johnson says this is a ""necessity"" and he has ""no doubt"" that this can be organised. Sir Bernard Jenkin says proxy voting has been beneficial for lots of women who often have caring responsibilities, he asks if the PM has an open mind on such things. Mr Johnson says he wants to see Parliament become more family friendly. Chair of the Commons Procedure Committee Conservative Karen Bradley asks the final set of questions, this time on lifting Covid-19 restrictions in Parliament. She says the House of Commons has been able to operate and sit throughout the whole pandemic, unlike many other parliaments in the world, she states. She asks how the PM thinks Parliament has operated over the past twelve months. Boris Johnson says some professions have been really badly hit by the disease, but he thanks the workers who have managed to make Parliament continue to sit. He says he thinks the public want to see MPs return to their place of work in person. Ms Bradley asks what his view is on social distancing in the Commons chamber. Mr Johnson says he wants to see an approach for the Commons which is adopted everywhere, as he wants Westminster to be like ""every other part of the UK"". Mr Merriman asks how discussions with other international leaders are going - such as talking to President Biden about travel between the UK and US restarting. The PM says leaders ""around the world"" are looking at ""when can get things moving"". But he says there is ""no doubt a growing global consensus for the purposes of aviation that evidence of a vaccination or immunity, that you have had the disease, or have taken a negative test... will be valuable"" for travel. Finally Mr Merriman asks when Brits will feel ready to travel again - and if the PM will be going abroad this summer. Mr Johnson says we should not ""underestimate the natural wanderlust of spiritual inquiry"" of the British people, adding: ""As soon as people feel it is safe, you will see a miraculous change in the mood."" He won't reveal his own holiday destination, but says: ""I think whatever I do, I will be making sure to tell the British public what I think is safe."" Now Huw Merriman gets his turn - he had tried to join the committee earlier via Zoom but had issues with his mute button - something we are all too familiar with. But there is plenty space in the room for him to join in person at a safe distance, so after a suggestion from Boris Johnson he should run across Parliament, he now gets to his questions. The Tory MP asks about international travel and how detailed the announcement on 5 April will be. Boris Johnson says he will have to wait and see but adds: ""We hope we can get people moving again by 17 May.... [but] we will just have to see where we get to, where other countries get to and what the data is telling us."" Mr Knight says it is not enough to say that talks are taking place with the EU on visa fees for performers. He wants ministers to get involved to ""short circuit"" discussions with countries that ""seem to be the most recalcitrant"" such as Italy, Spain and Greece. Mr Johnson says he agrees things ""must get ironed out"". He says it needs to be ""a two way street"" with the EU. On the issue of festivals taking place in the UK this summer, Mr Knight says organisers are nervous because of problems with Covid cancellation insurance. Will the PM get involved to ""back a Covid secure summer of fun rather than condemning us to a summer of none"" he asks? Mr Johnson says the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, has done a ""huge amount of work"" to get the sector ready for reopening. He says he does not want to see people unwilling to take risks when putting on events this year because they are scarred by memories of last year. Glastonbury has already announced it will not go ahead this summer, but will other festivals? Lead singer of The Darkness, Justin Hawkins, told the BBC he ""remains pessimistic"", while some in the industry are calling for government-backed insurance to renew confidence and enable the sector to ""get going again"". This video can not be played Music festivals and Covid: Could some events still go ahead this year? Julian Knight who chairs the Culture Committee jumps the queue because the chair of the Transport Committee is having technical problems. Mr Knight says the culture, media and sport sector is worth a quarter of the UK economy but visa fees to work in the EU mean musicians are performers are suffering. Why has no other sector been allowed to suffer from Brexit, he asks. Mr Johnson says he ""shares the frustration"" and agrees the sector is ""massively important"" and brings billions of tax revenue and employment to the UK. But he says EU restrictions are to blame and the situation is unlike that in ""global Britain"" which welcomes people from around the world. He adds that the government is working ""flat out"" with each individual government but ""some are much better than others"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There was never a simple binary trade-off between the two factors: those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths, also had the biggest hits to the economy and the UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. Read Faisal's full analysis here. Mr Stride says many economists think the spending forecasts in thatOBR report,externalare ""unrealistic"" and there are many more costs expected in the coming years which are not ""baked in to the budget"". There is, for instance, no additional spending outlined for the vaccine or test and trace beyond this summer. He asks if this leaves him feeling ""queasy"" over spending. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to make predictions now about  future spending reviews, but he says he there's no sign in the data that ""at this stage"" the UK will have to ""deviate from our path to freedom"" from lockdown. Mr Stride says there's no money in the forecast to fix and change social care. He asks if the tax burden can be expected not to rise. Mr Johnson says he ""strongly believes in a low-tax government, and I'm a low tax Conservative"". He says as the UK emerges from Covid-19, tax rates will keep the UK ""competitive"". Mr Stride says there will be a situation where tax benefits to corporations will end at the same time as corporation taxes will rise, he asks if this will damage such companies. Mr Johnson lists all of the help available to businesses during the pandemic, which he describes as a ""huge package"" over the past year. Chair of the Treasury committee Conservative MP Mel Stride asks if the spending assumptions from the Office for Budget Responsibility are ""realistic"". Mr Johnson says he thinks the OBR is ""right to think that the public finances are under very considerable pressure as a result of Covid"". Mr Stride asks if the forecast for the next five years from the OBR on government spending is correct. Mr Johnson says ""things are very tough"" and ""spending has been necessarily very extensive"" but the Chancellor's Budget is set to work in the medium term. Mr Stride asks if the PM is happy with the assumption of spending levels over the coming years. Mr Johnson says he wishes ""we weren't in this position"" and had to ""firehose so much money"" following Covid-19. Onto vaccines, Mr Wragg asks whether certificates proving you have had your jab are ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". The PM seems to answer a different question after discussions yesterday about care homes making vaccines mandatory for their staff. He says the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" as doctors already have to have Hepatitis B jabs, adding the idea ""doesn't seem to me to be irresponsible at all, far from it, it is wholly responsible for care home companies to think about requiring vaccinations"". But Mr Wragg asks, what about ""ordinary citizens going to the pub?"" Mr Johnson says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". Pushed further, the PM says other MPs want tougher restrictions, adding: ""I find myself in this long national conversation thinking very deeply about it, and the public have been thinking very deeply. ""They want us as their government and me as prime minister to take all the action I can to protect them."" Mr Wragg then asks about comments made by scientific advisers at the weekend that Brits won't be able to go abroad for their holidays - ""is that the government's policy?"" The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and he will ""set out what I see may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". Asked by Mr Wragg if he finds advisers ""freelancing across the media before decisions have been made"" helpful, the PM says: ""It is one of those things we just have to get used to. It has been a feature of life for quite some time."" But he assures his Tory colleague that advisers advise and ministers decide. The next MP to question the prime minister is Tory William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He asks why the Coronavirus Act - which gives the government emergency powers amid the pandemic - is being extended for six months on Thursday, past the final roadmap step out of lockdown. Boris Johnson says they need the act ""to deal with backlogs we have built up"" - such as allowing remote court hearings or letting NHS volunteers continue to serve. He adds: ""Be in no doubt after 21 June, all the restrictions we have, we hope, will be gone. ""But remember this is a 'not before' date."" Mr Wragg says some provisions in the law ""still haven't been used"" so questions why wont they be dropped. The PM says the government have ""already weeded out quite a few"", adding: ""anything redundant will go."" Yvette Cooper continues her questions and says  20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions. She says everyone understands the importance of hauliers being able to do their job but she wants to know why are they not being tested in the UK. Mr Johnson says the numbers coming in overall from France have ""massively diminished"". It ""was colossal"" the PM admits. He says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel""  and says he ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Ms Cooper says scientists and medics agree that the ""biggest threat to keeping the roadmap on track"" in the UK is the spread of new variants from South Africa and Brazil. Why is the PM not taking action now, she asks, when we know cases have been rising since February? Mr Johnson says that is because there is ""a balance to be struck"". He says it is not clear how the vaccines will work against the new variants and that the government has to balance taking action now against the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Anyone in England who travels abroad without good reasoncould soon be fined Â£5,000, under the coronavirus regulations. It comes amidst growing uncertainty about whether people will be able to take foreign holidays this summer. Holiday travel is not currently allowed - either in the UK or abroad - under lockdown rules. So when can you go on holiday again?Read our guide here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining us. Your writers today were Jen Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea, Penny Spiller and Fran Gillett. The editors were James Clarke and Rob Corp. We'll be back again tomorrow morning with all the coronavirus news as it happens. See you then. TheUK and EU say they are working on creating a ""win-win"" situation to expand vaccine supplyfor all citizens. A joint statement says co-operation is ""even more important"" as Europe faces a third wave of coronavirus. India has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, sources have told the BBC. Rising cases in India are putting pressure on the domestic supply chain - but there has been no official comment from the Indian government. China is stepping up its vaccine rollout, with plans to inoculate 40% of its 1.4 billion population by the end of June. So far,82.8 million people have received jabs,external, with China currently focusing on vaccinating people aged between 18 and 59. Chancellor Angela Merkel has made an extraordinary plea to the German people to forgive her,after she cancelled a strict Easter lockdown just a day after announcing it.She admitted there was not enough time to implement the shutdown; it had been met with resistance from business leaders. Brazil has, for the first time, recorded a daily coronavirus death toll of more than 3,000as the virus continues its rapid spread across the country. Health experts say the pandemic is virtually out of control and hospitals report being close to collapse.   We've heard a lot about the Covid variant that was first identified in South Africa - whichscientists believe could be more contagiousor more resistant to current vaccines. The strain has now been detected in dozens of other countries. In the UK, there have been 360 cases of the variant. A travel ban is currently in place for South Africa and nine other southern African countries and, while UK residents and Irish nationals are exempt, those arrivals must still quarantine. But is the government targeting enough countries with travel bans? On 16 March,external, the World Health Organisation identified 64 countries where the South Africa variant had been found. Of those, only 11 are on the ""red list"" which bans arrivals. According to Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial College, some countries - including France - are seeing that a significant fraction of their cases are the South Africa variant. He suggested that as there is ""a lot of essential travel"" between the UK and France, the government should consider further measures to reduce the risk of more of the variant reaching the UK.

Olga RobinsonBBC Monitoring Online communities sharing harmful anti-vaccine content have grown significantly during the pandemic,according to new BBC Monitoring researchon seven countries across Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe. Facebook accounts promoting false information about vaccines saw a boost in followers in Brazil, Mexico, India, Ukraine, France, Tanzania and Kenya over the past year. Vaccine misinformation in these countries appears to mainly spread in groups where a range of topics such as health, religion, politics and conspiracy theories are discussed. In Brazil, Mexico, Tanzania and Kenya some religious pages promoted misleading claims and conspiracy theories about vaccines to their large online audiences. In India we found anti-vaccine content was largely driven by individuals promoting traditional medicine. Our research also showed a political and nationalistic dimension to online debates about vaccination in some countries, which often featured criticism of and misleading claims about foreign vaccines. The findings were released on the final day of theBBC's Trust in News conference, at which technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones questioned social media companies about what they have done to tackle disinformation on their platforms. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Prime Minister Boris Johnson has plunged
headlong into an issue thatâs proving controversial within his own party. Speaking to a group of senior MPs earlier this afternoon, Mr Johnson suggested that, as restrictions
ease, people may have to provide proof of vaccination to visit a pub. This, he suggested, would be up to
individual publicans. The prime minister said the
""basic concept of a vaccine certification should not be totally alien to
us"". But the use of vaccine passports, or
certificates, domestically has previously been denounced as ""divisive"" - by none other than Mr Johnsonâs own
vaccines minister. At the same meeting, in answer to another question, Mr Johnson declared that
care home companies would be acting âresponsiblyâ if they required all staff
to be vaccinated. â""It doesnât seem to me to be
irresponsible at all â far from it, it's highly responsible â for care
home companies to think about requiring vaccinations,"" he said, speaking to the Liaisons Committee. There is an ongoing debate inside government over whether to make Covid vaccinations compulsory for social
care workers, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock setting out some of the benefits of this approach, But Unison, which represents staff, opposes mandatory vaccination. Now the prime minister seems to be floating a slightly different solution â by placing responsibility on employers to require that their staff be vaccinated. This will seen by some as
compulsion by the back door -  or what critics have called ""jabs for jobs"". India will open up vaccinations for those over the age of 45 from 1 April India has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, foreign ministry sources have told the BBC. They said rising cases meant domestic demand was expected to pick up in the coming weeks, and so the doses were needed for India's own rollout. The move - described as a ""temporary squeeze"" by officials - is expected to affect supplies until the end of April. Some 190 countries under the Covax scheme are likely to be affected. India's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India (SII), has delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to several countries in recent days, including the UK and Brazil. India has exported more than 60 million vaccine doses to 76 countries so far, with the majority of these being the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. The decision comes as India faces a surge in coronavirus cases. On Wednesday it recorded its sharpest daily rise this year, with more than 47,000 new cases and 275 deaths. There has been no official comment from the government or the Serum Institute on the decision. Read more. Some countries and travel firms are looking at whether people could be asked to prove their Covid status with a vaccine passport Earlier,we heard from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnsonwho was asked about whether Covid vaccination certificates or passports could be used to help British society open up. Asked whether they could be used by pubs to allow people in, Mr Johnson said ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". But the idea has been met with some criticism. Mr Johnson's fellow Conservative MP Steve Baker - a member of the lockdown-sceptic Coronavirus Research Group - has warned that the prime minister âbegan to tread a dangerous path when he opened the door to domestic Covid certificatesâ today. âFirst they said weâll need them to watch the football, and today that it may be papers for the pub. âWhether the state legislates for it, recommends it or simply allows it the result will be the same: a two-tier Britain that prevents pregnant women from taking part in society, given that the government is telling them not to take the vaccine, or one where we turn back the clock and tolerate businesses turning away customers from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine. âWe must not fall into this ghastly trap.â Laura GoodwinBBC Scotland Two separate studies have found that women under the age of 50 had worse long-term outcomes after being in hospital with Covid-19. Research led by Glasgow University followed 327 adults from around the UK who were admitted to hospital between 5 February and 5 October last year. Participants were followed for between three and 11 months. It found that women under 50 had higher odds of worse outcomes when compared with men and older participants - and this was even if the woman had no previous health problems, the study found. They were five times less likely to report feeling fully recovered three months or more after the onset of their infection, twice as likely to report worse fatigue and seven times more likely to be more breathless. We've got more on the findings here. We've found out some more about how the NHS coped during the second wave of the pandemic - and in particular, how intensive care units fared. Two patients were moved to a hospital 300 miles away because of an intensive care bed shortage - and an unprecedented 2,300 intensive care patients were moved between UK hospitals. The data covers the period from September 2020 to March 2021. Front-line doctors, speaking for the first time, say these transfers were the only way to care for patients. And NHS England said the health service had responded well under intense pressure. Read the full story here. The UK and EU have said they are working on creating a ""win-win"" situation and to expand vaccine supply for all citizens, as the row involving demand for the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab continues. The UK government and European Commission have just released a joint statement. âWe are all facing the same pandemic and
the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,"" it reads. ""We have been discussing what more we can
do to ensure a reciprocally beneficial relationship between the UK and EU on
Covid-19. ""Given our interdependencies, we are
working on specific steps we can take - in the short-, medium - and long term -
to create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all our citizens. ""In the end, openness and global
co-operation of all countries will be key to finally overcome this pandemic and
ensure better preparation for meeting future challenges. ""We will continue our discussions.â Earlier the government published its daily coronavirus figures, showing another 5,605 cases had been confirmed and a further 98 people had died with the virus. This continues the trend of a falling number of deaths, although the decline in cases has slowed. Meanwhile, the vaccine rollout continues. As our graphs show, more than 31 million jabs have now been administered of which more than 28 million are people's first doses. The Vatican said cuts were being made ""with the aim of safeguarding current jobs"" The Vatican's income has plummeted during the pandemic as museums and other attractions such as St Peter's Basilica have been forced to close. It's now expecting a deficit of â¬50m (Â£43m) this year. Pope Francis has now ordered pay cuts for cardinals and other clerics starting from next month. Cardinals are believed to receive up to â¬5,000 (Â£4,300) a month and often live in subsidised accommodation - but will now have their pay reduced by 10%. Priests and other clerics will see their salaries cut by between 3% and 8% and planned salary increases will be suspended until March 2023. The pope, who is the head of the Catholic Church, has previously said he does not want to fire people in difficult economic times. Read the full story here. Boris Johnson has been answering questions from a committee of senior MPs As we've been reporting, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been facing questions from MPs this afternoon about a whole range of issues - including about the government's handling of the pandemic. He is up in front of the liaison committee, which is made up of all the MPs who lead the different parliamentary committees, and which gets to grill the PM a few times each year. Conservative MP William Wragg asks what Johnson's thoughts are on vaccine certificates, for example proof of a vaccine that could allow someone to do certain things. Could they be used for ordinary people to be allowed into pub, for example? The prime minister says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". You can read more about vaccine passports here.A government review, which is being led by Michael Gove, is due to consider whether a vaccine passport could be also be used to allow visitors entry to venues such as bars, theatres or sports stadiums. Today's daily coronavirus figures have beenpublished by the government.,external They show another 5,605 cases have been recorded, and a further 98 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. Meanwhile the latest vaccination figures show that more than 28.6 million people have now had their first dose, after another 325,650 first doses given yesterday. Fellow Conservative William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee - has asked the PM about the possibility of international travel this summer. The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and thereafter he will ""be setting out what may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". He agrees there is a wide spectrum of scientific opinion on the matter, but assures his colleague advisors advise but ministers will decide. The Labour chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Yvette Cooper, has asked Boris Johnson why France has not been put on the UK's red list, given the rise in cases and new variants. The prime minister explains that putting a countryon the ""red list"",externalhas consequences for the supply of medicines and foods to the UK - a nod to the huge haulage industry that sees goods crossing the channel -  but the PM concedes ""we will have to look at tougher measures"" if the circumstances change. Cooper says 20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two-thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions - she wants to know why hauliers are not being tested in the UK. Johnson says the numbers have ""massively diminished"" in recent months - but says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel"" and ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Why is the PM not taking action now, asks Cooper? Johnson says there is ""a balance to be struck"" given the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Labour MP Meg Hillier asks Boris Johnson what his biggest regret is over the past year. The prime minister prevaricates, saying he ""wouldn't want to make a mistake about my biggest mistake and single out the wrong one"" but commits once again to ""a proper inquiry in due course"". Hillier homes in on the Test and Trace programme and asks the prime minister if he is ""content"" with having committed Â£37bn to it. Johnson says Test and Trace has been ""an extraordinary achievement"", adding 80% of the money goes on labs and testing, which is ""desperately needed"". It has given us ""the tools to fight"" the virus, he states. He says the data derived from the Test and Trace programme, in terms of new variants and where they have been arisen, has allowed the government to study ""what is happening with the pandemic in a very granular way"". He insists it has been of ""crucial importance"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is appearing before a special House of Commons committee made up of senior politicians who have been grilling him on a range of issues. Asked about the potential threat of the European Union restricting Covid vaccine exports, he said the co-operation the UK has with the EU is ""very important"" and he doesn't believe blockades ""are sensible"". Long-term damage done by blockades can be ""very considerable"", he told the chairman of the Health Committee Conservative Jeremy Hunt. Anyone considering a blockade may want to think about how companies would view a country where such things are imposed, he warns. Hunt asks if nothing will be ""taken off the table"" to make sure the UK gets vaccines. Johnson says ""we will do everything that is necessary"" to make sure that people get their vaccines. Would you like a Covid test with your chips? Some US residents can now get one alongside a meal after food ordering service DoorDash announced they'll deliver at-home tests to cities across the country. Two types of tests will be available - a nasal swab or a saliva sample - the company said. Both can yield results within 24 to 48 hours. It is the first such scheme to be launched by a delivery service. ""Amidst the pandemic, one of our priorities has been to make health and wellness essentials more accessible for customers, and we will continue to expand our offerings in the healthcare space,"" a spokesperson for DoorDash said. The prices and availability of testing kits in the US vary, though the ones offered by DoorDash range in price from $109 (Â£79) to $119 (Â£87) and may require a video call with medical personnel during the test.

"About 70,000 students attend Northern Ireland's further education colleges Hundreds of lecturers at further education colleges in Northern Ireland are holding a one-day strike. Staff belonging to the University and College Union (UCU) aretaking the action in a dispute over pay and workload. But the Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said the union rejected a pay offer amounting to a 7% rise. The UCU said their members in further education colleges had only received a 3.8% pay rise since 2013/14. About 70,000 students attend Northern Ireland's six Further Education (FE) colleges, according to figures from the Department for the Economy (DfE). Many of those students take vocational courses and many study part-time. The UCU said the Department for the Economy had failed to increase FE college funding so that employers could pay staff fairly. But BBC News NI has obtained a letter from Ms Dodds to Stormont's economy committee in which she said she did not have any ""direct role"" in the dispute. ""Further education colleges are employers in their own right and are responsible for determining the terms and conditions of lecturing staff,"" she wrote. However, the minister claimed the UCU action would have ""a detrimental effect on some of the most vulnerable learners, many of whom are already struggling to cope with the impact of a prolonged period of online learning and social isolation"". Many students in further education take vocational courses She told the committee the College Employers' Forum (CEF) had made an offer to trade unions of a 7% pay rise ""which they consider could be met from within existing budgets"". The CEF is made up of the chairs and chief executives of Northern Ireland's six FE colleges. ""Trade Union Side then submitted a pay claim seeking 11.7% and advising that the 7% offer was unacceptable,"" Ms Dodds wrote. But in a separate statement the UCU said the 7% pay offer was spread over a four-year period. UCU said it was ""barely better than pay restraint and fails to adequately compensate for the years when lecturers received no cost of living increases at all"". Further education lecturers to strike over pay Teachers agree new pay deal to end dispute The UCU official in Northern Ireland Katharine Clarke said as DfE determined funding to FE colleges they were ""clearly responsible for stagnating pay"". ""UCU members are going on strike because they have received a paltry 3.8% increase in total since 2013/14,"" she said. ""School teachers have received 11.25% over the same period. ""The offer of 7% over four years in the context of the previous capped awards equates to 1.2% per year over a nine-year period. ""No other workforce in the public sector has been subject to such a derisory increase."" But in Ms Dodds' letter, she said she had no authority to intervene in talks between the colleges and unions and that DfE would only become involved when agreement was reached. ""It is only when agreement has been reached through that process that a business case is submitted to the Department for appraisal,"" she said. ""Should the business case be considered to be sufficiently robust it can then be approved and consideration given to meeting any additional resource requirements."" Ms Dodds also said UCU did not represent all lecturers in FE colleges, as many were members of the NASUWT and NEU. She also claimed unions had also rejected a previous three-year pay offer of an increase of over 10% in 2020 without balloting their members, and concluded by urging the unions and employers to resume negotiations. But the UCU accused Ms Dodds of failing to meet them and of ""shirking her responsibility"" for underfunding FE colleges. The union said strike action would be followed by action short of a strike unless the minister and department ""secure more funding for colleges and a proper pay rise for college lecturers"". That action short of strike will see UCU members refusing to work overtime, and boycotting any un-agreed additional duties. Monica Goligher, a lecturer in biology at Belfast Met, is among those taking part in Wednesday's strike. She told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme she believes striking staff will have the support of their students and the wider public because ""they appreciate what we do"". Ms Goligher said lecturers' workload had ""imploded"" since their most recent contract was negotiated in 2009, and had increased further as a result of the pandemic. Staff have taken on a ""huge administrative burden"" as well as additional teaching requirements over those last 12 years, she explained. ""That has been compounded by moving to teach online, practically in full, since last March with less than 24 hours to prepare to do that."" Ms Goligher was asked if their pay claim was justified, given that nurses who are risking their lives working on the frontline during the coronavirus pandemic have been offered a 1% pay rise. ""We are the people who will step [up] to retrain, re-skill those who have lost their jobs in industries that have been particularly impacted by Covid and the ongoing economic difficulties,"" she replied. ""Minister Dodds can decide whether that is going to be a task that she is asking of a demotivated, demoralised and exhausted workforce in further education.""

"Natural gas supplier, Firmus energy, has announced a 14% price increase for customers in greater Belfast. The tariff change on 15 April will affect more than 50,000 consumers. The firm said the move is in response to an increase in global wholesale prices. Bills for the average household will rise by Â£1.32 per week. Firmus said the increase follows two price reductions totalling 20% over the last 18 months. The greater Belfast network area covers Belfast, Lisburn, Bangor, Holywood, Groomsport, Carryduff, Comber, Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus among other areas. Firmus Energy to cut some gas prices by 12% Gas bill cut of over 20% for some Firmus customers Earlier this month, the company announced prices in its Ten Towns network would increase by 17.75% from 1 April. ""We know that price stability is important for our customers but the increase of wholesale natural gas costs on the global market, which are beyond our control, have unfortunately made this increase inevitable,"" said Michael Scott, managing director of Firmus. ""Any increase is never welcome news and we recognise this comes at a particularly difficult time for many. ""We want to assure our customers that we will continue to monitor and review our tariffs to ensure customers are getting the best prices possible."" The Consumer Council said the latest price rise was ""unwelcome news"" for Firmus customers, following the price rise for customers in the Ten Towns network. However, Raymond Gormley from the Consumer Council said his organisation understood ""the main driver for the increase is the significant rise in the cost of wholesale gas globally over the last year"". ""Consumers who are experiencing financial difficulty and are struggling to pay their energy bills should contact their supplier without delay to talk about how they can help during these times,"" he added. Mr Gormley also encouraged customers to ""shop around to ensure they are on the best energy deal"".

"Many clothes retailers have been left with excess stock to sell at discount and some shops have closed for good. Sharply lower clothes prices and cheaper second-hand cars caused an unexpected fall in the UK's inflation rate in February. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate fell to 0.4% last month, down from 0.7% in January. Economists had expected inflation to rise slightly, driven by increasing fuel and energy prices. But the impact of rising fuel costs was offset by downward pressures in other areas, including travel costs and toys. February is traditionally a month where clothing prices would rise. But ONS deputy national statistician, Jonathan Athow said: ""The impact of the pandemic has disrupted standard seasonal patterns."" What is the UK's inflation rate? Clothing and footwear prices fell between January and February for the first time since 2007 and are 5.7% lower than a year before, the biggest annual decline since November 2009. The ONS said second-hand car prices had been rising during 2020 as people sought alternatives to using public transport. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon, said that despite inflation's ""sudden drop due to temporary weakness in clothing prices"" he still expected the rate to exceed 2% later this year. ""The lockdown has left clothing retailers with considerable excess stock to shift. Clothing prices likely have rebounded this month, now that retailers have introduced new seasonal ranges,"" he said. Jobless crisis shows signs of easing UK outlook 'uncertain' despite vaccine, says Bank Hannah Audino, economist at PwC, said that as lockdowns ease, inflation will tick higher as consumers ""unleash some of the Â£150bn of excess savings on the economy"" built up during 2020. ""Businesses will also be looking to recoup lost revenues from the past year, although the extension to the VAT cut for the hospitality and leisure sector will continue to exert some downward pressure on prices,"" she said. Many economists had predicted inflation would rise slightly in February to about 0.8%, driven higher by a big rise in fuel prices. The ONS said,externalthat between January and February petrol prices rose by 3.6 pence per litre, and diesel prices rose by 3.4 pence per litre. Fuel prices fell in the same period last year. Crude oil prices have been rising, which is expected to feed through into even higher costs at the pump, and household energy bills are also increasing after suppliers raised prices. Wednesday's data came a week after the Bank of England had warned that the inflation rate would approach its 2% target level in the coming months, mainly due to energy price increases. The BoE also left record-low interest rates at 0.1% last week and forecast that economic growth would recover towards pre-Covid levels this year. That expectation of faster growth was underlined on Wednesday in a survey that indicated the pace of new orders being placed by companies was increasing. The IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index,externalrose to a seven-month high of 56.6 in March from 49.6 in February, which was much higher than economists' forecasts. A figure above 50 denotes expansion. IHS chief business economist Chris Williamson said the surge in order activity, along with recent better news on jobs growth, ""point to robust economic growth in the second quarter, especially if virus restrictions are lifted further"".

"This video can not be played WATCH: Police raid the home of a vaccine-text fraudster More than 6,000 cases of Covid-related fraud and cyber-crime have been recorded by the UK's police forces during the pandemic. The Action Fraud team said Â£34.5m had been stolen since 1 March 2020. It covers activity in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not Scotland. In a related development, the National Cyber Security Centre has told the BBC it is tackling about 30 ""significant attacks"" a month against the country's pandemic response infrastructure. These involves attempts to breach the NHS, vaccine producers and vaccine supply chains, among other organisations. ""There unfortunately have been a number of successful ransomware incidents against businesses - I can think of roughly around 10,"" NCSC operations director Paul Chichester said. This is one of the scripts used to con victims to believe they were talking to their bank Other figures disclosed by City of London Police, which co-ordinates efforts to combat fraud, include: more than 150 related arrests were made since the pandemic began more than 2,000 websites, phone numbers and email addresses linked to the crimes were taken down there was a total of 416,000 reports of fraud and cyber-crime The activity peaked between April and May 2020, and January 2021 - both times when lockdowns were in force. The Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit, which tackles criminal gangs responsible for financial fraud and scams, worked with social media platforms to take down over 700 accounts linked to fraudulent activity in 2020, of which over 250 were money mule recruiters. But this may be the tip of the iceberg. The National Crime Agency estimates that just one in five fraud cases are typically reported to the police. And the volunteer-run Cyber Helpline told the BBC only a quarter of those who had contacted it after a cyber-attack said they had also reported the incident to the police. Many of the scams involved conning people out of their money and financial details by focusing on internet shopping. Related fraud was 42% higher over the pandemic than the preceding year, as criminals took advantage of the fact many physical stores had been forced to close. Anna - not her real name - from Cheltenham was one of thousands of people who received an SMS message asking her to go online and rearrange a parcel delivery. She filled in her details, but later suspected something was wrong. She alerted her bank and cancelled her bank card. Anna came close to being thousands of pounds out of pocket ""I thought, now I have nothing to worry about, everything is fine and case closed,"" she told the BBC. But the criminals used the details they had already obtained to authorise her bank to credit her account with a Â£9,000 loan. And a short while later they called her, pretending to be the bank. Not realising the scam, Anna told them she had not taken out a loan. ""They gave me the sort code and bank account number I needed to pay back the loan, and said if I paid the Â£9,000 there wouldn't be any charges. ""But then I was still feeling suspicious, so I Googled the sort code, and it came up with a completely different bank."" So, Anna called her bank directly and realised the scammers had returned. ""I didn't lose any money but it did feel like a real burglary to be honest,"" she said. She closed her account, and changed her email address and mobile number. But she still does not feel safe. Charities are also common targets. One in three charities suffered a cyber-attack during the first 10 months of the pandemic, according to Ecclesiastical Insurance. One victim actually specialises in offering cyber-security advice to others. Hackers got inside Charity Digital's network for seven days without being detected. They compromised its email accounts and sent false invoices to clients. The organisation's chief executive, Jonathan Chevallier, told the BBC the breach had not been noticed in part because all his staff had been working from home. Charity Digital spent more than Â£10,000 investigating the attack and has produced an online webinar to help others avoid a similar fate. Another popular type of cyber-fraud involved romance scams, in which people looking for relationships via the net often get fooled into sending money to prospective partners, who prey on their emotions. This type of crime was 20% more common over the past year than the one before. Fraudsters sometimes use ""Sim farms"" to send texts - this unit holds eight cards to quickly send multiple messages at once City of London Police also said key workers had also been specifically targeted. In one case, a man was arrested on suspicion of using social media to advertise bogus car insurance policies to NHS workers. The pandemic appears, however, to have coincided with a fall in one type of cyber-crime. Reported cases of computer software service fraud - in which criminals call offering fake tech support to fool victims into sharing their payment card details and other credentials - dropped by 15.5%.

"Vaccine campaigns across Europe have started slowly, blamed partly on delayed deliveries The UK and the European Union have said they are working together to improve their relationship, after weeks of tensions over Covid vaccine supplies. In a joint statement, they said they wanted to ""create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all"". The European Commission earlier proposed tougher export controls on vaccines, amid tensions over supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that ""blockades"" were not ""sensible"". The joint UK-EU statement said that ""openness and global co-operation"" would be key to tackling the pandemic. ""We are all facing the same pandemic and the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,"" it said. ""We will continue our discussions."" Why is the EU having vaccine problems? EU tussle with UK over AstraZeneca jabs escalates PM's vaccines comments set tongues wagging But there was little harmony earlier on Wednesday when the Commission announced plans for all vaccine shipments to be assessed on the destination country's rate of vaccinations and exports. The proposals, which will be put before EU leaders on Thursday, are seen as focused on the UK and US in particular. The tone of the EU-UK statement was positive, but actual progress between the two sides was described to me by an EU diplomat as ""slow, cumbersome and difficult"". On both sides. That doesn't mean impossible, but at their summit on Thursday, some EU leaders - along with the European Commission - will still be pushing for tougher controls on vaccine exports. And they could hit the UK. EU insiders say they had hoped never to use the controls. They say they want them as a means of exerting pressure on vaccine companies and on countries with vaccine production sites that are not exporting to the EU. With a third wave of the pandemic hitting much of mainland Europe, EU leaders are coming under increasing pressure to show voters they are taking action to ramp up both the supply of jabs and their vaccine rollout, on both of which they are trailing behind the UK. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides rejected a suggestion that the aim was to punish the UK. ""We're dealing with a pandemic and this is not seeking to punish any countries,"" she said. Asked whether the UK might retaliate, Mr Johnson told MPs he did not believe ""that blockades of either vaccines or of medicines, of ingredients for vaccines"" would be ""sensible"". Companies might draw conclusions about future investments ""in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed"", he added. Meanwhile, in other developments: Amid continuing anger in Europe at AstraZeneca, aFrenchgovernment spokesman said the UK-Swedish company's failure to deliver on its commitments was ""totally unacceptable"" InItaly, police raided a plant where 29 million AstraZeneca doses had been processed. An EU official told the BBC he asked for the weekend raid to ensure everything was on track Meanwhile inGermany,Chancellor Angela Merkel made a dramatic U-turnand cancelled a planned five-day lockdown over Easter following widespread criticism. ""This mistake is my mistake alone,"" she said EU states are trying to speed up their vaccination campaigns after a sluggish start. Italy's PM said he wanted to increase the country's rate of inoculations per day from 170,000 to half a million Some 19 EU states are recording a rise in infections - these includePoland, SpainandFrance The tougher export controls are most like to affect countries that have higher vaccination rates than the EU, such as the UK and US. The key criteria for the proposed regulations are ""reciprocity"" and ""proportionality"": The EU says there is no reciprocity if a country importing vaccines from the EU restricts exports itself either by law or other means, so ""it may be appropriate to consider whether exports to this country are justified"" Member states and the Commission will also consider the epidemiological situation in that non-EU country, its vaccination rate and existing availability of Covid-19 vaccines There will be no outright export bans, which are opposed by countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium. Vaccine manufacturers would be assessed to see if they were fulfilling their contract with the EU, although no specific algorithm is planned. In an interview with the BBC, the EU's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton insisted the bloc's issues were with AstraZeneca and not the UK government. ""I know that there's some tension... but as long as we have transparency, I think [relations] will be able to be normalised,"" he said. He said if AstraZeneca had provided the agreed 120 million doses to the EU, member states would have been at the same rate of vaccination as the UK: ""We have been heavily penalised and we just want to understand why"". AstraZeneca denies that it is failing to honour its contract with the EU. This video can not be played Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton says the EU has been ""heavily penalised"" and wants to know why A UK government spokesperson said: ""We are all fighting the same pandemic. Vaccines are an international operation; they are produced by collaboration by great scientists around the world. And we will continue to work with our European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout."" Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen complained that the EU had exported more than 10 million doses to the UK, but the UK had so far exported none in return. Her colleagues added that this had to be seen in the context of the EU being both a global Covid hotspot and also the biggest exporter of vaccines. Since the end of January, EU countries have exported 43 million doses of vaccine to 33 countries not subject to export authorisation, they say. UK sources insist vital components are being sent to the continent, for example for the Pfizer vaccine, and they have emphasised the UK's role in investing early in vaccine development, BBC correspondent Nick Beake reports.

India has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, sources have told the BBC. Rising cases in India are putting pressure on the domestic supply chain - but there has been no official comment from the Indian government. China is stepping up its vaccine rollout, with plans to inoculate 40% of its 1.4 billion population by the end of June. So far,82.8 million people have received jabs,external, with China currently focusing on vaccinating people aged between 18 and 59. Chancellor Angela Merkel has made an extraordinary plea to the German people to forgive her,after she cancelled a strict Easter lockdown just a day after announcing it.She admitted there was not enough time to implement the shutdown; it had been met with resistance from business leaders. Brazil has, for the first time, recorded a daily coronavirus death toll of more than 3,000as the virus continues its rapid spread across the country. Health experts say the pandemic is virtually out of control and hospitals report being close to collapse.   We've heard a lot about the Covid variant that was first identified in South Africa - whichscientists believe could be more contagiousor more resistant to current vaccines. The strain has now been detected in dozens of other countries. In the UK, there have been 360 cases of the variant. A travel ban is currently in place for South Africa and nine other southern African countries and, while UK residents and Irish nationals are exempt, those arrivals must still quarantine. But is the government targeting enough countries with travel bans? On 16 March,external, the World Health Organisation identified 64 countries where the South Africa variant had been found. Of those, only 11 are on the ""red list"" which bans arrivals. According to Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial College, some countries - including France - are seeing that a significant fraction of their cases are the South Africa variant. He suggested that as there is ""a lot of essential travel"" between the UK and France, the government should consider further measures to reduce the risk of more of the variant reaching the UK.

Olga RobinsonBBC Monitoring Online communities sharing harmful anti-vaccine content have grown significantly during the pandemic,according to new BBC Monitoring researchon seven countries across Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe. Facebook accounts promoting false information about vaccines saw a boost in followers in Brazil, Mexico, India, Ukraine, France, Tanzania and Kenya over the past year. Vaccine misinformation in these countries appears to mainly spread in groups where a range of topics such as health, religion, politics and conspiracy theories are discussed. In Brazil, Mexico, Tanzania and Kenya some religious pages promoted misleading claims and conspiracy theories about vaccines to their large online audiences. In India we found anti-vaccine content was largely driven by individuals promoting traditional medicine. Our research also showed a political and nationalistic dimension to online debates about vaccination in some countries, which often featured criticism of and misleading claims about foreign vaccines. The findings were released on the final day of theBBC's Trust in News conference, at which technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones questioned social media companies about what they have done to tackle disinformation on their platforms. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Prime Minister Boris Johnson has plunged
headlong into an issue thatâs proving controversial within his own party. Speaking to a group of senior MPs earlier this afternoon, Mr Johnson suggested that, as restrictions
ease, people may have to provide proof of vaccination to visit a pub. This, he suggested, would be up to
individual publicans. The prime minister said the
""basic concept of a vaccine certification should not be totally alien to
us"". But the use of vaccine passports, or
certificates, domestically has previously been denounced as ""divisive"" - by none other than Mr Johnsonâs own
vaccines minister. At the same meeting, in answer to another question, Mr Johnson declared that
care home companies would be acting âresponsiblyâ if they required all staff
to be vaccinated. â""It doesnât seem to me to be
irresponsible at all â far from it, it's highly responsible â for care
home companies to think about requiring vaccinations,"" he said, speaking to the Liaisons Committee. There is an ongoing debate inside government over whether to make Covid vaccinations compulsory for social
care workers, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock setting out some of the benefits of this approach, But Unison, which represents staff, opposes mandatory vaccination. Now the prime minister seems to be floating a slightly different solution â by placing responsibility on employers to require that their staff be vaccinated. This will seen by some as
compulsion by the back door -  or what critics have called ""jabs for jobs"". India will open up vaccinations for those over the age of 45 from 1 April India has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, foreign ministry sources have told the BBC. They said rising cases meant domestic demand was expected to pick up in the coming weeks, and so the doses were needed for India's own rollout. The move - described as a ""temporary squeeze"" by officials - is expected to affect supplies until the end of April. Some 190 countries under the Covax scheme are likely to be affected. India's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India (SII), has delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to several countries in recent days, including the UK and Brazil. India has exported more than 60 million vaccine doses to 76 countries so far, with the majority of these being the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. The decision comes as India faces a surge in coronavirus cases. On Wednesday it recorded its sharpest daily rise this year, with more than 47,000 new cases and 275 deaths. There has been no official comment from the government or the Serum Institute on the decision. Read more. Some countries and travel firms are looking at whether people could be asked to prove their Covid status with a vaccine passport Earlier,we heard from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnsonwho was asked about whether Covid vaccination certificates or passports could be used to help British society open up. Asked whether they could be used by pubs to allow people in, Mr Johnson said ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". But the idea has been met with some criticism. Mr Johnson's fellow Conservative MP Steve Baker - a member of the lockdown-sceptic Coronavirus Research Group - has warned that the prime minister âbegan to tread a dangerous path when he opened the door to domestic Covid certificatesâ today. âFirst they said weâll need them to watch the football, and today that it may be papers for the pub. âWhether the state legislates for it, recommends it or simply allows it the result will be the same: a two-tier Britain that prevents pregnant women from taking part in society, given that the government is telling them not to take the vaccine, or one where we turn back the clock and tolerate businesses turning away customers from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine. âWe must not fall into this ghastly trap.â Laura GoodwinBBC Scotland Two separate studies have found that women under the age of 50 had worse long-term outcomes after being in hospital with Covid-19. Research led by Glasgow University followed 327 adults from around the UK who were admitted to hospital between 5 February and 5 October last year. Participants were followed for between three and 11 months. It found that women under 50 had higher odds of worse outcomes when compared with men and older participants - and this was even if the woman had no previous health problems, the study found. They were five times less likely to report feeling fully recovered three months or more after the onset of their infection, twice as likely to report worse fatigue and seven times more likely to be more breathless. We've got more on the findings here. We've found out some more about how the NHS coped during the second wave of the pandemic - and in particular, how intensive care units fared. Two patients were moved to a hospital 300 miles away because of an intensive care bed shortage - and an unprecedented 2,300 intensive care patients were moved between UK hospitals. The data covers the period from September 2020 to March 2021. Front-line doctors, speaking for the first time, say these transfers were the only way to care for patients. And NHS England said the health service had responded well under intense pressure. Read the full story here. The UK and EU have said they are working on creating a ""win-win"" situation and to expand vaccine supply for all citizens, as the row involving demand for the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab continues. The UK government and European Commission have just released a joint statement. âWe are all facing the same pandemic and
the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,"" it reads. ""We have been discussing what more we can
do to ensure a reciprocally beneficial relationship between the UK and EU on
Covid-19. ""Given our interdependencies, we are
working on specific steps we can take - in the short-, medium - and long term -
to create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all our citizens. ""In the end, openness and global
co-operation of all countries will be key to finally overcome this pandemic and
ensure better preparation for meeting future challenges. ""We will continue our discussions.â Earlier the government published its daily coronavirus figures, showing another 5,605 cases had been confirmed and a further 98 people had died with the virus. This continues the trend of a falling number of deaths, although the decline in cases has slowed. Meanwhile, the vaccine rollout continues. As our graphs show, more than 31 million jabs have now been administered of which more than 28 million are people's first doses. The Vatican said cuts were being made ""with the aim of safeguarding current jobs"" The Vatican's income has plummeted during the pandemic as museums and other attractions such as St Peter's Basilica have been forced to close. It's now expecting a deficit of â¬50m (Â£43m) this year. Pope Francis has now ordered pay cuts for cardinals and other clerics starting from next month. Cardinals are believed to receive up to â¬5,000 (Â£4,300) a month and often live in subsidised accommodation - but will now have their pay reduced by 10%. Priests and other clerics will see their salaries cut by between 3% and 8% and planned salary increases will be suspended until March 2023. The pope, who is the head of the Catholic Church, has previously said he does not want to fire people in difficult economic times. Read the full story here. Boris Johnson has been answering questions from a committee of senior MPs As we've been reporting, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been facing questions from MPs this afternoon about a whole range of issues - including about the government's handling of the pandemic. He is up in front of the liaison committee, which is made up of all the MPs who lead the different parliamentary committees, and which gets to grill the PM a few times each year. Conservative MP William Wragg asks what Johnson's thoughts are on vaccine certificates, for example proof of a vaccine that could allow someone to do certain things. Could they be used for ordinary people to be allowed into pub, for example? The prime minister says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". You can read more about vaccine passports here.A government review, which is being led by Michael Gove, is due to consider whether a vaccine passport could be also be used to allow visitors entry to venues such as bars, theatres or sports stadiums. Today's daily coronavirus figures have beenpublished by the government.,external They show another 5,605 cases have been recorded, and a further 98 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. Meanwhile the latest vaccination figures show that more than 28.6 million people have now had their first dose, after another 325,650 first doses given yesterday. Fellow Conservative William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee - has asked the PM about the possibility of international travel this summer. The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and thereafter he will ""be setting out what may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". He agrees there is a wide spectrum of scientific opinion on the matter, but assures his colleague advisors advise but ministers will decide. The Labour chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Yvette Cooper, has asked Boris Johnson why France has not been put on the UK's red list, given the rise in cases and new variants. The prime minister explains that putting a countryon the ""red list"",externalhas consequences for the supply of medicines and foods to the UK - a nod to the huge haulage industry that sees goods crossing the channel -  but the PM concedes ""we will have to look at tougher measures"" if the circumstances change. Cooper says 20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two-thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions - she wants to know why hauliers are not being tested in the UK. Johnson says the numbers have ""massively diminished"" in recent months - but says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel"" and ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Why is the PM not taking action now, asks Cooper? Johnson says there is ""a balance to be struck"" given the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Labour MP Meg Hillier asks Boris Johnson what his biggest regret is over the past year. The prime minister prevaricates, saying he ""wouldn't want to make a mistake about my biggest mistake and single out the wrong one"" but commits once again to ""a proper inquiry in due course"". Hillier homes in on the Test and Trace programme and asks the prime minister if he is ""content"" with having committed Â£37bn to it. Johnson says Test and Trace has been ""an extraordinary achievement"", adding 80% of the money goes on labs and testing, which is ""desperately needed"". It has given us ""the tools to fight"" the virus, he states. He says the data derived from the Test and Trace programme, in terms of new variants and where they have been arisen, has allowed the government to study ""what is happening with the pandemic in a very granular way"". He insists it has been of ""crucial importance"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is appearing before a special House of Commons committee made up of senior politicians who have been grilling him on a range of issues. Asked about the potential threat of the European Union restricting Covid vaccine exports, he said the co-operation the UK has with the EU is ""very important"" and he doesn't believe blockades ""are sensible"". Long-term damage done by blockades can be ""very considerable"", he told the chairman of the Health Committee Conservative Jeremy Hunt. Anyone considering a blockade may want to think about how companies would view a country where such things are imposed, he warns. Hunt asks if nothing will be ""taken off the table"" to make sure the UK gets vaccines. Johnson says ""we will do everything that is necessary"" to make sure that people get their vaccines. Would you like a Covid test with your chips? Some US residents can now get one alongside a meal after food ordering service DoorDash announced they'll deliver at-home tests to cities across the country. Two types of tests will be available - a nasal swab or a saliva sample - the company said. Both can yield results within 24 to 48 hours. It is the first such scheme to be launched by a delivery service. ""Amidst the pandemic, one of our priorities has been to make health and wellness essentials more accessible for customers, and we will continue to expand our offerings in the healthcare space,"" a spokesperson for DoorDash said. The prices and availability of testing kits in the US vary, though the ones offered by DoorDash range in price from $109 (Â£79) to $119 (Â£87) and may require a video call with medical personnel during the test.

"      By Nick Southall For more than 60 years, John Kingston suspected his stepfather had been more than just a guard working for the local council in his hometown in Eastern Europe during World War Two. He became convinced Stanislaw “Stan” Chrzanowski was a Nazi war criminal who had evaded justice. And on several occasions, he tried, but failed, to persuade the UK authorities to prosecute. John amassed a hoard of evidence – photos, documents and secretly recorded phone conversations. For 20 years, it was stored in his attic. I got to know John in 2016 and began my own investigations into Stan’s War-time activities. But it was only when John died - and all the material in his attic was gifted to me - that possible new evidence emerged as to why Stan was never charged.  A BBC News investigation has found that an alleged Nazi war criminal, who settled in the UK, could have worked for British intelligence during the Cold War. Before he died, German officials were investigating Stanislaw Chrzanowski for the War-time murders of Jewish people and others in Belarus. He had previously been interviewed, but never charged, by UK police. Now, Chrzanowski, who had boasted to his stepson he had an “English secret”, has turned up on 1950s film footage from Berlin. And Jewish leaders are calling for an investigation into whether he, and others like him, were protected from prosecution because they spied for the UK.  By Nick Southall For more than 60 years, John Kingston suspected his stepfather had been more than just a guard working for the local council in his hometown in Eastern Europe during World War Two. He became convinced Stanislaw “Stan” Chrzanowski was a Nazi war criminal who had evaded justice. And on several occasions, he tried, but failed, to persuade the UK authorities to prosecute. John amassed a hoard of evidence – photos, documents and secretly recorded phone conversations. For 20 years, it was stored in his attic. I got to know John in 2016 and began my own investigations into Stan’s War-time activities. But it was only when John died – and all the material in his attic was gifted to me – that possible new evidence emerged as to why Stan was never charged.  John’s mother, Barbara, met Stan in 1954 - at a Polish club in Handsworth, Birmingham. Her head was turned by the handsome foreigner who loved to dance. Stan told her he had arrived, with other Polish soldiers, in Liverpool, in 1946 – the year after the War ended. And he had been brought up in Slonim – a town in Poland when War broke out but now in Belarus. Barbara was so taken with Stan she asked him to join her and her two children that summer, on their caravan holiday at Rhyl, Denbighshire . John, aged nine at the time, called it “the holiday when everything changed”. At first, he was in awe of his new father figure. “So much about him was fascinating and foreign,” John said. “I sort of admired him and wanted to be like him.” Stan told the Kingstons he had worked at a sawmill in Slonim at the start of the War until, in 1943, the Nazis had made him become a civilian guard. He had managed to escape, in 1944, became a prisoner of war, and then joined the Polish military to fight with the Allies. The family had no reason to doubt the story. The factory worker moved into the Kingstons’ home, in Balsall Heath, Birmingham. John as a child At home, he taught John how to jump off walls like a paratrooper – and bought him a toy German Luger pistol so he could play soldiers in the rubble of the city’s many bomb sites. But slowly, another Stan started to reveal himself. Young John was affected deeply, both physically and mentally. “It was a nightmare growing up with him,” he told me. “He was a very dangerous man.” Stan had a fierce temper and brought pieces of rubber flex back from work to whip both John and the family dog. “I was covered in welts,” John said. At bedtime, Stan told John war stories. They were exciting at first but gradually became more sinister. Stan described horrific events when the Nazis arrived in Slonim. He had spoken about people being tortured and interrogated, John said. “Sometimes he would talk about babies being grabbed by the ankles and smashed against the corner of a building,” he said. “And he would demonstrate how it was done.” Stan said he had seen such atrocities through binoculars. But John told me the stories had been so vivid it was as though Stan had committed the crimes himself. John with his stepfather Stan and mother Barbara John’s mental health suffered while living with Stan. And as a young adult, he became desperate to leave home. At the same time, he began to question Stan’s background. Had his stepfather actually worked for the Nazis? John eventually met Sheila, whom he married. And they moved to a new life in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire. But their marriage would see terrible heartbreak. Four of their six children would die young. In particular, the loss of their 17-year-old son Gerry – from meningitis – hit John hard. Cumulative grief brought him to a point where he found himself overwhelmed by what he felt was a terrible injustice. He believed the only father figure he had known had done terrible things – even possibly to children – yet was free to carry on with his life.

He believed the only father figure he had known had done terrible things – even possibly to children – yet was free to carry on with his life. And then, he spotted the chance to do something about it.  In March 1988, John saw a notice in a national newspaper. It was asking for information about alleged criminals living in the UK who had been responsible for “genocide, murder or manslaughter in Germany or German-occupied territories” in World War Two. The government had set up an inquiry after being given a list of suspects by Nazi investigators at the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said at the time, according to security expert Prof Anthony Glees, failing to check the men’s backgrounds at the end of the War made the UK “look like a [Latin American] banana republic”. John was convinced Stan was one of the men who had slipped through the net – not “just a guard” for Slonim’s local council, as he had claimed. He wrote to the inquiry outlining the dreadful things Stan had told him. Letters passed back and forth. And police officers interviewed Stan. But John was told “no further action” would be taken because of a lack of evidence. Stan now knew about John’s suspicions and had clearly been spooked by the police questioning. He applied for travel visas to Russia, Poland and Canada, where he had War-time friends and relatives. And as wider police investigations continued, three of Stan’s old comrades – who had also settled in the UK – died. One suspect, who had chosen Stan as best man for his wedding, killed himself. Convinced of Stan’s guilt, John carried on investigating his stepfather. And then one day, while visiting Stan’s bungalow, in Telford, he managed to copy one of the War-time photos hidden under Stan’s bed.    In March 1988, John saw a notice in a national newspaper.

Convinced of Stan’s guilt, John carried on investigating his stepfather. And then one day, while visiting Stan’s bungalow, in Telford, he managed to copy one of the War-time photos hidden under Stan’s bed.   “We knew him as a butcher,” widow Alexandra Daletski said, looking at the photo of Stan, in 1996. “That is what he did – kill people.” Having shared his suspicions with BBC News, John, and the then home-affairs correspondent Jon Silverman, were walking Slonim’s snowy streets, asking locals if they recognised the man in the photograph In the image, Stan is wearing the uniform of the Belarusian Auxiliary Police – an armed civilian force of locals that carried out orders on behalf of the Nazis. The date on the back of the original photo, according to John, was March 1942. Ms Daletski said her husband, Jan, had been one of 200 people Stan and the local police had rounded up the same year. And she described how Stan – or Stasic, as he was known in Slonim – had shot Jan, after he had tried to run from the execution line. Stan never disputed the Nazis had recruited him. But he always said it had not been until 1943 – after the bloody massacres of Slonim’s Jews – and even then only as a civilian guard. He always denied being in the murderous auxiliary police. But another witness, local church deacon Kazimir Adamovich, said he had watched from a farmer’s field as Stan shot 50 people over three days. Killing had put Stan in a good mood, he said. He had found it as “easy as spitting”. Their testimony suggested Stan had been present at the Slonim massacres – where tens of thousands of Jewish people and others were murdered. The mass killings began in autumn 1941, as Nazi Germany’s plan to exterminate Europe’s Jewish population stepped up a gear. Men, women and children were marched into local forests, ordered to strip, and then shot. Their bodies fell on to the corpses of others already in the newly dug “death pits”. John and the BBC News team also uncovered more evidence contradicting Stan’s original War-time story. Stan, it seemed, had not escaped the Nazis to join Polish forces straight away. Fleeing Slonim with the retreating Germans in June 1944 – as the Russians closed in – he was swept up with fellow collaborators and transported to eastern France to fight for a German Waffen-SS combat unit. As the German defence crumbled, Stan became a prisoner of war. Only then, did he switch sides and join Polish forces. Back in Telford, John and BBC News approached Stan. During the brief confrontation – after his weekly trip to church – Stan shouted denials and threatened to call the police. It was the last time John and Stan spoke. In light of the BBC News evidence, detectives re-interviewed Stan. But the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) again decided there was “insufficient evidence” for charges. “I found it completely depressing,” John told me. “Scotland Yard had just pulled the shutters down.” John drew a line under his investigation into Stan. His stepfather, he believed, had got away with murder. And it was not until he met me – 20 years later – that he saw another chance to bring Stan to justice.

And Stan, living in Telford, was in my patch. Five years ago, I spotted several German news stories where elderly men had been tried for alleged Nazi war crimes committed more than 70 years before. I remembered Stan’s story from the 1990s and contacted John. We got on well. And he was happy for me to begin my own investigation into Stan. By now, Stan was in his 90s and John his 70s. I persuaded experienced Nazi investigator Dr Stephen Ankier to help me. Stanislaw “Stan” Chrzanowski was one of hundreds of names reported to UK police after the 1988 appeal for war-crimes suspects. But in the end, only one man was convicted. Retired British Rail ticket collector Anthony Sawoniuk was convicted in 1999 for murdering Jews. He died in prison, serving two life sentences. Anthony Sawoniuk Like Stan, Sawoniuk had been a member of the Belarusian Auxiliary Police, the German Waffen-SS and then Polish forces fighting with the Allies. As many as 50,000 Nazi collaborators infiltrated Polish forces in the later stages of World War Two, historian Martin Dean, who worked on the government inquiry and for the Metropolitan Police’s War Crimes Unit, says. About a third of them ended up in the UK. “They would have had different degrees of involvement with the Nazis,” he says. “But some would be local policemen from places like Belarus.” Through sources in Belarus, Dr Ankier obtained a document from Russia’s spy agency, the KGB, listing some of the War-time Belarusian Auxiliary Police officers in Slonim. And Stan’s name and date of birth was there – in black and white – proving he had lied about his real job in the War. The list also helped us trace other suspects from Slonim to places in the UK. And it confirmed names of men Stan had mentioned to John over the years. In total, more than 30 other suspected Nazi collaborators from Slonim settled in England and Wales after the War, Mr Dean says. But most are now believed dead. Next, Nazi hunters at Germany’s specialist war crimes unit heard about our work and made contact. On the strength of the Slonim witness testimonies gathered by John and BBC News in 1996, lead prosecutor Thomas Will told us he was prepared to look at mounting a case against Stan, using the evidence previously rejected by the CPS. And Germany’s Federal Court of Justice ruled proceedings against Stan could continue – even though neither he nor his victims were German and his alleged crimes had been in Belarus. “Because he was working for a German unit, it could be seen as a German crime,” Mr Will said. Investigators were pushing German law to its limit. They had legal powers far greater than the initial scope of the Nuremberg trials, after the War. And in a landmark case, Stan became the first UK citizen to be investigated by Germany for alleged war crimes. Prosecutors centred on allegations he had murdered more than 30 civilians in Slonim, in winter 1942. Hermann Goering, Rudolf Hess (front row left) and other Nuremberg defendants, 1945 But in October 2017 – as German police waited for the go-ahead to raid his home – Stan, 96, died. Neighbours in Telford remember how he used to leave homegrown fruit on their doorsteps before setting off to the shops on his mobility scooter. Others talk of his fiery, unpredictable temper. By now, Barbara had left Stan. She has since described him as a “brutal man” who threatened to kill her – but says she knew nothing about his abuse of John. The German investigation provided relief for John. But less than six months later, he was taken ill and also died. He had kept his leukaemia diagnosis from me. John Kingston But it explained why, out of the blue, I had received a letter – just before his death – giving me permission to keep and use the evidence he had. I wondered if I would find anything in the stash that might offer fresh insight into Stan and other Nazi collaborators. And then – as I clambered around his attic – I found John’s cassette tapes labelled “war crimes”.  I work for BBC Radio Shropshire. And Stan, living in Telford, was in my patch.

And Germany’s Federal Court of Justice ruled proceedings against Stan could continue – even though neither he nor his victims were German and his alleged crimes had been in Belarus. “Because he was working for a German unit, it could be seen as a German crime,” Mr Will said. Investigators were pushing German law to its limit. They had legal powers far greater than the initial scope of the Nuremberg trials, after the War. Hermann Goering, Rudolf Hess (front row left) and other Nuremberg defendants, 1945 And in a landmark case, Stan became the first UK citizen to be investigated by Germany for alleged war crimes. Prosecutors centred on allegations he had murdered more than 30 civilians in Slonim, in winter 1942. But in October 2017 – as German police waited for the go-ahead to raid his home – Stan, 96, died. Neighbours in Telford remember how he used to leave homegrown fruit on their doorsteps before setting off to the shops on his mobility scooter. Others talk of his fiery, unpredictable temper. By now, Barbara had left Stan. She has since described him as a “brutal man” who threatened to kill her – but says she knew nothing about his abuse of John. The German investigation provided relief for John. But less than six months later, he was taken ill and also died. He had kept his leukaemia diagnosis from me. John Kingston But it explained why, out of the blue, I had received a letter – just before his death – giving me permission to keep and use the evidence he had. I wondered if I would find anything in the stash that might offer fresh insight into Stan and other Nazi collaborators. And then – as I clambered around his attic – I found John’s cassette tapes labelled “war crimes”.  John recorded his phone conversations with Stan for a few months in 1994 – to help a Sunday Express reporter expose him. When the article was published, police spoke to Stan again. But no action was taken. According to John, Stan had given nothing away in the recordings. But when I listened, one section in particular caught my attention. I heard Stan talk of an “English secret” he should not reveal. His words – in broken English – were at times difficult to understand. But Stan appeared to be telling John the UK authorities had told him to stay silent. “They, no… want this publicity,” he said. “They waiting if we all dead, it is true. “You take it, the secret, keep it with you all time – maybe even… to the dead.” What was the secret? A short piece of newsreel footage – filmed a decade after the War – could provide the answer.

I watched hundreds of archive films to see if I could catch a glimpse of Stan in places we knew he had been. It was a long shot – but I got lucky. He showed up – not on World War Two footage – but in a batch of US newsreel material from March 1954, eight years after he arrived and settled in the UK. The film shows Marienfelde transit camp, in West Berlin, where during the Cold War millions of people passed through from Communist East Berlin to capitalist West Berlin. The American narrator says the refugees are fleeing “red tyranny” in Eastern Europe. And then suddenly there’s Stan, in an overcoat, walking into the arrivals hall. For a split-second, he looks straight down the camera lens. To be sure it was him, I enlisted the help of a world-leading expert in facial mapping – Prof Hassan Ugail, from the University of Bradford. And he used specialist software to compare John’s old photographs of Stan with the man in the Berlin film. “It’s definitely him,” he said. Stan had told John he had never left the UK, after arriving in 1946. And Dr Ankier discovered – through a Freedom of Information request – Stan had said the same to police in 1961, when he applied for British citizenship. Three photos of Stan Remarkably, in a longer, unedited sequence of the film from the Marienfelde camp, we spotted four more men from photos in Stan’s collection. Two had been photographed with Stan in Slonim during the German occupation, the others with him – in military uniforms – most likely when they fought for the Allies at the very end of the War. The software looks for facial similarities. Anything above a 70% result is considered an accurate match. Stan – and the four others – all passed that bar. For legal reasons, we cannot show the photos of the men with Stan or identify them in the film footage. But our investigations are continuing to try to confirm their names. What were all five men – who had clearly met each other earlier in their lives – doing in Berlin during the Cold War? The Marienfelde refugee camp itself may hold the key.

The complex was a sanctuary for people looking for a better life in the West – but it was also a hive of spies. Refugees from the East were useful sources of information. “British, American and French intelligence wanted to learn as much as they could about Soviet forces and East Germany,” says Dr Keith Allen, from Germany’s Institute for Contemporary History. When we presented our evidence on Stan to three security and intelligence experts, they all told us the evidence could point to him having spied for the UK. Refugees at Marienfelde, July 1961 Stan’s language skills – he spoke Russian, Polish and German – would have been useful as the West tried to obtain details of the Soviets’ nuclear ambitions, author Steve Vogel says. “US and British intelligence officers interviewed German scientists who had been taken to the Soviet Union to work.” Stan had learned radio skills in the Polish army at the end of the War. And historian Dr Stephen Dorril says people like him were sent to Eastern Europe to set up intelligence networks. “This is exactly what MI6 was doing - we know they trained people,” he says – stressing British security services would have known about Stan’s past with the Belarusian Auxiliary Police and German Waffen-SS. “There has been a long-term cover-up,” he says. “Some of these people – their backgrounds were truly appalling.”  The complex was a sanctuary for people looking for a better life in the West – but it was also a hive of spies.

We put this allegation to the government – but it did not respond. The destruction of the documents was a “double-whammy cover-up”, Prof Glees says. Not only was any help given by collaborators to the UK authorities kept secret from the British public – but also any War-time crimes they had committed. If they had been working undercover for the UK, Prof Glees says, Stan and others would have been protected from ever being tried for what they allegedly did in World War Two. “The inducement would have been no prosecution – their passport to freedom. “If you were a bad person [in the War] and feared what might happen to you, the more you offered [the intelligence services], the safer you were.” Could this explain why there was only one war-crimes prosecution after the 1988 appeal for suspects? Prof Glees, Dr Dorril and others are urging the UK government to follow the US secret service, the CIA, and release any remaining files connected to people such as Stan. But not everyone we spoke to agreed Stan could have been a spy. Cold War historian and author Paul Maddrell told us he saw “no evidence of any connection between [Stan] and any intelligence agency”. In a statement, the Home Office repeated what John had been told in the 1990s – the CPS had reviewed Stan’s case at the time but there had been insufficient evidence to proceed, with no real prospect of a conviction. The Metropolitan Police also told us the case had failed to “meet the evidential test”. Two photos of Stan as a young man Senior figures in the Jewish community have described the updated evidence against Stan as “horrific and frightening”. If he and others did work for British intelligence, then it is “a badge of shame for the UK” and a “double betrayal” of the War-time victims, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Efraim Zuroff – who sent the 1986 list of Nazi suspects to the Thatcher government – says. “So many of these people should have – could have – been brought to justice,” he says. “It is sad one of the best democracies in the world could not get these people prosecuted.” Board of Deputies of British Jews president Marie van der Zyl said it looked like a “huge cover-up” and is now calling for a public inquiry. Conservative MP Robert Halfon - who's Jewish - plans to call on the parliamentary security committee to investigate whether there were Nazi war criminals in the UK “who ended up working for British intelligence or any other organ of the state”. Before he died, John told me he regretted so much of his life had been focused on his stepfather but was relieved his suspicions had been proved right. And he recalled Stan’s arrogant boast – after being questioned by police in the 1990s – that he was able to convince people he was innocent. “He said, ‘These people are buried in the ground [in Slonim],’” John said. “‘They are buried and flattened. “‘And here I am living my life. “‘Whose side is God on?’ “I found that the most appalling thing I had ever heard.” Prof Anthony Glees, of the University of Buckingham, told us British security services had destroyed 110,000 files in the late 1980s and early 90s that “almost certainly included” details of any foreign-born Nazi collaborator who had gone on to work for UK intelligence.

"The Tunbridge Wells store, on the list to stay closed permanently John Lewis has said it will not reopen eight of its stores once lockdown eases, putting 1,465 jobs at risk. The retail giant said some locations could not sustain a large store. Four ""At Home"" shops in Ashford, Tunbridge Wells, Basingstoke, and Chester will close - as well as department stores in Aberdeen, Peterborough, Sheffield and York. John Lewis said the eight shops were ""financially challenged prior to the pandemic"". Earlier this month,the retailer warned it would be making more store closuresafter the impact of the pandemic led it to report a hefty annual loss. The latest move comes on top of the closure of eight stores that John Lewis announced last year. The chain has now axed around a third of its stores in less than a year. James Morrell says it could present an opportunity for small independent stores For almost 40 years the John Lewis store in Peterborough has been the flagship of the city's shopping centre, but along with seven other branches it looks sets to close. Shopper James Morrell says he usually goes to John Lewis to look at the ""tech"" and says it will be a shame to not see it reopen after lockdown. ""This is pretty much all we've got in Peterborough really, it's our main selling point,"" he says. But he says it ""might be nice for little independent shops to come along and take up the space"". Read more here. The company said it planned to create more places to shop for John Lewis products across the UK. It suggested it would not entirely move out of areas where the main store was closing. ""In areas where we propose not to reopen stores, we will look at the right combination of options for that location to ensure we remain convenient for our customers, so they can continue to access John Lewis products and services."" It added it would invest in improving click-and-collect in its Waitrose stores and offer more local collection points through third parties. It also will continue experimenting with John Lewis shopping areas in Waitrose stores, as well as trying out smaller, local neighbourhood shops. John Lewis said 34 stores would start reopening from 12 April, subject to government guidance, with the exception of Glasgow, which will reopen from 26 April, and Edinburgh, which will reopen on 14 May. John Lewis expects 60-70% of its sales to take place online in future The company said it would ""enter into consultation with the 1,465 affected partners"" about the proposals. Should it proceed, it said it would make ""every effort"" to find alternative roles for as many as possible. John Lewis has a unique structure in that its staff are also partners in the business, and receive a share in the profits in good years. It said the stores that were closing were in locations where it did not have enough customers. ""Given the significant shift to online shopping in recent years - and our belief that this trend will not materially reverse - we do not think the performance of these eight stores can be substantially improved."" Andrew Taylor Andrew worked at the John Lewis store in Birmingham for five years before being made redundant last year. He has worked in the retail industry for 20 years. ""I'm not surprised by today's announcement,"" he said. ""While it's true that customer shopping habits have changed, I believe the partnership was in the middle of an identity crisis before the pandemic."" Mr Taylor said the company has ""struggled to adapt and needs to work on diversity and inclusion as a business to reflect modern-day Britain."" Dan Jarvis, the mayor for Sheffield, saidlosing the store in Sheffield would be a heavy blow to the area. ""The store has been a cornerstone of the city's retail offer for more than a century,"" he said. ""I am working with John Lewis and Sheffield City Council to determine what this means for those whose jobs are now on the line and what can be done to support them."" John Lewis has now axed around a third of its stores in less than a year. It wasn't all that long ago that the chain was opening stores. In 2007, it had 26 when it decided to embark on an aggressive expansion plan, almost doubling the number of stores in a decade, even though internet sales were starting to climb. This is now a painful correction. Of the 23 department stores it went on to open, only 12 will still be trading when lockdown ends. Its Birmingham store was the most high-profile casualty last year. The company is also reining back on its smaller ""John Lewis at home"" stores. Only four of the original 12 remain. But it's also losing some older main department stores in regional cities, which will have a huge impact. John Lewis has been a presence in Sheffield for some 80 years, for instance. The business insists that as the High Street changes, it has to change with it, reflecting changing shopping habits. It expects 70% of its sales to be online by 2025. John Lewis is betting on fewer bigger ""destination"" shops as well as relying far less on retail in the future for its overall profits - from expanding financial services to using excess space for housing. Some bold decisions are being made across retail given the turmoil over the past 12 months, but the question is whether John Lewis can pull off its turnaround plan without losing its competitive edge. John Lewis said it expects from 60-70% of John Lewis sales to be made online in the future. Nearly 50% of its customers have been using a combination of store and online when making their purchases. Despite the expected further shift to online, John Lewis said that stores were essential to its business, as people still wanted physical proximity: ""They provide a sensory experience that online cannot, supported by the expertise of our partners."" The pandemic caused the chain's first ever annual loss of Â£517m for the year to January, against profits of Â£146m the previous year. At the time of that announcement earlier this month, the firm said it would reshape its business in response to the change in customer shopping habits. Much of that loss was due to a write down in the value of its stores because of the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs.

"Police in Wales have had to enforce sometimes ""unpopular"" Covid rules, say officers Front-line police officers should have been prioritised for the Covid vaccine, according to the head of one force. Chief Constable Pam Kelly said it has been one of her biggest concerns during the crisis. The Gwent Police boss agreed that NHS staff and the vulnerable should come first, but she wanted greater protection for her staff. The Welsh government said there is insufficient evidence to support vaccination by occupation. Police officers often attend the same scenes as health workers but are the only ones not vaccinated, said Mrs Kelly. ""We salute NHS staff, they've been outstanding. But often you will get an ambulance worker, health worker and police officer at the same scene,"" she said. ""When there's a violent person, police officers are there trying to protect the health workers - yet it's the police officer that's not vaccinated. Policing Covid: 'Coughed at and spat on' Police officers 'must be on vaccine priority list' Third of officers 'face Covid infection threats' ""It's a real concern for me. It's all about having enough emergency workers to respond to 999 and 101 calls and the vaccination for police officers would have been a really strong voice in saying we're grateful for what you've done. ""They're not asking for money - all we're asking for is for our officers to be safe."" Chief Constable Pam Kelly wants greater protection from Covid for officers More than 4,000 emergency workers have been assaulted in Wales over the last 20 months, she added. ""Sometimes Covid has been used as a weapon. I understand without question the need for the vulnerable to be vaccinated, but at this stage where the wider community is being vaccinated, I feel very strongly that front-line policing should be vaccinated,"" she said. Mrs Kelly added that out of a 1,400 strong workforce, just 140 have had the vaccine - based purely on their age or vulnerability. But as crime dropped around 15%, demand for policing increased significantly, she said. The role of the police has changed during the pandemic, even checking where people are walking and with whom In the neighbouring South Wales Police force, Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan is equally concerned about the impact the pandemic has had on staff. ""It's taken its toll. On a weekly basis I'm texting somebody who is poorly, somebody who is in hospital, I've visited families, I've been to a number of funerals. We really care about their wellbeing and welfare,"" he said. Police officers ""absolutely"" should be prioritised for Covid vaccines, Temporary Chief Constable of Dyfed Powys Police Claire Parmenter said. She told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""I'm pleased that in recent weeks officers have started to get offered reserve vaccines where, at the end of the day, there are some vaccines leftover. ""But it's critical that we continue to support officers for the vaccination because they have no choice but to put themselves at risk."" Many have opposed legislation giving police greater power to crack down on protests As a border force, different rules in England and Wales added to the confusing picture. Initially the focus remained on engaging, explaining and encouraging compliance, but enforcement has increasingly been a factor. In the last 12 months the role of policing changed significantly. While crime remained a priority, officers were asked to step in and police far more of our lives - right down to where we took a walk and with whom. People in Cardiff protested in January over the death of Mahmoud Hassan, who died after being released from police custody Team that with protests - and a national focus on the way police have handled protests in a pandemic, from Black Lives Matter to women's safety demonstrations following the murder of Sarah Everard. Has it impacted their relationship with their community? ""I can't thank communities enough for the way they've worked with us,"" said Mrs Kelly, who was interviewed beforeofficers in Bristol were injured during protestson Monday. ""I don't want to become the Covid police - and we've carried on tackling serious organised crime with vigour - but ultimately we have seen some fragility in terms of the relationships between policing and the community. ""We've had about 73 protests during the Covid crisis and protests are very difficult to police."" Images of Patsy Stevenson being detained by police at a vigil for Sarah Everard in London were shared widely She said they had worked with protesters - some had moved online, others were done in a Covid-secure way. Hundreds at protest after Sarah Everard's death Black Lives Matter protest: Hundreds in Barry and Chepstow Her south Wales counterpart Mr Vaughan, who was also interviewed before the Bristol protests, added people have the right to be heard - but the rules have changed in Covid times. ""People want their voices to be heard - and people are protesting on some really important issues,"" he said. ""In ordinary times the police would work really hard to allow those voices to be heard- to facilitate those protests, but these aren't ordinary times. They're extraordinary times. ""There comes a point after a few days of protest, and we've warned them on a number of times, that we need to take action. ""That's not for one second calling into question the right of individual's voices to be heard, or indeed the things that they want to talk about which are extremely important things, but we're being called to help protect people from a global pandemic."" Thousands of people joined anti-racism protests across Wales last summer The Welsh government thanked officers for doing a ""fantastic job"" enforcing coronavirus regulations. However a spokesman said it was following the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to vaccinate according to age, as that ""remains the strongest factor"" linked to deaths and hospitalisations from the virus. ""The JCVI has looked at prioritisation by occupation but found there wasn't sufficient evidence for this,"" he added. ""It has advised that the complexity of delivering this approach would slow down the pace of the vaccination roll-out."" Black Lives Matter protests continue around Wales.

"Tracey Davies says dealing with abuse every day is exhausting A supermarket worker has received abuse ""every day"" for the past year from customers over social distancing requests. Tracey Davies, who works in Neath Port Talbot, said it was ""non-acceptable"" to have to face abuse just for going to work. An Usdaw union representative, she said members at stores across the area had reported similar experiences. On Monday,supermarkets were allowed to resume selling non-essential goods. The re-opening of aisles and reductions in clothing prices saw queues around the stores in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot, Ms Davies told Radio Wales. She said the situation was ""manic"", with people buying in bulk and the extra customer numbers making social distancing difficult. Non-essential aisles reopened on Monday People had to be asked to maintain a two-metre gap ""all the time,"" she said. ""That is the worrying part. We continue to get abuse just simply by asking the question, can you please maintain a safe social distance?"" ""Some people come back and say mind your own business. Some people swear. It was getting to be just the norm. ""It's non-acceptable. You shouldn't have to go to work to be abused."" 'Loads of shoppers breaking rules' in supermarkets Supermarket staff 'having to referee' Covid rules Supermarket workers facing coronavirus 'abuse' Asked how often it happened she replied: ""Every day.

"Criminals and paedophiles are trying to groom and exploit young siblings as part of an emerging trend of online sexual abuse, experts have warned. The Internet Watch Foundation said victims ranged from 3-16 years, with some groomed to copy adult pornography. It found 511 examples involving siblings between September and December - roughly one in 30 instances of all ""self-generated content"" in that time. Campaigners say livestreaming services need to do more to protect children. The IWF, which works with police and websites worldwide to take down harmful material, said the Covid-19 pandemic had been a ""perfect storm"" for the abuse. Its chief executive, Susie Hargreaves, said there had been: a greater demand for abusive content an increase in the amount of time spent online by children a rise in the use of livestreaming platforms There was a ""common myth"" abuse involving siblings was limited to poorer countries - but most of the videos the IWF found featured children in the West, including from the UK, US and across Europe. Internet child abuse images 'not purged in lockdown' Online child abuse rising during lockdown Children 'at risk' from encrypted message apps Should governments be given keys to access our messages? Grooming often begins on social-media and gaming platforms, before offenders encourage children on to video-chat or livestreaming services where the abuse then escalates. And abuse of siblings typically involves an older child being coerced into abusing their younger brother or sister. One video, shared online multiple times, involved a brother and sister aged six and three being given instructions by an abuser, the IWF said. Last December, the government set out its proposed Online Harms Bill, designed to ensure companies provide improved safeguarding measures. It plans to give watchdog Ofcom the power to: block access to online services that fail to protect users fine technology companies The proposals contained the ""strongest protections"" for children, Safeguarding Minister Victoria Atkins told BBC News. ""Encouraging siblings to enact sexual abuse demonstrates just how heinous offenders are in this space,"" she added. Facebook Messenger Rooms, a video chat service, was launched during the pandemic NSPCC online-safety-policy head Andy Burrows said it could be a ""world-leading piece of legislation"" but must follow through with its promise to give Ofcom ""teeth"" to step in and take action. In the past year, in the race to bring video-chat and livestreaming services to market, some technology companies had prioritised profit over making their platforms safe, the charity said. And Mr Burrows raised particular concerns over Facebook's plans to introduce end-to-end encryption - a way of sending information so only the intended receiver can read it - across all of its messenger services. Plans to include it in its video-chat service, Rooms, launched in May, would ""significantly compromise the ability to detect child abuse"", he said. The National Crime Agency said the changes would ""dramatically reduce [Facebook's] ability to provide law-enforcement with the evidence they need"" to prosecute alleged offenders. Facebook said end-to-end encryption ""was already the leading security technology used by many services to keep people safe"" and ""a long-term project"". It added: ""We are committed to building strong anti-abuse measures into our plans. ""Facebook will continue to lead the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect and respond to abuse.""

"The Tunbridge Wells store, on the list to stay closed permanently John Lewis has said it will not reopen eight of its stores once lockdown eases, putting 1,465 jobs at risk. The retail giant said some locations could not sustain a large store. Four ""At Home"" shops in Ashford, Tunbridge Wells, Basingstoke, and Chester will close - as well as department stores in Aberdeen, Peterborough, Sheffield and York. John Lewis said the eight shops were ""financially challenged prior to the pandemic"". Earlier this month,the retailer warned it would be making more store closuresafter the impact of the pandemic led it to report a hefty annual loss. The latest move comes on top of the closure of eight stores that John Lewis announced last year. The chain has now axed around a third of its stores in less than a year. James Morrell says it could present an opportunity for small independent stores For almost 40 years the John Lewis store in Peterborough has been the flagship of the city's shopping centre, but along with seven other branches it looks sets to close. Shopper James Morrell says he usually goes to John Lewis to look at the ""tech"" and says it will be a shame to not see it reopen after lockdown. ""This is pretty much all we've got in Peterborough really, it's our main selling point,"" he says. But he says it ""might be nice for little independent shops to come along and take up the space"". Read more here. The company said it planned to create more places to shop for John Lewis products across the UK. It suggested it would not entirely move out of areas where the main store was closing. ""In areas where we propose not to reopen stores, we will look at the right combination of options for that location to ensure we remain convenient for our customers, so they can continue to access John Lewis products and services."" It added it would invest in improving click-and-collect in its Waitrose stores and offer more local collection points through third parties. It also will continue experimenting with John Lewis shopping areas in Waitrose stores, as well as trying out smaller, local neighbourhood shops. John Lewis said 34 stores would start reopening from 12 April, subject to government guidance, with the exception of Glasgow, which will reopen from 26 April, and Edinburgh, which will reopen on 14 May. John Lewis expects 60-70% of its sales to take place online in future The company said it would ""enter into consultation with the 1,465 affected partners"" about the proposals. Should it proceed, it said it would make ""every effort"" to find alternative roles for as many as possible. John Lewis has a unique structure in that its staff are also partners in the business, and receive a share in the profits in good years. It said the stores that were closing were in locations where it did not have enough customers. ""Given the significant shift to online shopping in recent years - and our belief that this trend will not materially reverse - we do not think the performance of these eight stores can be substantially improved."" Andrew Taylor Andrew worked at the John Lewis store in Birmingham for five years before being made redundant last year. He has worked in the retail industry for 20 years. ""I'm not surprised by today's announcement,"" he said. ""While it's true that customer shopping habits have changed, I believe the partnership was in the middle of an identity crisis before the pandemic."" Mr Taylor said the company has ""struggled to adapt and needs to work on diversity and inclusion as a business to reflect modern-day Britain."" Dan Jarvis, the mayor for Sheffield, saidlosing the store in Sheffield would be a heavy blow to the area. ""The store has been a cornerstone of the city's retail offer for more than a century,"" he said. ""I am working with John Lewis and Sheffield City Council to determine what this means for those whose jobs are now on the line and what can be done to support them."" John Lewis has now axed around a third of its stores in less than a year. It wasn't all that long ago that the chain was opening stores. In 2007, it had 26 when it decided to embark on an aggressive expansion plan, almost doubling the number of stores in a decade, even though internet sales were starting to climb. This is now a painful correction. Of the 23 department stores it went on to open, only 12 will still be trading when lockdown ends. Its Birmingham store was the most high-profile casualty last year. The company is also reining back on its smaller ""John Lewis at home"" stores. Only four of the original 12 remain. But it's also losing some older main department stores in regional cities, which will have a huge impact. John Lewis has been a presence in Sheffield for some 80 years, for instance. The business insists that as the High Street changes, it has to change with it, reflecting changing shopping habits. It expects 70% of its sales to be online by 2025. John Lewis is betting on fewer bigger ""destination"" shops as well as relying far less on retail in the future for its overall profits - from expanding financial services to using excess space for housing. Some bold decisions are being made across retail given the turmoil over the past 12 months, but the question is whether John Lewis can pull off its turnaround plan without losing its competitive edge. John Lewis said it expects from 60-70% of John Lewis sales to be made online in the future. Nearly 50% of its customers have been using a combination of store and online when making their purchases. Despite the expected further shift to online, John Lewis said that stores were essential to its business, as people still wanted physical proximity: ""They provide a sensory experience that online cannot, supported by the expertise of our partners."" The pandemic caused the chain's first ever annual loss of Â£517m for the year to January, against profits of Â£146m the previous year. At the time of that announcement earlier this month, the firm said it would reshape its business in response to the change in customer shopping habits. Much of that loss was due to a write down in the value of its stores because of the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs.

"The prime minister has given evidence to a committee of senior MPs Mr Johnson faced questions from the Liaison Committee on the UKâs place in the world, the governmentâs response to the coronavirus pandemic, and the economy. The PM suggested that care home companies would be acting âresponsiblyâ if they required staff to be vaccinated. He also said that people may have to provide proof of vaccination to visit a pub Home Secretary Priti Patel has set out government plans to tighten the rules for asylum seekers staying the UK At PMQs, Boris Johnson said the work of the UK vaccine programme has ""brought hope"" and allowed the UK to set out a cautious roadmap The PM and Keir Starmer clashed on government plans for the armed forces On Tuesday, the PM has told a private meeting of Tory MPs the UK's coronavirus vaccine programme was a success because of ""capitalism"" and ""greed"" A government source said the PM was referring to the profit motive driving companies to develop new products and were not about the row over vaccine supply with the EU Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll end our coverage now on today's proceedings in the Commons. The team on board with you today were Hazel Shearing, Jennifer Scott, Richard Morris, and Sinead Wilson, with Johanna Howitt editing. Parliament goes in to recess for the Easter break after tomorrow's sitting.  So we'll be back with our regular coverage of Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday 14 April. Thanks for following along with us. That was a wide-ranging 90 minutes in front of the committee for Boris Johnson. But here are some of the key points from the session: Reality Check Boris Johnson faced lots of question today on defence spending - in PMQs and in his session with the Liaison Committee. The
prime minister said recent spending pledges were âthe biggest investment in
defence since the Cold War.â Looking
back at figures since 1990 - seen by many as the end of the Cold War, with the
Berlin Wall coming down in November 1989 - it is clear military spending has
fallen considerably. The
proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of
everything produced by the economy in any particular year, was 3.5% in 1990 .
It was 2.1% in 2018/19. The
boostannounced in Novembermeans by
2024-25, defence spending will be Â£7bn a year higher than it would have been
under previous plans. But
with Â£7bn worth about 0.35% of GDP, this extra money is not enough to push
defence spending above the 3.5% of GDP it represented in 1990. The
government has previously phrased this claim differently, though, calling the
boost that will see defence spending rise by Â£7bn a year by 2024-25, the
""biggest sustained increase in 30 years"". And
as defence spending has not increased for more than three years in a row since
1990, this will probably turn out to be true. Read more here.  Bernard Jenkin thanks the prime minister for the time he has given to the committee, and he closes the session in the tradition of parliamentary proceedings: ""Order, order"". And that's it. We'll bring you a quick summary of the key points next.... Before the chair of the Liaison Committee, Bernard Jenkin, brings the session to a close he returns to questions about the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. He says he is concerned that ""it doesn't look like the same consuming priority as other policies"". Can the PM do more to secure the agreement of all those countries due to attend? Mr Johnson says he is ""engaged in some kind of COP conversation virtually every day"". He says it is a ""big cross-government effort"" to get ready for it.  It is led by Alok Sharma, he says, but everyone is ""gripping it across Whitehall"". Mr Jenkin asks how often the Climate Action Strategy Committee is meeting in preparation? Mr Johnson says ""to be frank"" it has ""not met a great deal"" but that is because a lot is happening already on ""an ad hoc level"". Ms Bradley asks if there are any procedural changes the prime minister would like to see to enable more women to make successful careers in Parliament. Mr Johnson says technology has ""definitely been our friend"" during the pandemic. He says it is not for him to dictate, but it is for MPs and the Speaker to see how things can be improved for work and family balances. ""There are still very considerable barriers"" he states, and there are some deterrents that female MPs face, such as ""absolutely appalling"" online trolling. Ms Bradley asks if there are any particular innovations which he'd like to see continue after the pandemic, such as virtual voting. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to commit to any particular change, but he says he's open to different ideas. He says he ""wants the chamber to be full again"" and he wants the public to see where the ""sentiment"" is in Parliament by seeing and hearing how MPs are responding to a debate. He also wants to see MPs be able to ""mingle again in the lobbies,"" ""voting as a communal act, together, has immense benefits,"" he states. Ms Bradley asks her final question, she says the government has to provide time in Parliament to allow MPs to debate changes to how they work. Mr Johnson says this is a ""necessity"" and he has ""no doubt"" that this can be organised. Sir Bernard Jenkin says proxy voting has been beneficial for lots of women who often have caring responsibilities, he asks if the PM has an open mind on such things. Mr Johnson says he wants to see Parliament become more family friendly. Chair of the Commons Procedure Committee Conservative Karen Bradley asks the final set of questions, this time on lifting Covid-19 restrictions in Parliament. She says the House of Commons has been able to operate and sit throughout the whole pandemic, unlike many other parliaments in the world, she states. She asks how the PM thinks Parliament has operated over the past twelve months. Boris Johnson says some professions have been really badly hit by the disease, but he thanks the workers who have managed to make Parliament continue to sit. He says he thinks the public want to see MPs return to their place of work in person. Ms Bradley asks what his view is on social distancing in the Commons chamber. Mr Johnson says he wants to see an approach for the Commons which is adopted everywhere, as he wants Westminster to be like ""every other part of the UK"". Mr Merriman asks how discussions with other international leaders are going - such as talking to President Biden about travel between the UK and US restarting. The PM says leaders ""around the world"" are looking at ""when can get things moving"". But he says there is ""no doubt a growing global consensus for the purposes of aviation that evidence of a vaccination or immunity, that you have had the disease, or have taken a negative test... will be valuable"" for travel. Finally Mr Merriman asks when Brits will feel ready to travel again - and if the PM will be going abroad this summer. Mr Johnson says we should not ""underestimate the natural wanderlust of spiritual inquiry"" of the British people, adding: ""As soon as people feel it is safe, you will see a miraculous change in the mood."" He won't reveal his own holiday destination, but says: ""I think whatever I do, I will be making sure to tell the British public what I think is safe."" Now Huw Merriman gets his turn - he had tried to join the committee earlier via Zoom but had issues with his mute button - something we are all too familiar with. But there is plenty space in the room for him to join in person at a safe distance, so after a suggestion from Boris Johnson he should run across Parliament, he now gets to his questions. The Tory MP asks about international travel and how detailed the announcement on 5 April will be. Boris Johnson says he will have to wait and see but adds: ""We hope we can get people moving again by 17 May.... [but] we will just have to see where we get to, where other countries get to and what the data is telling us."" Mr Knight says it is not enough to say that talks are taking place with the EU on visa fees for performers. He wants ministers to get involved to ""short circuit"" discussions with countries that ""seem to be the most recalcitrant"" such as Italy, Spain and Greece. Mr Johnson says he agrees things ""must get ironed out"". He says it needs to be ""a two way street"" with the EU. On the issue of festivals taking place in the UK this summer, Mr Knight says organisers are nervous because of problems with Covid cancellation insurance. Will the PM get involved to ""back a Covid secure summer of fun rather than condemning us to a summer of none"" he asks? Mr Johnson says the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, has done a ""huge amount of work"" to get the sector ready for reopening. He says he does not want to see people unwilling to take risks when putting on events this year because they are scarred by memories of last year. Glastonbury has already announced it will not go ahead this summer, but will other festivals? Lead singer of The Darkness, Justin Hawkins, told the BBC he ""remains pessimistic"", while some in the industry are calling for government-backed insurance to renew confidence and enable the sector to ""get going again"". This video can not be played Music festivals and Covid: Could some events still go ahead this year? Julian Knight who chairs the Culture Committee jumps the queue because the chair of the Transport Committee is having technical problems. Mr Knight says the culture, media and sport sector is worth a quarter of the UK economy but visa fees to work in the EU mean musicians are performers are suffering. Why has no other sector been allowed to suffer from Brexit, he asks. Mr Johnson says he ""shares the frustration"" and agrees the sector is ""massively important"" and brings billions of tax revenue and employment to the UK. But he says EU restrictions are to blame and the situation is unlike that in ""global Britain"" which welcomes people from around the world. He adds that the government is working ""flat out"" with each individual government but ""some are much better than others"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There was never a simple binary trade-off between the two factors: those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths, also had the biggest hits to the economy and the UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. Read Faisal's full analysis here. Mr Stride says many economists think the spending forecasts in thatOBR report,externalare ""unrealistic"" and there are many more costs expected in the coming years which are not ""baked in to the budget"". There is, for instance, no additional spending outlined for the vaccine or test and trace beyond this summer. He asks if this leaves him feeling ""queasy"" over spending. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to make predictions now about  future spending reviews, but he says he there's no sign in the data that ""at this stage"" the UK will have to ""deviate from our path to freedom"" from lockdown. Mr Stride says there's no money in the forecast to fix and change social care. He asks if the tax burden can be expected not to rise. Mr Johnson says he ""strongly believes in a low-tax government, and I'm a low tax Conservative"". He says as the UK emerges from Covid-19, tax rates will keep the UK ""competitive"". Mr Stride says there will be a situation where tax benefits to corporations will end at the same time as corporation taxes will rise, he asks if this will damage such companies. Mr Johnson lists all of the help available to businesses during the pandemic, which he describes as a ""huge package"" over the past year. Chair of the Treasury committee Conservative MP Mel Stride asks if the spending assumptions from the Office for Budget Responsibility are ""realistic"". Mr Johnson says he thinks the OBR is ""right to think that the public finances are under very considerable pressure as a result of Covid"". Mr Stride asks if the forecast for the next five years from the OBR on government spending is correct. Mr Johnson says ""things are very tough"" and ""spending has been necessarily very extensive"" but the Chancellor's Budget is set to work in the medium term. Mr Stride asks if the PM is happy with the assumption of spending levels over the coming years. Mr Johnson says he wishes ""we weren't in this position"" and had to ""firehose so much money"" following Covid-19. Onto vaccines, Mr Wragg asks whether certificates proving you have had your jab are ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". The PM seems to answer a different question after discussions yesterday about care homes making vaccines mandatory for their staff. He says the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" as doctors already have to have Hepatitis B jabs, adding the idea ""doesn't seem to me to be irresponsible at all, far from it, it is wholly responsible for care home companies to think about requiring vaccinations"". But Mr Wragg asks, what about ""ordinary citizens going to the pub?"" Mr Johnson says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". Pushed further, the PM says other MPs want tougher restrictions, adding: ""I find myself in this long national conversation thinking very deeply about it, and the public have been thinking very deeply. ""They want us as their government and me as prime minister to take all the action I can to protect them."" Mr Wragg then asks about comments made by scientific advisers at the weekend that Brits won't be able to go abroad for their holidays - ""is that the government's policy?"" The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and he will ""set out what I see may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". Asked by Mr Wragg if he finds advisers ""freelancing across the media before decisions have been made"" helpful, the PM says: ""It is one of those things we just have to get used to. It has been a feature of life for quite some time."" But he assures his Tory colleague that advisers advise and ministers decide. The next MP to question the prime minister is Tory William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He asks why the Coronavirus Act - which gives the government emergency powers amid the pandemic - is being extended for six months on Thursday, past the final roadmap step out of lockdown. Boris Johnson says they need the act ""to deal with backlogs we have built up"" - such as allowing remote court hearings or letting NHS volunteers continue to serve. He adds: ""Be in no doubt after 21 June, all the restrictions we have, we hope, will be gone. ""But remember this is a 'not before' date."" Mr Wragg says some provisions in the law ""still haven't been used"" so questions why wont they be dropped. The PM says the government have ""already weeded out quite a few"", adding: ""anything redundant will go."" Yvette Cooper continues her questions and says  20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions. She says everyone understands the importance of hauliers being able to do their job but she wants to know why are they not being tested in the UK. Mr Johnson says the numbers coming in overall from France have ""massively diminished"". It ""was colossal"" the PM admits. He says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel""  and says he ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Ms Cooper says scientists and medics agree that the ""biggest threat to keeping the roadmap on track"" in the UK is the spread of new variants from South Africa and Brazil. Why is the PM not taking action now, she asks, when we know cases have been rising since February? Mr Johnson says that is because there is ""a balance to be struck"". He says it is not clear how the vaccines will work against the new variants and that the government has to balance taking action now against the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Anyone in England who travels abroad without good reasoncould soon be fined Â£5,000, under the coronavirus regulations. It comes amidst growing uncertainty about whether people will be able to take foreign holidays this summer. Holiday travel is not currently allowed - either in the UK or abroad - under lockdown rules. So when can you go on holiday again?Read our guide here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Bernard Jenkin thanks the prime minister for the time he has given to the committee, and he closes the session in the tradition of parliamentary proceedings: ""Order, order"". And that's it. We'll bring you a quick summary of the key points next.... Before the chair of the Liaison Committee, Bernard Jenkin, brings the session to a close he returns to questions about the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. He says he is concerned that ""it doesn't look like the same consuming priority as other policies"". Can the PM do more to secure the agreement of all those countries due to attend? Mr Johnson says he is ""engaged in some kind of COP conversation virtually every day"". He says it is a ""big cross-government effort"" to get ready for it.  It is led by Alok Sharma, he says, but everyone is ""gripping it across Whitehall"". Mr Jenkin asks how often the Climate Action Strategy Committee is meeting in preparation? Mr Johnson says ""to be frank"" it has ""not met a great deal"" but that is because a lot is happening already on ""an ad hoc level"". Ms Bradley asks if there are any procedural changes the prime minister would like to see to enable more women to make successful careers in Parliament. Mr Johnson says technology has ""definitely been our friend"" during the pandemic. He says it is not for him to dictate, but it is for MPs and the Speaker to see how things can be improved for work and family balances. ""There are still very considerable barriers"" he states, and there are some deterrents that female MPs face, such as ""absolutely appalling"" online trolling. Ms Bradley asks if there are any particular innovations which he'd like to see continue after the pandemic, such as virtual voting. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to commit to any particular change, but he says he's open to different ideas. He says he ""wants the chamber to be full again"" and he wants the public to see where the ""sentiment"" is in Parliament by seeing and hearing how MPs are responding to a debate. He also wants to see MPs be able to ""mingle again in the lobbies,"" ""voting as a communal act, together, has immense benefits,"" he states. Ms Bradley asks her final question, she says the government has to provide time in Parliament to allow MPs to debate changes to how they work. Mr Johnson says this is a ""necessity"" and he has ""no doubt"" that this can be organised. Sir Bernard Jenkin says proxy voting has been beneficial for lots of women who often have caring responsibilities, he asks if the PM has an open mind on such things. Mr Johnson says he wants to see Parliament become more family friendly. Chair of the Commons Procedure Committee Conservative Karen Bradley asks the final set of questions, this time on lifting Covid-19 restrictions in Parliament. She says the House of Commons has been able to operate and sit throughout the whole pandemic, unlike many other parliaments in the world, she states. She asks how the PM thinks Parliament has operated over the past twelve months. Boris Johnson says some professions have been really badly hit by the disease, but he thanks the workers who have managed to make Parliament continue to sit. He says he thinks the public want to see MPs return to their place of work in person. Ms Bradley asks what his view is on social distancing in the Commons chamber. Mr Johnson says he wants to see an approach for the Commons which is adopted everywhere, as he wants Westminster to be like ""every other part of the UK"". Mr Merriman asks how discussions with other international leaders are going - such as talking to President Biden about travel between the UK and US restarting. The PM says leaders ""around the world"" are looking at ""when can get things moving"". But he says there is ""no doubt a growing global consensus for the purposes of aviation that evidence of a vaccination or immunity, that you have had the disease, or have taken a negative test... will be valuable"" for travel. Finally Mr Merriman asks when Brits will feel ready to travel again - and if the PM will be going abroad this summer. Mr Johnson says we should not ""underestimate the natural wanderlust of spiritual inquiry"" of the British people, adding: ""As soon as people feel it is safe, you will see a miraculous change in the mood."" He won't reveal his own holiday destination, but says: ""I think whatever I do, I will be making sure to tell the British public what I think is safe."" Now Huw Merriman gets his turn - he had tried to join the committee earlier via Zoom but had issues with his mute button - something we are all too familiar with. But there is plenty space in the room for him to join in person at a safe distance, so after a suggestion from Boris Johnson he should run across Parliament, he now gets to his questions. The Tory MP asks about international travel and how detailed the announcement on 5 April will be. Boris Johnson says he will have to wait and see but adds: ""We hope we can get people moving again by 17 May.... [but] we will just have to see where we get to, where other countries get to and what the data is telling us."" Mr Knight says it is not enough to say that talks are taking place with the EU on visa fees for performers. He wants ministers to get involved to ""short circuit"" discussions with countries that ""seem to be the most recalcitrant"" such as Italy, Spain and Greece. Mr Johnson says he agrees things ""must get ironed out"". He says it needs to be ""a two way street"" with the EU. On the issue of festivals taking place in the UK this summer, Mr Knight says organisers are nervous because of problems with Covid cancellation insurance. Will the PM get involved to ""back a Covid secure summer of fun rather than condemning us to a summer of none"" he asks? Mr Johnson says the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, has done a ""huge amount of work"" to get the sector ready for reopening. He says he does not want to see people unwilling to take risks when putting on events this year because they are scarred by memories of last year. Glastonbury has already announced it will not go ahead this summer, but will other festivals? Lead singer of The Darkness, Justin Hawkins, told the BBC he ""remains pessimistic"", while some in the industry are calling for government-backed insurance to renew confidence and enable the sector to ""get going again"". This video can not be played Music festivals and Covid: Could some events still go ahead this year? Julian Knight who chairs the Culture Committee jumps the queue because the chair of the Transport Committee is having technical problems. Mr Knight says the culture, media and sport sector is worth a quarter of the UK economy but visa fees to work in the EU mean musicians are performers are suffering. Why has no other sector been allowed to suffer from Brexit, he asks. Mr Johnson says he ""shares the frustration"" and agrees the sector is ""massively important"" and brings billions of tax revenue and employment to the UK. But he says EU restrictions are to blame and the situation is unlike that in ""global Britain"" which welcomes people from around the world. He adds that the government is working ""flat out"" with each individual government but ""some are much better than others"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There was never a simple binary trade-off between the two factors: those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths, also had the biggest hits to the economy and the UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. Read Faisal's full analysis here. Mr Stride says many economists think the spending forecasts in thatOBR report,externalare ""unrealistic"" and there are many more costs expected in the coming years which are not ""baked in to the budget"". There is, for instance, no additional spending outlined for the vaccine or test and trace beyond this summer. He asks if this leaves him feeling ""queasy"" over spending. Mr Johnson says he doesn't want to make predictions now about  future spending reviews, but he says he there's no sign in the data that ""at this stage"" the UK will have to ""deviate from our path to freedom"" from lockdown. Mr Stride says there's no money in the forecast to fix and change social care. He asks if the tax burden can be expected not to rise. Mr Johnson says he ""strongly believes in a low-tax government, and I'm a low tax Conservative"". He says as the UK emerges from Covid-19, tax rates will keep the UK ""competitive"". Mr Stride says there will be a situation where tax benefits to corporations will end at the same time as corporation taxes will rise, he asks if this will damage such companies. Mr Johnson lists all of the help available to businesses during the pandemic, which he describes as a ""huge package"" over the past year. Chair of the Treasury committee Conservative MP Mel Stride asks if the spending assumptions from the Office for Budget Responsibility are ""realistic"". Mr Johnson says he thinks the OBR is ""right to think that the public finances are under very considerable pressure as a result of Covid"". Mr Stride asks if the forecast for the next five years from the OBR on government spending is correct. Mr Johnson says ""things are very tough"" and ""spending has been necessarily very extensive"" but the Chancellor's Budget is set to work in the medium term. Mr Stride asks if the PM is happy with the assumption of spending levels over the coming years. Mr Johnson says he wishes ""we weren't in this position"" and had to ""firehose so much money"" following Covid-19. Onto vaccines, Mr Wragg asks whether certificates proving you have had your jab are ""compatible with a free society such as ours"". The PM seems to answer a different question after discussions yesterday about care homes making vaccines mandatory for their staff. He says the concept ""should not be totally alien to us"" as doctors already have to have Hepatitis B jabs, adding the idea ""doesn't seem to me to be irresponsible at all, far from it, it is wholly responsible for care home companies to think about requiring vaccinations"". But Mr Wragg asks, what about ""ordinary citizens going to the pub?"" Mr Johnson says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". Pushed further, the PM says other MPs want tougher restrictions, adding: ""I find myself in this long national conversation thinking very deeply about it, and the public have been thinking very deeply. ""They want us as their government and me as prime minister to take all the action I can to protect them."" Mr Wragg then asks about comments made by scientific advisers at the weekend that Brits won't be able to go abroad for their holidays - ""is that the government's policy?"" The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and he will ""set out what I see may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". Asked by Mr Wragg if he finds advisers ""freelancing across the media before decisions have been made"" helpful, the PM says: ""It is one of those things we just have to get used to. It has been a feature of life for quite some time."" But he assures his Tory colleague that advisers advise and ministers decide. The next MP to question the prime minister is Tory William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He asks why the Coronavirus Act - which gives the government emergency powers amid the pandemic - is being extended for six months on Thursday, past the final roadmap step out of lockdown. Boris Johnson says they need the act ""to deal with backlogs we have built up"" - such as allowing remote court hearings or letting NHS volunteers continue to serve. He adds: ""Be in no doubt after 21 June, all the restrictions we have, we hope, will be gone. ""But remember this is a 'not before' date."" Mr Wragg says some provisions in the law ""still haven't been used"" so questions why wont they be dropped. The PM says the government have ""already weeded out quite a few"", adding: ""anything redundant will go."" Yvette Cooper continues her questions and says  20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions. She says everyone understands the importance of hauliers being able to do their job but she wants to know why are they not being tested in the UK. Mr Johnson says the numbers coming in overall from France have ""massively diminished"". It ""was colossal"" the PM admits. He says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel""  and says he ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Ms Cooper says scientists and medics agree that the ""biggest threat to keeping the roadmap on track"" in the UK is the spread of new variants from South Africa and Brazil. Why is the PM not taking action now, she asks, when we know cases have been rising since February? Mr Johnson says that is because there is ""a balance to be struck"". He says it is not clear how the vaccines will work against the new variants and that the government has to balance taking action now against the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Anyone in England who travels abroad without good reasoncould soon be fined Â£5,000, under the coronavirus regulations. It comes amidst growing uncertainty about whether people will be able to take foreign holidays this summer. Holiday travel is not currently allowed - either in the UK or abroad - under lockdown rules. So when can you go on holiday again?Read our guide here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining us. Your writers today were Jen Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea, Penny Spiller and Fran Gillett. The editors were James Clarke and Rob Corp. We'll be back again tomorrow morning with all the coronavirus news as it happens. See you then. TheUK and EU say they are working on creating a ""win-win"" situation to expand vaccine supplyfor all citizens. A joint statement says co-operation is ""even more important"" as Europe faces a third wave of coronavirus. India has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, sources have told the BBC. Rising cases in India are putting pressure on the domestic supply chain - but there has been no official comment from the Indian government. China is stepping up its vaccine rollout, with plans to inoculate 40% of its 1.4 billion population by the end of June. So far,82.8 million people have received jabs,external, with China currently focusing on vaccinating people aged between 18 and 59. Chancellor Angela Merkel has made an extraordinary plea to the German people to forgive her,after she cancelled a strict Easter lockdown just a day after announcing it.She admitted there was not enough time to implement the shutdown; it had been met with resistance from business leaders. Brazil has, for the first time, recorded a daily coronavirus death toll of more than 3,000as the virus continues its rapid spread across the country. Health experts say the pandemic is virtually out of control and hospitals report being close to collapse.   We've heard a lot about the Covid variant that was first identified in South Africa - whichscientists believe could be more contagiousor more resistant to current vaccines. The strain has now been detected in dozens of other countries. In the UK, there have been 360 cases of the variant. A travel ban is currently in place for South Africa and nine other southern African countries and, while UK residents and Irish nationals are exempt, those arrivals must still quarantine. But is the government targeting enough countries with travel bans? On 16 March,external, the World Health Organisation identified 64 countries where the South Africa variant had been found. Of those, only 11 are on the ""red list"" which bans arrivals. According to Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial College, some countries - including France - are seeing that a significant fraction of their cases are the South Africa variant. He suggested that as there is ""a lot of essential travel"" between the UK and France, the government should consider further measures to reduce the risk of more of the variant reaching the UK.

Olga RobinsonBBC Monitoring Online communities sharing harmful anti-vaccine content have grown significantly during the pandemic,according to new BBC Monitoring researchon seven countries across Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe. Facebook accounts promoting false information about vaccines saw a boost in followers in Brazil, Mexico, India, Ukraine, France, Tanzania and Kenya over the past year. Vaccine misinformation in these countries appears to mainly spread in groups where a range of topics such as health, religion, politics and conspiracy theories are discussed. In Brazil, Mexico, Tanzania and Kenya some religious pages promoted misleading claims and conspiracy theories about vaccines to their large online audiences. In India we found anti-vaccine content was largely driven by individuals promoting traditional medicine. Our research also showed a political and nationalistic dimension to online debates about vaccination in some countries, which often featured criticism of and misleading claims about foreign vaccines. The findings were released on the final day of theBBC's Trust in News conference, at which technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones questioned social media companies about what they have done to tackle disinformation on their platforms. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Prime Minister Boris Johnson has plunged
headlong into an issue thatâs proving controversial within his own party. Speaking to a group of senior MPs earlier this afternoon, Mr Johnson suggested that, as restrictions
ease, people may have to provide proof of vaccination to visit a pub. This, he suggested, would be up to
individual publicans. The prime minister said the
""basic concept of a vaccine certification should not be totally alien to
us"". But the use of vaccine passports, or
certificates, domestically has previously been denounced as ""divisive"" - by none other than Mr Johnsonâs own
vaccines minister. At the same meeting, in answer to another question, Mr Johnson declared that
care home companies would be acting âresponsiblyâ if they required all staff
to be vaccinated. â""It doesnât seem to me to be
irresponsible at all â far from it, it's highly responsible â for care
home companies to think about requiring vaccinations,"" he said, speaking to the Liaisons Committee. There is an ongoing debate inside government over whether to make Covid vaccinations compulsory for social
care workers, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock setting out some of the benefits of this approach, But Unison, which represents staff, opposes mandatory vaccination. Now the prime minister seems to be floating a slightly different solution â by placing responsibility on employers to require that their staff be vaccinated. This will seen by some as
compulsion by the back door -  or what critics have called ""jabs for jobs"". India will open up vaccinations for those over the age of 45 from 1 April India has placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, foreign ministry sources have told the BBC. They said rising cases meant domestic demand was expected to pick up in the coming weeks, and so the doses were needed for India's own rollout. The move - described as a ""temporary squeeze"" by officials - is expected to affect supplies until the end of April. Some 190 countries under the Covax scheme are likely to be affected. India's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India (SII), has delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to several countries in recent days, including the UK and Brazil. India has exported more than 60 million vaccine doses to 76 countries so far, with the majority of these being the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. The decision comes as India faces a surge in coronavirus cases. On Wednesday it recorded its sharpest daily rise this year, with more than 47,000 new cases and 275 deaths. There has been no official comment from the government or the Serum Institute on the decision. Read more. Some countries and travel firms are looking at whether people could be asked to prove their Covid status with a vaccine passport Earlier,we heard from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnsonwho was asked about whether Covid vaccination certificates or passports could be used to help British society open up. Asked whether they could be used by pubs to allow people in, Mr Johnson said ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". But the idea has been met with some criticism. Mr Johnson's fellow Conservative MP Steve Baker - a member of the lockdown-sceptic Coronavirus Research Group - has warned that the prime minister âbegan to tread a dangerous path when he opened the door to domestic Covid certificatesâ today. âFirst they said weâll need them to watch the football, and today that it may be papers for the pub. âWhether the state legislates for it, recommends it or simply allows it the result will be the same: a two-tier Britain that prevents pregnant women from taking part in society, given that the government is telling them not to take the vaccine, or one where we turn back the clock and tolerate businesses turning away customers from communities which have shown an unfortunate hesitancy to take up the offer of a vaccine. âWe must not fall into this ghastly trap.â Laura GoodwinBBC Scotland Two separate studies have found that women under the age of 50 had worse long-term outcomes after being in hospital with Covid-19. Research led by Glasgow University followed 327 adults from around the UK who were admitted to hospital between 5 February and 5 October last year. Participants were followed for between three and 11 months. It found that women under 50 had higher odds of worse outcomes when compared with men and older participants - and this was even if the woman had no previous health problems, the study found. They were five times less likely to report feeling fully recovered three months or more after the onset of their infection, twice as likely to report worse fatigue and seven times more likely to be more breathless. We've got more on the findings here. We've found out some more about how the NHS coped during the second wave of the pandemic - and in particular, how intensive care units fared. Two patients were moved to a hospital 300 miles away because of an intensive care bed shortage - and an unprecedented 2,300 intensive care patients were moved between UK hospitals. The data covers the period from September 2020 to March 2021. Front-line doctors, speaking for the first time, say these transfers were the only way to care for patients. And NHS England said the health service had responded well under intense pressure. Read the full story here. The UK and EU have said they are working on creating a ""win-win"" situation and to expand vaccine supply for all citizens, as the row involving demand for the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab continues. The UK government and European Commission have just released a joint statement. âWe are all facing the same pandemic and
the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,"" it reads. ""We have been discussing what more we can
do to ensure a reciprocally beneficial relationship between the UK and EU on
Covid-19. ""Given our interdependencies, we are
working on specific steps we can take - in the short-, medium - and long term -
to create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all our citizens. ""In the end, openness and global
co-operation of all countries will be key to finally overcome this pandemic and
ensure better preparation for meeting future challenges. ""We will continue our discussions.â Earlier the government published its daily coronavirus figures, showing another 5,605 cases had been confirmed and a further 98 people had died with the virus. This continues the trend of a falling number of deaths, although the decline in cases has slowed. Meanwhile, the vaccine rollout continues. As our graphs show, more than 31 million jabs have now been administered of which more than 28 million are people's first doses. The Vatican said cuts were being made ""with the aim of safeguarding current jobs"" The Vatican's income has plummeted during the pandemic as museums and other attractions such as St Peter's Basilica have been forced to close. It's now expecting a deficit of â¬50m (Â£43m) this year. Pope Francis has now ordered pay cuts for cardinals and other clerics starting from next month. Cardinals are believed to receive up to â¬5,000 (Â£4,300) a month and often live in subsidised accommodation - but will now have their pay reduced by 10%. Priests and other clerics will see their salaries cut by between 3% and 8% and planned salary increases will be suspended until March 2023. The pope, who is the head of the Catholic Church, has previously said he does not want to fire people in difficult economic times. Read the full story here. Boris Johnson has been answering questions from a committee of senior MPs As we've been reporting, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been facing questions from MPs this afternoon about a whole range of issues - including about the government's handling of the pandemic. He is up in front of the liaison committee, which is made up of all the MPs who lead the different parliamentary committees, and which gets to grill the PM a few times each year. Conservative MP William Wragg asks what Johnson's thoughts are on vaccine certificates, for example proof of a vaccine that could allow someone to do certain things. Could they be used for ordinary people to be allowed into pub, for example? The prime minister says ""that's the kind of thing that may be up to individual publicans"". You can read more about vaccine passports here.A government review, which is being led by Michael Gove, is due to consider whether a vaccine passport could be also be used to allow visitors entry to venues such as bars, theatres or sports stadiums. Today's daily coronavirus figures have beenpublished by the government.,external They show another 5,605 cases have been recorded, and a further 98 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. Meanwhile the latest vaccination figures show that more than 28.6 million people have now had their first dose, after another 325,650 first doses given yesterday. Fellow Conservative William Wragg - who chairs the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee - has asked the PM about the possibility of international travel this summer. The PM says the government will get the findings of its global travel taskforce on 5 April and thereafter he will ""be setting out what may be possible from 17 May"". But he warns ""things are looking difficult on the continent and we will have to look at the situation as it develops"". He agrees there is a wide spectrum of scientific opinion on the matter, but assures his colleague advisors advise but ministers will decide. The Labour chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Yvette Cooper, has asked Boris Johnson why France has not been put on the UK's red list, given the rise in cases and new variants. The prime minister explains that putting a countryon the ""red list"",externalhas consequences for the supply of medicines and foods to the UK - a nod to the huge haulage industry that sees goods crossing the channel -  but the PM concedes ""we will have to look at tougher measures"" if the circumstances change. Cooper says 20,000 people are coming to the UK from France every week and two-thirds of arrivals are exempt from restrictions - she wants to know why hauliers are not being tested in the UK. Johnson says the numbers have ""massively diminished"" in recent months - but says he will ""look at the situation in the Channel"" and ""can't rule out further measures"" on people arriving from France. Why is the PM not taking action now, asks Cooper? Johnson says there is ""a balance to be struck"" given the ""very serious disruption"" that would occur to cross-channel trade. ""We will take action if necessary to protect public health"" he adds and ""we may have to do it ""very soon"". Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Labour MP Meg Hillier asks Boris Johnson what his biggest regret is over the past year. The prime minister prevaricates, saying he ""wouldn't want to make a mistake about my biggest mistake and single out the wrong one"" but commits once again to ""a proper inquiry in due course"". Hillier homes in on the Test and Trace programme and asks the prime minister if he is ""content"" with having committed Â£37bn to it. Johnson says Test and Trace has been ""an extraordinary achievement"", adding 80% of the money goes on labs and testing, which is ""desperately needed"". It has given us ""the tools to fight"" the virus, he states. He says the data derived from the Test and Trace programme, in terms of new variants and where they have been arisen, has allowed the government to study ""what is happening with the pandemic in a very granular way"". He insists it has been of ""crucial importance"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is appearing before a special House of Commons committee made up of senior politicians who have been grilling him on a range of issues. Asked about the potential threat of the European Union restricting Covid vaccine exports, he said the co-operation the UK has with the EU is ""very important"" and he doesn't believe blockades ""are sensible"". Long-term damage done by blockades can be ""very considerable"", he told the chairman of the Health Committee Conservative Jeremy Hunt. Anyone considering a blockade may want to think about how companies would view a country where such things are imposed, he warns. Hunt asks if nothing will be ""taken off the table"" to make sure the UK gets vaccines. Johnson says ""we will do everything that is necessary"" to make sure that people get their vaccines. Would you like a Covid test with your chips? Some US residents can now get one alongside a meal after food ordering service DoorDash announced they'll deliver at-home tests to cities across the country. Two types of tests will be available - a nasal swab or a saliva sample - the company said. Both can yield results within 24 to 48 hours. It is the first such scheme to be launched by a delivery service. ""Amidst the pandemic, one of our priorities has been to make health and wellness essentials more accessible for customers, and we will continue to expand our offerings in the healthcare space,"" a spokesperson for DoorDash said. The prices and availability of testing kits in the US vary, though the ones offered by DoorDash range in price from $109 (Â£79) to $119 (Â£87) and may require a video call with medical personnel during the test.

"More oil and gas wells are to be drilled in the North Sea, the UK government has announced. The decision has angered environmental campaigners, who say the government should refuse new licences. Ministers say permission to drill will be granted as part of a careful transition away from fossil fuels, safeguarding jobs and the economy. But the environmentalists say that enough fossil fuels to ruin the climate have already been found. In light of this, they say, the government should have refused the new licences. They add that the decision undermines the UK position as leader of the vital UN climate conference in November, known as COP26. But ministers insist that their strategy will work. So-called ""checkpoints"" will be introduced that take into account domestic demand for oil and gas, projected production levels, the increase in clean technologies such as offshore wind, and the sectorâs progress in cutting emissions. The sector will face targets to reduce emissions by 10% by 2025 and 25% by 2027. It is also committed to cut emissions by 50% by 2030. It will be helped by joint government and private investment of up to Â£16bn by 2030. Six questions about the Cumbria coal controversy Government U-turn puts new coal mine on hold This will include up to Â£10bn for hydrogen production and Â£3bn for a technology called carbon capture, usage and storage - where carbon emissions are either turned into other products such as plastics or buried. The government says the deal should cut pollution by up to 60 million tonnes by 2030, while also supporting up to 40,000 jobs across the supply chain. Mel Evans from Greenpeace  said: âThis is a colossal failure. The UK will make a fool of itself in the run-up to hosting the COP26 global climate talks if our energy minister signs off on new oil and gas licences that serve to rip up the Paris Agreement (the world deal to hold global temperature rise to 1.5C). âWe know the government has already approved too much oil and gas extraction to meet our climate obligations under Paris, and the oil industry itself says that weâve passed peak oil demand.â Denmark recently announced a decision toreject new licences for oil drilling in the North Sea.,external The UK Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said he would follow a different path: âToday, we are sending a clear message around the world that the UK will be a nation of clean energy. âWe will not leave oil and gas workers behind in the irreversible shift away from fossil fuels. We will power the green industrial revolution, turning its focus to the next-generation clean technologies the UK needs to support a green economy.â The UK needs clean forms of energy such as offshore wind in order to meet its emissions targets He was supported by Deirdre Mitchie, chief executive of Oil and Gas UK, who told BBC News: âOngoing exploration and production is compatible with net zero emissions â weâre pleased that the government has recognised this."" Net zero means reducing greenhouse emissions as much as possible and then balancing any that remain by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland, told BBC News: âEvery new licence makes it more difficult to achieve the reductions we need and risks creating an even bigger âcliff edgeâ for oil and gas workers. âAs climate science continues to be updated, itâs entirely possible that thereâs going to have to be an even quicker tail-off in oil and gas production than is currently predicted. âIf we want the transition to be a fair one, then instead of wasting any more time opening up new fossil fuel reserves, efforts would be better used to more rapidly harness existing skills and direct them toward the zero-carbon industries we all need.â Details have also been given about the UKâs previously-announced plans to stop funding overseas projects that directly support fossil fuels â that will now happen at the end of March. It will see the UK cease export finance, aid funding and trade promotion for new crude oil, natural gas or thermal coal projects. However, a controversial gas scheme in Mozambique will still go ahead because it has already been approved. In the last four years, the government supported Â£21bn of UK oil and gas exports. The need to protect workers in oil and gas has been stressed by an independent group studying Scotlandâs transition to a clean economy. The so-called Just Transition Commission warns that creating a near-zero carbon future means a fundamental transformation of the nationâs economy that must be implemented fairly. It says the transition must be made by the people of Scotland, not done to the people of Scotland. And the shift must be a ânational mission with social justice at its heartâ. The commission - recruited by the Scottish government from industry, trades unions and academia - says worker education and skills training will be vital. It says the great move towards low carbon must be done in co-operation with the unions.

"The election has been widely seen as a referendum on Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu could struggle to secure enough parliamentary seats to stay in power, preliminary results from Tuesday's election show. Local media said Mr Netanyahu's right-wing bloc would end up with 52 seats - nine short of the threshold. In a surprise development, an Arab party which is projected to get four seats could hold the balance of power. The outcome will among other things determine the course of Israel's relations with the Palestinians. The Arab party, Raam, has not declared whether it will support the efforts of Mr Netanyahu -  not a natural ally - to form a governing coalition or those of the bloc of parties opposed to him remaining in office. The Netanyahu opponents are set to win 57 seats, and although backing from Raam could give them a majority, they are fragmented and unlikely to be able to agree to work together. If neither bloc succeeds, the country could face its fifth election since 2019. Israel's electoral system, a form of proportional representation, makes it almost impossible for a single party to win an election outright. According to the Central Election Commission, the prime minister's right-wing Likud party won 24.2% of the vote. The centrist Yesh Atid party of the main opposition leader, Yair Lapid, was second with 13.9%. Election hopes and fears play out in crater town Israel's commando-turned-PM Israeli media reported that the tallies would result in Likud getting 30 seats in the 120-seat Knesset and Yesh Atid 17. Mr Netanyahu's political allies, the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties Shas and United Torah Judaism, were projected to get nine and seven seats respectively; the centrist Blue and White party of Defence Minister Benny Gantz eight; and the centre-left Labour party and the nationalist Yamina and Yisrael Beitenu parties seven each. The Joint List alliance of Arab parties, the New Hope party of Mr Netanyahu's former-ally-turned-opponent Gideon Saar, the far-right Religious Zionism alliance and the left-wing Meretz party are forecast to win six apiece; and Raam four. Yair Lapid leader Yesh Atid said his party and his supporters had a ""good reason to be proud"" After the initial projections by Israel's main broadcasters on Tuesday night, Benjamin Netanyahu took to the stage smiling at Likud's headquarters. He declared the vote ""a great achievement"" and spoke of the need for a ""stable government"" for Israel. His opponent Mr Lapid said he was ""proud"" of Yesh Atid's ""enormous"" achievement and that he would ""do everything possible to establish a sane government"". There is plenty of political drama about who is going to sit in Israel's parliament, and especially who is going to be in charge. But with so little movement from the results of previous elections, this vote shows once again how deeply divided Israeli politics are. There are those who are for Benjamin Netanyahu and those who are against him. Already there are deals being done and moves being made behind the scenes. It looks like Mr Netanyahu's best path to securing another term would be a highly unusual one that could involve building a coalition with Jewish ultra-Orthodox, ultra-nationalist and Arab parties. How that would work is almost anyone's guess. Israelis are left wondering whether this election will ultimately prove to be inconclusive once again and the long period of political stalemate will continue. It appears that both Mr Netanyahu and his rivals will require the support of Yamina and Raam to secure a majority. Raam split from the Joint List earlier this year in part because Raam's leader Mansour Abbas said he was open to working with Mr Netanyahu to address the needs of Israel's Arab citizens, who make up about 20% of the population. In an interview on Wednesday morning, Mr Abbas said he would not rule out joining any coalition. ""We are not in anyone's pocket. We are prepared to engage with both sides,"" he told Israel's 103 FM radio station. Israeli Arabs make up about 20% of the population However, Bezalel Smotrich, a Netanyahu ally and the leader of Religious Zionism, indicated on Thursday that the prime minister could not rely on its support if he made a deal with Raam. ""A right-wing government will not be formed based on Mansour Abbas's [party]. Period,"" he tweeted. An Arab party has never sat in government in Israel, and such parties do not share Mr Netanyahu's right-wing ideology. Yamina is led by Mr Netanyahu's former protÃ©gÃ© and defence minister, Naftali Bennett, with whom he has a difficult relationship. Like Mr Abbas, Mr Bennett has not announced which side he will throw his weight behind. ""I will do only what is good for the State of Israel,"" he said after voting ended on Tuesday night. It will determine who is in charge of one of the most powerful countries in the region, a state which the US considers one of its most important allies. The next government will also shape relations with the Palestinians and Arab countries. Mr Netanyahu opposes the kind of fully fledged independent state Palestinians are seeking in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza, and supports Jewish settlements in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. A centrist or centre-left government would be more likely to try to revive stalled negotiations with the Palestinians and consider territorial concessions in return for peace. The outcome could also affect Mr Netanyahu's trial on corruption charges, which is due to resume in two weeks' time. Analysts suggest a right-wing government could attempt to block the trial from proceeding. The prime minister denies any wrongdoing. The election was widely seen as a referendum on Mr Netanyahu's leadership. The 71-year-old prime minister has been in power continuously since 2009, having served an earlier three-year term in the late 1990s. His campaign focused on Israel's world-leading Covid-19 vaccination programme and his diplomatic success in normalising ties with some Arab countries. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Bateman spent 2020 following the lives of Israelis affected by the pandemic. But his opponents from across the political spectrum accused him of mishandling the pandemic and argued that he should not remain in office while standing trial. After the previous three elections neither Mr Netanyahu nor his rivals were able to form a stable governing coalition. The current national unity government, which was the result of a power-sharing deal with Defence Minister Benny Gantz, collapsed in December after just seven months.

"About 70,000 students attend Northern Ireland's further education colleges Hundreds of lecturers at further education colleges in Northern Ireland are holding a one-day strike. Staff belonging to the University and College Union (UCU) aretaking the action in a dispute over pay and workload. But the Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said the union rejected a pay offer amounting to a 7% rise. The UCU said their members in further education colleges had only received a 3.8% pay rise since 2013/14. About 70,000 students attend Northern Ireland's six Further Education (FE) colleges, according to figures from the Department for the Economy (DfE). Many of those students take vocational courses and many study part-time. The UCU said the Department for the Economy had failed to increase FE college funding so that employers could pay staff fairly. But BBC News NI has obtained a letter from Ms Dodds to Stormont's economy committee in which she said she did not have any ""direct role"" in the dispute. ""Further education colleges are employers in their own right and are responsible for determining the terms and conditions of lecturing staff,"" she wrote. However, the minister claimed the UCU action would have ""a detrimental effect on some of the most vulnerable learners, many of whom are already struggling to cope with the impact of a prolonged period of online learning and social isolation"". Many students in further education take vocational courses She told the committee the College Employers' Forum (CEF) had made an offer to trade unions of a 7% pay rise ""which they consider could be met from within existing budgets"". The CEF is made up of the chairs and chief executives of Northern Ireland's six FE colleges. ""Trade Union Side then submitted a pay claim seeking 11.7% and advising that the 7% offer was unacceptable,"" Ms Dodds wrote. But in a separate statement the UCU said the 7% pay offer was spread over a four-year period. UCU said it was ""barely better than pay restraint and fails to adequately compensate for the years when lecturers received no cost of living increases at all"". Further education lecturers to strike over pay Teachers agree new pay deal to end dispute The UCU official in Northern Ireland Katharine Clarke said as DfE determined funding to FE colleges they were ""clearly responsible for stagnating pay"". ""UCU members are going on strike because they have received a paltry 3.8% increase in total since 2013/14,"" she said. ""School teachers have received 11.25% over the same period. ""The offer of 7% over four years in the context of the previous capped awards equates to 1.2% per year over a nine-year period. ""No other workforce in the public sector has been subject to such a derisory increase."" But in Ms Dodds' letter, she said she had no authority to intervene in talks between the colleges and unions and that DfE would only become involved when agreement was reached. ""It is only when agreement has been reached through that process that a business case is submitted to the Department for appraisal,"" she said. ""Should the business case be considered to be sufficiently robust it can then be approved and consideration given to meeting any additional resource requirements."" Ms Dodds also said UCU did not represent all lecturers in FE colleges, as many were members of the NASUWT and NEU. She also claimed unions had also rejected a previous three-year pay offer of an increase of over 10% in 2020 without balloting their members, and concluded by urging the unions and employers to resume negotiations. But the UCU accused Ms Dodds of failing to meet them and of ""shirking her responsibility"" for underfunding FE colleges. The union said strike action would be followed by action short of a strike unless the minister and department ""secure more funding for colleges and a proper pay rise for college lecturers"". That action short of strike will see UCU members refusing to work overtime, and boycotting any un-agreed additional duties. Monica Goligher, a lecturer in biology at Belfast Met, is among those taking part in Wednesday's strike. She told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme she believes striking staff will have the support of their students and the wider public because ""they appreciate what we do"". Ms Goligher said lecturers' workload had ""imploded"" since their most recent contract was negotiated in 2009, and had increased further as a result of the pandemic. Staff have taken on a ""huge administrative burden"" as well as additional teaching requirements over those last 12 years, she explained. ""That has been compounded by moving to teach online, practically in full, since last March with less than 24 hours to prepare to do that."" Ms Goligher was asked if their pay claim was justified, given that nurses who are risking their lives working on the frontline during the coronavirus pandemic have been offered a 1% pay rise. ""We are the people who will step [up] to retrain, re-skill those who have lost their jobs in industries that have been particularly impacted by Covid and the ongoing economic difficulties,"" she replied. ""Minister Dodds can decide whether that is going to be a task that she is asking of a demotivated, demoralised and exhausted workforce in further education.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: Police raid the home of a vaccine-text fraudster More than 6,000 cases of Covid-related fraud and cyber-crime have been recorded by the UK's police forces during the pandemic. The Action Fraud team said Â£34.5m had been stolen since 1 March 2020. It covers activity in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not Scotland. In a related development, the National Cyber Security Centre has told the BBC it is tackling about 30 ""significant attacks"" a month against the country's pandemic response infrastructure. These involves attempts to breach the NHS, vaccine producers and vaccine supply chains, among other organisations. ""There unfortunately have been a number of successful ransomware incidents against businesses - I can think of roughly around 10,"" NCSC operations director Paul Chichester said. This is one of the scripts used to con victims to believe they were talking to their bank Other figures disclosed by City of London Police, which co-ordinates efforts to combat fraud, include: more than 150 related arrests were made since the pandemic began more than 2,000 websites, phone numbers and email addresses linked to the crimes were taken down there was a total of 416,000 reports of fraud and cyber-crime The activity peaked between April and May 2020, and January 2021 - both times when lockdowns were in force. The Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit, which tackles criminal gangs responsible for financial fraud and scams, worked with social media platforms to take down over 700 accounts linked to fraudulent activity in 2020, of which over 250 were money mule recruiters. But this may be the tip of the iceberg. The National Crime Agency estimates that just one in five fraud cases are typically reported to the police. And the volunteer-run Cyber Helpline told the BBC only a quarter of those who had contacted it after a cyber-attack said they had also reported the incident to the police. Many of the scams involved conning people out of their money and financial details by focusing on internet shopping. Related fraud was 42% higher over the pandemic than the preceding year, as criminals took advantage of the fact many physical stores had been forced to close. Anna - not her real name - from Cheltenham was one of thousands of people who received an SMS message asking her to go online and rearrange a parcel delivery. She filled in her details, but later suspected something was wrong. She alerted her bank and cancelled her bank card. Anna came close to being thousands of pounds out of pocket ""I thought, now I have nothing to worry about, everything is fine and case closed,"" she told the BBC. But the criminals used the details they had already obtained to authorise her bank to credit her account with a Â£9,000 loan. And a short while later they called her, pretending to be the bank. Not realising the scam, Anna told them she had not taken out a loan. ""They gave me the sort code and bank account number I needed to pay back the loan, and said if I paid the Â£9,000 there wouldn't be any charges. ""But then I was still feeling suspicious, so I Googled the sort code, and it came up with a completely different bank."" So, Anna called her bank directly and realised the scammers had returned. ""I didn't lose any money but it did feel like a real burglary to be honest,"" she said. She closed her account, and changed her email address and mobile number. But she still does not feel safe. Charities are also common targets. One in three charities suffered a cyber-attack during the first 10 months of the pandemic, according to Ecclesiastical Insurance. One victim actually specialises in offering cyber-security advice to others. Hackers got inside Charity Digital's network for seven days without being detected. They compromised its email accounts and sent false invoices to clients. The organisation's chief executive, Jonathan Chevallier, told the BBC the breach had not been noticed in part because all his staff had been working from home. Charity Digital spent more than Â£10,000 investigating the attack and has produced an online webinar to help others avoid a similar fate. Another popular type of cyber-fraud involved romance scams, in which people looking for relationships via the net often get fooled into sending money to prospective partners, who prey on their emotions. This type of crime was 20% more common over the past year than the one before. Fraudsters sometimes use ""Sim farms"" to send texts - this unit holds eight cards to quickly send multiple messages at once City of London Police also said key workers had also been specifically targeted. In one case, a man was arrested on suspicion of using social media to advertise bogus car insurance policies to NHS workers. The pandemic appears, however, to have coincided with a fall in one type of cyber-crime. Reported cases of computer software service fraud - in which criminals call offering fake tech support to fool victims into sharing their payment card details and other credentials - dropped by 15.5%.

"Police in Wales have had to enforce sometimes ""unpopular"" Covid rules, say officers Front-line police officers should have been prioritised for the Covid vaccine, according to the head of one force. Chief Constable Pam Kelly said it has been one of her biggest concerns during the crisis. The Gwent Police boss agreed that NHS staff and the vulnerable should come first, but she wanted greater protection for her staff. The Welsh government said there is insufficient evidence to support vaccination by occupation. Police officers often attend the same scenes as health workers but are the only ones not vaccinated, said Mrs Kelly. ""We salute NHS staff, they've been outstanding. But often you will get an ambulance worker, health worker and police officer at the same scene,"" she said. ""When there's a violent person, police officers are there trying to protect the health workers - yet it's the police officer that's not vaccinated. Policing Covid: 'Coughed at and spat on' Police officers 'must be on vaccine priority list' Third of officers 'face Covid infection threats' ""It's a real concern for me. It's all about having enough emergency workers to respond to 999 and 101 calls and the vaccination for police officers would have been a really strong voice in saying we're grateful for what you've done. ""They're not asking for money - all we're asking for is for our officers to be safe."" Chief Constable Pam Kelly wants greater protection from Covid for officers More than 4,000 emergency workers have been assaulted in Wales over the last 20 months, she added. ""Sometimes Covid has been used as a weapon. I understand without question the need for the vulnerable to be vaccinated, but at this stage where the wider community is being vaccinated, I feel very strongly that front-line policing should be vaccinated,"" she said. Mrs Kelly added that out of a 1,400 strong workforce, just 140 have had the vaccine - based purely on their age or vulnerability. But as crime dropped around 15%, demand for policing increased significantly, she said. The role of the police has changed during the pandemic, even checking where people are walking and with whom In the neighbouring South Wales Police force, Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan is equally concerned about the impact the pandemic has had on staff. ""It's taken its toll. On a weekly basis I'm texting somebody who is poorly, somebody who is in hospital, I've visited families, I've been to a number of funerals. We really care about their wellbeing and welfare,"" he said. Police officers ""absolutely"" should be prioritised for Covid vaccines, Temporary Chief Constable of Dyfed Powys Police Claire Parmenter said. She told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""I'm pleased that in recent weeks officers have started to get offered reserve vaccines where, at the end of the day, there are some vaccines leftover. ""But it's critical that we continue to support officers for the vaccination because they have no choice but to put themselves at risk."" Many have opposed legislation giving police greater power to crack down on protests As a border force, different rules in England and Wales added to the confusing picture. Initially the focus remained on engaging, explaining and encouraging compliance, but enforcement has increasingly been a factor. In the last 12 months the role of policing changed significantly. While crime remained a priority, officers were asked to step in and police far more of our lives - right down to where we took a walk and with whom. People in Cardiff protested in January over the death of Mahmoud Hassan, who died after being released from police custody Team that with protests - and a national focus on the way police have handled protests in a pandemic, from Black Lives Matter to women's safety demonstrations following the murder of Sarah Everard. Has it impacted their relationship with their community? ""I can't thank communities enough for the way they've worked with us,"" said Mrs Kelly, who was interviewed beforeofficers in Bristol were injured during protestson Monday. ""I don't want to become the Covid police - and we've carried on tackling serious organised crime with vigour - but ultimately we have seen some fragility in terms of the relationships between policing and the community. ""We've had about 73 protests during the Covid crisis and protests are very difficult to police."" Images of Patsy Stevenson being detained by police at a vigil for Sarah Everard in London were shared widely She said they had worked with protesters - some had moved online, others were done in a Covid-secure way. Hundreds at protest after Sarah Everard's death Black Lives Matter protest: Hundreds in Barry and Chepstow Her south Wales counterpart Mr Vaughan, who was also interviewed before the Bristol protests, added people have the right to be heard - but the rules have changed in Covid times. ""People want their voices to be heard - and people are protesting on some really important issues,"" he said. ""In ordinary times the police would work really hard to allow those voices to be heard- to facilitate those protests, but these aren't ordinary times. They're extraordinary times. ""There comes a point after a few days of protest, and we've warned them on a number of times, that we need to take action. ""That's not for one second calling into question the right of individual's voices to be heard, or indeed the things that they want to talk about which are extremely important things, but we're being called to help protect people from a global pandemic."" Thousands of people joined anti-racism protests across Wales last summer The Welsh government thanked officers for doing a ""fantastic job"" enforcing coronavirus regulations. However a spokesman said it was following the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to vaccinate according to age, as that ""remains the strongest factor"" linked to deaths and hospitalisations from the virus. ""The JCVI has looked at prioritisation by occupation but found there wasn't sufficient evidence for this,"" he added. ""It has advised that the complexity of delivering this approach would slow down the pace of the vaccination roll-out."" Black Lives Matter protests continue around Wales.

"This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel says the new rules are based on the principle of fairness The home secretary has set out what she has called a ""fair but firm"" overhaul to the way people applying for asylum in the UK are treated. Priti Patel said, for the first time, people seeking protection as refugees would have their claim assessed based on how they arrive in the UK. She said ministers would crack down on people smugglers because ""enough is enough"". Labour said the plans lacked compassion and competence. Under the changes, people who arrive in the UK by what the government call illegal means to claim asylum will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive through proper channels. There were35,099 asylum claims,externalmade in the UK during the year ending March 2020, with Iran, Albania and Iraq providing the most applicants. More than 8,000 people crossed the Channel in small boats, with the help of people smugglers. What happens to migrants who reach the UK? UK to consider sending asylum seekers abroad Asylum seekers could be processed on old ferries Setting out the plans to MPs, Ms Patel said the government would introduce a ""faster and fairer"" system that would ""better support the most vulnerable"". Ms Patel said ""serious organised criminal gangs"" were exploiting people trying to get to the UK, and that it was these same gangs who were also involved in ""serious violent crimes"" in the UK such as trafficking guns and drugs. ""Families and young children have lost their lives at sea, in lorries and in shipping containers having put their trust in the hands of criminals,"" she added. ""The way to stop these deaths is to stop the trade in people that causes them."" She said the new measures will create ""safe and legal routes"", and that people should be claiming asylum in the EU country in which they first arrive, rather than using it as a springboard to reach the UK. ""If you illegally enter the UK via a safe country in which you could have claimed asylum, you are not seeking refuge from imminent peril, as is the intended purpose of the asylum system, but are picking the UK as a preferred destination over others,"" she said. This video can not be played Labour's shadow home secretary says the asylum plans are ""lacking in compassion"" She said the system was currently ""clogged up"" with bogus claims and legal wrangles. But human rights lawyers have warned the plans are unlawful because they ignore Britain's international obligations under the Refugee Convention. Labour said the proposals would do ""next to nothing to stop people making dangerous crossings"" or to deal with criminal gangs. There are two enormous legal elephants trumpeting away in the shiny glass atrium of the Home Office that are casting some really significant doubts on whether the home secretary's plan is deliverable. Firstly, can she treat some refugees who have a recognised case for protection differently from others, purely based on how they reached the UK? Under the UN Refugee Convention (which, history fans, the UK government helped write in 1951) states can't penalise people in need who come ""directly"" from their homeland - or anyone who has ""good cause"" to enter a nation illegally. Official sources say Ms Patel's restrictions would be legally possible because asylum seekers are not allowed to go ""shopping"" for the best destination. But even if the restrictions are introduced, and the Home Office wants to send people back to France or elsewhere, how is that going to happen? The UK has no legal agreement with EU nations to take these people back. And that's because we chose to leave it as part of Brexit. The BBC has learnt that the Home Office has not sent any failed asylum seekers back to EU states since the end of the Brexit transition three months ago. The home secretary's plans for asylum rely on striking agreements with other safe countries who would be willing to take people who have passed through their territory on the way to the UK. Many people smugglers send asylum seekers across the Channel in dangerously small boats Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told MPs the changes proposed by the government ""risk making the situation even worse for victims of human trafficking as it would make seeking help in the UK even harder"". ""The government policy is defined by a lack of compassion and a lack of competence, the plans risk baking in to the UK system the callousness of this government's approach,"" he said. Responding to Ms Patel's pledges, Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon accused the government of ""seeking to unjustly differentiate between the deserving and undeserving refugee"" by giving protection ""based on how they travel to the UK"". Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said it was ""slightly misleading to say people have a choice between the legal and illegal route"" adding ""for many people the clandestine means will be their only way to get to the UK"". She also said there would be ""complex issues"" about whether other countries would be willing to take back asylum seekers deemed to have arrived in the UK via irregular routes. Asked if any EU states had agreed to take people back, Ms Patel replied that she was currently in discussions with those countries. There was support from Conservative MPs in the Commons, including West Bromwich MP Shaun Bailey who said: ""Just like my constituents, I'm angry at the images that we're seeing of small boats coming into the Channel and the sky-rocketing costs of our asylum system. ""The broader issue here is this: our European neighbours need to step up. It's as simple as that."" This video can not be played 'Nobody chooses persecution' - criticism of asylum changes from an asylum seeker The Home Office said that ""for the first time"" the question of whether asylum seekers enter the UK via another ""safe"" country, such as France would ""have an impact"" on how it dealt with claims. The government would seek the ""rapid removal from the UK"" of rejected applicants, with appeals ""reformed to speed up"" the process, it added. But asylum seekers fleeing persecution or violence and coming to the UK via the ""legal resettlement"" route from countries such as Syria and Iran would straight away get permission to remain in the UK indefinitely, the Home Office said. Under the new plans, anyone who pays criminal gangs to bring them to the UK would only ever receive temporary permission to remain and would be regularly assessed for removal from the UK. Other proposals include bringing in ""rigorous"" age checks to stop adults entering the country by pretending to be children. The use of hotels to accommodate arrivals will end and the government will bring forward plans to expand the ""asylum estate"". Ms Patel said asylum applicants with criminal records who returned to the UK after being deported would receive a jail sentence of up to five years. The current maximum is six months. And people smugglers - responsible for shipping many of the 8,500 people who crossed the English Channel in small boats last year - could get life sentences.

Drama student Emmeline Hartley moved Â£1,000 out of her account after a man claiming to be from Barclays called. The number appeared to be genuine, but it was a spoof. The 28-year-old's bank has now agreed to fully reimburse her. Her story has been retweeted thousands of times and others have shared their experiences in response to her post.

On Friday, Ms Hartley said she had been taken in by atext message scam which claimed she owed payment to Royal Mailfor a package to be delivered. As her birthday was coming up and she was in a hurry, she said she had thought nothing of it and entered her bank details. The following day, a man called her and told her someone had tried to set up direct debits in her account to other firms. The con-artist told her she needed a new bank account as entering her details to the text had put her online banking at risk. He persuaded her to transfer the Â£1,000 - all her savings - to the new account and Ms Hartley said she had only fully realised she was being scammed when he had asked her to transfer her overdraft. When it did not work, she said she had broken down in tears and he had hung up.

"Prince Harry and his wife have stepped away from royal duties The Duke of Sussex is to become chief impact officer at the US coaching and mental health firm, BetterUp. Prince Harry saidin a statement,externalthat he was ""really excited"" about taking on the new role. His exact duties, hours and any payment are not clear. It is his latest job move after he and the Duchess of Sussexstepped back as senior royals in March last year. It also comes after the duke and Meghan gave an explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey earlier this month. In it, the couple alleged an unnamed royal family member had asked about how dark their son Archie's skin might be, before he was born.

Earlier this week, Buckingham Palace said adiversity review was under wayacross all royal households. 12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview Harry and Meghan step back Harry and Meghan rattle monarchy's gilded cage In his statement, Prince Harry said his goal in his new function would be to ""lift up critical dialogues around mental health, build supportive and compassionate communities, and foster an environment for honest and vulnerable conversations"". Prince Harry will not manage employees or have people report directly to him, but he is likely to spend some time in the company's San Francisco headquarters once it is safe to do so,BetterUp CEO Alexi Robichaux told the Wall Street Journal,external(WSJ). In his role as the company's first chief impact officer, Prince Harry is expected to have input into initiatives including product strategy decisions and charitable contributions, and advocate publicly on topics related to mental health, the WSJ reports. Prince Harry said that when he met Mr Robichaux, they ""instantly recognised a shared passion for helping others realise their full potential"". The chief impact officer position is relatively rare in the corporate world, notes the WSJ - it is seen more commonly in non-profit organisations such as Amnesty International. BetterUp, which was founded in 2013, provides mobile-based professional coaching, counselling and mentorship.

"The election has been widely seen as a referendum on Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu could struggle to secure enough parliamentary seats to stay in power, preliminary results from Tuesday's election show. Local media said Mr Netanyahu's right-wing bloc would end up with 52 seats - nine short of the threshold. In a surprise development, an Arab party which is projected to get four seats could hold the balance of power. The outcome will among other things determine the course of Israel's relations with the Palestinians. The Arab party, Raam, has not declared whether it will support the efforts of Mr Netanyahu -  not a natural ally - to form a governing coalition or those of the bloc of parties opposed to him remaining in office. The Netanyahu opponents are set to win 57 seats, and although backing from Raam could give them a majority, they are fragmented and unlikely to be able to agree to work together. If neither bloc succeeds, the country could face its fifth election since 2019. Israel's electoral system, a form of proportional representation, makes it almost impossible for a single party to win an election outright. According to the Central Election Commission, the prime minister's right-wing Likud party won 24.2% of the vote. The centrist Yesh Atid party of the main opposition leader, Yair Lapid, was second with 13.9%. Election hopes and fears play out in crater town Israel's commando-turned-PM Israeli media reported that the tallies would result in Likud getting 30 seats in the 120-seat Knesset and Yesh Atid 17. Mr Netanyahu's political allies, the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties Shas and United Torah Judaism, were projected to get nine and seven seats respectively; the centrist Blue and White party of Defence Minister Benny Gantz eight; and the centre-left Labour party and the nationalist Yamina and Yisrael Beitenu parties seven each. The Joint List alliance of Arab parties, the New Hope party of Mr Netanyahu's former-ally-turned-opponent Gideon Saar, the far-right Religious Zionism alliance and the left-wing Meretz party are forecast to win six apiece; and Raam four. Yair Lapid leader Yesh Atid said his party and his supporters had a ""good reason to be proud"" After the initial projections by Israel's main broadcasters on Tuesday night, Benjamin Netanyahu took to the stage smiling at Likud's headquarters. He declared the vote ""a great achievement"" and spoke of the need for a ""stable government"" for Israel. His opponent Mr Lapid said he was ""proud"" of Yesh Atid's ""enormous"" achievement and that he would ""do everything possible to establish a sane government"". There is plenty of political drama about who is going to sit in Israel's parliament, and especially who is going to be in charge. But with so little movement from the results of previous elections, this vote shows once again how deeply divided Israeli politics are. There are those who are for Benjamin Netanyahu and those who are against him. Already there are deals being done and moves being made behind the scenes. It looks like Mr Netanyahu's best path to securing another term would be a highly unusual one that could involve building a coalition with Jewish ultra-Orthodox, ultra-nationalist and Arab parties. How that would work is almost anyone's guess. Israelis are left wondering whether this election will ultimately prove to be inconclusive once again and the long period of political stalemate will continue. It appears that both Mr Netanyahu and his rivals will require the support of Yamina and Raam to secure a majority. Raam split from the Joint List earlier this year in part because Raam's leader Mansour Abbas said he was open to working with Mr Netanyahu to address the needs of Israel's Arab citizens, who make up about 20% of the population. In an interview on Wednesday morning, Mr Abbas said he would not rule out joining any coalition. ""We are not in anyone's pocket. We are prepared to engage with both sides,"" he told Israel's 103 FM radio station. Israeli Arabs make up about 20% of the population However, Bezalel Smotrich, a Netanyahu ally and the leader of Religious Zionism, indicated on Thursday that the prime minister could not rely on its support if he made a deal with Raam. ""A right-wing government will not be formed based on Mansour Abbas's [party]. Period,"" he tweeted. An Arab party has never sat in government in Israel, and such parties do not share Mr Netanyahu's right-wing ideology. Yamina is led by Mr Netanyahu's former protÃ©gÃ© and defence minister, Naftali Bennett, with whom he has a difficult relationship. Like Mr Abbas, Mr Bennett has not announced which side he will throw his weight behind. ""I will do only what is good for the State of Israel,"" he said after voting ended on Tuesday night. It will determine who is in charge of one of the most powerful countries in the region, a state which the US considers one of its most important allies. The next government will also shape relations with the Palestinians and Arab countries. Mr Netanyahu opposes the kind of fully fledged independent state Palestinians are seeking in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza, and supports Jewish settlements in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. A centrist or centre-left government would be more likely to try to revive stalled negotiations with the Palestinians and consider territorial concessions in return for peace. The outcome could also affect Mr Netanyahu's trial on corruption charges, which is due to resume in two weeks' time. Analysts suggest a right-wing government could attempt to block the trial from proceeding. The prime minister denies any wrongdoing. The election was widely seen as a referendum on Mr Netanyahu's leadership. The 71-year-old prime minister has been in power continuously since 2009, having served an earlier three-year term in the late 1990s. His campaign focused on Israel's world-leading Covid-19 vaccination programme and his diplomatic success in normalising ties with some Arab countries.

But his opponents from across the political spectrum accused him of mishandling the pandemic and argued that he should not remain in office while standing trial. After the previous three elections neither Mr Netanyahu nor his rivals were able to form a stable governing coalition. The current national unity government, which was the result of a power-sharing deal with Defence Minister Benny Gantz, collapsed in December after just seven months.
