"This video can not be played Milan quarantine resident: ""It's really important to be responsible in this moment"" The number of people to have died from the coronavirus in Italy has shot up by 133 in a day to 366, officials say. The total number of infections leapt 25% to 7,375 from 5,883, according to the Civil Protection agency. The jump in figures comes as millions adapt to radical measures introduced on Sunday in an attempt to contain the outbreak. Up to 16 million people in Lombardy and 14 provinces need special permission to travel under new quarantine rules. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also announced the closure of schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues across the whole country. The restrictions will last until 3 April. Latest updates here The latest figures mean Italy now has the highest number of confirmed infections outside China, where the outbreak originated in December. It has overtaken South Korea, where the total number of cases is nearing 7,400. Italy has one of the world's oldest populations.The virus is particularly dangerous for the elderlyand those with underlying health conditions. Among the latest people to test positive in Italy is the army's chief of staff. Salvatore Farina said he felt well and was self-isolating. The strict new quarantine measures affect a quarter of the Italian population and centre on the rich northern part of the country that powers its economy. The health system is under immense strain in Lombardy, a northern region of 10 million people, where people are being treated in hospital corridors. ""We want to guarantee the health of our citizens. We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices, sometimes small and sometimes very big,"" Prime Minister Conte said as he announced the measures in the middle of Saturday night.

MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Under the new measures, people are not supposed to be able to enter or leave Lombardy, where Milan is the main city. The same restrictions apply to 14 provinces: Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano Cusio Ossola, Vercelli, Padua, Treviso and Venice. The UK Foreign Office advisesagainst all but essential travel to these areas. Some transport in and out of the regions affected continued on Sunday. Flights still arrived at Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, though some scheduled flights were cancelled. However, Italy's national carrier Alitalia said it would suspend all operations from Malpensa from Monday and Linate would only serve domestic routes. International flights would continue to and from Rome. The World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Italy for making ""genuine sacrifices"" with the restrictions. Until Sunday only about 50,000 people in northern Italy had been affected by quarantines. Last week the government announced the closure of all schools and universities across the country for 10 days. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The number of infections worldwide is more than 107,000, with about 3,600 deaths. Most of the fatalities have been in China. But the country on Monday reported no new locally transmitted infection outside of Hubei province, where the outbreak began, for the second consecutive day. Although this indicates that the spread there is slowing, senior officials warned against reducing vigilance. In South Korea officials reported the lowest number of new cases in two weeks. Iran, one of the worst hotspots outside China, has now confirmed 6,566 infections and 194 deaths. However, the real figure is feared to be much higher. One report on Sunday, quoting a government envoy, said there had been 200 deaths in the northern Gilan province alone - but the figures were later removed. In France, the virus is spreading among MPs. Two more members of the National Assembly have tested positive, officials said late on Sunday. In total four deputies have been infected. Also on Sunday France reported 1,126 cases, a 19% increase in a day and the second largest number of infections in Europe after Italy. The French government has banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people.

"The UK will remain in the ""containment"" stage of its response to the coronavirus following an emergency Cobra meeting. It comes as the country's chief medical adviser confirmed a fourth person had died from the virus in the UK. There were319 confirmed cases in the UK as of 09:00 GMT,externalon Monday, a rise of 46 since the same time on Sunday. However, measures to delay the virus' spread with ""social distancing"" will not be introduced yet, ministers said. Number 10 said it accepted that the virus ""is going to spread in a significant way"", however. The latest person to die from the virus was in their 70s and had underlying health conditions, according to the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty. He said the patient, who was being treated at a hospital in Wolverhampton, appeared to have contracted the virus in the UK and that officials were tracing people they had been in contact with. Following the Cobra meeting, Downing Street said the prime minister ""will be guided by the best scientific advice"" but there was no need to cancel sporting events at this stage. Ministers have also been meeting with sports bodies to discuss their response to the outbreak, which could include staging matches behind closed doors. It comes asIreland's Six Nations rugby match in France on Saturday has been postponed,following an earlier decision to postpone England's match in Italy. However, Wales's game against Scotland in Cardiff is to go ahead as scheduled. Another two cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus were confirmed in Walesandanother five in Scotlandon Monday. LIVE:Follow the latest updates EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the government has enlisted an extra 700 people to support a growing number of enquiries to NHS 111, which he added is now dealing with more online enquiries than telephone calls. Mr Hancock added that a bill to help tackle the outbreak would be ""temporary and proportionate"". The UK's top share index,the FTSE 100, is facing its worst day since the financial crisisafter it fell by more than 8%, wiping billions off the value of major firms. The Bank of England has said it will take all necessary steps to protect financial and monetary stability, according to a spokesman for the prime minister. The UK is currently in the first phase - ""containment"" - ofthe government's four-part plan,externalto tackle the spread of coronavirus. The government has previously said ""social distancing"" measures to slow the spread of the virus could include a ban on sporting events and other large gatherings, and encouraging people to work from home rather than use crowded trains and buses. Such a step would require agreement from Prof Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Universal credit claimants who have to self-isolate will not be sanctioned, a work and pensions minister has confirmed. There is no reason to cancel large events at the moment, ministers say A European Union expert said the UK had only a ""few days"" to implement measures to prevent an outbreak like Italy's, which isthe worst outside China with 7,375 confirmed cases and 366 deaths. Environment Secretary George Eustice will also discuss contingency plans with supermarket chief executives, including proposals on how to support vulnerable groups who may have to self-isolate. As supermarkets restrict sales of some products to halt panic-buying, a survey suggested one in 10 shoppers are stockpiling. Boththe government and retailers say stockpiling is unnecessary, and Mr Hancock said food supplies would continue even in the ""reasonable worst-case"" scenario. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell accused the government of offering only ""vague statements"" in response to the outbreak, saying it needed to guarantee sick pay for all workers and address issues such as a shortage of 100,000 NHS staff. TheForeign Office has warned Britons to avoid large parts of northern Italyunder a coronavirus quarantine, unless their journey is essential. Those travelling from locked-down areas have also been advised to self-isolate if they returned to the UK in the last 14 days - even if they have shown no symptoms. Travellers from the rest of Italy are only told to self-isolate and call 111 if they have a cough, fever or shortness of breath. British nationals are still able to depart Italy without restriction, but some airlines - including easyJet and British Airways - have cancelled several flights to and from affected areas. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, told BBC Radio 5 Live ""enhanced measures"" were in place to screen passengers from Italy - but the only one he identified was training airline staff to spot the symptoms of Covid-19.

Public Health England said passengers on flights from northern Italy are also issued with information about symptoms and necessary actions to take, which will be extended to all flights from Italy by Wednesday. However, the Unite union, which represents many cabin crew, said ""there has been no training"" for its members working on flights from northern Italy. The Foreign Office said it was ""working intensively"" to arrange a flight home for 142 Britons on board the Grand Princess cruise ship,which is due to dock in California on Monday after spending five daysstranded off the coast because of 21 cases among crew and passengers. Neil Hanlon, from Bridgwater in Somerset, told BBC Breakfast thatfood on board has become ""very limited""and he was ""gutted"" that it may take until later in the week until he and his wife Victoria can fly home.

"Garlic: It may be good for general health, but it won't stop the coronavirus Coronavirus is emerging in more countries around the world and there's currently no known cure. Unfortunately that hasn't stopped a slew of health advice, ranging from useless but relatively harmless, to downright dangerous. We've been looking at some of the most widespread claims being shared online, and what the science really says. Lots of posts that recommend eating garlic to prevent infection are being shared on Facebook. The WHO (World Health Organization) says that while it is ""a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties"", there's no evidence that eating garlic can protect people from the new coronavirus. In lots of cases, these kinds of remedies aren't harmful in themselves, as long as they aren't preventing you from following evidence-based medical advice. But they have the potential to be. The South China Morning Post reported a story of a woman who had to receive hospital treatment for a severely inflamed throat after consuming 1.5kg of raw garlic. We know, in general, that eating fruit and vegetables and drinking water can be good for staying healthy. However, there is no evidence specific foods will help fight this particular virus. YouTuber Jordan Sather, who has many thousands of followers across different platforms, has been claiming that a ""miracle mineral supplement"", called MMS, can ""wipe out"" coronavirus. It contains chlorine dioxide - a bleaching agent. Sather and others promoted the substance even before the coronavirus outbreak, and in January he tweeted that, ""not only is chlorine dioxide (aka MMS) an effective cancer cell killer, it can wipe out coronavirus too"".

Last year, theUS Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned about the dangers to health of drinking MMS.,externalHealth authorities in other countries have also issued alerts about it. The FDA says it ""is not aware of any research showing that these products are safe or effective for treating any illness"". It warns that drinking them can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and symptoms of severe dehydration. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Some shops are reportedly selling out of hand sanitiser gels There have been many reports of shortages of hand sanitiser gel, aswashing your hands is one key way to prevent spread of the virus. As reports of the shortages emerged in Italy, so did recipes for home-made gel on social media. But these recipes, alleged dupes for one of the country's most popular brands, were for a disinfectant better suited for cleaning surfaces and, as scientists pointed out, not suitable for use on skin. Alcohol-based hand gels usually also contain emollients, which make them gentler on skin, on top of their 60-70% alcohol content. Professor Sally Bloomfield, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says she does not believe you could make an effective product for sanitising hands at home -even vodka only contains 40% alcohol. For cleaning surfaces, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says most common household disinfectants should be effective. The use of colloidal silver was promoted on US televangelist Jim Bakker's show. Colloidal silver is tiny particles of the metal suspended in liquid. A guest on the show claimed the solution kills some strains of coronavirus within 12 hours (while admitting it hadn't yet been tested on Covid-19). The idea that it could be an effective treatment for coronavirus has been widely shared on Facebook, particularly by ""medical freedom"" groups which are deeply suspicious of mainstream medical advice. Proponents of colloidal silver claim it can treat all kinds of health conditions, act as an antiseptic, and state it helps the immune system. There are some occasional uses of silver in healthcare, for example in bandages applied to wounds, but that doesn't mean it's effective to consume. There's clear advice from the US health authorities that there's no evidence this type of silver solution is effective for any health condition. More importantly,it could cause serious side effects,externalincluding kidney damage, seizures and argyria - a condition that makes your skin turn blue. They say that, unlike iron or zinc, silver is not a metal that has any function in the human body. Some of those promoting the substance for general health on social media have found their posts now generate a pop-up warning from Facebook's fact-checking service. One post, copied and pasted by multiple Facebook accounts, quotes a ""Japanese doctor"" who recommends drinking water every 15 minutes to flush out any virus that might have entered the mouth. A version in Arabic has been shared more than 250,000 times. Professor Trudie Lang at the University of Oxford says there is ""no biological mechanism"" that would support the idea that you can just wash a respiratory virus down into your stomach and kill it. Infections like coronaviruses enter the body via the respiratory tract when you breathe in. Some of them might go into your mouth, but even constantly drinking water isn't going to prevent you from catching the virus. Nonetheless, drinking water and staying hydrated is generally good medical advice. There are lots of variations of the advice suggesting heat kills the virus, from recommending drinking hot water to taking hot baths, or using hairdryers. One post, copied and pasted by dozens of social media users in different countries - and falsely attributed to Unicef - claims that drinking hot water and exposure to the sun will kill the virus, and says ice cream is to be avoided.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Charlotte Gornitzka, who works for Unicef on coronavirus misinformation, says: ""A recent erroneous online message...purporting to be a Unicef communication appears to indicate that avoiding ice cream and other cold foods can help prevent the onset of the disease. This is, of course, wholly untrue."" We know the flu virus doesn't survive well outside the body during the summer, but we don't yet know how heat impacts the new coronavirus. Trying to heat your body or expose yourself to the sun - presumably to make it inhospitable to the virus - is completely ineffective, according to Prof Bloomfield. Once the virus is in your body, there's no way of killing it - your body just has to fight it off. Outside the body, ""to actively kill the virus you need temperatures of around 60 degrees [Celsius]"", says Professor Bloomfield - far hotter than any bath. Washing bed linen or towels at 60C is a good idea, as this can kill any viruses in the fabric. But it's not a good option for washing your skin. And having a hot bath or drinking hot liquids won't change your actual body temperature, which remains stable unless you are already ill.

"Tesco has introduced signs at point-of-sale in supermarkets, informing shoppers of restrictions Tesco, the UK's largest grocer, has begun restricting sales of essential food and household items as a result of coronavirus stockpiling. Shoppers are limited to buying no more than five of certain goods, including antibacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables The rules apply in stores and online. A government spokesperson said it was in touch with UK supermarkets to ""discuss their response"" to the virus. Waitrose has introduced a temporary cap on some items on its website, including some anti-bacterial soaps and wipes. The supermarket said it was in talks with its suppliers to ensure customer demand was met. It said some individual stores may have introduced their own restrictions, with ""some branch managers making a judgement at a localised level"". Empty pasta shelves at the Tesco store in Royston, Hertfordshire The High Street chemist Boots has restricted sales of hand sanitisers to two per person. Asda is also restricting some types of hand sanitiser to two bottles per person - the supermarket's only restriction in place currently. Meanwhile, Sainsbury's said it was not limiting sales of any products in stores or online yet. On Monday, Environment Secretary George Eustice is expected to hold talks with supermarket and trade bosses about ""support for vulnerable groups who may be in isolation"", the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said. According to a survey from Retail Economics, as many as one in 10 UK consumers is stockpiling, based on a sample of 2,000 shoppers. But Dr Andrew Potter, chair in logistics and transport at Cardiff Business School, told the BBC:  ""Whilst there might be empty shelves at the moment in the shops, over the next week or so, we will see them replenish. The Tesco restrictions on five items for things like hand gel also apply to online purchases ""The supply chain will start to deliver stuff through to the stores and hopefully this shortage - which is fairly short-term - will clear and everything will be back to normal again."" He said while retailers may have been caught out by the beginning of this shopping surge, they had very sophisticated systems to check changes in demand. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, echoed that ""supply chains remain robust and even where there are challenges, retailers are well-versed in providing measures"" to keep shops running smoothly. Waitrose said it has not put a cap on any of its products in stores. But it has introduced a temporary cap on certain products on its website, including some anti-bacterial soaps and wipes, ""to ensure our customers have access to the products they need"". UK retailers have been warned that they face prosecution if they exploit the coronavirus scare to hike prices for products such as hand sanitisers and face masks.

Facebook had earlier announced a ban on ads for medical products which falsely suggested an item was in short supply, as well as those which falsely claimed to provide cures or prevention methods for coronavirus.

"This video can not be played The economic impact of the virus could be ""significant"" but temporary, says the chancellor The NHS will get ""whatever resources it needs"" to cope with a coronavirus epidemic, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said ahead of Wednesday's Budget. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show ""strong"" economic foundations meant he could provide additional funding. The chancellor also said he was looking at extra financial help for individuals and businesses if measures against the virus meant they were out of pocket. On Sunday UK cases rose to 273, up from 209 on Saturday - the biggest rise yet. It comes asTesco said it had begun rationing essential food and household itemsas a result of coronavirus stockpiling. In other developments, theUK Foreign Office is advising against ""all but essential travel"" to large parts of northern Italyafter they were put in lockdown. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Sunak has pledged to address the outbreak in his first Budget and said the impact of the virus on business ""could be significant, but for a temporary period of time"". He said: ""I can say absolutely, categorically, the NHS will get whatever resources it needs to get us through this crisis."" As of Sunday morning, two people have died in the UK - an83-year-old mananda woman in her 70swho both had underlying health problems - and 23,513 people have been tested across the UK. The government's medical advisers say the UK is still in the ""containment"" phase, but they expect to move to a ""delay"" phase soon, in which the focus is on trying to slow down the spread. This phase could see the introduction of ""social distancing"" measures such as closing schools and urging people to work from home. Mr Sunak said he was looking at temporary measures to support people who may be unable to go to work or businesses which may suffer as a result of the measures. This could include ensuring benefits under universal credit and Employment and Support Allowance are available ""quickly and effectively"", waiving requirements for sick notes or in-person benefits interviews, and providing help for businesses with cashflow problems, he said. ""I'm keen to make sure when we get through the other side, we haven't lost these great small businesses permanently,"" he said. The man was tested in a specialist coronavirus pod A man who became infected with coronavirus after returning from a skiing trip in northern Italy last weekend has told Radio 4's Broadcasting House of the ""very strange chills"" he experienced after developing symptoms. He flew home from Innsbruck over the border in Austria to Manchester Airport. He first experienced a dry cough after he and his wife self-quarantined in their home as a precaution, before ""suddenly"" developing a fever, a headache and a warm chest. ""And there were very strange chills that seemed to spread all around the surface of your body, very quickly, and then reverberate around - it's a very strange feeling,"" he said. He was later confirmed to have the virus after being tested at a specialist coronavirus pod. His wife, however, tested negative - to both of their surprise. The man said he was now ""really well recovered"" but would have to remain in self-quarantine until he was told by health professionals he could leave. Listen to the full interviewhere. With an epidemic potentially putting extraordinary pressures on the public and private sector, Mr Sunak was repeatedly asked whether he would stick to the government's fiscal rules. He did not answer directly, but said he believed ""very much in the importance of fiscal responsibility, about responsible management of our public finances"" and added that ""difficult decisions"" by past chancellors meant he could respond to this crisis.

He declined to say whether government debt would be lower by the end of this parliament, if the government would borrow to fund day-to-day spending or whether he could guarantee to balance the budget within three years. Mr Sunak's pledge to the NHS comes asthe government outlined emergency legislation, which could be introduced to the Commons this month, to protect people's jobs if they volunteer to care for coronavirus patients. The government says about three millon people currently volunteer in ""a health, community health and social care setting"". Under the proposed plan, the jobs of ""skilled, experienced or qualified volunteers"" would be protected for up to four weeks while they care for people with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Ministers have also proposed the emergency registration of retired health professionals, and the new bill will aim to ensure their pensions are not negatively impacted by returning to work in the NHS. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK's response to a widespread outbreak required a ""massive national effort"" and these were ""proportionate"" measures. ""I want to ensure government is doing everything in its power to be ready to delay and mitigate this threat,"" he said. An extra 500 staff have been hired for the NHS 111 service to cope with coronavirus calls Tom Dolphin, a doctor who is a member of the British Medical Association's governing council, told the BBC the measures could help to free up capacity in hospitals by allowing people to be discharged into social care. But he said the health service was under-resourced and could still find itself having to make ""difficult choices"", postponing planned operations to cope with emergencies and epidemic cases. Five hundred extra staff have also been recruited to work on the NHS 111 phone service, after calls increased by a third over the last week, compared with the same period a year ago. Globally, the number of coronavirus cases has now passed 100,000, with 3,400 deaths.

"Despite fears over the coronavirus outbreak, thousands of people took to the streets across Asia, including this march in Yogyakarta, Indonesia Marches to raise awareness of discrimination against women are taking place in cities around the world to mark International Women's Day. The protests have been widespread and well-attended despite concerns about the coronavirus. People around the world have been marking 8 March as a special day for women for more than a century. WATCH: Global marches mark International Women's Day It grew out of the labour movement to become a UN-recognised annual event. Several protests took place across Spain. This one (above) in the capital, Madrid, was organised by a feminist group demanding equal working rights, women's right to abortion and an end to violence against women. In the UK, many feminist groups held online campaigns instead of street marches, but this ""March4Women"" demonstration in London drew large crowds, including the English actress Natalie Dormer (seen here in the orange scarf). At a march in the Indonesian capital Jakarta, women from numerous organisations and trade unions demanded the government revoke what they see as gender discriminative laws - such as the ""omnibus law"" - and create new laws to protect women. In Germany, hundreds of women road bicycles through the streets of Berlin as part of a feminist demonstration labelled ""Purple Ride"". Women at Turkey's border with Greece held a demonstration demanding they be permitted to cross during International Women's Day. There have been fierce clashes between migrants and Greek border security as the former seek access to the EU Bangladeshi women played basketball on the outskirts of the capital, Dhaka, in a match organised for International Women's Day. Across Pakistan, marches took place in several cities in the face of violent threats and legal petitions. Here, people hold placards calling for an end to violence against women as they demonstrate in Islamabad. Pakistan on knife edge over women's march In the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek police detained dozens of women's rights activists shortly after masked men reportedly attacked marchers. Activists say women's rights are deteriorating in the country. In Belarus women took part in a ""beauty run"" to mark the day. Here, women warm up ahead of the run.

"This video can not be played Six Nations 2020: Scotland 28-17 France - highlights Guinness Six Nations: Scotland v France Scotland:(14) 28 Tries:Maitland (2), McInallyPens:Hastings (3)Cons:Hastings (2) France:(7) 17 Tries:Penaud, OllivonPens:JalibertCons:Jalibert (2) France's hopes of a Six Nations Grand Slam are over after revitalised Scotland inflicted their fourth consecutive Murrayfield defeat. Fabien Galthie's side had won their first three games of the Six Nations but a first-half red card for Mohamed Haouas let Scotland seize control. Sean Maitland crossed either side of the break after Damian Penaud's score, before Stuart McInally added a third. Charles Ollivon's late try could not deny Gregor Townsend consecutive wins. Adam Hastings, who impressed in place of the exiled Finn Russell, added 13 points with the boot. France are now second in the championship and even a bonus-point win over Ireland in Paris next weekend might not seal the title with England still to face Italy. Pressure on me 'irrelevant' - Townsend Ibanez plans 'long talk' with Haouas Reaction & as it happened Chasing the fourth leg of a Grand Slam, France were met with Scottish belligerence from the get-go, their day beginning badly and getting steadily worse from that point. Here they met a home team who had no truck with all the chat of the glorious revival of Les Bleus. They said privately they believed they would win and they set about their mission with zeal. There were towering performances from the Scotland back row, with Jamie Ritchie and Hamish Watson bringing their relentless personalities to bear. Lock Grant Gilchrist was outstanding. The front row to a man were ferocious, with prop Zander Fagerson doing his bit in a winning scrum and putting in a monstrous shift around the park. Hastings was terrific and this was a big day for Stuart Hogg, perhaps his biggest in a Scotland jersey. As captain, he would have felt the joy of this big time. There were big performers all over the field. Red card or no red card, this was richly deserved. France had Francois Cros binned early for dumping Gilchrist on his head in the tackle, with Paul Willemse perhaps getting off lightly for he was on the scene as well. And while Cros was away for his 10 minutes - and there was a case for it being a red card - Scotland hit the front. The visitors' scrum has been one of their few areas of weakness on their road to Murrayfield this season and now it hurt them again. The Scots have been reborn in that department. When France collapsed, Hastings banged over the first points. Romain Ntamack had gone by then, the brilliant fly-half injured inside 10 minutes. It was another blow following the withdrawal in the warm-up of their replacement hooker Camille Chat. Things were not going their way. Cros returned but Hastings made it 6-0 just after. A quarter had been played and France had produced nothing. When they threatened to get up a head of steam, they were halted by the aggression coming at them, their threat snuffed out early through Scotland's intensity and their own handling errors under the pressure of the blitz. Murrayfield revelled in it - and then Murrayfield winced. Having looked passive, France suddenly switched and regained their magic, if only for a brief period. A thrust up the left from Matthieu Jalibert and Gael Fickou had Scotland in trouble. When they moved it right, Antoine Dupont, the wee wizard that he is, put in the most sumptuous cross-field kick for Penaud to score. Jalibert then rifled over the conversion to put France ahead. This video can not be played Mohamed Haouas sent off for throwing a punch The drama was only starting. Four minutes before the break Haouas, a player with the shortest fuse, lost the plot amid a melee on the France line. Practically every player was in there, pushing and shoving, but Haouas threw a punch at Ritchie, connected, and got what he deserved - a red card. Hastings added to the visitors' misery by putting over the resultant penalty to inch Scotland back in front. Before the half was done, Scotland sickened France further, striking out through their forward muscle before the stand-off entered proceedings with some brilliance that France couldn't cope with. He dummied and slalomed his way into space and found Ali Price in support. France were spread-eagled. Pace and accuracy did for them. Centre Sam Johnson kept his cool in the decisive moment and gave it on a plate to Maitland, who sprinted over in the corner. Within four minutes of Haouas walking, Scotland had hit them with eight points. At last, they had found a ruthless streak. The early minutes of the second half shone a light on how Scotland managed to put it all together on the day. Under ferocious pressure near their own line, they stood up. Big and bold, they would not let the French through, Watson coming up with a massive turnover. This video can not be played When mum and dad embarrass you on your big day - Adam Hastings' parents share a kiss Then they attacked, and France got well and truly Hogg-roasted. The captain took off from his own 10m line, arcing downfield before playing in Chris Harris, who galloped clear. The centre had Price on his shoulder and when the scrum-half was hauled down in the France 22, the recycle was quick and the execution precise, Ritchie and Johnson sending Maitland in for his second score. Hastings' conversion from the touchline was pin-sharp. The 15 men led the 14 men 21-7. The Slam had been slammed. France rallied but the only joy they got from their pressure was three points from Jalibert, a penalty that was put over after they seemed to realise trying to bust the home defence for a try wasn't working out. The third Scotland try came 15 minutes before the end. It was a fluke, but Murrayfield didn't care a whole lot about that. Scotland had a line-out in the France 22 and McInally - on for 50-cap man Fraser Brown - had his throw pinched, but when the ball was diverted back on the France side, no visitor was able to collect it and the replacement hooker scooped up the gift and ran away to score. Hastings knocked over the conversion. The Scots led by 28-10, a gap that narrowed to 11 when Ollivon battered his way over four minutes from time. Jalibert added the conversion, but he couldn't save the Slam. A thunderous Scotland, with help from the fiery Haouas, had ripped it from their grasp.

"Anthony Martial is the first United player to score in both derbies in a Premier League season since Cristiano Ronaldo in 2006-07 Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said it is a ""privilege"" to manage his players as they completed the Premier League double over derby rivals Manchester City for the first time in a decade. This thunderous encounter was a personal nightmare for Manchester City's normally reliable Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson, who gifted Solskjaer's side both goals in sharply contrasting fashion. He allowed Anthony Martial's routine shot to squirm under his body from a quick Bruno Fernandes free-kick on the half-hour and then, with seconds left, threw a clearance straight to Scott McTominay, who showed great technique to send a long-range finish, struck first time, into the net in front of a delirious Stretford End. This video can not be played Solskjaer and Fernandes have 'turned Man Utd around' It is a win that leaves Liverpool - who now have a 25-point lead at the top of the table - requiring only two more wins to secure their first league title for 30 years and Manchester United only three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, after their first derby league double since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. City hotly contested the free-kick, given by referee Mike Dean for a foul by Ilkay Gundogan on Fernandes, that led to Martial's goal - although United also felt they were denied a penalty when Fred was booked for diving after tangling with Nicolas Otamendi. Sergio Aguero had a goal ruled out for offside by VAR and even though City enjoyed the greater share of possession, United sealed a crucial win with McTominay's strike to take their unbeaten run to 10 games in all competitions. ""It's a privilege to be their manager,"" Solskjaer told BBC Sport. ""They give absolutely everything. They know they are all good players but they want to learn as well. ""We feel we are improving as a squad and a team. We feel the fans want us to do well and they see what we are doing, so it is getting better and better. ""But we are still fifth. We need points to catch Chelsea and Leicester, so need to keep plugging away."" This video can not be played Man Utd 2-0 Man City: 'It's a privilege to be manager of this young squad' - Solskjaer The jubilant scenes and the sound of his name echoing around Old Trafford at the final whistle will have been music to the ears of Manchester United manager Solskjaer. The Norwegian, still to convince many of his suitability for the giant task of turning Manchester United's fortunes around, has now enjoyed three wins over Pep Guardiola and Manchester City this season - and this was surely the most satisfying day of the season at 'The Theatre Of Dreams'. United may still be light years away from the glory days of old but victories such as this sustain hope, and the atmosphere inside Old Trafford as Solskjaer's side first held on to their advantage and then sealed the win was reminiscent of days gone by. Manchester City may have enjoyed the greater share of possession but United showed great resilience and always carried a threat on the break. Fernandes once again confirmed what a shrewd piece of business his signing was from Sporting Lisbon - although why wait so late in the window to sign him? - and why he is already a hero to United's fans. The Portuguese has that touch of class and creativity while United had another outstanding performer in defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who won his battle with Raheem Sterling as he hounded the England star for 90 minutes and beyond. Manchester United, who have looked off the top four for so much of the time this season, are now right in the fight and credit must be given to the manager who has helped fashion this impressive run. ""We feel we are improving all the time. We know we lack one, two, three players to be considered a title contender and some experience,"" said Solskjaer. ""We are just going to start talking about going up the table, getting more points. ""Chelsea and Leicester are too far ahead for my liking."" This video can not be played Man Utd 2-0 Man City: Pep Guardiola says his side put in a good performance against rivals Manchester City's defeat is hardly damaging in the context of their Premier League title defence - that was lost to Liverpool a long time ago. Guardiola's concern, and admittedly he was without his star player Kevin de Bruyne, will be that once again his side had plenty of possession but did not create enough, not showing enough urgency until it was too late. And he will be concerned by the performance of goalkeeper Ederson, who was over-confident throughout and paid a heavy price. Ederson was not only badly at fault for both goals but almost gave away another when he allowed a routine pass to roll under his foot at the Stretford End, resulting in a desperate tackle on Martial almost on the goalline to spare his embarrassment. Guardiola will be additionally unhappy about this defeat, not least because it was City's seventh of the Premier League campaign, making 2019-20 the season in which he has lost the most league games in his managerial career. City now face home games against Arsenal and Burnley to get themselves in shape for the Champions League last-16 second leg meeting with Real Madrid, in which they hold a precious 2-1 advantage from the first leg in the Bernabeu. Guardiola will hope Ederson has got this carelessness and over-confidence out of his system. Aaron Wan-Bissaka won his battle with Raheem Sterling. He had more touches than any other United player and his eight tackles were twice as many as anyone else on the pitch Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola to BBC Match of the Day:""We played good, we missed a little in the final third but the second half was better and it was a good performance. ""We play the same way, tried the press and defend well and we did well. ""Our game is there, we played really good in terms of coming here. They wait and did long balls on the counter-attack for Daniel James and Anthony Martial. ""We did our game but unfortunately we conceded a goal. They waited for our mistakes."" United are unbeaten in their last 10 games (W7 D3); their longest run without defeat since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first 11 games in charge. This is the second time in Pep Guardiola's managerial career that he has suffered three defeats against a specific opponent in a single season (also versus Liverpool in 2017-18). Anthony Martial is only the second United player to score in three consecutive Premier League starts in Manchester derbies, and the first since Eric Cantona netted in five in a row between March 1993 and April 1996. Since making his debut in the competition on 1 February, United's Bruno Fernandes has been directly involved in more goals in the Premier League than any other player (five - two goals and three assists). Manchester City's Raheem Sterling became the fourth youngest player to reach 250 appearances in the Premier League, after Wayne Rooney, James Milner and Gareth Barry. City host Arsenal on Wednesday at 19:30 GMT in a rearranged Premier League fixture, with United going to LASK in Austria in the Europa League the following day (17:55 GMT).

"This video can not be played Milan quarantine resident: ""It's really important to be responsible in this moment"" Italy has placed up to 16 million people under quarantine as it battles to contain the spread of coronavirus. Anyone living in Lombardy and 14 other central and northern provinces will need special permission to travel. Milan and Venice are both affected. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also announced the closure of schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues across the whole country. The measures, the most radical taken outside China, will last until 3 April. Italy has seen the largest number of coronavirus infections in Europe, with the number of confirmed cases jumping by more than 1,200 to 5,883 on Saturday. Among the latest people to test positive is the army's chief of staff. Salvatore Farina said he felt well and was self-isolating. The strict new quarantine measures affect a quarter of the Italian population and centre on the rich northern part of the country that powers its economy. The death toll in Italy has passed 230, with officials reporting more than 36 deaths in 24 hours. Live coverage: Follow the latest updates The health system is under immense strain in Lombardy, a northern region of 10 million people, where people are being treated in hospital corridors. ""We want to guarantee the health of our citizens. We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices, sometimes small and sometimes very big,"" Prime Minister Conte said as he announced the measures in the middle of the night. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Under the new measures, people are not supposed to be able to enter or leave Lombardy, where Milan is the main city. The same restrictions apply to 14 provinces: Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano Cusio Ossola, Vercelli, Padua, Treviso and Venice. ""There will be no movement in or out of these areas, or within them, unless for proven work-related reasons, emergencies or health reasons,"" Mr Conte told reporters. ""We are facing an emergency, a national emergency. We have to limit the spread of the virus and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed."" People queued to buy food in Milan as quarantine measures were announced Some transport in and out of the regions affected continued on Sunday. Flights continued to arrive at Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, though some scheduled flights were cancelled. However, Italy's national carrier Alitalia said it would suspend all operations from Malpensa from Monday and Linate would only serve domestic routes. International flights would continue to and from Rome. Chris Wood, a 26-year-old from London said he and his girlfriend had cut their holiday in Italy short and were waiting for a flight home from Venice. ""The initial announcement that Venice was in lockdown was quite terrifying but everything at the airport is pretty calm,"" he said. ""I was in a bit of a panic as I thought we were going to be stuck in Venice for a month."" Last week was critical to seeing if Italy's coronavirus response had managed to halt the spread. If the numbers had begun to tail off, it would have suggested the containment measures had worked. They haven't. With cases still surging, the government has moved to the next stage - and it's a dramatic step up. It's not quite a complete lockdown - planes and trains are still running and access will be permitted for emergency or essential work reasons. But police will be able to stop people and ask why they're trying to enter or leave the areas covered. The question is whether this is all too late. It's believed the virus was circulating in Italy for weeks before it was detected. And there have now been cases in all 22 regions of the country. The government is now taking the most extensive containment measures outside of China. But is this a case of trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted? Weddings and funerals have been suspended, as well as religious and cultural events. Cinemas, nightclubs, gyms, swimming pools, museums and ski resorts have been closed. Restaurants and cafes in the quarantined zones can open between 06:00 and 18:00 but customers must sit at least 1m (3ft) apart. People have been told to stay at home as much as possible, and those who break the quarantine could face three months in jail. The World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Italy for making ""genuine sacrifices"" with the restrictions. Until now only about 50,000 people in northern Italy had been affected by quarantines. Last week the government announced the closure of all schools and universities across the country for 10 days.

The number of infections worldwide is more than 105,500, the WHO says, with nearly 3,600 deaths. Most of the fatalities have been in China, where the virus originated in December. But the country on Sunday reported its lowest number of new infections in a single day since January - an indication that the virus's spread there is slowing. There were 40 new cases on Saturday, less than half the number reported on Friday. Twenty-seven new deaths were reported - the lowest figure in more than a month - and all were in Wuhan, where the outbreak began. Iran, one of the worst hotspots outside China, has now confirmed almost 6,000 infections and 145 deaths. However, the real figure is believed to be much higher. One report on Sunday, quoting a government envoy, said there had been 200 deaths in the northern Gilan province alone - but the figures were later removed.

"Staff on HSBC's tenth floor were told to leave the office and work from home after a staff member returned from Asia with coronavirus Many of the City of London's biggest institutions are taking steps to combat the spread of the coronavirus. On Monday many of JPMorgan's UK-based staff are being temporarily moved to a different office. They're not alone. Goldman Sachs last week sent around 200 members of staff to test a site in Croydon, South London for the day to ensure the systems worked effectively. Many of these measures by some of the world's biggest banks follow the events that took place at HSBC last week. HSBC sent home more than 100 staff from the tenth floor of its Canary Wharf offices on Thursday. The move came after one staff member, who was part of the research division, returned from travelling and was diagnosed with the Covid-19 virus. The employee is now under medical supervision and has self-isolated, and the rest of the research division worked from home on that day. This was the first known case at a major company in the UK's financial service hub. The research floor received a ""deep clean"" from a specialist professional services company. HSBC said the building, which houses close to 10,000 workers, would remain open after it took medical advice. The City financial watchdog says it does not mind where bank staff work, so long as regulations are upheld Regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), says it doesn't have an issue with staff working from backup sites or even from home, so long as certain standards are met. The FCA expects firms to be able to enter orders and transactions promptly into the relevant systems, use recorded lines when trading and give staff the compliance support they need. JPMorgan says it began its coronavirus contingency plan last week by splitting up teams to work in different offices around the country. Many members of staff are now either working in a different office than normal or at home. The bank has offices in London, Bournemouth, Glasgow and Edinburgh. However, the nature of the job means that working from home is not an option for many staff at most of the large investment banks such as JP Morgan or its rival Goldman Sachs. That's because most traders and salespeople need to sit together on a trading floor which is monitored in order to meet regulatory rules. Goldman Sachs hasn't activated its coronavirus contingency plan just yet but if the need arises the bank says it is ready to act.

"Garlic: It may be good for general health, but it won't stop the coronavirus Coronavirus is emerging in more countries around the world and there's currently no known cure. Unfortunately that hasn't stopped a slew of health advice, ranging from useless but relatively harmless, to downright dangerous. We've been looking at some of the most widespread claims being shared online, and what the science really says. Lots of posts that recommend eating garlic to prevent infection are being shared on Facebook. The WHO (World Health Organization) says that while it is ""a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties"", there's no evidence that eating garlic can protect people from the new coronavirus. In lots of cases, these kinds of remedies aren't harmful in themselves, as long as they aren't preventing you from following evidence-based medical advice. But they have the potential to be. The South China Morning Post reported a story of a woman who had to receive hospital treatment for a severely inflamed throat after consuming 1.5kg of raw garlic. We know, in general, that eating fruit and vegetables and drinking water can be good for staying healthy. However, there is no evidence specific foods will help fight this particular virus. YouTuber Jordan Sather, who has many thousands of followers across different platforms, has been claiming that a ""miracle mineral supplement"", called MMS, can ""wipe out"" coronavirus. It contains chlorine dioxide - a bleaching agent. Sather and others promoted the substance even before the coronavirus outbreak, and in January he tweeted that, ""not only is chlorine dioxide (aka MMS) an effective cancer cell killer, it can wipe out coronavirus too"".

Last year, theUS Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned about the dangers to health of drinking MMS.,externalHealth authorities in other countries have also issued alerts about it. The FDA says it ""is not aware of any research showing that these products are safe or effective for treating any illness"". It warns that drinking them can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and symptoms of severe dehydration. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Some shops are reportedly selling out of hand sanitiser gels There have been many reports of shortages of hand sanitiser gel, aswashing your hands is one key way to prevent spread of the virus. As reports of the shortages emerged in Italy, so did recipes for home-made gel on social media. But these recipes, alleged dupes for one of the country's most popular brands, were for a disinfectant better suited for cleaning surfaces and, as scientists pointed out, not suitable for use on skin. Alcohol-based hand gels usually also contain emollients, which make them gentler on skin, on top of their 60-70% alcohol content. Professor Sally Bloomfield, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says she does not believe you could make an effective product for sanitising hands at home -even vodka only contains 40% alcohol. For cleaning surfaces, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says most common household disinfectants should be effective. The use of colloidal silver was promoted on US televangelist Jim Bakker's show. Colloidal silver is tiny particles of the metal suspended in liquid. A guest on the show claimed the solution kills some strains of coronavirus within 12 hours (while admitting it hadn't yet been tested on Covid-19). The idea that it could be an effective treatment for coronavirus has been widely shared on Facebook, particularly by ""medical freedom"" groups which are deeply suspicious of mainstream medical advice. Proponents of colloidal silver claim it can treat all kinds of health conditions, act as an antiseptic, and state it helps the immune system. There are some occasional uses of silver in healthcare, for example in bandages applied to wounds, but that doesn't mean it's effective to consume. There's clear advice from the US health authorities that there's no evidence this type of silver solution is effective for any health condition. More importantly,it could cause serious side effects,externalincluding kidney damage, seizures and argyria - a condition that makes your skin turn blue. They say that, unlike iron or zinc, silver is not a metal that has any function in the human body. Some of those promoting the substance for general health on social media have found their posts now generate a pop-up warning from Facebook's fact-checking service. One post, copied and pasted by multiple Facebook accounts, quotes a ""Japanese doctor"" who recommends drinking water every 15 minutes to flush out any virus that might have entered the mouth. A version in Arabic has been shared more than 250,000 times. Professor Trudie Lang at the University of Oxford says there is ""no biological mechanism"" that would support the idea that you can just wash a respiratory virus down into your stomach and kill it. Infections like coronaviruses enter the body via the respiratory tract when you breathe in. Some of them might go into your mouth, but even constantly drinking water isn't going to prevent you from catching the virus. Nonetheless, drinking water and staying hydrated is generally good medical advice. There are lots of variations of the advice suggesting heat kills the virus, from recommending drinking hot water to taking hot baths, or using hairdryers. One post, copied and pasted by dozens of social media users in different countries - and falsely attributed to Unicef - claims that drinking hot water and exposure to the sun will kill the virus, and says ice cream is to be avoided.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Charlotte Gornitzka, who works for Unicef on coronavirus misinformation, says: ""A recent erroneous online message...purporting to be a Unicef communication appears to indicate that avoiding ice cream and other cold foods can help prevent the onset of the disease. This is, of course, wholly untrue."" We know the flu virus doesn't survive well outside the body during the summer, but we don't yet know how heat impacts the new coronavirus. Trying to heat your body or expose yourself to the sun - presumably to make it inhospitable to the virus - is completely ineffective, according to Prof Bloomfield. Once the virus is in your body, there's no way of killing it - your body just has to fight it off. Outside the body, ""to actively kill the virus you need temperatures of around 60 degrees [Celsius]"", says Professor Bloomfield - far hotter than any bath. Washing bed linen or towels at 60C is a good idea, as this can kill any viruses in the fabric. But it's not a good option for washing your skin. And having a hot bath or drinking hot liquids won't change your actual body temperature, which remains stable unless you are already ill.

"Tesco has introduced signs at point-of-sale in supermarkets, informing shoppers of restrictions Tesco, the UK's largest grocer, has begun restricting sales of essential food and household items as a result of coronavirus stockpiling. Shoppers are limited to buying no more than five of certain goods, including antibacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables The rules apply in stores and online. A government spokesperson said it was in touch with UK supermarkets to ""discuss their response"" to the virus. Waitrose has introduced a temporary cap on some items on its website, including some anti-bacterial soaps and wipes. The supermarket said it was in talks with its suppliers to ensure customer demand was met. It said some individual stores may have introduced their own restrictions, with ""some branch managers making a judgement at a localised level"". Empty pasta shelves at the Tesco store in Royston, Hertfordshire The High Street chemist Boots has restricted sales of hand sanitisers to two per person. Asda is also restricting some types of hand sanitiser to two bottles per person - the supermarket's only restriction in place currently. Meanwhile, Sainsbury's said it was not limiting sales of any products in stores or online yet. On Monday, Environment Secretary George Eustice is expected to hold talks with supermarket and trade bosses about ""support for vulnerable groups who may be in isolation"", the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said. According to a survey from Retail Economics, as many as one in 10 UK consumers is stockpiling, based on a sample of 2,000 shoppers. But Dr Andrew Potter, chair in logistics and transport at Cardiff Business School, told the BBC:  ""Whilst there might be empty shelves at the moment in the shops, over the next week or so, we will see them replenish. The Tesco restrictions on five items for things like hand gel also apply to online purchases ""The supply chain will start to deliver stuff through to the stores and hopefully this shortage - which is fairly short-term - will clear and everything will be back to normal again."" He said while retailers may have been caught out by the beginning of this shopping surge, they had very sophisticated systems to check changes in demand. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, echoed that ""supply chains remain robust and even where there are challenges, retailers are well-versed in providing measures"" to keep shops running smoothly. Waitrose said it has not put a cap on any of its products in stores. But it has introduced a temporary cap on certain products on its website, including some anti-bacterial soaps and wipes, ""to ensure our customers have access to the products they need"".

"One day, just after I had dropped my son off at school, I was sent a horrific video on WhatsApp. It made me question how images and videos of child sex abuse come to be made, and how they can be openly circulated on social media. And I wanted one answer above all - what happened to the boy in the video? It may sound strange, but the woman who sent me the video was a fellow mum at the school gates. A group of us had set up a WhatsApp group to discuss term dates, uniforms, illnesses. Then one morning, out of the blue, one of these mums sent a video to the group, with two crying-face emojis underneath it. It was just a black box, no thumbnail, and we all pressed play without thinking. Maybe it would be a meme or a news story. Maybe one of the ""stranger danger"" videos some of the mums had started to share. The video starts with a shot of a man and a baby, about 18 months old, sitting on a sofa. The baby smiles at the man. I can't describe the rest. If I tell you what I saw in the 10 seconds it took to grasp what was happening, and press stop, you'll have the image in your head too. And you don't want it. It's a video of child sex abuse. It's nine minutes long. I screamed, and threw my phone across the room. It was pinging with messages from distraught members of the group. I took my phone to the police station. I told them what had happened. I told them I believed the woman had sent it to us as a warning, and that I hoped they would investigate where the video came from. Was it new, or one they'd already come across? Was this little boy still in danger? Could this evidence help save him, or catch the abuser? The police had my phone for two weeks. I found out the next day that they arrested the woman who sent it and visited other members of the group. And then I didn't hear anything else about it. But one question stayed with me. What happened to the boy in the video? And so, a few months later, once I could read my own kids a bedtime story without thinking of him and life had got back to normal, I began to look for answers. I started by trying to speak to the police officer investigating the video on my phone. But every time I called Wembley CID to speak to him, he'd just gone out. He didn't want anything to do with me. I checked with Alan Collins, a lawyer who specialises in child sex abuse, to see if any of the things I might normally do to track down people would work. Could I, for example, send former police officers a copy of the video to see if they recognised it? ""You could be looking at a prison sentence of 10 years,"" he told me. Same goes for taking a still and sending that. Just possessing an image like this on my phone could land me in jail. So I called a friend of a friend who used to work for the police. He told me Wembley CID would have sent my phone off to one of the digital forensics labs spread across the city. The labs list all the illegal content, and when it's child sex abuse they grade it: Category A for the most serious, Cat B, Cat C. This WhatsApp video was Cat A. Next, the file goes to victim identification and my case was passed to the Metropolitan Police's Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Command. An officer there, Det Sgt Lindsay Dick, agreed to talk to me, but he didn't want to say much about the techniques used in case it helped offenders work out how to evade capture. An estimated 100,000 men in the UK regularly view child sex abuse Police arrest between 400 and 450 people a month, men mostly, for viewing or downloading these files WhatsApp takes down 250,000 accounts every month suspected of spreading child sex abuse material, based on the names of groups and profile pictures Report child sexual abuse safely and anonymously to theInternet Watch Foundation,external He did tell me about one case, where an officer had got hold of a phone that had images of a boy being abused on it, along with images of the same boy not being abused. In one, he's standing at a bus stop in school uniform. An officer recognised the bus stop as a Mersey Transport sign, and put a call in to the Merseyside team. They recognised the school uniform. The boy was identified, his parents arrested, and social services took over. Victim-identification police all over the world rely on little clues like this. Lindsay Dick wouldn't discuss the details of what I'd been sent, even though he had investigated the case. Then, when I asked him about a suggestion from an editor to take a still from the video of the perpetrator's face, to help identify him, I started to feel some heat. ""Do you still have a copy of that video?"" he asked me, sternly. ""No,"" I replied. But it was still sitting somewhere on WhatsApp's server, and because I was still a member of the group, it was still showing on my phone. Even though I'd done nothing wrong, I realised how seriously the police took this kind of thing. This hit home late last year when a senior Metropolitan Police officer, Supt Novlett Robyn Williams, was given 200 community hours' unpaid work and threatened with losing her job for failing to report a video of child sex abuse her sister had sent her on WhatsApp. (She is now appealing against the conviction.) The Metropolitan Police refused to help me any further in my search for the boy in the video. At one point they even told officers in another part of the country, incorrectly, that I'd been cautioned for sharing the video. I found out later from the woman who sent the video to me that she had been given three years on the sex offenders register. But the investigating officers at Wembley CID took the case no further - they didn't arrest the friend who had sent it to her, and they didn't even try to find out who had sent it to her friend. Further up that chain of people sharing the video must be some dangerous people, perhaps an abuser. But nothing was done to follow the trail. The Metropolitan Police says: ""The scale of child abuse and sexual exploitation offending online has grown in recent years. This increased demand on police, coupled with the need to keep up with advancement of technology and adapt our methods to detect and identify offenders, means it is a challenging area for the Met and police forces nationally. However, we remain committed to bringing those who commit child abuse offences online to justice, and safeguarding victims and young people at risk. ""We encourage anyone concerned about a child at risk of abuse or a possible victim, to contact police immediately. Anyone who receives an unsolicited message which depicts child abuse should report it to police immediately so action can be taken. Images of this nature should not be shared under any circumstances."" I needed someone who wasn't involved with the case to give me some more clues about where this file I'd been sent might have come from. So I started searching, and I came across news articles about a team in Queensland, Australia with a reputation for infiltrating child abuse video-sharing sites. Their head of victim identification, former Greater Manchester Police detective Paul Griffiths, told me the file I'd been sent had probably started life on one of these sites. ""What tends to happen is that when a file gets produced like that, it generally stays under cover, under wraps, circulating amongst a fairly small, tight network. Very often people who would know that they need to keep it safe and not distribute it widely,"" he said. These networks of paedophiles use the dark web, a part of the internet that isn't indexed readily by search engines such as Google. They access sites through a connection called TOR, or the onion router.  They use a fake IP address, connected to several other servers dotted around the globe, which makes their location untraceable. Members of these dark web sites are like sick stamp collectors - they post thumbnails of what they have on dedicated online forums, and look to complete series, usually of a particular child. Some of them are ""producers"" - they abuse the children, or film them being abused. A couple of years ago Paul Griffiths' team was watching one site called Child's Play. They had intelligence that two of the site's leaders were meeting up in the US. Officers intercepted them, arrested them, and got their passwords. Now they could see everything - each and every video - and they could get to work finding children and perpetrators. They made hundreds of arrests worldwide, and 200 children have been saved so far. ""It's Sherlock Holmes stuff, it's following little clues and seeing what you can piece together to try and find a needle in a haystack,"" says Griffiths. The big worry now is live-streaming, where adults can pay to watch children being abused in real time. It's even harder to detect, because no file containing clues circulates, and the platforms are all encrypted. Just as the police and technology get better at finding victims in stills or videos, another threat emerges. ""There's a famous story and it often gets told in relation to this area of crime, in relation to the young girl walking on the beach and there's starfish all over the beach and she's picking the starfish up and putting them back into the sea and a guy says to her, 'Little girl, what are you doing? You're never gonna be able to save all of these starfish.' And she says, 'No, but I'll save that one.' And that's really what we're doing,"" says Griffiths. ""You know, we're saving the ones we can save. And if some magical solution appears somewhere in the future that's going to save all of them, that's going to stop this happening, then that'll be wonderful. But in the meantime, we can't just sit back and ignore what we know is happening."" Listen to Lucy Proctor's Radio 4 documentary, The Boy in the Video, on BBC Sounds Paul Griffiths is part of a small network of people who travel the globe for meetings and conferences on what to do about the huge numbers of videos and images circulating online. He told me to contact Maggie Brennan, a lecturer in clinical forensic psychology at the University of Plymouth, who has been studying child-sex-abuse material for years. Between 2016 and 2018 she combed through the child-abuse images in a database run by Interpol, to build up a profile of victims. She found a chilling pattern that suggested the age of the boy in the video I saw is not that unusual. ""Concerningly, there is a substantive, small, but important proportion of those images that do depict infants and toddlers. And we found a significant result in terms of the association between very extreme forms of sexual violence and very young children."" Like the boy in the video I was sent, most children on the database are white - most likely a reflection of the fact that the police forces contributing to it are from majority-white countries. There's constant pressure, Brennan says, to quantify the numbers of images or videos that are in existence, and the numbers of victims who are being sexually exploited. But it's impossible. Databases only hold the images that have been found, through police raids or reports. Who knows how many are circulating out there? Paul Griffiths says it only takes one person to bring a video out of the depths of the dark web and unleash it on the general population. ""Sooner or later it comes into the possession of someone who either doesn't know how to keep it safe and hidden, or doesn't really care. And they spread it wider. It can take a few hours, and it's all over the internet."" I spoke to one offender who served seven months in prison for viewing child abuse images. He had been offered the files on Skype during an adult online sexual meet-up. He'd opened the first file, seen it was of a child - and carried on opening all 20. Then he tried to share them with someone else. Eventually, the man who sent him the files sent them to someone who told the police. But it's a telling example of how easily files like the one I was sent spread, from the depths of the dark web, on to platforms like Skype, and then to people's phones. Despite the lack of action taken on my case, the UK policing response to child sex abuse images is one of the most robust in the world. The Child Abuse Image Database (CAID) has seen huge investment over the last five years. When detectives receive the phone or laptop of a suspect, they can run images on it through state-of-the-art software that checks whether images are new, or already known to police. All police forces are linked up, and the database talks to others around the world. In the 1990s the Home Office undertook a study of the proliferation of indecent imagery of children. There were less than 10,000 images in circulation then. Now there are almost 14 million images on the UK database. The levels of depravity in videos and images are getting worse, Chief Constable Simon Bailey tells me. He's been the National Police Chief Council's lead for child protection and abuse investigations for the last five years. I am expecting a forbidding character when I go to interview him at his Norfolk HQ. What I find is a man at the end of his tether. ""It just keeps growing, and growing, and growing,"" he says. ""And there is an element of, 'These figures are just so huge that just can't be right.' Well trust me, it is right. And if I have one really significant regret around my leadership and our response to this it's that we have struggled to land with the public the true scale of what we are dealing with, the horrors of what we are dealing with. Most people, I would like to think, would be mortified that this type of abuse is taking place."" Last year, Simon Bailey called for a boycott of tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, until they invest in technology to filter and block these images and videos. The public, including myself, took little notice. Last year, the robots Facebook deploys to sift through its Messenger service reported 12 million posts containing images of child abuse to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which runs the US database. So child protection campaigners are horrified at Facebook's decision to start encrypting Messenger over the coming months, because it will mean the platform effectively goes ""dark"" and abusers will be able to share material with impunity. It will become more like WhatsApp, where end-to-end encryption means no-one except the sender and receiver knows anything about what's in a message. WhatsApp's encryption works because your phone and the phone of the person you're messaging generate the encryption codes and keys. When the message leaves your phone, it does travel through WhatsApp's servers - but they don't have the keys to decrypt it. The only way robots or artificial intelligence could scan the message would be if it was encrypted after it left your phone. But that would give prying regimes, law enforcement or the tech firms themselves a window into our messages. WhatsApp thinks it would lose customers as a result. Online sexual abuse: 'Don't do what I did' Record number of images dealt with, charity says One in five adults experienced abuse as children - report The solution is to do the scanning on our phones. One way this could be done would be for everyone to download software with a list of all the unique codes of all the known child abuse images and videos. But this would still raise privacy concerns. The tech firms could fiddle with the list of codes to include non-child-abuse images - censorship in other words. So it would be better if phones could run an algorithm to generate the codes themselves, completely independently from any government or tech company. This is the tricky bit though. No one's invented that algorithm yet. One expert I spoke to put it like this: ""I wouldn't call it impossible, I'd call it unknown how to do it today."" It would take huge amounts of research and development - but it could probably be done. The failure by Big Tech to invest in this angers Simon Bailey. ""They hold the key to so much of this. Their duty of care I think to children, they have completely absolved themselves of that. ""The reaction is always, 'Well we're doing our best.' No you're not. You need to do more. You're making billions of pounds in profit. Invest."" There are high hopes for the UK government's Online Harms White Paper published in April 2019 - a radical proposal for legislation that would see tech firms held responsible for the harm they do. It proposes a new regulator and campaigners hope the resulting bill will include mandatory reporting of any child sex abuse. The results of a public consultation are due soon. At the moment, the tech firms choose what to tell us. No-one knows, for example, how much Facebook or WhatsApp spend on child protection. Facebook says it has the best artificial intelligence on the market trying to block and filter messages. But the company won't reveal how it works, or how much it costs. John Carr, who advises governments on child safety online, says this lack of transparency has to end. ""I work with people in these companies all the time, they agree with me on most stuff, they care passionately about protecting children but they don't make the decisions. It's their bosses, typically in California, that decide what happens. People high up in those companies need to feel the heat, they need to feel that their feet are being brought to the fire."" Of course, I ask to speak to WhatsApp. They say no. One bright summer day, I finally get a breakthrough in my search for the boy in the video. Simon Bailey's assistant puts me in touch with a senior police officer who opens some doors, and I get a call. I'm told the boy is alive. He's one of the lucky minority who have been identified and rescued. The video I was sent is an old one, from America. There are already three versions of it on the UK's CAID database - mine makes it four. Police can't tell me where he is, or what his name is. But they do tell me his abuser is serving a long jail term. It's the news I was hoping for. And I'm happy to leave it at that. There's one word that has stuck in mind over the months that I've tried to find out more about this case - ""revictimisation"". Each time anybody watches or shares a video of a child being abused, that child is revictimised. And as I get closer to finding the boy, I realise I could end up making a phone call to tell him, out of the blue, that I've seen the video of him. He'd be reminded of the horror. He'd be humiliated. I should just leave him in peace. But I've learned about a campaign group in the US made up of victims - people filmed by abusers - whowantto be found, and heard. James Marsh, a lawyer who has been representing and campaigning for victims of child sex abuse for 14 years, recently spearheaded a change to the law in America that gives victims a right to a minimum of $3,000 compensation from everyone convicted of viewing or sharing a video of their abuse. It's called the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2018, after the three young victims who backed it by writing impact statements for the courts. ""It's only been really very recently that victims have become more empowered to reclaim that space, really trying to assert that this is not a victimless crime, that these are not harmless pictures, and that they have voices that deserve to be heard,"" he tells me. A set of ""voluntary principles"" for the tech industry, designed to counter online child sexual exploitation and abusewas published this week,externalby the governments of the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, after consultations with six leading tech companies. An accompanying letter acknowledged the industry's efforts, but said there was ""much more to be done to strengthen existing efforts,external"". It added that the initiative was intended to ""drive collective action"". The principles include preventing dissemination of child sex abuse material, targeting online grooming, preventing search results from surfacing child sexual abuse, and sharing data about the evolving threat. Recently a seasoned journalist called him for details about what happened to one of his clients. She was expecting to hear that the abuse involved naked photos. When he told her of the reality of the content of these films - the rape of a small child - she was horrified, and didn't publish the details. ""I think as a journalist you're turning off your readership by including these graphic descriptions. And yet, how else can you accurately report what's happening to bring about meaningful change?"" He says his clients, as they get older, have become frustrated by this squeamishness. ""This is our lived experience,"" they say. ""Face up to it."" I ask him if he thinks the young man, Andy, from the Amy and Vicky and Andy Act, would be up for talking to me. He agrees to connect us on Facebook Messenger. And with that, I had foundaboy inavideo. One who had suffered the same terrible fate as the boy in the video I was sent. Whatever I might have wanted to ask that boy, I could ask Andy. Did he have somewhere safe to sleep at night? Had he managed to stay safe? Andy has a warm voice. He's eager to talk, candid and hugely likeable. It's strange, but our conversation is not a miserable one. He tells me he is in his early 20s. He's been out of jail for six months, which is the longest he's managed since he was a child. Fighting mainly, and robbery. When he was younger he was into drugs - meth, heroin and weed. He's doing well at staying off them now. And he has two children, who he adores. But he lives in a kind of prison. ""I'm kind of a boring person. I don't really go out much, I stay at home, I kind of live just with my kids, and that's about it."" Andy lives in constant fear that someone might recognise him from one of the videos his abuser made of him, as the abuse continued until he was 13. If someone so much as looks at him in the street, he worries. His story starts with his parents' divorce. His mother wanted a male figure in his life, and so when Andy was around seven years old she sent him to a youth programme. The ""mentor"" allocated by the organisation groomed Andy and his family for a few months and took Andy on trips to Las Vegas. Andy didn't tell anyone when the sexual abuse started, because he didn't want to upset his mother. ""I didn't know how my mom would act about it. I didn't want her to be embarrassed because something had happened to me. I didn't know if it was normal. That's kind of how he made it seem."" If you've been affected by the issues touched on in this story, you can findsources of support on the BBC Action Line TheLucy Faithfull Foundation,externalworks to prevent and tackle child sexual abuse and exploitation When Andy grew old enough he confronted his abuser, who soon afterwards went on the run to Mexico. Then, one day, the FBI turned up at Andy's high school and knocked on his classroom door. The abuser had got sloppy - he'd sent a video to someone he didn't know, who'd reported him. ""And then they tell me that there's hundreds of thousands of videos and pictures of me out on the web."" Until that moment, Andy had no idea his abuse had been shared at all, let alone with thousands of people. But despite this shocking news, and the difficulty of telling his mother the truth, Andy agreed to help the FBI lure his abuser back across the border. ""We coaxed him back with a birthday party of mine. ""It was a whole three months, all the way up until my birthday. I talked with him on the phone, like nothing was wrong. He sent me a few packages."" The FBI officers set up the sting. They showed Andy the route they thought his abuser would take and the location of the planned arrest. ""It was really cool. They caught him a couple blocks from my grandmother's house, pulled him over and arrested him."" It was one of the best moments of Andy's life. Like other identified victims in the US, Andy gets a letter every time someone is convicted of viewing or sharing a video of him. He has thousands of them. He's doing his best to rebuild his life. When he can afford therapy, things are better. His lawyers are working on some big cases, which should bring him more compensation. But it's tough. ""Work is really hard for me. And it's not because I'm lazy or anything. It's mainly the mentality of not being able to trust somebody. I can't let this person in. So I'm really anti-social."" Andy, like all victims, was incredibly unlucky to fall into the hands of an abuser. Had he not, he thinks he would by now have been the CEO of his father's business. He is finding purpose and solace in his involvement with Amy, Vicky and Andy's law. The three young campaigners hope to meet up in person soon. In the future, Andy wants to give up his anonymity and go into schools to teach children how to stay safe, and how to tell someone if they are not. He feels an obligation to do it he says. ""You know, I want people to know my story."" I will never get to talk to the other boy in the video. I hope he's OK. I hope he can rebuild his life - however slowly and imperfectly - like Andy. I've been able to give you a happy ending. Both Andy and the little boy in the video I was sent have been identified and their abusers are in prison. But this is wildly misleading. Most of the boys and girls in videos won't be rescued. And without radical reform of the way we manage technology and privacy, videos like the one I saw will keep circulating, and new children will be abused to feed the demand.

"Despite fears over the coronavirus outbreak, thousands of people took to the streets across Asia, including this march in Yogyakarta, Indonesia Marches to raise awareness of discrimination against women are taking place in cities around the world to mark International Women's Day. The protests have been widespread and well-attended despite concerns about the coronavirus. People around the world have been marking 8 March as a special day for women for more than a century. WATCH: Global marches mark International Women's Day It grew out of the labour movement to become a UN-recognised annual event. Several protests took place across Spain. This one (above) in the capital, Madrid, was organised by a feminist group demanding equal working rights, women's right to abortion and an end to violence against women. In the UK, many feminist groups held online campaigns instead of street marches, but this ""March4Women"" demonstration in London drew large crowds, including the English actress Natalie Dormer (seen here in the orange scarf). At a march in the Indonesian capital Jakarta, women from numerous organisations and trade unions demanded the government revoke what they see as gender discriminative laws - such as the ""omnibus law"" - and create new laws to protect women. In Germany, hundreds of women road bicycles through the streets of Berlin as part of a feminist demonstration labelled ""Purple Ride"". Women at Turkey's border with Greece held a demonstration demanding they be permitted to cross during International Women's Day. There have been fierce clashes between migrants and Greek border security as the former seek access to the EU Bangladeshi women played basketball on the outskirts of the capital, Dhaka, in a match organised for International Women's Day. Across Pakistan, marches took place in several cities in the face of violent threats and legal petitions. Here, people hold placards calling for an end to violence against women as they demonstrate in Islamabad. Pakistan on knife edge over women's march In the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek police detained dozens of women's rights activists shortly after masked men reportedly attacked marchers. Activists say women's rights are deteriorating in the country. In Belarus women took part in a ""beauty run"" to mark the day. Here, women warm up ahead of the run.

"Funding for flood defences in England is expected to be doubled to Â£5.2bn over five years in the forthcoming Budget, the Treasury has said. The money, due to be announced on March 11, will help to build 2,000 new flood and coastal defence schemes and protect 336,000 properties in the country. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said communities had been ""hit hard"" in recent floods. The funding - double the Â£2.6bn budgeted between 2015 and 2021 - is due to be available from April 2021. This year wasthe wettest February in the UK since records beganin 1862, with more than three times the average rainfall - as three successive storms left rivers bursting their banks and communities flooded. In some of the worst-hit areas in the Midlands, Wales and south Yorkshire, homes and businesses flooded three times in a matter of weeks. Flood defences get 1% of infrastructure spending Climate woes grow amid wettest February on record Storm payouts average out at Â£32,000 per household Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced criticism from Labourfor going ""Awol"" during the emergency and for failing to budget enough for flood defences. But the Treasury said this spending commitment now puts the government ""on track"" to meet the investment recommended by the National Infrastructure Commission. The government'sInfrastructure and Projects Authority previously projected that it would spent Â£4.7bn on flood defences,externalup to 2026, but the funding had not been confirmed. MPs in northern England called for flood defence spending to be reallocated, as the plans showed that a third of the money was expected to be spend in London and the South East of England. But the Treasury said every region would benefit from the investment and the North East and North West of England would receive the highest level of funding per property at risk of flooding. Mr Sunak said: ""Communities up and down Britain have been hit hard by the floods this winter, so it is right that we invest to protect towns, families, and homes across the UK."" The chancellor is also due to announced a Â£120m fund to repair flood defences that were damaged in the recent storms, bringing at least 300 schemes back to full operation, the Treasury said.

"The Oxford MP said her party faced an ""existential challenge"" Oxford West and Abingdon MP Layla Moran has said she will be standing in the contest to become the leader of the Liberal Democrats. She said her party faced an ""existential challenge"" and needed to focus on a positive vision for the UK. Jo Swinson resigned after losing her seatat the general election in December, in which the Lib Dems dropped from 12 to 11 seats. Nominations for candidates will open on 11 May, the party has said. Declaring her candidacy, Ms Moran said the decision had been a ""long-time coming"", but she had felt ""frustrated"" over the last three years about the direction the party was going in.

"Victims of domestic abuse who contact Scottish Women's Aid (SWA) for help face being put on waiting lists of up to six months, the charity has said. SWA figures show it supports more than 1,000 women and children across the country on any given day. The group is now urging the Scottish government and councils to provide increased funding to make sure victims are helped more quickly. The government said it was committed to tackling all forms of domestic abuse. SWA published a report on its work to markInternational Women's Day.,external It said the vast majority (84%) of Women's Aid groups have to operate waiting lists of up to six months for at least one of their services. More than half of its services were forced to operate a waiting list for refuge spaces in 2018-19. On one day in 2019, SWA was unable to provide accommodation for 58% of the women and 38% of the children and young people seeking refuge, the report said. Also on a single day last year, 1,235 women, children and young people contacted a Women's Aid service - with 101 of them seeking help for the first time. The charity, which has 38 local groups, said funding for specialist services was ""insufficient due to funding cuts, freezes, and the nature of short-term, precarious funding"". Scottish government statistics show that in 2018-19, there were 60,641 incidents of domestic abuse recorded by Police Scotland. But the SWA report stresses that ""most domestic abuse is not reported to the police"". It said 79% of its services have either received no increase in funding or have seen funding cut - on average by 10%. The report highlights a ""stark increase in the waiting time for women and children to access a refuge"". It added: ""This means that women and children forced to leave their home because of domestic abuse are left without a safe place to go."" The charity's Ash Kuloo said: ""It is women, children and young people experiencing domestic abuse who bear the brunt of cuts to funding. ""It is their safety and survival that lies behind these statistics and every increased waiting list means another person not getting the vital support they need, at the time they need it."" She said Women's Aid services were ""continuously being asked to do much more, with much less"". A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We are absolutely committed to tackling all forms of domestic abuse and violence against women and girls, and ensuring that victims receive the support they need. ""We are working with Cosla and key partners to implement our Equally Safe strategy across Scotland. ""We have invested significant levels of funding into front-line services, as well as working closely with statutory agencies to improve their response to victims and survivors."" Cosla, which represents local authorities, said while the Scottish government had made a significant investment, the ""underinvestment"" in councils had impacted its work in this area.

"Tesco has introduced signs at point-of-sale in supermarkets, informing shoppers of restrictions Tesco, the UK's largest grocer, has begun restricting sales of essential food and household items as a result of coronavirus stockpiling. Shoppers are limited to buying no more than five of certain goods, including antibacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables The rules apply in stores and online. A government spokesperson said it was in touch with UK supermarkets to ""discuss their response"" to the virus. Waitrose has introduced a temporary cap on some items on its website, including some anti-bacterial soaps and wipes. The supermarket said it was in talks with its suppliers to ensure customer demand was met. It said some individual stores may have introduced their own restrictions, with ""some branch managers making a judgement at a localised level"". Empty pasta shelves at the Tesco store in Royston, Hertfordshire The High Street chemist Boots has restricted sales of hand sanitisers to two per person. Asda is also restricting some types of hand sanitiser to two bottles per person - the supermarket's only restriction in place currently. Meanwhile, Sainsbury's said it was not limiting sales of any products in stores or online yet. On Monday, Environment Secretary George Eustice is expected to hold talks with supermarket and trade bosses about ""support for vulnerable groups who may be in isolation"", the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said. According to a survey from Retail Economics, as many as one in 10 UK consumers is stockpiling, based on a sample of 2,000 shoppers. But Dr Andrew Potter, chair in logistics and transport at Cardiff Business School, told the BBC:  ""Whilst there might be empty shelves at the moment in the shops, over the next week or so, we will see them replenish. The Tesco restrictions on five items for things like hand gel also apply to online purchases ""The supply chain will start to deliver stuff through to the stores and hopefully this shortage - which is fairly short-term - will clear and everything will be back to normal again."" He said while retailers may have been caught out by the beginning of this shopping surge, they had very sophisticated systems to check changes in demand. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, echoed that ""supply chains remain robust and even where there are challenges, retailers are well-versed in providing measures"" to keep shops running smoothly. Waitrose said it has not put a cap on any of its products in stores. But it has introduced a temporary cap on certain products on its website, including some anti-bacterial soaps and wipes, ""to ensure our customers have access to the products they need"". UK retailers have been warned that they face prosecution if they exploit the coronavirus scare to hike prices for products such as hand sanitisers and face masks.

Facebook says it is temporarily banning ads and commercial listings for medical face masks.  The ban will also apply to Instagram. NHS will get 'whatever it needs' for coronavirus Coronavirus: Are people panic buying? Coronavirus: The psychology of panic buying Retailers warned not to 'exploit' consumers' fears ""We're monitoring Covid-19 closely and will make necessary updates to our policies if we see people trying to exploit this public health emergency,"" Facebook director of product management Rob Leathern tweeted. ""We'll start rolling out this change in the days ahead.  We... anticipate profiteers will evolve their approach as we enforce on these ads."" Facebook had earlier announced a ban on ads for medical products which falsely suggested an item was in short supply, as well as those which falsely claimed to provide cures or prevention methods for coronavirus. Meanwhile, Amazon said it had removed thousands of listings from its sites around the world and was constantly monitoring attempted price-gouging. Analysis from Liberty Marketing,externalhas found UK own-brand hand sanitisers are being sold on eBay for huge mark ups, with Lidl 49p sanitisers selling for as much as Â£24.99 online.

"This video can not be played Milan quarantine resident: ""It's really important to be responsible in this moment"" Italy has placed up to 16 million people under quarantine as it battles to contain the spread of coronavirus. Anyone living in Lombardy and 14 other central and northern provinces will need special permission to travel. Milan and Venice are both affected. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also announced the closure of schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues across the whole country. The measures, the most radical taken outside China, will last until 3 April. Italy has seen the largest number of coronavirus infections in Europe, with the number of confirmed cases jumping by more than 1,200 to 5,883 on Saturday. Among the latest people to test positive is the army's chief of staff. Salvatore Farina said he felt well and was self-isolating. The strict new quarantine measures affect a quarter of the Italian population and centre on the rich northern part of the country that powers its economy. The death toll in Italy has passed 230, with officials reporting more than 36 deaths in 24 hours. Live coverage: Follow the latest updates The health system is under immense strain in Lombardy, a northern region of 10 million people, where people are being treated in hospital corridors. ""We want to guarantee the health of our citizens. We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices, sometimes small and sometimes very big,"" Prime Minister Conte said as he announced the measures in the middle of the night. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Under the new measures, people are not supposed to be able to enter or leave Lombardy, where Milan is the main city. The same restrictions apply to 14 provinces: Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano Cusio Ossola, Vercelli, Padua, Treviso and Venice. ""There will be no movement in or out of these areas, or within them, unless for proven work-related reasons, emergencies or health reasons,"" Mr Conte told reporters. ""We are facing an emergency, a national emergency. We have to limit the spread of the virus and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed."" People queued to buy food in Milan as quarantine measures were announced Some transport in and out of the regions affected continued on Sunday. Flights continued to arrive at Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, though some scheduled flights were cancelled. However, Italy's national carrier Alitalia said it would suspend all operations from Malpensa from Monday and Linate would only serve domestic routes. International flights would continue to and from Rome. Chris Wood, a 26-year-old from London said he and his girlfriend had cut their holiday in Italy short and were waiting for a flight home from Venice. ""The initial announcement that Venice was in lockdown was quite terrifying but everything at the airport is pretty calm,"" he said. ""I was in a bit of a panic as I thought we were going to be stuck in Venice for a month."" Last week was critical to seeing if Italy's coronavirus response had managed to halt the spread. If the numbers had begun to tail off, it would have suggested the containment measures had worked. They haven't. With cases still surging, the government has moved to the next stage - and it's a dramatic step up. It's not quite a complete lockdown - planes and trains are still running and access will be permitted for emergency or essential work reasons. But police will be able to stop people and ask why they're trying to enter or leave the areas covered. The question is whether this is all too late. It's believed the virus was circulating in Italy for weeks before it was detected. And there have now been cases in all 22 regions of the country. The government is now taking the most extensive containment measures outside of China. But is this a case of trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted? Weddings and funerals have been suspended, as well as religious and cultural events. Cinemas, nightclubs, gyms, swimming pools, museums and ski resorts have been closed. Restaurants and cafes in the quarantined zones can open between 06:00 and 18:00 but customers must sit at least 1m (3ft) apart. People have been told to stay at home as much as possible, and those who break the quarantine could face three months in jail. The World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Italy for making ""genuine sacrifices"" with the restrictions. Until now only about 50,000 people in northern Italy had been affected by quarantines. Last week the government announced the closure of all schools and universities across the country for 10 days.

The number of infections worldwide is more than 105,500, the WHO says, with nearly 3,600 deaths. Most of the fatalities have been in China, where the virus originated in December. But the country on Sunday reported its lowest number of new infections in a single day since January - an indication that the virus's spread there is slowing. There were 40 new cases on Saturday, less than half the number reported on Friday. Twenty-seven new deaths were reported - the lowest figure in more than a month - and all were in Wuhan, where the outbreak began. Iran, one of the worst hotspots outside China, has now confirmed almost 6,000 infections and 145 deaths. However, the real figure is believed to be much higher. One report on Sunday, quoting a government envoy, said there had been 200 deaths in the northern Gilan province alone - but the figures were later removed.

"Victims of domestic abuse who contact Scottish Women's Aid (SWA) for help face being put on waiting lists of up to six months, the charity has said. SWA figures show it supports more than 1,000 women and children across the country on any given day. The group is now urging the Scottish government and councils to provide increased funding to make sure victims are helped more quickly. The government said it was committed to tackling all forms of domestic abuse. SWA published a report on its work to markInternational Women's Day.,external It said the vast majority (84%) of Women's Aid groups have to operate waiting lists of up to six months for at least one of their services. More than half of its services were forced to operate a waiting list for refuge spaces in 2018-19. On one day in 2019, SWA was unable to provide accommodation for 58% of the women and 38% of the children and young people seeking refuge, the report said. Also on a single day last year, 1,235 women, children and young people contacted a Women's Aid service - with 101 of them seeking help for the first time. The charity, which has 38 local groups, said funding for specialist services was ""insufficient due to funding cuts, freezes, and the nature of short-term, precarious funding"". Scottish government statistics show that in 2018-19, there were 60,641 incidents of domestic abuse recorded by Police Scotland. But the SWA report stresses that ""most domestic abuse is not reported to the police"". It said 79% of its services have either received no increase in funding or have seen funding cut - on average by 10%. The report highlights a ""stark increase in the waiting time for women and children to access a refuge"". It added: ""This means that women and children forced to leave their home because of domestic abuse are left without a safe place to go."" The charity's Ash Kuloo said: ""It is women, children and young people experiencing domestic abuse who bear the brunt of cuts to funding. ""It is their safety and survival that lies behind these statistics and every increased waiting list means another person not getting the vital support they need, at the time they need it."" She said Women's Aid services were ""continuously being asked to do much more, with much less"". A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We are absolutely committed to tackling all forms of domestic abuse and violence against women and girls, and ensuring that victims receive the support they need. ""We are working with Cosla and key partners to implement our Equally Safe strategy across Scotland. ""We have invested significant levels of funding into front-line services, as well as working closely with statutory agencies to improve their response to victims and survivors."" Cosla, which represents local authorities, said while the Scottish government had made a significant investment, the ""underinvestment"" in councils had impacted its work in this area.

"The UK will leave the European aviation safety regulator after the Brexit transition period, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has confirmed. He said UK membership of the European Aviation Safety Agency - responsible for certifying the airworthiness of planes - would end on 31 December. He said the UK's Civil Aviation Authority would ""bring expertise home"". But the owner of British Airways said the CAA lacked world-class knowledge and could not be ready in time. Mr Shapps told Aviation Week,externalmuch of the Cologne-based European Aviation Safety Agency's (EASA) expertise came from the UK and that a lot of its leaders were British. He said the agency's powers would revert to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) ""and the expertise will need to come home to do that, but we'll do it in a gradual way"". The trade body ADS - which represents more than 1,100 UK businesses in the aerospace, defence, security and space sectors - told the BBC the decision could potentially mean products and designs would need to be certified more than once. For example, EASA is responsible for certifying commercial aircraft for service across the EU and some non-EU European countries. When the UK ends its membership of EASA, it may need to certify aircraft separately itself. Brexit: What happens next? Aerospace industry seeks Brexit reassurance Aviation regulator's no-deal plan 'rebuffed' ADS has estimated that it would take 10 years and cost up to Â£40m annually to create a UK safety authority with all the expertise of EASA, against a current contribution to the European agency of Â£1m to Â£4m a year. It claimed a new regulatory regime could put jobs in the sector at risk. ""We have been clear that continued participation in EASA is the best option to maintain the competitiveness of our Â£36bn aerospace industry and our access to global export markets,"" the trade body said. It added that the UK's influence within EASA ""contributes to raising standards in global aviation"" and helped make the industry ""attractive to the investment it needs"". British Airways owner IAG said it was ""disappointed"" with the decision and said the Civil Aviation Authority ""does not have the expertise required to operate as a world class safety and technical regulator"". IAG said: ""The CAA will require fundamental restructuring from top to bottom which will take time. There is no way that it can be done by 31 December."" Airlines UK, which represents carriers including EasyJet and Ryanair, said its members supported continued membership of EASA - but not at the risk of the UK becoming a ""dumb follower of EU rules"". It urged the government to begin negotiations on an air safety agreement with the EU so it could be ready by the end of the year. The Department for Transport said: ""Being a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency is not compatible with the UK having genuine economic and political independence. ""We will maintain world-leading safety standards for industry, with the Civil Aviation Authority taking over these responsibilities, and will continue to work with colleagues in the EU to establish a new regulatory relationship.""

"This video can not be played Milan quarantine resident: ""It's really important to be responsible in this moment"" Italy has placed up to 16 million people under quarantine as it battles to contain the spread of coronavirus. Anyone living in Lombardy and 14 other central and northern provinces will need special permission to travel. Milan and Venice are both affected. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also announced the closure of schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues across the whole country. The measures, the most radical taken outside China, will last until 3 April. Italy has seen the largest number of coronavirus infections in Europe, with the number of confirmed cases jumping by more than 1,200 to 5,883 on Saturday. Among the latest people to test positive is the army's chief of staff. Salvatore Farina said he felt well and was self-isolating. The strict new quarantine measures affect a quarter of the Italian population and centre on the rich northern part of the country that powers its economy. The death toll in Italy has passed 230, with officials reporting more than 36 deaths in 24 hours. Live coverage: Follow the latest updates The health system is under immense strain in Lombardy, a northern region of 10 million people, where people are being treated in hospital corridors. ""We want to guarantee the health of our citizens. We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices, sometimes small and sometimes very big,"" Prime Minister Conte said as he announced the measures in the middle of the night. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Under the new measures, people are not supposed to be able to enter or leave Lombardy, where Milan is the main city. The same restrictions apply to 14 provinces: Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano Cusio Ossola, Vercelli, Padua, Treviso and Venice. ""There will be no movement in or out of these areas, or within them, unless for proven work-related reasons, emergencies or health reasons,"" Mr Conte told reporters. ""We are facing an emergency, a national emergency. We have to limit the spread of the virus and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed."" People queued to buy food in Milan as quarantine measures were announced Some transport in and out of the regions affected continued on Sunday. Flights continued to arrive at Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, though some scheduled flights were cancelled. However, Italy's national carrier Alitalia said it would suspend all operations from Malpensa from Monday and Linate would only serve domestic routes. International flights would continue to and from Rome. Chris Wood, a 26-year-old from London said he and his girlfriend had cut their holiday in Italy short and were waiting for a flight home from Venice. ""The initial announcement that Venice was in lockdown was quite terrifying but everything at the airport is pretty calm,"" he said. ""I was in a bit of a panic as I thought we were going to be stuck in Venice for a month."" Last week was critical to seeing if Italy's coronavirus response had managed to halt the spread. If the numbers had begun to tail off, it would have suggested the containment measures had worked. They haven't. With cases still surging, the government has moved to the next stage - and it's a dramatic step up. It's not quite a complete lockdown - planes and trains are still running and access will be permitted for emergency or essential work reasons. But police will be able to stop people and ask why they're trying to enter or leave the areas covered. The question is whether this is all too late. It's believed the virus was circulating in Italy for weeks before it was detected. And there have now been cases in all 22 regions of the country. The government is now taking the most extensive containment measures outside of China. But is this a case of trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted? Weddings and funerals have been suspended, as well as religious and cultural events. Cinemas, nightclubs, gyms, swimming pools, museums and ski resorts have been closed. Restaurants and cafes in the quarantined zones can open between 06:00 and 18:00 but customers must sit at least 1m (3ft) apart. People have been told to stay at home as much as possible, and those who break the quarantine could face three months in jail. The World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Italy for making ""genuine sacrifices"" with the restrictions. Until now only about 50,000 people in northern Italy had been affected by quarantines. Last week the government announced the closure of all schools and universities across the country for 10 days.

The number of infections worldwide is more than 105,500, the WHO says, with nearly 3,600 deaths. Most of the fatalities have been in China, where the virus originated in December. But the country on Sunday reported its lowest number of new infections in a single day since January - an indication that the virus's spread there is slowing. There were 40 new cases on Saturday, less than half the number reported on Friday. Twenty-seven new deaths were reported - the lowest figure in more than a month - and all were in Wuhan, where the outbreak began. Iran, one of the worst hotspots outside China, has now confirmed almost 6,000 infections and 145 deaths. However, the real figure is believed to be much higher. One report on Sunday, quoting a government envoy, said there had been 200 deaths in the northern Gilan province alone - but the figures were later removed.

"Funding for flood defences in England is expected to be doubled to Â£5.2bn over five years in the forthcoming Budget, the Treasury has said. The money, due to be announced on March 11, will help to build 2,000 new flood and coastal defence schemes and protect 336,000 properties in the country. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said communities had been ""hit hard"" in recent floods. The funding - double the Â£2.6bn budgeted between 2015 and 2021 - is due to be available from April 2021. This year wasthe wettest February in the UK since records beganin 1862, with more than three times the average rainfall - as three successive storms left rivers bursting their banks and communities flooded. In some of the worst-hit areas in the Midlands, Wales and south Yorkshire, homes and businesses flooded three times in a matter of weeks. Flood defences get 1% of infrastructure spending Climate woes grow amid wettest February on record Storm payouts average out at Â£32,000 per household Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced criticism from Labourfor going ""Awol"" during the emergency and for failing to budget enough for flood defences. But the Treasury said this spending commitment now puts the government ""on track"" to meet the investment recommended by the National Infrastructure Commission. The government'sInfrastructure and Projects Authority previously projected that it would spent Â£4.7bn on flood defences,externalup to 2026, but the funding had not been confirmed. MPs in northern England called for flood defence spending to be reallocated, as the plans showed that a third of the money was expected to be spend in London and the South East of England. But the Treasury said every region would benefit from the investment and the North East and North West of England would receive the highest level of funding per property at risk of flooding. Mr Sunak said: ""Communities up and down Britain have been hit hard by the floods this winter, so it is right that we invest to protect towns, families, and homes across the UK."" The chancellor is also due to announced a Â£120m fund to repair flood defences that were damaged in the recent storms, bringing at least 300 schemes back to full operation, the Treasury said.
