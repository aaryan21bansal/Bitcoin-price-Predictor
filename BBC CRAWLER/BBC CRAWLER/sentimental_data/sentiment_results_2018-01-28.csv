"This video can not be played David Lidington, minister for the Cabinet Office, says the Conservative ""family"" should think about more than Brexit Conservatives must ""come together in a spirit of mutual respect"", a cabinet minister says amid backbench criticism over Brexit and policy direction. David Lidington told the BBC the ""left, right and centre"" of the party should look at the ""bigger picture"". One Tory MP tweeted: ""We need to get a grip and lead"" while another urged ""less policy making by tortoise"". Ex-cabinet minister Theresa Villiers joined those concerned the UK would remain in the EU ""in all but name"". Criticisms over the government's Brexit negotiations began on Thursday when influential backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg accused UK negotiators of being ""cowed by the EU"". Others were annoyed by Chancellor Philip Hammond's suggestion that changes to the UK-EU relations after Brexit could be ""very modest"". Trump 'would've done Brexit differently' Laura Kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface Davis plays down Tory Brexit row Rees-Mogg and Hammond at odds over Brexit But wider criticisms of Downing Street's direction were voiced on Sunday, amid newspaper headlines about ""Tories in Turmoil"", with backbencher Heidi Allentweeting,externalthat the party needed to ""get a grip"", adding: ""We are letting this country down."" The Conservative chairman of the education selected committee, Robert Halfon, said more needed to be done to tackle social injustice, telling the BBC: ""We need to have less policy-making by tortoise and [more] policy making by lion."" And fellow backbencher Nigel Mills, told BBC Radio 4 that progress in education had ""stalled"", adding: ""I think the frustration is that the prime minister had the right drive and the right belief when she came into office and it's hard to see how we're making progress on that."" But Cabinet Office minister Mr Lidington told The Andrew Marr Show: ""I think what I say to all my colleagues is the Conservative family - left, right and centre, because we're a broad church - needs to come together in a spirit of mutual respect, there are differences in any broad church, and look at what the bigger picture is showing."" The party was still ""neck and neck"" with Labour in the polls after eight years of government, as well as ""taking seats off them"" in local government elections, he added. Mr Lidington's message was echoed by Culture Secretary Matt Hancock, who told BBC One's Breakfast on Monday: ''The prime minister has shown leadership in a number of areas.... there are many challenges that Britain faces and we need to face them together and deal with them. I think we should pull together and back her.'' The UK is due to leave the European Union in March 2019, and among the key questions in negotiations between the two sides is how close their trading relationship will be in the future. This video can not be played Theresa Villiers MP: ""If you go too far with compromise... we wouldn't genuinely be leaving"" Former Northern Ireland Secretary Ms Villiers, who campaigned for the UK to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum,wrote in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalthat there was ""a real danger"" the UK would sign up to an agreement with Brussels which could ""keep us in the EU in all but name"". She told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""There is only so far you can go with compromise without ultimately finding yourself in a position where you're selling out all the people who voted to leave."" Although 29 March 2019 is the official Brexit date, the UK will continue to allow free movement of people, goods and money for about two years to allow businesses to adjust. The EU is seeking to tighten the conditions which will apply to the UK during the transitional period, according to a draft of revised EU guidelines. Mr Lidington said there would be ""big, big differences"" to the relationship during that period, and that Britain would have the option to move away from EU rules. ""The bill in front of Parliament extinguishes the power of the European Court (of Justice) and supranational EU law over the UK. ""We will have, from next year, a registration system we've not had before for EU nationals coming to this country. ""Of course we will have the power to choose for ourselves whether or not to diverge once we have left the supranational legal structures of the EU,"" he added. Meanwhile, former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps has urged the prime minister to ""name a date"" when she will stand down,according to the Mail on Sunday.,external Mr Shapps said he had not submitted a letter to the party's 1922 Committee, calling for a leadership contest, but added ""an increasing number of my colleagues have"". Elsewhere, in an interview with Piers Morgan for ITV, US President Donald Trumpcriticised the prime minister's approach to Brexit negotiations.

"Cambodian police have published a group shot of the 10 arrested foreigners Prosecutors in Cambodia have charged 10 foreigners, including five Britons, with producing pornographic images. They were arrested on Thursday after images emerged of people appearing to imitate sex acts at a party in a villa in Siem Reap in the north-west. If convicted, they could face up to a year in prison. Also among those arrested are citizens of Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Norway, reports say. However several people in the pictures from the party do not appear among those held, reports say. Britain's Foreign Office said it was providing assistance to the UK detainees. Police said the private villa was a stop on an organised pub crawl, the Press Association reports. Images posted on an expat-run website showed several clothed couples on the floor of the villa, apparently acting out sexual positions. One member of the group told PA from prison that about 30 police officers had entered the villa in a ""confusing"" raid. ""They raided, rounded us up, there was about 80 to 100 people at this party, some of them were tourists."" The mother of one member of the group told PA the detainees had had to sign papers written in Khmer ""not knowing what they"" were. A police handout picture of people appearing to imitate sex acts at a party Siem Reap is popular with tourists because it is close to the famous ancient ruins of Angkor Wat, Cambodia's biggest tourist site. Its nightlife scene has rapidly grown over the past few years as it has become more accessible to backpackers and budget travellers. This has sometimes placed tourists at odds with Cambodia's socially conservative culture. Duong Thavry, chief of the Anti-Human Trafficking and Juvenile Protection Department in Siem Reap, told AFP news agency the group had been arrested ""because they committed activities that are against our culture"".

"""Rogue"" parking companies will be banned from accessing driver data and issuing charges as part of plans to stop ""unscrupulous operators"". The government has confirmed it will support new legislation aimed at raising standards among parking firms. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, said the legislation will provide ""fair, clear and consistent"" regulation of the parking industry. It comes as firms issue almost 13 times more tickets than a decade ago. Drivers' growing disquiet about the rules on parking are underlined by figures showing nearly 10,000 people approached the Citizens Advice Bureau for guidance on parking tickets last year. There are complaints of inconsistent practices, substandard signage, confusing appeals processes and intimidating payment letters, said the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. Private parking charges: Your rights MSP calls for private parking law change Conservative MP Sir Greg Knight's Parking (Code of Practice) Bill to tackle rogue parking operators is due for its second reading in the House of Commons on Friday, effectively guaranteeing its passage into law. Firms which don't obey the rules will be blocked from accessing drivers' DVLA records. This will prevent the firms from issuing charges, effectively forcing them out of the industry. Mr Javid said drivers have suffered for too long ""at the hands of dodgy parking firms"". He said: ""That is why government is putting the brakes on these rogue operators and backing new laws that will put a stop to aggressive behaviour and provide a simpler way for drivers to appeal fines."" The department hopes motoring groups and other experts will help the Communities Secretary to develop the code of practice. Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said the move would bring ""some much-needed regulatory rigour to the world of private parking"". He added: ""Drivers don't want a parking free-for-all, but they do want a system that is fair to all parties and that's what a code of practice set by government - rather than the industry itself - should bring about.""

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says he would give immediate housing to those that are currently homeless Labour is pledging to provide 8,000 homes ""immediately"" to house people with a history of rough sleeping, should it win power. Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said they would also help councils ""take over"" properties kept empty deliberately. He said the scale of homelessness was ""disgusting"" and ""wholly unnecessary"". Conservative David Lidington said the reasons for rough sleeping were complex and the government had set ambitious targets to reduce it. Outlining Labour's plans, Mr Corbyn pledged more council properties with lifetime tenancies at secure rent, and more intervention into the private rented sector. Asked what a Labour government could do for people who were already homeless, Mr Corbyn told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""Immediately purchase 8,000 properties across the country to give emergency housing to those people who are currently homeless and at the same time require local authorities to build far more."" A party spokesman later clarified that the 8,000 properties would not be bought using compulsory purchase powers but would be acquired by ""immediately striking a deal"" with housing associations to free them up as they fell vacant. They would then be replaced by new properties to be built under Labour's pledged house building programme. Rough sleeping rises for seventh year Homeless-by-sea Mr Corbyn went on: ""We would give local authorities the power to take over deliberately kept empty properties, because there is something grossly insulting about the idea you would build some luxury block and deliberately keep it empty. ""Surely we have to have a social objective and a social priority in our society?"", he said. Labour says they would work with charities and outreach workers to identify rough sleepers and offer them accommodation ""as quickly as possible"" and tenancies could be modelled on schemes already in place - such as the""clearing house"" scheme operated by the St Mungo's charity,externalin London. The party says it would make better use of existing ""empty dwelling management orders"" - which give councils powers to let out properties which have been vacant for at least two years, with some exemptions including for second homes, people taken into care and armed services personnel on active service. New figures out last week showed rough sleeping in England had increased for the seventh year in a row. There were 4,751 people counted or estimated to be bedding down outside in autumn 2017, a 15% rise on the year before and more than double the figure recorded five years ago. Conservative Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said there were ""a number of different reasons"" rough sleeping had gone up - including mental health issues and drug and alcohol problems. ""We have pledged to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminate it by 2027,"" he said. ""We have backed new legislation which is enabling us, with local authorities, to address the reasons why people become homeless and sleep rough, so that we prevent it, rather than try to deal with the problem when it occurs.""

"New Zealand's Air Force released this image of the survivors adrift in the Pacific Eight survivors from a ferry missing in the Kiribati archipelago have been rescued in the Pacific Ocean. The MV Butiraoi went missing nearly two weeks ago with 50 people on board. The eight people were picked up by a fishing boat,externalafter they were spotted from air in a small dinghy, the New Zealand Defence Force said. Search operations continued on Monday with rescuers saying there may yet be more survivors out at sea. New Zealand and Fiji are among the countries assisting in the search and rescue operation. A New Zealand military plane had found the 5m (16ft) dinghy adrift on Sunday morning. The New Zealand Defence Force had initially given the number of survivors on board as seven. The crew had airdropped essential supplies and radio equipment to the survivors. Later on Sunday, the group were picked up by a fishing vessel. Allow Twitter content?

John Ashby, from the New Zealand Rescue Coordination Centre, said the dinghy was one of two believed to have been carried by the MV Butiraoi. ""The group seem very relieved to have been found,"" he added, noting that sea conditions were ""moderate to rough"". No further details about the fate of the 17.5m (57ft) wooden catamaran or its other passengers were given. The ferry left the island of Nonouti ahead of a 260km (160 miles) journey to Betio. The Butiraoi left Nonouti Island on 18 January on a 250km (155 mile) journey to the island of Betio, a journey which was expected to take two days. The vessel had undergone repairs to its propeller shaft just before the journey. After a week with no sign of the boat, New Zealand began offering assistance. ""We are always ready to play our part at home and in the region to help those in need,"" it said in a statement at the start of its involvement.

"This video can not be played From 2018: Five things to know about Ingvar Kamprad, founder of Ikea The Swedish founder of the Ikea furniture chain, Ingvar Kamprad, has died at the age of 91, the company has announced. Mr Kamprad - who pioneered flat-pack furniture - died at his home in SmÃ¥land, Ikea confirmed in a statement. The company said that Mr Kamprad was ""one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the 20th century"". The billionaire, who was born in 1926 in SmÃ¥land, founded Ikea at the age of 17. He used some money his father had given him as a gift for performing well at school despite his dyslexia. In the later years of his life, Mr Kamprad faced questions over his past links to fascist groups - something he admitted, but said was a ""mistake"". World reacts to Ikea founder's death Ingvar Kamprad said there were ""many reasons"" why he loved his business In a statement on Sunday, Ikea said that Mr Kamprad had ""peacefully passed away at his home"". ""He worked until the very end of his life, staying true to his own motto that most things remain to be done,"" it added. Mr Kamprad eventually stepped down from the company's board in 2013, at the age of 87. ""Ingvar Kamprad was a great entrepreneur of the typical southern Swedish kind - hardworking and stubborn, with a lot of warmth and a playful twinkle in his eye,"" the company said. His company's designs became popular in part because of their simplicity and value. Mr Kamprad is reported to have come up with the idea of flat-pack furniture after watching an employee remove the legs from a table in order to fit it into a customer's car. Is Ikea the Marmite of retailers? How Ikea's Billy took over the world Furniture designer Jeff Banks said that Mr Kamprad's creations radically changed how people made and designed products for the home. ""People have tried to reproduce and copy that, but unsuccessfully,"" he said. Mr Banks added that the designs produced and sold through the retailer made good use of recyclable products, adding that Mr Kamprad was ""head and shoulders above the rest"". Ikea has expanded to operate all around the world, including in China Mr Kamprad was renowned for his devotion to frugality, reportedly driving an old Volvo and travelling by economy class. In a 2016 interview with Swedish television channel TV4, Mr Kamprad said that it was ""in the nature of SmÃ¥land to be thrifty"". ""If you look at me now, I don't think I'm wearing anything that wasn't bought at a flea market,"" he said. He told the channel that he built his business on a ""local ethos"". ""We have SmÃ¥land in the blood, and we know what a krona is - even though it is not as much as it was when we bought candy and went to elementary school,"" he said, referring to the Swedish currency. People took to social media on Sunday to pay their respects to the ""greatest Swedish entrepreneur to have ever lived"". Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom tweeted her condolences, saying that Mr Kamprad had ""put Sweden on the world map"". Ikea started in 1943 and now has 389 stores worldwide The name comes from Mr Kamprad's initials (IK), together with the name of the farm he grew up on - Elmtaryd (E) - and the nearby village Agunnaryd (A) The company's retail sales totalled 36.4bn euros ($43bn, Â£30bn) in 2016 Its flat-pack furniture became iconic both for its affordability and for its picture-based assembly instructions Ikea has remained privately-owned under a Dutch trust operated by the Kamprad family. Its complex business structure has drawn controversy and the European Commission said last year that it had launched an investigation into Ikea's tax arrangements. The European Green Party said that the arrangement had allowed the company to avoid paying some â¬1bn in tax between 2009 and 2014. A spokesman for Dutch-based Inter Ikea, one of the company's two divisions, said that the company had been taxed ""in accordance with EU rules"". Ikea boss says it pays fair share of tax Ikea's fight against teen sleepovers In an interview in the 1980s, Mr Kamprad said that his vision for Ikea was that it would be a company that would make life easier for its customers. In more recent years,Mr Kamprad had faced scrutiny over his past links to Nazi groups. The tycoon revealed some elements of his past in a book in 1988, admitting that he was a close friend of the Swedish fascist activist Per Engdahl, and a member of his New Swedish Movement between 1942 and 1945. He said that his involvement was youthful ""stupidity"" and the ""greatest mistake"" of his life. But a 2011 book by Elisabeth Asbrink alleged details beyond what Mr Kamprad had previously admitted. She wrote that he was an active recruiter for a Swedish Nazi group, and stayed close to sympathisers well after World War Two. At the time a spokesman for Mr Kamprad said he had long admitted flirting with fascism, but that there were now ""no Nazi-sympathising thoughts in Ingvar's head whatsoever"".

"The recent death of an actor known for his roles in Maid Marian And Her Merry Men and Brush Strokes is being investigated by police. Howard Lew Lewis, who also appeared in Blackadder, died on 20 January in an Edinburgh hospital, aged 76. His daughter Debora Milazzo claims he had been placed on a regime of high-dose sedatives and maximum-strength opiate painkillers. Police Scotland confirmed it was investigating the complaint. The death is being treated as ""unexplained"". The actor, known as Lewy, died in Ellen's Glen House, a community hospital in Edinburgh just over a week ago. He was being treated for dementia. Ms Milazzo told the BBC Scotland News website: ""I'm trying to get justice for my dad. ""I want Police Scotland to investigate my dad's case."" She claims Mr Lewis had been needlessly placed on the kind of treatment plan that would be prescribed for the terminal phase of a malignant disease. Ms Milazzo insisted her father had not received a terminal diagnosis. She said: ""My father didn't have cancer, he didn't have heart disease. Lew Lewis, back, with Maid Marian co-stars (left to right) Tony Robinson, Danny John-Jules, Kate Lonergan, Wayne Morris and Mike Edmonds ""They suddenly just changed his medication and it was the new medication that killed him.""

"This video can not be played The BBC's Steve Rosenberg: ""We were standing right next to Mr Navalny... it was very dramatic"" Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been freed after detained by police at a Moscow rally in support of a presidential election boycott. His lawyer told the press that he had been released without charge but will have to appear in court at a later date and may then face charges. Earlier, police raided his offices in Moscow, reportedly seizing equipment. Mr Navalny - President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critic - is barred from standing in the 18 March election. BBC footage showed him being wrestled to the ground by policemen during the arrest. Soon afterwards the opposition leader tweeted to urge others to join protests across the country. ""The detention of one person is meaningless if there are many of us. Someone, come and replace me,"" he wrote (in Russian). Navalny: Russia's vociferous opposition leader Protest rallies were held in a number of Russian cities. In Moscow and St Petersburg they were not sanctioned by authorities. More than 180 people were detained across the country, reports say. Earlier on Sunday, Russian police raided the property of Mr Navalny's anti-corruption organisation in Moscow.A YouTube clip showed a broadcast recording from the office being interrupted,external. A spokesman for Mr Navalny said the officers used a power tool to break into the office, adding that they said they were investigating a bomb threat. Alexei Navalny has said that the upcoming Russian presidential election is ""dishonest"" The demonstrations come after weeks of pressure on Mr Navalny's supporters across Russia, who have faced detentions and had leaflets in support of the rallies confiscated. Mr Navalny's supporters attend a rally in the city of Vladivostok calling for a boycott of the election Mr Navalny, who insists he would beat Mr Putin in a fair fight, is barred from running in the ballot over a criminal conviction that he says is politically motivated. The opposition leader led mass street protests against Mr Putin in the winter of 2011-12 and was arrested three times in 2017 for organising unauthorised anti-Putin protests. Mr Putin, who refuses to mention Mr Navalny by name, retains a massive approval rating in Russia and is widely expected to win a fourth six-year term in office.

"Conditions at Lochnagar have deteriorated since this picture was taken by pilot Mark Farquhar on Friday morning A body has been found in the search for a hillwalker in Lochnagar. Police confirmed a body was found at about 12:00 on Sunday after a search which started on Friday night. More than 80 people were involved in the operation to find the 65-year-old who had been missing for two nights on the mountain in the Grampians.

""It is sad to learn that someone has succumbed to the elements. Our thoughts are with family and friends at this time."" Earlier, police revealed that the hillwalker raised the alarm himself by phone on Friday. He was sighted that afternoon on a path ascending Lochnagar but contact was lost that evening. Insp Matt Smith, of Police Scotland, said: ""We got a couple of phone calls through to him on the night but we've had very limited contact and we've had pretty much no contact since the night itself. ""The weather conditions up there were absolutely atrocious. A lot of the videos of what we were up against have appeared on social media in terms of the blizzards and the wind.

Mountain rescue teams from Braemar and Aberdeen were joined by colleagues from Tayside. Rescue volunteers from Cumbria who were training in the area have also been involved.

"The recent death of an actor known for his roles in Maid Marian And Her Merry Men and Brush Strokes is being investigated by police. Howard Lew Lewis, who also appeared in Blackadder, died on 20 January in an Edinburgh hospital, aged 76. His daughter Debora Milazzo claims he had been placed on a regime of high-dose sedatives and maximum-strength opiate painkillers. Police Scotland confirmed it was investigating the complaint. The death is being treated as ""unexplained"". The actor, known as Lewy, died in Ellen's Glen House, a community hospital in Edinburgh just over a week ago. He was being treated for dementia. Ms Milazzo told the BBC Scotland News website: ""I'm trying to get justice for my dad. ""I want Police Scotland to investigate my dad's case."" She claims Mr Lewis had been needlessly placed on the kind of treatment plan that would be prescribed for the terminal phase of a malignant disease. Ms Milazzo insisted her father had not received a terminal diagnosis. She said: ""My father didn't have cancer, he didn't have heart disease. Lew Lewis, back, with Maid Marian co-stars (left to right) Tony Robinson, Danny John-Jules, Kate Lonergan, Wayne Morris and Mike Edmonds ""They suddenly just changed his medication and it was the new medication that killed him."" A Police Scotland spokesman said: ""Police in Edinburgh are investigating following the death of a 76-year-old man in the Carnbee Avenue area on Saturday 20 January. ""The death is being treated as unexplained, but not suspicious. A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.""

"The search for Polish climber Tomasz Mackiewicz has been called off A French climber stranded on one of Pakistan's most deadly Himalayan mountains has been flown to hospital after a dramatic rescue operation. But the search for Elisabeth Revol's Polish climbing partner was called off. Ms Revol and Tomasz Mackiewicz were climbing Nanga Parbat, nicknamed ""Killer Mountain"", when they got stuck at 7,400m (24,280ft) on Friday. An elite Polish climbing team on nearby K2 came to the rescue, scaling Nanga Parbat overnight to rescue Ms Revol. ""Elisabeth is in the hospital in Islamabad. She has severe frostbite on her hands and feet,"" Ludovic Giambiasi, a friend of Ms Revol, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday. Allow Facebook content?

Four members of the Polish team, who had been attempting the first winter ascent of K2 - the second highest mountain in the world - were brought to Nanga Parbat by a Pakistani military helicopter. They were dropped off more than 1,000 metres below the lost climbers' last known location. Polish climbers prepare for a rescue mission on Nanga Parbat Denis Urubko and Adam Bielecki then began the climb in complete darkness, while Jaroslaw Botor and Piotr Tomala established a camp. After reaching Ms Revol, the team descended back to the camp - a treacherous journey that lasted about five-and-a-half hours. In the early hours of Sunday local time, the climbing team's Facebook page announced: ""Elisabeth Revol found!"" Ms Revol was then taken to hospital by helicopter. Mr Mackiewicz had been separated from Ms Revol. Earlier reports said that he had been suffering from frostbite and snow blindness. ""The rescue for Tomasz is unfortunately not possible,"" Mr Giambiasi wrote. ""Because of the weather and altitude it would put the life of rescuers in extreme danger. ""It's a terrible and painful decision. We are in deep sadness. All our thoughts go out to Tomek's family and friends. We are crying."" A crowdfunding campaign to pay for the rescue attempt had raised tens of thousands of dollars by the time the news of Ms Revol's safety emerged. Masha Gordon, who set up the crowdfunding campaign, posted an update to the 4,000 supporters: ""We are crying from happiness.""

Last year, a Spaniard and an Argentinean were presumed dead in an avalanche after they went missing trying to scale the peak.

"This video can not be played Scientists examine Bronze age bones from Northumberland field Forensic scientists have been analysing Bronze Age bones found in a field - but how do they work out who the person was? In September 2017, afarmer near Rock, Northumberland, preparing his field for drainagediscovered a burial cist - or stone coffin - containing a skeleton and a jug. Sanita Nezirovic, a lecturer in forensic science at the University of Derby, was tasked with finding out whose bones they were. She has looked at the remains of hundreds of people, dating from the Bronze Age to modern times. In each case she creates a ""presumptive profile"", detailing facts such as the person's sex, age and height. Sanita Nezirovic has been investigating the Bronze Age remains These are determined on the balance of probabilities: for example, if she has a pelvis and a skull of someone over 18, then she can be 90% accurate on their sex. In this case, Ms Nezirovic had the skull and various other bones which, from the state of fusion, she could determine to be an adult. A more specific age will be sought later. The bones had been largely preserved by some form of blanket, possibly horse hair, used to cover the body when it was buried. The body had been covered with some form of blanket, possibly horse hair, parts of which remain The first job is determining a sex. Looking at five points on the skull, such as the brow, chin and crest at the back of the head, Ms Nezirovic grades its features out of five, one being feminine and five being masculine. She is 60 to 70% satisfied the Rock remains belonged to a man. And he was a handsome one as well. ""The shape of his head is beautiful, and you can see from the teeth he would have had a perfect smile,"" she said. The person had a ""beautiful symmetric"" skull ""This was a good-looking chap."" Her next job was determining the age. The development of a flake of bone on the clavicle allows her to say he was aged between 17 and 21. The development of a flake on the clavicle provides a good indicator of age ""That's not a bad age range at all,"" she said. ""It's better than the 29 to 89 range, which might sometimes be the closest we can get to."" Next Ms Nezirovic attempted to work out his stature or height. The most complete remaining bone is the tibia, Measuring that and applying a formula to it provides a height range of between 1.72m and 1.79m. There are no obvious signs of trauma so it is not possible to say how he died. The Bronze Age remains were found in a cist in a field But, by looking at the area around the nose and forehead, it can be determined he was a Caucasian. And the circumstances of his burial would suggest he had been an important man. ""He was on his own, had a beaker buried with him and was covered,"" Ms Nezirovic said. ""All of these things suggest he was not an ordinary man; he would have been someone. ""He is absolutely stunning.""

"Conservative MPs have been offered tutorials on how to use Instagram, the picture-sharing app more usually associated with animals and brunches, followingcriticism of their social media strategy. Party chairman Brandon Lewis recently arranged a training session for MPs on setting up an account and ""creating effective content"". As more MPs sign up to use it, we followed as many as we could find to see what it could tell us about how they are communicating with voters. It's still a minority interest among politicians, relatively speaking. About 90% of MPs have Twitter profiles and the vast majority have Facebook pages, but only about a third use Instagram. Of those who are on Instagram, the accounts are not always updated regularly and tend to have far fewer followers than on Twitter or Facebook. Even MPs with Instagram accounts are not always active users Jeremy Corbyn has 149,000 followers on Instagram compared to 1.7m on Twitter and 1.4m on Facebook. Theresa May has 29,600 Instagram followers compared to 457,000 on Twitter and 548,00 on Facebook. The viciousness of Twitter and Facebook is well-documented.A survey for BBC Radio 5livefound at least 50 MPs had been subject to abuse during the 2017 election campaign, including ""co-ordinated Facebook attacks"". A recent report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life,externalincluded the finding that ""no female MP who was active on Twitter has been free from online intimidation"". But Instagram seems, at least for now, to conform to a different pattern. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

One Conservative aide says MPs find the platform ""more wholesome"", adding ""comments aren't necessarily a big part of Insta so it doesn't attract the same abuse and tone-deaf, campaign-y tweets which Twitter enables"". On a related note, Instagram is striking for being less relentlessly political than Twitter or Facebook.

While Instagram shares some features with Twitter and Facebook, the craze for posting pictures of food is perhaps its most distinctive feature. It's part of how users create the impression of their lifestyle - often highly stylised and aspirational. Some MPs have fully embraced this. Allow Instagram content?

As well as content provided directly by the parties, MPs also team up more informally. We spotted these two posts, by Conservative MPs Mims Davies and Sir Peter Bottomley, which look very similar. Images shared by Conservatives Sir Peter Bottomley and Mims Davies Bottomley's post was created by Jessica Zbinden-Webster, his assistant, who shared the idea with Davies' team. ""There is an MP-to-MP sharing of digital strategy taking place now which there wasn't a year ago,"" she told the BBC. There's nothing wrong with this of course - MPs, especially from the same party, have always collaborated and shared resources. ""The similar idea of sharing an MP's schedule on Instagram 'Stories' has been shared as an efficient way of keeping constituents informed of what their representative gets up to in Westminster,"" said Zbinden-Webster. Instagram announced in September that it had 800m monthly active users, up from 700m million in April, making it one of the fastest-growing social media platforms. Twitter has less than half that number, and hasrecently reported a very modest increase in user numbers. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Twitter also functions as a news platform, whereas Instagram focuses on the everyday details of people's lives - and as such it's a good place to lie in wait for ""normal"" people who aren't already political wonks. As Conservative MP Victoria Prentis puts it: ""It's a quick and convenient way of engaging with a different demographic of constituent."" The most popular politician on Instagram is Jeremy Corbyn. That's perhaps not unexpected given his party's popularity with younger voters, as well aspeople of all ages who use the internet more often. But the MP with the second highest number of followers, ahead of Theresa May, is the Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg. On Twitter he is only the 18th most-followed MP. You might not associate Instagram with Mr Rees-Mogg's brand of old-fashioned Conservatism. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

While he hasplayed down talk of a future leadership bid, having so many Instagram followers would certainly be useful, should he ever wanted to climb the pole.

"This video can not be played David Lidington, minister for the Cabinet Office, says the Conservative ""family"" should think about more than Brexit Conservatives must ""come together in a spirit of mutual respect"", a cabinet minister says amid backbench criticism over Brexit and policy direction. David Lidington told the BBC the ""left, right and centre"" of the party should look at the ""bigger picture"". One Tory MP tweeted: ""We need to get a grip and lead"" while another urged ""less policy making by tortoise"". Ex-cabinet minister Theresa Villiers joined those concerned the UK would remain in the EU ""in all but name"". Criticisms over the government's Brexit negotiations began on Thursday when influential backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg accused UK negotiators of being ""cowed by the EU"". Others were annoyed by Chancellor Philip Hammond's suggestion that changes to the UK-EU relations after Brexit could be ""very modest"". Trump 'would've done Brexit differently' Laura Kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface Davis plays down Tory Brexit row Rees-Mogg and Hammond at odds over Brexit But wider criticisms of Downing Street's direction were voiced on Sunday, amid newspaper headlines about ""Tories in Turmoil"", with backbencher Heidi Allentweeting,externalthat the party needed to ""get a grip"", adding: ""We are letting this country down."" The Conservative chairman of the education selected committee, Robert Halfon, said more needed to be done to tackle social injustice, telling the BBC: ""We need to have less policy-making by tortoise and [more] policy making by lion."" And fellow backbencher Nigel Mills, told BBC Radio 4 that progress in education had ""stalled"", adding: ""I think the frustration is that the prime minister had the right drive and the right belief when she came into office and it's hard to see how we're making progress on that."" But Cabinet Office minister Mr Lidington told The Andrew Marr Show: ""I think what I say to all my colleagues is the Conservative family - left, right and centre, because we're a broad church - needs to come together in a spirit of mutual respect, there are differences in any broad church, and look at what the bigger picture is showing."" The party was still ""neck and neck"" with Labour in the polls after eight years of government, as well as ""taking seats off them"" in local government elections, he added. Mr Lidington's message was echoed by Culture Secretary Matt Hancock, who told BBC One's Breakfast on Monday: ''The prime minister has shown leadership in a number of areas.... there are many challenges that Britain faces and we need to face them together and deal with them. I think we should pull together and back her.'' The UK is due to leave the European Union in March 2019, and among the key questions in negotiations between the two sides is how close their trading relationship will be in the future.

She told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""There is only so far you can go with compromise without ultimately finding yourself in a position where you're selling out all the people who voted to leave."" Although 29 March 2019 is the official Brexit date, the UK will continue to allow free movement of people, goods and money for about two years to allow businesses to adjust. The EU is seeking to tighten the conditions which will apply to the UK during the transitional period, according to a draft of revised EU guidelines. Mr Lidington said there would be ""big, big differences"" to the relationship during that period, and that Britain would have the option to move away from EU rules. ""The bill in front of Parliament extinguishes the power of the European Court (of Justice) and supranational EU law over the UK. ""We will have, from next year, a registration system we've not had before for EU nationals coming to this country. ""Of course we will have the power to choose for ourselves whether or not to diverge once we have left the supranational legal structures of the EU,"" he added.

"As many as 10,000 businesses in Japan are said to accept crypto-currencies. One of Japan's largest digital currency exchanges has said it will refund most of the $534m (Â£380m) worth of virtual assets lost in a hacking attack. Coincheck has promised to use its own funds to reimburse more than 46bn yen ($423m) to customers who lost their NEM cryptocurrency coins on Friday. The Tokyo-based company suspended trading after detecting ""unauthorised access"" of its digital exchange. Some 260,000 customers are said to be affected by the reported theft. Coincheck said on Sunday that the amount it has promised to return covers nearly 90% of the 58bn yen worth of NEM coins lost in the attack. After the breach was discovered on Friday, the company froze deposits and withdrawals for all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin as it assessed its losses in NEM, a lesser-known currency. The stolen Coincheck assets were said to be kept in a ""hot wallet"", which is a part of the exchange connected to the internet, as opposed to a ""cold wallet"", where funds are stored securely offline. The company says it has the digital address of where the assets were sent. As many as 10,000 businesses in Japan are said to accept cryptocurrencies. In 2014 MtGox, another Tokyo exchange, collapsed after admitting that $400m had been stolen from its network. Cyber-thieves cash in on Bitcoin boom Hack attack shuts Youbit exchange Bitcoin boom boosts graphics card prices Hackers broke in at 02:57 on Friday (17:57 GMT Thursday), the company said,externalin a statement, but the breach was not discovered until 11:25, nearly eight and a half hours later. Company chief operating officer Yusuke Otsuka said 523m NEMs had been sent from Coincheck's NEM address during the breach. ""It's worth 58bn yen based on the calculation at the rate when detected,"" he told reporters at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Coincheck Inc is based in Tokyo Coincheck then looked into how many customers were affected and whether the break-in had been launched from Japan or another country. ""We know where the funds were sent,"" Mr Otsuka added. ""We are tracing them and if we're able to continue tracking, it may be possible to recover them."" Coincheck reported the incident to the police and to Japan's Financial Services Agency. NEM, the 10th-largest crypto-currency by market value, fell 11% over a 24-hour period to 87 cents,external, Bloomberg news agency reported. Among the other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin dropped 3.4% and Ripple retreated 9.9% on Friday, according to prices seen by the agency. More was lost on Friday than in 2014, whenMtGox lost what it thought was 850,000 bitcoins. However, MtGox later found 200,000 bitcoins in an old digital wallet. After the collapse of MtGox shook the digital currency world, a licensing system was introduced in Japan to increase oversight of local currency exchanges such as Coincheck. ""What's the lasting impact? It's hard to tell,"" Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services International in London, told Bloomberg. ""Japan is one of the most pro-crypto trading countries, among the G-20. In Japan they don't really want a wholesale clampdown. So it will be interesting how Japanese regulators respond to this, if they indeed do."" 50 Cent discovers his Bitcoin millions Founded in 2012, the company is based in Tokyo, where it employed 71 people as of August last year. Its headquarters are located in the city's Shibuya district, an area popular with start-ups that was also home to MtGox, Bloomberg reports. Last year, Coincheck began running adverts on national television featuring popular local comedian Tetsuro Degawa, the agency adds. Kunihiko Sato, a 30-year-old customer from Tokyo, told Kyodo he had deposited about 500,000 yen ($4,600), into his account with the exchange. ""I never thought this kind of thing would happen with Japan's developed legislation,"" he said. Whereas money is printed by governments or traditional banks, digital currencies are generated  through a complex process known as ""mining"". Transactions are then monitored by a network of computers across the world using a technology called blockchain. There are thousands of them, largely existing online, unlike the notes or coins in your pocket. It may be more useful to think of them as assets, rather than digital cash. The vast majority of Bitcoin holders, for instance, appear to be investors. But the anonymity that cryptocurrencies afford has also attracted criminals.

"The search for Polish climber Tomasz Mackiewicz has been called off A French climber stranded on one of Pakistan's most deadly Himalayan mountains has been flown to hospital after a dramatic rescue operation. But the search for Elisabeth Revol's Polish climbing partner was called off. Ms Revol and Tomasz Mackiewicz were climbing Nanga Parbat, nicknamed ""Killer Mountain"", when they got stuck at 7,400m (24,280ft) on Friday. An elite Polish climbing team on nearby K2 came to the rescue, scaling Nanga Parbat overnight to rescue Ms Revol. ""Elisabeth is in the hospital in Islamabad. She has severe frostbite on her hands and feet,"" Ludovic Giambiasi, a friend of Ms Revol, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday. Allow Facebook content?

Four members of the Polish team, who had been attempting the first winter ascent of K2 - the second highest mountain in the world - were brought to Nanga Parbat by a Pakistani military helicopter. They were dropped off more than 1,000 metres below the lost climbers' last known location. Polish climbers prepare for a rescue mission on Nanga Parbat Denis Urubko and Adam Bielecki then began the climb in complete darkness, while Jaroslaw Botor and Piotr Tomala established a camp. After reaching Ms Revol, the team descended back to the camp - a treacherous journey that lasted about five-and-a-half hours. In the early hours of Sunday local time, the climbing team's Facebook page announced: ""Elisabeth Revol found!"" Ms Revol was then taken to hospital by helicopter. Mr Mackiewicz had been separated from Ms Revol. Earlier reports said that he had been suffering from frostbite and snow blindness. ""The rescue for Tomasz is unfortunately not possible,"" Mr Giambiasi wrote. ""Because of the weather and altitude it would put the life of rescuers in extreme danger. ""It's a terrible and painful decision. We are in deep sadness. All our thoughts go out to Tomek's family and friends. We are crying."" A crowdfunding campaign to pay for the rescue attempt had raised tens of thousands of dollars by the time the news of Ms Revol's safety emerged. Masha Gordon, who set up the crowdfunding campaign, posted an update to the 4,000 supporters: ""We are crying from happiness.""

"Steve Wynn is a major figure in the casino world US casino mogul Steve Wynn has resigned as finance chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) amid sexual harassment allegations. A Wall Street Journal report on Friday alleged that the 76-year-old billionaire harassed massage therapists and forced one staff member to have sex with him. Mr Wynn has denied wrongdoing, calling the stories ""preposterous"". RNC chair Ronna McDaniel told US media she had accepted his resignation. Mr Wynn has blamed his ex-wife, whom he is fighting in court, for the ""slander"". ""The instigation of these accusations is the continued work of my ex-wife Elaine Wynn, with whom I am involved in a terrible and nasty lawsuit,"" the billionaire said in a statement that his public relations team sent to the BBC on Friday. According to the Wall Street Journal, which said it had interviewed dozens of people who worked with Mr Wynn, he is accused of engaging in a pattern of abuse in which he often harassed massage therapists while alone in his private office. The gambling industry giant paid $7.5m (Â£5.2m) to one manicurist who alleged she had been forced into sex by Mr Wynn, the paper claims citing court documents. Why does the US have so many sexual harassment cases? Female employees would fake appointments in order to avoid seeing him, or enlist others to pretend to be their assistants in order to avoid being alone with him. Some would even hide in bathrooms or closets if they heard he was coming to their salon, the paper claimed. Mr Wynn is also a Republican Party donor and fundraiser. After harassment allegations were made against Hollywood executive producer Harvey Weinstein last year, Ms McDaniel and other leading Republicans called for the Democratic Party to return his donations. Now some Democrats are asking if the same rules should apply regarding allegations against Mr Wynn. The Democratic National Committee has attacked the RNC for remaining silent. In an October statement, Ms McDaniel wrote: ""If Democrats and the DNC truly stand up for women like they say they do, then returning this dirty money should be a no brainer."" Steve Wynn and second wife, Andrea Hissom, at President Trump's inauguration The son of an East Coast bingo parlour operator, he is now worth an estimated $3.5bn, according to Forbes magazine He made his fortune in construction and operation of major Las Vegas casinos, including the Golden Nugget, The Mirage, Treasure Island and the Bellagio, all of which he later sold to MGM Grand Inc He has been locked in legal battles with his ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, for more than seven years.

"Funerals for the victims took place on Saturday and Sunday More than 100 people are now known to have been killed in a suicide bombing on Saturday in Kabul. Attackers drove an ambulance past a police checkpoint to get to a crowded street in a district full of government buildings and embassies. Afghanistan's government has declared a day of mourning for Sunday, as funerals take place and relatives search hospitals for survivors. The Taliban - a hardline Islamist group - said it was behind the attack. It was the deadliest attack in Afghanistan for months and took place a week after an attack on a Kabul hotel in which 22 people were killed. Who are the Taliban? Four days behind the Taliban front line Interior minister Wais Barmak said a number of people died in hospital overnight and the death toll now stood at 103, with 235 wounded. Most of the injured are men. Witnesses say the area - also home to offices of the European Union, a hospital anda shopping zone known as Chicken Street- was crowded with people when the bomb exploded on Saturday at about 12:15 local time (08:45 GMT). Nasrat Rahimi, deputy spokesperson for the Interior Ministry, said the attacker got through a security checkpoint after telling police he was taking a patient to nearby Jamhuriat hospital. He detonated the bomb at a second checkpoint, said Mr Rahimi. The International Committee of the Red Cross said the use of an ambulance was ""harrowing"". This video can not be played WATCH: How the attack unfolded A Taliban spokesman later linked the attack to US efforts to assist Afghan forces with troops and air strikes. In a statement, Zabihullah Mujahid said: ""If you go ahead with a policy of aggression and speak from the barrel of a gun, don't expect Afghans to grow flowers in response."" By BBC Pakistan Correspondent Secunder Kermani Outside the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital in central Kabul a middle-aged women breaks down in tears, screaming hysterically: ""Mother, mother!"" A young man, a bandage around his hand, is trying to console her - but is sobbing furiously himself. Every few minutes a hospital official announces a name on a loudspeaker, and an anxious relative rushes to enter the hospital building to get an update about his or her relative. As well as sorrow, there's anger in Kabul. One man standing outside another hospital tells me he blames the government for not doing more to stop this attack and the many others that have preceded it over the past year. Kabul used to be one of the most secure places in the country - now it increasingly feels like one of the most dangerous. Back at the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, a man is making his way to the morgue to look for his cousin's body. He tells me they've already seen dozens of corpses in different hospitals. He doesn't find his cousin's remains here either, and so sets off to continue his search. The Afghan government has condemned the bombing as a crime against humanity, and accused Pakistan of providing support to the attackers. The Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan and parts of neighbouring Pakistan. Pakistan denies supporting militants that carry out attacks in Afghanistan. This month,the US cut its security aid to Pakistan, saying it had failed to take action against terrorist networks on its soil. US President Donald Trump condemned the attack and said it ""renews our resolve and that of our Afghan partners"".

"This video can not be played From 2018: Five things to know about Ingvar Kamprad, founder of Ikea The Swedish founder of the Ikea furniture chain, Ingvar Kamprad, has died at the age of 91, the company has announced. Mr Kamprad - who pioneered flat-pack furniture - died at his home in SmÃ¥land, Ikea confirmed in a statement. The company said that Mr Kamprad was ""one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the 20th century"". The billionaire, who was born in 1926 in SmÃ¥land, founded Ikea at the age of 17. He used some money his father had given him as a gift for performing well at school despite his dyslexia. In the later years of his life, Mr Kamprad faced questions over his past links to fascist groups - something he admitted, but said was a ""mistake"". World reacts to Ikea founder's death Ingvar Kamprad said there were ""many reasons"" why he loved his business In a statement on Sunday, Ikea said that Mr Kamprad had ""peacefully passed away at his home"". ""He worked until the very end of his life, staying true to his own motto that most things remain to be done,"" it added. Mr Kamprad eventually stepped down from the company's board in 2013, at the age of 87. ""Ingvar Kamprad was a great entrepreneur of the typical southern Swedish kind - hardworking and stubborn, with a lot of warmth and a playful twinkle in his eye,"" the company said. His company's designs became popular in part because of their simplicity and value. Mr Kamprad is reported to have come up with the idea of flat-pack furniture after watching an employee remove the legs from a table in order to fit it into a customer's car. Is Ikea the Marmite of retailers? How Ikea's Billy took over the world Furniture designer Jeff Banks said that Mr Kamprad's creations radically changed how people made and designed products for the home. ""People have tried to reproduce and copy that, but unsuccessfully,"" he said. Mr Banks added that the designs produced and sold through the retailer made good use of recyclable products, adding that Mr Kamprad was ""head and shoulders above the rest"". Ikea has expanded to operate all around the world, including in China Mr Kamprad was renowned for his devotion to frugality, reportedly driving an old Volvo and travelling by economy class. In a 2016 interview with Swedish television channel TV4, Mr Kamprad said that it was ""in the nature of SmÃ¥land to be thrifty"". ""If you look at me now, I don't think I'm wearing anything that wasn't bought at a flea market,"" he said. He told the channel that he built his business on a ""local ethos"". ""We have SmÃ¥land in the blood, and we know what a krona is - even though it is not as much as it was when we bought candy and went to elementary school,"" he said, referring to the Swedish currency. People took to social media on Sunday to pay their respects to the ""greatest Swedish entrepreneur to have ever lived"". Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom tweeted her condolences, saying that Mr Kamprad had ""put Sweden on the world map"". Ikea started in 1943 and now has 389 stores worldwide The name comes from Mr Kamprad's initials (IK), together with the name of the farm he grew up on - Elmtaryd (E) - and the nearby village Agunnaryd (A) The company's retail sales totalled 36.4bn euros ($43bn, Â£30bn) in 2016 Its flat-pack furniture became iconic both for its affordability and for its picture-based assembly instructions Ikea has remained privately-owned under a Dutch trust operated by the Kamprad family. Its complex business structure has drawn controversy and the European Commission said last year that it had launched an investigation into Ikea's tax arrangements. The European Green Party said that the arrangement had allowed the company to avoid paying some â¬1bn in tax between 2009 and 2014. A spokesman for Dutch-based Inter Ikea, one of the company's two divisions, said that the company had been taxed ""in accordance with EU rules"". Ikea boss says it pays fair share of tax Ikea's fight against teen sleepovers In an interview in the 1980s, Mr Kamprad said that his vision for Ikea was that it would be a company that would make life easier for its customers. In more recent years,Mr Kamprad had faced scrutiny over his past links to Nazi groups. The tycoon revealed some elements of his past in a book in 1988, admitting that he was a close friend of the Swedish fascist activist Per Engdahl, and a member of his New Swedish Movement between 1942 and 1945. He said that his involvement was youthful ""stupidity"" and the ""greatest mistake"" of his life. But a 2011 book by Elisabeth Asbrink alleged details beyond what Mr Kamprad had previously admitted. She wrote that he was an active recruiter for a Swedish Nazi group, and stayed close to sympathisers well after World War Two. At the time a spokesman for Mr Kamprad said he had long admitted flirting with fascism, but that there were now ""no Nazi-sympathising thoughts in Ingvar's head whatsoever"".

"This video can not be played The BBC's Steve Rosenberg: ""We were standing right next to Mr Navalny... it was very dramatic"" Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been freed after detained by police at a Moscow rally in support of a presidential election boycott. His lawyer told the press that he had been released without charge but will have to appear in court at a later date and may then face charges. Earlier, police raided his offices in Moscow, reportedly seizing equipment. Mr Navalny - President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critic - is barred from standing in the 18 March election.

"1.1 million people, most of them Jews, were killed at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp in Poland Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticised a draft Polish bill to make it illegal to accuse Poles of complicity in the Nazi Holocaust. ""I strongly oppose it. One cannot change history and the Holocaust cannot be denied,"" he said in a statement. The bill, which is an amendment to an existing Polish law, would also make it illegal to describe Nazi death camps in Poland as Polish. It is expected to pass in the Senate before being signed by the president. The Polish charge d'affaires to Israel has been summoned by the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem. Poland was attacked and occupied by Nazi Germany during World War Two. Millions of its citizens were killed, including three million Polish Jews in the Holocaust. The country has long objected to the use of phrases like ""Polish death camps"", which suggest the Polish state in some way shared responsibility for camps such as Auschwitz. The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love Convicted Auschwitz guard pleads for mercy Auschwitz inmate's notes from hell finally revealed The camps were built and operated by the Nazis after they invaded Poland in 1939. Israeli officials are opposed to the proposed law, suggesting it will limit discussion of Polish involvement in the Holocaust. ""This is a shameful disregard of the truth,"" said Israel's Education and Diaspora Affairs Minister Naftali Bennett. ""It is a historic fact that many Poles aided in the murder of Jews, handed them in, abused them, and even killed Jews during and after the Holocaust."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he strongly opposed the bill But he acknowledged that phrases such as ""Polish camps"" were misrepresentative. ""It is also a historic fact that the Germans initiated, planned, and built the work and death camps in Poland. That is the truth, and no law will rewrite it. These facts must be taught to the next generation."" The Yad Vashem Holocaust Remembrance Centre in Israel said: ""There is no doubt that the term 'Polish death camps' is a historical misrepresentation,external. Yad Vashem will continue to support research aimed at exposing the complex truth regarding the attitude of the Polish population towards the Jews during the Holocaust."" The Polish government said the bill was not intended to limit freedom to research or discuss the Holocaust. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki tweeted that ""Auschwitz-Birkenau is not a Polish name, and Arbeit Macht Frei is not a Polish phrase"". Allow Twitter content?

"Steve Wynn is a major figure in the casino world US casino mogul Steve Wynn has resigned as finance chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) amid sexual harassment allegations. A Wall Street Journal report on Friday alleged that the 76-year-old billionaire harassed massage therapists and forced one staff member to have sex with him. Mr Wynn has denied wrongdoing, calling the stories ""preposterous"". RNC chair Ronna McDaniel told US media she had accepted his resignation. Mr Wynn has blamed his ex-wife, whom he is fighting in court, for the ""slander"". ""The instigation of these accusations is the continued work of my ex-wife Elaine Wynn, with whom I am involved in a terrible and nasty lawsuit,"" the billionaire said in a statement that his public relations team sent to the BBC on Friday. According to the Wall Street Journal, which said it had interviewed dozens of people who worked with Mr Wynn, he is accused of engaging in a pattern of abuse in which he often harassed massage therapists while alone in his private office. The gambling industry giant paid $7.5m (Â£5.2m) to one manicurist who alleged she had been forced into sex by Mr Wynn, the paper claims citing court documents. Why does the US have so many sexual harassment cases? Female employees would fake appointments in order to avoid seeing him, or enlist others to pretend to be their assistants in order to avoid being alone with him. Some would even hide in bathrooms or closets if they heard he was coming to their salon, the paper claimed. Mr Wynn is also a Republican Party donor and fundraiser. After harassment allegations were made against Hollywood executive producer Harvey Weinstein last year, Ms McDaniel and other leading Republicans called for the Democratic Party to return his donations. Now some Democrats are asking if the same rules should apply regarding allegations against Mr Wynn. The Democratic National Committee has attacked the RNC for remaining silent. In an October statement, Ms McDaniel wrote: ""If Democrats and the DNC truly stand up for women like they say they do, then returning this dirty money should be a no brainer."" Steve Wynn and second wife, Andrea Hissom, at President Trump's inauguration The son of an East Coast bingo parlour operator, he is now worth an estimated $3.5bn, according to Forbes magazine He made his fortune in construction and operation of major Las Vegas casinos, including the Golden Nugget, The Mirage, Treasure Island and the Bellagio, all of which he later sold to MGM Grand Inc He has been locked in legal battles with his ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, for more than seven years.

"Vila was the head of five generations, the safari park said. One of the oldest gorillas in the world has died at the age of 60. San Diego Zoo Safari Park announced on Friday that Vila, who was born in the Congo in 1957, died surrounded by members of her family troop. She was the ""matriarch"", they said, of five generations. ""There are very few gorillas anywhere near that age,"" said Peggy Sexton, a lead animal keeper at the safari park in California. Gorillas typically live for 35-40 years. ""She will be missed by zoo members, guests, volunteers and staff,"" said Randy Riches, mammals curator at the safari park. The oldest gorilla living in the care of humans is thought to be 61-year-old Trudy at Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas.

"Funerals for the victims took place on Saturday and Sunday More than 100 people are now known to have been killed in a suicide bombing on Saturday in Kabul. Attackers drove an ambulance past a police checkpoint to get to a crowded street in a district full of government buildings and embassies. Afghanistan's government has declared a day of mourning for Sunday, as funerals take place and relatives search hospitals for survivors. The Taliban - a hardline Islamist group - said it was behind the attack. It was the deadliest attack in Afghanistan for months and took place a week after an attack on a Kabul hotel in which 22 people were killed. Who are the Taliban? Four days behind the Taliban front line Interior minister Wais Barmak said a number of people died in hospital overnight and the death toll now stood at 103, with 235 wounded. Most of the injured are men. Witnesses say the area - also home to offices of the European Union, a hospital anda shopping zone known as Chicken Street- was crowded with people when the bomb exploded on Saturday at about 12:15 local time (08:45 GMT). Nasrat Rahimi, deputy spokesperson for the Interior Ministry, said the attacker got through a security checkpoint after telling police he was taking a patient to nearby Jamhuriat hospital. He detonated the bomb at a second checkpoint, said Mr Rahimi. The International Committee of the Red Cross said the use of an ambulance was ""harrowing"". This video can not be played WATCH: How the attack unfolded A Taliban spokesman later linked the attack to US efforts to assist Afghan forces with troops and air strikes. In a statement, Zabihullah Mujahid said: ""If you go ahead with a policy of aggression and speak from the barrel of a gun, don't expect Afghans to grow flowers in response."" By BBC Pakistan Correspondent Secunder Kermani Outside the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital in central Kabul a middle-aged women breaks down in tears, screaming hysterically: ""Mother, mother!"" A young man, a bandage around his hand, is trying to console her - but is sobbing furiously himself. Every few minutes a hospital official announces a name on a loudspeaker, and an anxious relative rushes to enter the hospital building to get an update about his or her relative. As well as sorrow, there's anger in Kabul. One man standing outside another hospital tells me he blames the government for not doing more to stop this attack and the many others that have preceded it over the past year. Kabul used to be one of the most secure places in the country - now it increasingly feels like one of the most dangerous. Back at the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, a man is making his way to the morgue to look for his cousin's body. He tells me they've already seen dozens of corpses in different hospitals. He doesn't find his cousin's remains here either, and so sets off to continue his search. The Afghan government has condemned the bombing as a crime against humanity, and accused Pakistan of providing support to the attackers. The Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan and parts of neighbouring Pakistan. Pakistan denies supporting militants that carry out attacks in Afghanistan. This month,the US cut its security aid to Pakistan, saying it had failed to take action against terrorist networks on its soil. US President Donald Trump condemned the attack and said it ""renews our resolve and that of our Afghan partners"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said: ""Indiscriminate attacks against civilians are a serious violation of human rights and humanitarian laws, and can never be justified."" In France, the Eiffel Tower turned off its lights at midnight on Saturday as a mark of respect for the dead and injured. Hospitals in Kabul struggled to cope with casualties from the bombing Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo wrote on Twitter: ""The city of Paris and Parisians are with the Afghan people who are once again facing terrorist barbarity,"" she said. The attack is the deadliest in Kabul in several months. In October, 176 people were killed in bomb attacks across Afghanistan in one week. The country's security forces in particular have suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the Taliban, who want to re-impose their strict version of Islamic law in the country. In May, 150 people were killed by a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. The Taliban denied any role, but the Afghan government says its affiliate, the Haqqani group, carried it out with support from Pakistan. Thehardline Islamic Taliban movementswept to power in Afghanistan in 1996 after the civil war which followed the Soviet-Afghan war, and were ousted by the US-led invasion five years later, but returned to run some key areas In power, they imposed a brutal version of Sharia law, such as public executions and amputations, and banned women from public life Men had to grow beards and women to wear the all-covering burka; television, music and cinema were banned They sheltered al-Qaeda leaders before and after being ousted - since then they have fought a bloody insurgency which continues today In 2016, Afghan civilian casualties hit a new high- a rise attributed by the UN largely to the Taliban Civilian casualties remained at high levels in 2017,external, the UN said Taliban kill 95 with ambulance bomb Ambulance suicide bomb: What we know.

"Coincheck representatives looked numb when they faced journalists One of Japan's largest digital currency exchanges says it has lost some $534m (Â£380m) worth of virtual assets in a hacking attack on its network. Coincheck froze deposits and withdrawals for all crypto-currencies except Bitcoin as it assessed its losses in NEM, a lesser-known currency. It may be unable to reimburse the funds lost on Friday, a representative told Japanese media. If the theft is confirmed, it will be the largest involving digital currency. Another Tokyo exchange, MtGox, collapsed in 2014 after admitting that $400m had been stolen from its network. The stolen Coincheck assets were said to be kept in a ""hot wallet"" - a part of the exchange connected to the internet. That contrasts with a cold wallet, where funds are stored securely offline. Coincheck says it has the digital address of where the assets were sent. Cyber-thieves cash in on Bitcoin boom Hack attack shuts Youbit exchange Bitcoin boom boosts graphics card prices Hackers broke in at 02:57 on Friday (17:57 GMT Thursday), the company said in a statement,external, but the breach was not discovered until 11:25, nearly eight and a half hours later. Company chief operating officer Yusuke Otsuka said 523m NEMs had been sent from Coincheck's NEM address during the breach. ""It's worth 58bn yen based on the calculation at the rate when detected,"" he told reporters at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Coincheck Inc is based in Tokyo Coincheck was still examining how many customers had been affected and trying to establish whether the break-in had been launched from Japan or another country. ""We know where the funds were sent,"" Mr Otsuka added. ""We are tracing them and if we're able to continue tracking, it may be possible to recover them."" Coincheck reported the incident to the police and to Japan's Financial Services Agency. NEM, the 10th-largest crypto-currency by market value, fell 11% over a 24-hour period to 87 cents, as of 18:30, Bloomberg news agency reports.,external Among the other crypto-currencies, Bitcoin dropped 3.4% and Ripple retreated 9.9% on Friday, according to prices seen by the agency. More was lost on Friday than in 2014, whenMtGox lost what it thought was 850,000 bitcoins. However, MtGox later found 200.000 bitcoins in an old digital wallet. ""In a worst-case scenario, we may not be able to return clients' assets,"" an unnamed Coincheck representative was quoted as saying on Saturday by Japan's Kyodo news agency. After the collapse of MtGox shook the digital currency world, a licensing system was introduced in Japan to increase oversight of local currency exchanges such as Coincheck. ""What's the lasting impact? It's hard to tell,"" Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services International in London, told Bloomberg. ""Japan is one of the most pro-crypto trading countries, among the G-20. In Japan they don't really want a wholesale clampdown.

The former leader has been living in Brussels since he declared independence in October, resulting in charges of sedition and rebellion against him. Mr Puigdemont is the only candidate for the Catalonian presidency. But the country's constitutional court has now ruled he cannot lead the region's parliament from abroad. Mr Puigdemont believes he was given a democratic mandate for his declaration of independence during a controversial referendum, which Spain declared illegal. The charges against the separatist leader are serious, and could result in 30 years in prison. Supporters of Mr Puigdemont had argued that he could carry out his role with the use of technology such as video links from Belgium, where he is currently living.

"1.1 million people, most of them Jews, were killed at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp in Poland Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticised a draft Polish bill to make it illegal to accuse Poles of complicity in the Nazi Holocaust. ""I strongly oppose it. One cannot change history and the Holocaust cannot be denied,"" he said in a statement. The bill, which is an amendment to an existing Polish law, would also make it illegal to describe Nazi death camps in Poland as Polish. It is expected to pass in the Senate before being signed by the president. The Polish charge d'affaires to Israel has been summoned by the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem. Poland was attacked and occupied by Nazi Germany during World War Two. Millions of its citizens were killed, including three million Polish Jews in the Holocaust. The country has long objected to the use of phrases like ""Polish death camps"", which suggest the Polish state in some way shared responsibility for camps such as Auschwitz. The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love Convicted Auschwitz guard pleads for mercy Auschwitz inmate's notes from hell finally revealed The camps were built and operated by the Nazis after they invaded Poland in 1939. Israeli officials are opposed to the proposed law, suggesting it will limit discussion of Polish involvement in the Holocaust. ""This is a shameful disregard of the truth,"" said Israel's Education and Diaspora Affairs Minister Naftali Bennett. ""It is a historic fact that many Poles aided in the murder of Jews, handed them in, abused them, and even killed Jews during and after the Holocaust."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he strongly opposed the bill But he acknowledged that phrases such as ""Polish camps"" were misrepresentative. ""It is also a historic fact that the Germans initiated, planned, and built the work and death camps in Poland. That is the truth, and no law will rewrite it. These facts must be taught to the next generation."" The Yad Vashem Holocaust Remembrance Centre in Israel said: ""There is no doubt that the term 'Polish death camps' is a historical misrepresentation,external. Yad Vashem will continue to support research aimed at exposing the complex truth regarding the attitude of the Polish population towards the Jews during the Holocaust."" The Polish government said the bill was not intended to limit freedom to research or discuss the Holocaust. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki tweeted that ""Auschwitz-Birkenau is not a Polish name, and Arbeit Macht Frei is not a Polish phrase"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played David Lidington, minister for the Cabinet Office, says the Conservative ""family"" should think about more than Brexit Conservatives must ""come together in a spirit of mutual respect"", a cabinet minister says amid backbench criticism over Brexit and policy direction. David Lidington told the BBC the ""left, right and centre"" of the party should look at the ""bigger picture"". One Tory MP tweeted: ""We need to get a grip and lead"" while another urged ""less policy making by tortoise"". Ex-cabinet minister Theresa Villiers joined those concerned the UK would remain in the EU ""in all but name"". Criticisms over the government's Brexit negotiations began on Thursday when influential backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg accused UK negotiators of being ""cowed by the EU"". Others were annoyed by Chancellor Philip Hammond's suggestion that changes to the UK-EU relations after Brexit could be ""very modest"". Trump 'would've done Brexit differently' Laura Kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface Davis plays down Tory Brexit row Rees-Mogg and Hammond at odds over Brexit But wider criticisms of Downing Street's direction were voiced on Sunday, amid newspaper headlines about ""Tories in Turmoil"", with backbencher Heidi Allentweeting,externalthat the party needed to ""get a grip"", adding: ""We are letting this country down."" The Conservative chairman of the education selected committee, Robert Halfon, said more needed to be done to tackle social injustice, telling the BBC: ""We need to have less policy-making by tortoise and [more] policy making by lion."" And fellow backbencher Nigel Mills, told BBC Radio 4 that progress in education had ""stalled"", adding: ""I think the frustration is that the prime minister had the right drive and the right belief when she came into office and it's hard to see how we're making progress on that."" But Cabinet Office minister Mr Lidington told The Andrew Marr Show: ""I think what I say to all my colleagues is the Conservative family - left, right and centre, because we're a broad church - needs to come together in a spirit of mutual respect, there are differences in any broad church, and look at what the bigger picture is showing."" The party was still ""neck and neck"" with Labour in the polls after eight years of government, as well as ""taking seats off them"" in local government elections, he added. Mr Lidington's message was echoed by Culture Secretary Matt Hancock, who told BBC One's Breakfast on Monday: ''The prime minister has shown leadership in a number of areas.... there are many challenges that Britain faces and we need to face them together and deal with them. I think we should pull together and back her.'' The UK is due to leave the European Union in March 2019, and among the key questions in negotiations between the two sides is how close their trading relationship will be in the future. This video can not be played Theresa Villiers MP: ""If you go too far with compromise... we wouldn't genuinely be leaving"" Former Northern Ireland Secretary Ms Villiers, who campaigned for the UK to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum,wrote in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalthat there was ""a real danger"" the UK would sign up to an agreement with Brussels which could ""keep us in the EU in all but name"". She told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""There is only so far you can go with compromise without ultimately finding yourself in a position where you're selling out all the people who voted to leave."" Although 29 March 2019 is the official Brexit date, the UK will continue to allow free movement of people, goods and money for about two years to allow businesses to adjust. The EU is seeking to tighten the conditions which will apply to the UK during the transitional period, according to a draft of revised EU guidelines. Mr Lidington said there would be ""big, big differences"" to the relationship during that period, and that Britain would have the option to move away from EU rules. ""The bill in front of Parliament extinguishes the power of the European Court (of Justice) and supranational EU law over the UK. ""We will have, from next year, a registration system we've not had before for EU nationals coming to this country. ""Of course we will have the power to choose for ourselves whether or not to diverge once we have left the supranational legal structures of the EU,"" he added. Meanwhile, former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps has urged the prime minister to ""name a date"" when she will stand down,according to the Mail on Sunday.,external Mr Shapps said he had not submitted a letter to the party's 1922 Committee, calling for a leadership contest, but added ""an increasing number of my colleagues have"". Elsewhere, in an interview with Piers Morgan for ITV, US President Donald Trumpcriticised the prime minister's approach to Brexit negotiations.

"""Rogue"" parking companies will be banned from accessing driver data and issuing charges as part of plans to stop ""unscrupulous operators"". The government has confirmed it will support new legislation aimed at raising standards among parking firms. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, said the legislation will provide ""fair, clear and consistent"" regulation of the parking industry. It comes as firms issue almost 13 times more tickets than a decade ago. Drivers' growing disquiet about the rules on parking are underlined by figures showing nearly 10,000 people approached the Citizens Advice Bureau for guidance on parking tickets last year. There are complaints of inconsistent practices, substandard signage, confusing appeals processes and intimidating payment letters, said the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. Private parking charges: Your rights MSP calls for private parking law change Conservative MP Sir Greg Knight's Parking (Code of Practice) Bill to tackle rogue parking operators is due for its second reading in the House of Commons on Friday, effectively guaranteeing its passage into law. Firms which don't obey the rules will be blocked from accessing drivers' DVLA records. This will prevent the firms from issuing charges, effectively forcing them out of the industry. Mr Javid said drivers have suffered for too long ""at the hands of dodgy parking firms"". He said: ""That is why government is putting the brakes on these rogue operators and backing new laws that will put a stop to aggressive behaviour and provide a simpler way for drivers to appeal fines."" The department hopes motoring groups and other experts will help the Communities Secretary to develop the code of practice. Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said the move would bring ""some much-needed regulatory rigour to the world of private parking"". He added: ""Drivers don't want a parking free-for-all, but they do want a system that is fair to all parties and that's what a code of practice set by government - rather than the industry itself - should bring about.""

Conservative councillor John Abbott said Banky's work did not compare with ""real art"" in the city gallery. ""I think that should be cleaned off. It should be photographed and the photograph kept because Banksy is not without talent,"" said Mr Abbott. ""But to compare Banksy for example with some of the real art in theFerens Art Gallery,external, which is quite mind-bogglingly brilliant at times, is, shall we say, to judge by two different sets of standards.""

People have been visiting the area since news of the artwork was announced leading to the area round the bridge being fenced off. One visitor described seeing the mural ""as a dream come true"". ""I've followed Banksy's work for many years,"" he said. ""Never thought I'd see one and actually stood in front of it. You find them in Dubai and places like that."" BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz described Banksy as a ""good artist and a genius PR man"". ""I don't think you can remove it,"" he said. ""I think the whole point of Banksy's work is they are what is called site specific... they work because of the places they've been put and if you remove the location the work loses its power.""

"Three teenage boys were killed when a car hit them near a bus stop in west London on Friday evening in what police have called a ""horrific"" crash. Two of the boys, who were aged 16 and 17 and had been heading to a birthday party, have been named locally as Harry Louis Rice and George Wilkinson. The crash happened in Shepiston Lane, Hayes, near a petrol station. A man, 28, who was in the Audi involved in the crash, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. The suspect was detained by members of the public, and was then taken to hospital for treatment before going to a north London police station for questioning. At least one other male is reported to have left the car following the collision. Police said they were doing everything they could to establish the full facts and trace everybody involved. A black Audi car is believed to have mounted the pavement before crashing into a lamp post The boys' next of kin have been informed, and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course. The victims have yet to be formally identified, the Met Police said. Other teenagers who were standing with the boys were uninjured. Friends who left flowers at the scene on Saturday said the teenagers were going to a 16th birthday party. Police were called to the scene at 20:41 GMT on Friday A crowd gathered on Shepiston Lane to pay tribute to the boys Staff at the nearby Esso garage said a group had been fighting at the entrance to the forecourt just before the crash. It is believed the Audi was travelling at high speed before it mounted the pavement just outside the entrance and travelled a few yards down the road before hitting a lamp post. Three energy drink bottles were left at the scene along with flowers One person who passed the crash scene said he saw friends of the victims help a fast-response paramedic get equipment from the car. Amamdeep Matharoo, 27, said: ""The lads were shouting on the phone. They were saying 'three of our friends are dead'. They were hysterical and in pieces."" Tony Kitchin, 44, who works as a security guard at a haulage firm nearby, said: ""This road is busy 24/7. It's a speed trap. ""I'm really surprised we haven't had more horrific accidents like this. ""No parent should have to deal with that. My heartfelt sympathies go out to the family and friends of the people who lost their lives last night."" Det Sgt Jane Shaw, from the Met's serious collision investigation unit, said: ""There are horrific circumstances that have resulted in three young people losing their lives."" She appealed for anyone who saw what happened to contact the police. Temporary road closures have now been lifted.

The boys, named locally as Harry Louis Rice, George Wilkinson and Josh Kennedy, died after a car mounted the pavement at about 20:40 GMT on Friday.

Detectives have not ruled out the possibility of more passengers in the car which is believed to have been travelling at high speed before hitting a lamp-post yards from an Esso petrol station, near to junction 4 of the M4. Det Sgt Michael Rapp from the Met's serious collision investigation unit, said: ""While the images are not of good quality, I am convinced that anyone who knows this male will recognise him.

"This video can not be played How the attack unfolded A suicide bombing has killed at least 95 people and injured 158 others in the centre of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, officials say. Attackers drove an ambulance laden with explosives past a police checkpoint in a secure zone, home to government offices and foreign embassies. The Taliban have said they carried out the attack, the deadliest for months. US President Donald Trump called for ""decisive action"" against the group after the ""despicable"" bombing. A week ago, Taliban militants killed 22 people in a luxury Kabul hotel. Witnesses say the area - also home to offices of the European Union, a hospital anda shopping zone known as Chicken Street- was crowded with people when the bomb exploded on Saturday at about 12:15 local time (08:45 GMT). Nasrat Rahimi, deputy spokesperson for the Interior Ministry, said the attacker got through a security checkpoint after telling police he was taking a patient to nearby Jamhuriat hospital. He detonated the bomb at a second checkpoint, said Mr Rahimi. The BBC's Zia Shahreyar, speaking from the scene, says it is not easy to get through the checkpoints. Cars are searched and drivers' identities checked. He adds that questions will be asked about how the attacker got through. The International Committee of the Red Cross said the use of an ambulance was ""harrowing"". MP Mirwais Yasini told the BBCthe area looked like a butcher's shop afterwards. He was having lunch at his family home, just metres away, when the blast went off.  ""First of all we thought it was inside our house,"" he said. Then he went outside and saw scattered bodies. ""It is very, very inhumane."" Who are the Taliban? Four days behind the Taliban front line How Kabul's Chicken Street fell on hard times Another witness, a software engineer who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC he was about a kilometre (two thirds of a mile) away when he heard the noise. ""I saw a huge flame,"" he said. ""The smoke was pungent. It entered my eyes and I was not able to see for some time."" He said when he moved closer he saw the dead bodies, and it looked like a ""brutal graveyard"". ""It was a terrible moment. [The area] is completely destroyed."" The Afghan government has condemned the bombing as a crime against humanity, and accused Pakistan of providing support to the attackers. The Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan and parts of neighbouring Pakistan. Pakistan denies supporting militants that carry out attacks in Afghanistan. This month,the US cut its security aid to Pakistan, saying it had failed to take action against terrorist networks on its soil. The injured and distressed were helped away from the scene In a statement, US President Donald Trump said: ""I condemn the despicable car bombing attack in Kabul today that has left scores of innocent civilians dead and hundreds injured. This murderous attack renews our resolve and that of our Afghan partners."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said: ""Indiscriminate attacks against civilians are a serious violation of human rights and humanitarian laws, and can never be justified."" In France, the Eiffel Tower turned off its lights at midnight on Saturday as a mark of respect for the dead and injured. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo wrote on Twitter: ""The city of Paris and Parisians are with the Afghan people who are once again facing terrorist barbarity,"" she said. The attack is the deadliest in Kabul in several months. In October, 176 people were killed in bomb attacks across Afghanistan in one week. The country's security forces in particular have suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the Taliban, who want to re-impose their strict version of Islamic law in the country. In May, 150 people were killed by a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. The Taliban denied any role, but the Afghan government says its affiliate, the Haqqani group, carried it out with support from Pakistan. More than 150 people were wounded in the bombing The area of the attack was a scene of devastation Thehardline Islamic Taliban movementswept to power in Afghanistan in 1996 after the civil war which followed the Soviet-Afghan war, and were ousted by the US-led invasion five years later, but returned to run some key areas In power, they imposed a brutal version of Sharia law, such as public executions and amputations, and banned women from public life Men had to grow beards and women to wear the all-covering burka; television, music and cinema were banned They sheltered al-Qaeda leaders before and after being ousted - since then they have fought a bloody insurgency which continues today In 2016, Afghan civilian casualties hit a new high- a rise attributed by the UN largely to the Taliban Civilian casualties remained at high levels in 2017,external, the UN said A plume of smoke from the explosion was seen around the city Kabul hospitals were overwhelmed with patients in the aftermath Ambulance suicide bomb: What we know.

"The prime minister of Ireland has told the BBC he will campaign for the country's near-total ban on abortion to be liberalised. Leo Varadkar had previously said the laws were ""too restrictive"". A referendum will take place this summer on whether to repeal a constitutional amendment that effectively bans pregnancy terminations. The wording of the referendum question is yet to be decided. Ireland's eighth amendment places the right to life of an unborn child on a par with that of a mother, meaning abortion is banned even when the pregnancy is the result of rape or when the foetus has a fatal abnormality. Campaigners have long called for the laws to be changed, and last year a Citizens' Assembly and a cross-party parliamentary committee both recommended removing the ban. Leo Varadkar profile: Ireland's youngest PM Abortion in Ireland: The fight for choice The committee recommended that abortions should be allowed without restriction up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy. The Republic of Ireland has a near total ban on abortion. In 2013, abortion was permitted for the first time in the country under certain conditions - when doctors deem that a woman is at risk of taking her life, or that her life is at risk due to medical complications. This video can not be played Claire had to carry her pregnancy to full term and describes her experiences The law does not allow for terminations in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a foetal abnormality. The law was introduced in the wake of the case of an Indian woman, Savita Halappanavar,who died in a Galway hospital in 2012 after she was refused an abortion. The eighth amendment to the Republic's constitution, introduced in 1983, ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn"". In what was known as the X Case of 1992, a 14-year-old rape victim was initially prevented from travelling to England to terminate her pregnancy. This ruling was overturned by the Irish Supreme Court and a referendum approved a further update to the constitution, stating that the eighth amendment did not restrict the freedom to travel to another state. In 2016, 3,265 women and girls gave Republic of Ireland addresses when accessing abortion services at clinics in England and Wales,external, according to UK Department of Health statistics.
