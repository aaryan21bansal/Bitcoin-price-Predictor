"Plans to reform the way people pay for social care in England have been voted on by MPs. The government's proposals were approved but it faced significant opposition from other political parties and some of its own MPs - with concerns that not enough is being done to protect the poorest pensioners. The reforms include a cap - or limit - on the amount people will have to pay towards their personal care. It will be set at Â£86,000. After this has been reached, the local authority will pay for the care. This does not include living costs such as food, energy bills or accommodation. MPs back change to social care cost cap funding There have been claims about how much these changes will benefit people - we've been looking at some of them. As well as the cap, people will be eligible for some financial help from their local council towards the cost of care. This is means-tested and will be available to people who need social careand have less than Â£100,000 in assets.,external If someone has less than Â£20,000 in assets, then they won't have to spend any of those assets on their personal care. Social care: Boris Johnson defends his plan amid criticism over the cost cap The question being discussed by the prime minister is when your home counts towards your assets. He's right in his explanation. If you are receiving social care at home or if you are in a care home and your spouse is living in your home, the value of the home is not counted towards your assets. That's called the housing disregard. If you go into a care home and you do not have a spouse living in your home, then the value of your home is counted towards your assets and you may have to sell it, although there are schemes that allow you to defer the costs, and for the property to be sold after you die. This is controversial because it is at odds with what the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto said. It promised that: ""nobody needing care should be forced to sell their home to pay for it"". You can read more about how the new system will work here But,as we've pointed out before, the government's language around this has shifted since the manifesto pledge. The Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said ""no-one will have to sell their house in their lifetime"". And Business Minister Paul Scully told Sky News today: ""There will be fewer people selling their houses and hopefully none."" The first thing to say about this claim from Labour's shadow health secretary is that this would only be the case if somebody was receiving social care in a care home - not if they were getting care in their own home. If they were receiving care at home or had a spouse living at home, then the home would not count towards their assets - under the housing disregard. If this wasn't the case, the rules mean that you would have to contribute from your savings and other assets towards your social care until you got down to having assets worth Â£20,000. This could include having to agree to sell your home in future. So in Mr Ashworth's example, if the Â£80,000 house was your only asset, you could lose three-quarters of your assets. And remember, these figures cover personal care and not other costs such as accommodation and food. People may be eligible for means-tested benefits to help with those costs. This piece was updated on 23 November to clarify the means-testing for social care support. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Health minister Jens Spahn did not mince his words when he stressed the importance of getting jabbed Germany's health minister has issued his starkest warning yet on the importance of getting vaccinated. ""By the end of this winter everyone in Germany will either be vaccinated, recovered or dead,"" Jens Spahn told a news conference in Berlin on Monday. Germany is in the grip of a fourth wave of coronavirus. Cases are rising rapidly and many hospitals are full. It has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe, with 68% of people fully vaccinated. Germany's infection rate is at its highest since the pandemic began, andhealth experts have warned this wave could be the worst yet. In the past 24 hours, there have been 30,643 new infections - 7,000 more than a week ago. This is among the highest rates in the world. Tighter restrictions are to be brought in whichwill see the unvaccinated excluded from certain venues, and some of Germany's famed Christmas markets have been cancelled. Mr Spahn said he was against making Covid vaccines compulsory, but that it was a ""moral obligation"" to get the jab because it impacts on other people. ""Freedom means taking responsibility, and there is a duty to society to get vaccinated,"" he said. The minister said the highly contagious Delta variant is driving the latest wave and that ""anyone who is not vaccinated will, over the next few months, become infected and lack protection"". In the news conference on Monday, Mr Spahn also promoted the US-made Moderna shot, calling it the Rolls Royce of vaccines, as high demand for the German-produced Pfizer/BioNTech jabs risked depleting stocks. He warned that some 16 million Moderna doses could expire in the next few months if they are not used. WHO very worried about Covid rise in Europe Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? The country expects the European Union to approve vaccines for children aged five to 11 by the end of the week.

"This video can not be played Watch: Witnesses recount how the Wisconsin parade crash happened Wisconsin officials will seek to charge a driver who ploughed into a Christmas parade on Sunday with five counts of intentional homicide. It comes as hundreds of people gathered for a candlelight vigil in Waukesha to remember those who lost their lives. Darrell Edward Brooks Jr, 39, killed five people, aged between 52 and 81, and injured 48 others, including young children, in Waukesha. Police say he was fleeing a domestic dispute when he mowed into the crowd. Waukesha police also said the incident was not an act of terrorism. Several school children and grandparents were among the victims. Warning: This article contains upsetting content. The victims named on Monday were: Mr Wilhelm Hospel, 81 Ms Virginia Sorenson, 79 Ms LeAnna Owen, 71 Ms Tamara Durand, 52 Ms Jane Kulich, 52 They include members of the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies, who are a regular fixture in the city's parades. ""Our group was doing what they loved, performing in front of crowds in a parade putting smiles on faces of all ages,"" the group wrote in a statement on Facebook. ""Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies."" Waukesha Christmas Parade: Who were the victims? Hundreds of people gathered in Waukesha on Monday night for a candlelight vigil On Monday night hundreds of people gathered for a candlelight vigil at Waukesha's Cutler Park to remember the victims. Braving freezing conditions, community members listened as an interfaith service read out the names of the victims and volunteers handed out sandwiches, hot chocolate and candles to mourners. Mayor Shawn Reilly told the crowd that the event was the ""beginning of many nights where we will grieve and mourn for those we lost"". Dozens of people still remain in hospital. Police said the injured were taken to six area hospitals by first responders as well as other residents who were at the parade. Eighteen children were admitted after the incident, the Children's Wisconsin paediatric hospital told reporters on Monday. Care providers described the incident as one of the state's largest mass casualty events involving children in recent history. Physicians said some children sustained serious head injuries and broken bones. The injured range in age from three to 16 and include three sets of siblings, medical staff said. Ten children required treatment in the intensive care unit. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee said one of its priests, multiple parishioners and students at a local Catholic school were also among the injured. Darrell Brooks faces at least five other criminal charges ""A lone subject intentionally drove his maroon SUV through barricades and into a crowd of people that was celebrating the Waukesha Christmas parade,"" city police chief Dan Thompson told reporters at a news conference on Monday. He added that an officer had fired shots at the vehicle, but had to stop due to the number of people on the street. This video can not be played Watch: Waukesha police chief gets choked up naming victims Police said they were responding to a domestic incident involving Mr Brooks when he fled the scene and mowed through the parade crowd. Earlier media reports suggested he was escaping a knife fight, but police have not confirmed those details. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper reported Mr Brooks is currently facing at least five other criminal charges - including for domestic abuse and battery - and had been released from jail on bond just two days earlier. BBC News has also reviewed the records belonging to the suspect. In a statement on Monday, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, said the bail recommendation in Mr Brooks' open court case was ""inappropriately low in light of the nature of recent charges and the pending charges"" against him. Mr Brooks is from the city of Milwaukee, about 24 km (15 miles) east of Waukesha. The parade in Waukesha - a community of about 72,000 located to the west of Milwaukee - is traditionally held every year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, and includes fancy dress, floats, dancers and marching bands. This year's theme was ""comfort and joy"". Families lined the sides of the road to watch the event, which was returning after a year's absence due to the coronavirus pandemic. Local resident Angelito Tenorio toldthe Journal Sentinel,externalhe had just finished marching in the parade when the SUV ""put the pedal to the metal and just [started] zooming full speed along the parade route"" at about 16:40 (22:40 GMT) on Sunday. ""Then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle,"" he said. Corey Montiho, whose daughter's dance team was hit by the SUV, told the paper: ""There were pom-poms and shoes and spilled hot chocolate everywhere. I had to go from one crumpled body to the other to find my daughter."" Sarah Saldivar, who was at the parade with her two young children, told CBS News she saw ""a red blur"" and then saw ""little girls flying through the air"". Video posted online showed the vehicle as it was about to hit the parade in Waukesha One video shared on social media shows the car crashing at high speed through street barriers, while another shows the vehicle driving into what looks like a group of musicians. Police officers ran down the street during the incident, telling people to take shelter in shops. Emergency responders and passers-by attended to injured people Mayor Shawn Reilly described the incident as a ""horrible, senseless tragedy"". ""I am deeply saddened to know that so many in our community went to a parade but ended up dealing with injury and heartache,"" he said. President Joe Biden said he was praying for the community and ""monitoring the situation very closely"". Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff across the state in honour of the victims. Waukesha's public schools were closed on Monday, and counselling services were made available to those affected. A community fund has been created to help victims of the incident.

"Councils across the UK are to be forced to care for some of the unaccompanied asylum seeker children who have arrived via the English Channel in small boats. Immigration minister Kevin Foster said the decision was not taken lightly but was in the children's best interests. Authorities will take children now being looked after by Kent and other councils on England's south coast. More than 100 children are living in hotels because of a shortage of places in children's homes. The change will see all 217 UK authorities with social services departments obliged to accept an allocation of the children. The Home Office said it was taking ""urgent steps"" to allocate places in care for asylum-seeking children. It has sent councils across the UK a letter giving them two weeks to present reasons why they should not accept them. The letter says they will not need to accept more asylum-seeking children if they are already caring for a number that makes up 0.07% of their general child population. The government will pay councils Â£143 per child per night under the scheme. Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said councils around the UK needed to ""play their part"" in offering accommodation to asylum seekers. The UK migrant dilemma - it's all about Brexit What happens to migrants who reach the UK? Migrant crossings to UK by boat triple 2020 total The vast majority of councils have already offered places to unaccompanied children, according to Nick Forbes, chairman of the Local Government Association's asylum, refugee and migration taskforce. But the Labour politician told the BBC he was ""very disappointed"" that about 15 to 30 councils - out of 217 - were yet to take any children. Mr Forbes, who is also the leader of Newcastle City Council, said some local authorities were reluctant to volunteer due to the ""chaotic asylum system"" and national shortage of social workers and foster care placements. It comes as the number of migrants to have reached the UK by boat this year has risen to more than three times the 2020 total. The Home Office said 886 people arrived on Saturday, bringing the 2021 total to more than 25,700. The figure for last year was 8,469. However, increased security and Covid restrictions have made traditional routes less viable for migrants and the overall number of people to have claimed asylum in the UK in the 12 months ending June 2021 was 31,115, a 4% year-on-year fall. The people who cross the Channel come to the UK from the poorest and most vulnerable parts of the world - including Yemen, Eritrea, Chad, Egypt, Sudan and Iraq. Under international law, people have the right to seek asylum in whichever country they arrive, and there is nothing to say they must seek asylum in the first safe country. It is very hard to apply to the UK for asylum unless you are already in the country. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the government decision to compel councils to take unaccompanied children was ""important"". He said it ""should reduce the unacceptable delays in vulnerable children, who have often experienced great trauma, getting the vital care they need"". However, local government sources say there are concerns about the funding councils - which are already under financial pressure - will receive. The Conservative leader of the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, Councillor James Jamieson, said: ""These new arrangements must continue to swiftly take into account existing pressures in local areas."" The home secretary criticised Scottish councils in the Commons on Monday for the numbers of children they had taken. Kelly Parry, an SNP councillor who speaks for the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, said they were committed to participating on a voluntary basis and were already providing a ""proportionate share"" of placements. If migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British port If they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take them Each country has search-and-rescue zones An EU law called Dublin III allows asylum seekers to be transferred back to the first member state they were proven to have entered but the UK is no longer part of this arrangement and has not agreed a new scheme to replace it.

"Bulb Energy, which has 1.7 million customers, has announced that the firm will be put into administration. It is the largest UK energy company to face difficulties following a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices this year. Bulb will become the first energy company to be placed into ""special administration"", where it is run by the government through the regulator Ofgem. ""Customers of Bulb do not need to worry - Bulb will continue to operate as normal,"" Ofgem said. ""Customers will see no disruption to their supply and their account and tariff will continue as normal. Bulb staff will still be available to answer calls and queries."" The special administration measure is only used if Ofgem is unable to find another company to take over an energy firm's customers. The regulator said it was planning to apply to a court to appoint an administrator who will run the company. Bulb said energy supplies were ""secure and all credit balances are protected"". Bulb is the UK's seventh biggest energy company and has 1,000 staff. It has been trying to shore up its finances for several weeks. Ofgem set up the Special Administrator Regime (SAR) for when an energy company goes bust but is too big to have its customers transferred to another firm. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? The aim of the regime is to stop financial failure spreading across the industry. Under the SAR scheme, the government can make grants and loans to the company while its future is sorted out. It could come in the shape of a takeover by another company, selling parts of its business or customers being transferred to another firm. Provision for special administration, owing to the collapse of a major player in the UK energy sector, has been part of the law for 10 years. It had never been needed until now. So, this decision will be a hugely significant moment in this gas crisis. But it is one to which customers of Bulb are being urged to respond by remaining calm and essentially doing nothing. It is written into the rules that a special administrator, unlike an ordinary administrator, has an obligation to consider consumers' interests as well as those of creditors who are owed money by Bulb. It means customers have short-term certainty that their supply, their current tariff, their credit balance and their bills will continue as normal. That means switching now would be a bad, and expensive, idea. Longer-term, some of that certainty diminishes as decisions are made about the future sale or wind-up of the company. Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that in effect it meant the ""taxpayer is likely to take the strain, so we might all end up paying a price"". A host of energy companies have gone bust over the last three months as wholesale gas prices have soared, affecting nearly four million customers. On Monday, Ofgem said British Gas would take on customers from Neon Reef and Social Energy Supply, which went bust last week. The two firms had a combined 35,000 customers. The UK's energy price cap - which limits what providers can charge - has exacerbated the problem, firms say. Justina Miltienyte, an energy policy expert at Uswitch, said the failure of Bulb signalled the ""tipping point"" of the UK energy crisis. ""Ultimately this demise wasn't caused by a badly run business model. Instead, Bulb was choked off by the way the government decided to structure the current energy market with the price cap."" But Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said Bulb's fall into administration should ""focus minds on how the market operates"" and ""why so many companies have been allowed to operate so recklessly for so long"". ""The government has had to step in to protect customers from a failure of unprecedented size, and it will have to use taxpayers' money to do so,"" he added. John Arnold, a Bulb customer for several years from Potters Bar in Hertfordshire, told the BBC he was ""not surprised"" by the supplier's struggles given the current market, but added he was ""more than a little disappointed"" they had gone into administration. Bulb customer John Arnold says it has been a ""good company to deal with"" ""In my experience they have been a good company to deal with. I like their green credentials and their tariffs have been very fair,"" the 69-year-old said. Deborah Davenport, from Easton on the Hill in the East Midlands, said Bulb's customer service was ""absolutely brilliant"". While renovating her cottage which involved installing solar panels and a new gas supply, Ms Davenport said there were a few ""hiccups"" with meter readings and bills, but added Bulb solved the problems promptly. Bulb was ""just really pragmatic"" to deal with, she said, compared to some other energy firms who she believes ""do not care about people"". ""I just thought I had a voice with Bulb."" London-based Bulb, which caters to 5-6% of the UK energy market, said the gas price crisis meant it was unable to raise the financing it needed from investors to keep on operating. ""The rising energy crisis... has concerned investors who can't go ahead while wholesale prices are so high and the price cap - designed to protect customers - currently means suppliers provide energy at a significant loss,"" Bulb said on its website. Bulb was founded in 2015 to compete with the Big Six energy firms and claimed to offer cheaper and greener electricity than its rivals. It grew quickly and launched divisions in France, Spain and the US, which will continue to trade. According to Bulb's latest available accounts, in the year to 31 March 2020 the company made losses of Â£63m. It also had a Â£55m loan facility due for repayment on 31 December this year. In September, Bulb appointed investment bank Lazard to look into restructuring options, which reportedly included a joint venture or merger with another firm, and a cash injection from existing shareholders. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here.

"A new store could finally fill a site empty for more than a decade - but the potential arrival of Home Bargains in Cardigan has divided opinion. Planning permission was granted for a supermarket at Bath House,but Sainsbury's scrapped plansin 2014. A planning application has now been made to create a 2,359 square metre Home Bargains store with space for 182 cars. Ceredigion councillors are set to debate the proposals. Home Bargains owner TJ Morris said it hoped the plans would create 100 part and full-time jobs, with a Â£6m investment in the local economy. Its ethos is to ""sell the best branded products at the lowest possible price"" and they are typically between 10% and 30% cheaper than elsewhere, according to the firm. Staff shortages hitting supermarket shelves McDonald's runs out of milkshakes However, former mayor and councillor Shan Williams is concerned money will leave the local economy if the store is granted permission. ""On the one hand it's nice to see something happening on this site, and it is a bit of an eyesore, but are Home Bargains the right people to come here? ""My biggest concern is the effect it will have on the local economy. We already have multinational supermarkets in Cardigan selling exactly the same as they'll be selling in Home Bargains. ""It'll have a detrimental and devastating effect on local business."" Sainsbury's scrapped plans to build a new store on the site She said she was worried that with people driving to the site and not into Cardigan to shop, it would ""cripple the heart of the town"", adding: ""They say they will undercut every other business by 10-30%. ""That to me is not fair competition. They'll wipe out the competition."" Shan Williams is concerned about what the store could mean for the town Hairdresser Cindy Rogers believes the plans could be positive for the town However, hairdresser Cindy Rogers believes it is good news. ""I'm very passionate about Cardigan and it's important to have shops like this coming to Cardigan to create jobs and get people to come to the town to use the shops that are there now,"" she said. ""A lot of people haven't got spare money for expensive things. It's a shop for everybody's pocket. I don't think it will have a bad impact on Cardigan."" TJ Morris declined to make any comment.

"An organisation wants to help farmers make the most of their land without selling Farmers could turn their poorest land into profitable assets under plans to help rural communities survive. Large-scale investment companieshave been buying farms across the countryfor afforestation - planting trees to offset carbon emissions. About 12 sites have been sold recently and the Farmers Union of Wales warned of a threat to culture and language. A new project called Stump Up for Trees wants to keep land in the hands of people in the area. The group is urging farmers not to sell up, but to look at carbon offset as an opportunity to use land unsuitable for crops themselves. Brecon carbon offset project Why are firms buying Welsh farms? A reasonbig companies outside Wales are buying up the landis to take advantage of Welsh government forestry grants, aimed at encouraging trees to be planted to  improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gases. In the Black Mountains, which straddle Monmouthshire and Powys, thousands of trees have already been planted on land so poor, even sheep do not wander on to its slopes. If they do stray here, it is a farmer's nightmare to get them back. There is some land that even sheep will not venture on to This is common land, but across Wales there are thousands of acres like this covered in bracken, owned by farmers, which is lying largely unused and unprofitable. But it is this land which the Black Mountains tree planters say could now become key to saving family farms and a way of life. ""We've seen the wholesale purchase and planting of farms by corporates. As a tree planting charity you'd think we'd think it was great, but actually we think its a disaster,"" said Stump Up for Trees' Keith Powell. ""If you destroy the local economy, there are no jobs, no community. It will also affect our food security and we need to have domestic food security."" Although trees are being planted to offset carbon emissions, there are concerns the loss of farmland harms rural communities He believes there is enough land in Wales for the country to maintain its food security and wants farmers to make the most of ""unproductive land"". The project is working with Coed Cymru, which provides grant advice to farmers. ""We are hoping to make it possible for farmers to have other choices (apart from selling to corporations) and farmers are really up for this from the number of inquiries we are getting,"" said director Gareth Davies. Underlining this is the fact London-based utility company UW has invested a large sum of money in the project. Chief executive Andrew Lindsay believes it is good marketing to be associated with a scheme which is planting trees while not damaging land that could be used for food production. He believes other large companies will come to regret buying up farms simply for carbon offsetting that could remain productive in other ways. ""We are definitely seeing big companies coming in with big cheque books saying we've got to plant trees, but its not going to work if it's all about money,"" he added. ""Trees matter, but people matter, the rural community is already under pressure.  We want to be perceived as a company that cares about communities."" NFU Cymru has backed the plans, saying it means farmers make the decisions on where trees are planted and livelihoods are protected. ""Wales has been exploited before, people from outside Wales have made significant amounts of money and we need to make sure people in Wales benefit from the opportunity that Wales can provide,"" said chief executive John Davies. Farmers Union of Wales county executive for Gwent and Glamorgan Sharon Pritchard said it was important rural communities kept a ""united front"". ""It's a massive threat. I was in Maesteg last week where we are talking in the last couple of years over 500 acres had been sold to an outside-of-Wales purchaser, so that grant funding is accessed by that person outside of wales,"" she said. ""That money is lost to Welsh agriculture. We are seeing it on a weekly basis, worries and concerns that prime agricultural productive land is being taken out of food production.""

"Boris Johnson was pictured enjoying the ride at Peppa Pig World on Sunday Boris Johnson has been criticised after he lost his place in a speech to British businesses leaders and referred to the children's cartoon Peppa Pig. Speaking to the CBI conference, the PM also quoted Lenin and performed an impression of a car. Halting his speech led to an awkward 21 seconds of apologies and paper shuffling from the Tory leader. Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, called the speech ""shambolic"". She added: ""No one was laughing, because the joke's not funny anymore."" A senior Downing Street source told the BBC: ""Business was really looking for leadership today and it was shambolic."" They added there was ""a lot of concern inside the building"" about Mr Johnson. ""Cabinet needs to wake up and demand serious changes otherwise it'll keep getting worse. If they don't insist, he just won't do anything about it."" A Downing Street spokesperson pointed out that CBI head Tony Danker had welcomed the PM's words on the private sector working with the government. PM defends social care plan amid cap criticism The UK migrant dilemma - it's all about Brexit Do more to end North-South divide, says CBI Mr Johnson's 25-minute speech to assembled business leaders focused on levelling up, but also took some awkward turns as the prime minister tried to fuel enthusiasm for hisgreen industrial revolution. After saying government ""cannot fix everything"" and that ""the true driver of growth is not government but the energy and dynamism and originality of the private sector"", Mr Johnson turned to CBI chief Mr Danker and said: ""Yesterday I went, as we all must, to Peppa Pig World."" He asked the audience for a show of hands for who had been to the Hampshire attraction, and after saying ""not enough"", the PM continued. ""I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,"" he said. ""Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. ""It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig."" This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister is asked if he's OK after talking about Peppa Pig in a speech to business leaders Mr Johnson added: ""The real lesson for me going to Peppa Pig World... was about the power of UK creativity. ""Who would have believed a pig who looks like... a Picasso like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC, would now be exported to 180 countries and theme parks both in America and China, as well as in the New Forest and be a business worth at least Â£6bn to this country and counting. ""I think that is pure genius don't you? No government in the world, no Whitehall civil servant, would have conceivably come up with Peppa."" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: ""Businesses are crying out for clarity. Instead, all they got was Boris Johnson rambling on about Peppa Pig. ""It is a perfect metaphor for Johnson's chaotic, incompetent government as it trashes our economy, but it is not worthy of a British prime minister."" During the section in the speech on electric cars, accompanied by a potted history of his career as a motoring correspondent, Mr Johnson launched into a seemingly well-practised impression of a car. ""[Electric vehicles] may not burble like sucking doves,"" he said. ""And they may not have that 'vrrrom vrrrom raaah raaah' that you like. ""But they have so much torque that they move off the lights faster than a Ferrari."" The PM then moved onto his personal10 point planto support businesses going greener in the future. But he made an ambitious jump when he appeared to compare himself to Moses as he ""came down from [Mount] Sinai and [told] my officials [about] the new 10 commandments"" - pledges includingmore investment in wind powerand hydrogen technologies. That was still less of a surprise than a Conservative prime minister, known for his quotations, turning to a Russian revolutionary to drive his point home. ""Lenin once said that the Communist Revolution was Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country,"" he told the crowd. ""Well, I hesitate to quote Lenin before the Confederation of British Industry, but the coming industrial revolution is green power plus the electrification of the whole country."" After urging people back to office, saying there were ""reasons why Mother Nature does not like working from home"", the PM then lost his place in his speech What followed was 21 seconds of silence, filled with the occasional mumble of ""forgive me"" and much ruffling of papers. But he returned to his script to talk about building up skills and the government'sIntegrated Rail Plan, which despite a raft of critical coverage, he claimed it would be ""transformatory"". After questions on other issues of the day - the government's announcements on rail, and criticism of plans for the social care cap - Mr Johnson left the stage. But later, before heading back to Downing Street, the PM gave an interview to a reporter, who simply asked: ""Is everything OK?"" Mr Johnson said he thought people had ""got the vast majority of the points"" he wanted to make and that the speech ""went over well"".

"Nicola Sturgeon and Douglas Ross visited the Bluevale Community Club in Glasgow Nicola Sturgeon and Douglas Ross have held a joint visit to a drugs recovery group in a ""united effort"" to tackle Scotland's substance abuse death toll. The SNP and Tory leaders agreed to ""put politics aside"" for their visit to the Bluevale Community Club in Glasgow. Mr Ross said he would not ""stand in the way"" if ministers look to trial drug consumption rooms in Scotland. And Ms Sturgeon said she is ""absolutely open minded"" about backing a Tory bid to put a ""right to recovery"" in law. Six ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis Johnson 'not in favour' of drug consumption rooms Drug-related deaths in Scotlandhit a new record high of 1,339 in 2020, with the country suffering by far the highest fatality rate of any country in Europe. The joint visit came about after the first minister challenged Mr Ross to join her in a working-class community, after he accused her of being ""out of touch"" - with the Tory leader responding with an invitation of his own to a drugs recovery group. The Bluevale Community Club in Glasgow's Haghill area is a facility which helps people with addictions, as well as seeking to divert young people away from drugs. The club's founder Kenny Trainer said he hoped it was not a ""one-off photo op"" by the politicians, but ""a turning point"" which could bring about change. Scott Sharp, 50, has been addicted to heroin since his 30s and has been on methadone for 20 years. Last month, for the first time in decades, he come off the opiate substitute in a bid to become completely drug-free. He told his story to the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Tory leader Douglas Ross during their visit. Scott said: ""I was using on top of my methadone prescription - street valium or anything that could take me away from myself. ""It was a case of getting prescription, going to the chemist, going to a drug worker, going to the chemistâ¦ I was just like a mouse on a wheel, going round and round in circles."" He told BBC Scotland he could have been abstinent sooner if his choice of treatment was better. ""I don't think I should have been on this for 20 years,"" he said. ""I think maybe a short term prescription should be fine, and then maybe be told about recovery cafes or whatever suits that individual person."" Ms Sturgeon said her government had committed ""significant additional investment"" into tackling the ""shameful"" level of drug-related deaths in Scotland. However she said she would ""readily acknowledge there is much more that we need to do to turn around what is an unacceptable toll that drugs are taking on communities"". She said: ""That is about faster access to treatment, it's about extending rehabilitation, both residential and non-residential, it's about supporting facilities focused on recovery and making sure we are seeing all these services in an integrated and joined-up way. ""Because behind all the discussion and terminology we are talking about human brings, real people and real families that are being torn apart by drugs."" Ms Sturgeon said she was open minded to a Tory proposal to enshrine a ""right to recovery"" in law, although she said she would need to see the detail of any proposed legislation. Meanwhile Mr Ross said he would back ministers in setting up safe consumption rooms, where people can take drugs in a clean and supervised environment. Previous proposals to set up such facilities have failed to progress, with the UK government - which controls key drugs legislation - opposed to them. In August, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he is ""instinctively"" opposed to anything which could ""encourage people to take more drugs"". However, Scotland's new Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain told MSPs that she could give ""fresh consideration"" to the legality of a ""precise"" and ""specific"" proposal. Mr Ross said: ""I still have serious reservations about drug consumption rooms, the legality of them and how you police them. There are serious practical problems, but I also believe that when four people every day in Scotland are dying as a result of drug misuse we have to look at all the options. ""If the Scottish government bring forward plans to have a pilot scheme in Scotland, I won't stand in the way because I want to look at all the evidence surrounding this."" The Tory leader said no party had a monopoly on the right answers to the drug deaths crisis, saying it was important to ""show there is a united effort to deal with this national scandal"". He added: ""On issues like this I'm sure people will expect us to leave our party politics to the side and actually work to deal with the situation in front of us."" It is a rare sight indeed. The first minister is not often seen shoulder to shoulder with the leader of the largest Holyrood opposition party. There has never been much personal warmth between them. It is, after all, only eight months since his party tried to force her from office in a confidence vote. Yes, they'll appear together at memorial events, in charity photocalls or in the line up to greet the Queen. But teaming up on a major matter of public policy? Not so much. That they have agreed to do so over Scotland's drugs deaths crisis underlines how serious the problem is. That the number of deaths has risen sharply on the SNP's watch means they can ill afford to reject ideas and political support from wherever it comes. For the Conservatives, this is an opportunity for them to be relevant, purposeful and potentially have some of their suggestions adopted by the government. That may not happen often in this session of the Scottish Parliament, where the SNP and Green partnership does not require the votes of other parties to get things done.

"Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. The PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. Under the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023: those with assets of less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay anything from these towards care fees - although they might have to pay from their income those with more than Â£100,000 in assets - the value of their home, savings or investments - will not get any financial help from the council those with assets between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 will qualify for council help, but will have to pay Â£86,000 out of their own pocket to reach the cap On Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246. Nineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead. The bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. What could care changes cost you and your family? Claims about social care fact-checked What are the challenges facing social care? Will the cap really fix the social care system? Defending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win. Pushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament. The Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a ""step in the right direction"" and ""an improvement on what we have today"". But he said its plans for calculating the cap were a ""big disappointment"" and ""not as generous as people like me wanted"". After a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like. But that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place. And on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable. The vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own. Read Laura's blog in full Under the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit. The threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to Â£100,000 able to qualify, rather than Â£23,250 currently. The governmentannounced last week,externalthat only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap. Local authorities will meet care costs beyond the Â£86,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded througha new health and social care tax. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care. Sally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was ""sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment"". ""The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,"" she said. ""It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this."" When asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I can't predict individual situations."" After the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: ""Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected."" But the prime minister said the new system would be ""progressive"" and ""much better"" than the existing one. ""Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of Â£23,000 or more - now you get support if you have Â£100,000 or less, so we're helping people,"" Mr Johnson said. He added: ""We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country."" Lorraine, pictured as a child, and her mother Roma Lorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent ""every penny that she ever earned"" on care. Despite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of Â£140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. She says for her mother, 83, selling her home was ""probably the worst thing ever"". ""She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,"" Lorraine adds. ""Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances."" Every adult receiving care will have an account measuring how much they spend on care fees from their own income or assets Those with total assets worth more than Â£100,000 will have to pay all the care fees themselves Once assets fall below Â£100,000, people will be able to claim means-tested payments from their council to help with costs If they cannot pay for care from their income, they will have to contribute Â£1 for every Â£250 they have in assets Care home fees - such as for food and rent - will not count towards the Â£86,000 limit but will be capped at Â£200 a week People with assets under Â£20,000 won't have to contribute to their care costs, although they might have to contribute from their income.

"Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. The PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. Under the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023: those with assets of less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay anything from these towards care fees - although they might have to pay from their income those with more than Â£100,000 in assets - the value of their home, savings or investments - will not get any financial help from the council those with assets between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 will qualify for council help, but will have to pay Â£86,000 out of their own pocket to reach the cap On Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246. Nineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead. The bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. What could care changes cost you and your family? Claims about social care fact-checked What are the challenges facing social care? Will the cap really fix the social care system? Defending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win. Pushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament. The Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a ""step in the right direction"" and ""an improvement on what we have today"". But he said its plans for calculating the cap were a ""big disappointment"" and ""not as generous as people like me wanted"". After a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like. But that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place. And on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable. The vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own.

"This video can not be played Watch: Witnesses recount how the Wisconsin parade crash happened Wisconsin officials will seek to charge a driver who ploughed into a Christmas parade on Sunday with five counts of intentional homicide. It comes as hundreds of people gathered for a candlelight vigil in Waukesha to remember those who lost their lives. Darrell Edward Brooks Jr, 39, killed five people, aged between 52 and 81, and injured 48 others, including young children, in Waukesha. Police say he was fleeing a domestic dispute when he mowed into the crowd. Waukesha police also said the incident was not an act of terrorism. Several school children and grandparents were among the victims. Warning: This article contains upsetting content. The victims named on Monday were: Mr Wilhelm Hospel, 81 Ms Virginia Sorenson, 79 Ms LeAnna Owen, 71 Ms Tamara Durand, 52 Ms Jane Kulich, 52 They include members of the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies, who are a regular fixture in the city's parades. ""Our group was doing what they loved, performing in front of crowds in a parade putting smiles on faces of all ages,"" the group wrote in a statement on Facebook. ""Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies."" Waukesha Christmas Parade: Who were the victims? Hundreds of people gathered in Waukesha on Monday night for a candlelight vigil On Monday night hundreds of people gathered for a candlelight vigil at Waukesha's Cutler Park to remember the victims. Braving freezing conditions, community members listened as an interfaith service read out the names of the victims and volunteers handed out sandwiches, hot chocolate and candles to mourners. Mayor Shawn Reilly told the crowd that the event was the ""beginning of many nights where we will grieve and mourn for those we lost"". Dozens of people still remain in hospital. Police said the injured were taken to six area hospitals by first responders as well as other residents who were at the parade. Eighteen children were admitted after the incident, the Children's Wisconsin paediatric hospital told reporters on Monday. Care providers described the incident as one of the state's largest mass casualty events involving children in recent history. Physicians said some children sustained serious head injuries and broken bones. The injured range in age from three to 16 and include three sets of siblings, medical staff said. Ten children required treatment in the intensive care unit. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee said one of its priests, multiple parishioners and students at a local Catholic school were also among the injured. Darrell Brooks faces at least five other criminal charges ""A lone subject intentionally drove his maroon SUV through barricades and into a crowd of people that was celebrating the Waukesha Christmas parade,"" city police chief Dan Thompson told reporters at a news conference on Monday. He added that an officer had fired shots at the vehicle, but had to stop due to the number of people on the street. This video can not be played Watch: Waukesha police chief gets choked up naming victims Police said they were responding to a domestic incident involving Mr Brooks when he fled the scene and mowed through the parade crowd. Earlier media reports suggested he was escaping a knife fight, but police have not confirmed those details. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper reported Mr Brooks is currently facing at least five other criminal charges - including for domestic abuse and battery - and had been released from jail on bond just two days earlier. BBC News has also reviewed the records belonging to the suspect. In a statement on Monday, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, said the bail recommendation in Mr Brooks' open court case was ""inappropriately low in light of the nature of recent charges and the pending charges"" against him. Mr Brooks is from the city of Milwaukee, about 24 km (15 miles) east of Waukesha. The parade in Waukesha - a community of about 72,000 located to the west of Milwaukee - is traditionally held every year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, and includes fancy dress, floats, dancers and marching bands. This year's theme was ""comfort and joy"". Families lined the sides of the road to watch the event, which was returning after a year's absence due to the coronavirus pandemic. Local resident Angelito Tenorio toldthe Journal Sentinel,externalhe had just finished marching in the parade when the SUV ""put the pedal to the metal and just [started] zooming full speed along the parade route"" at about 16:40 (22:40 GMT) on Sunday. ""Then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle,"" he said. Corey Montiho, whose daughter's dance team was hit by the SUV, told the paper: ""There were pom-poms and shoes and spilled hot chocolate everywhere. I had to go from one crumpled body to the other to find my daughter."" Sarah Saldivar, who was at the parade with her two young children, told CBS News she saw ""a red blur"" and then saw ""little girls flying through the air"". Video posted online showed the vehicle as it was about to hit the parade in Waukesha One video shared on social media shows the car crashing at high speed through street barriers, while another shows the vehicle driving into what looks like a group of musicians. Police officers ran down the street during the incident, telling people to take shelter in shops. Emergency responders and passers-by attended to injured people Mayor Shawn Reilly described the incident as a ""horrible, senseless tragedy"". ""I am deeply saddened to know that so many in our community went to a parade but ended up dealing with injury and heartache,"" he said. President Joe Biden said he was praying for the community and ""monitoring the situation very closely"". Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff across the state in honour of the victims. Waukesha's public schools were closed on Monday, and counselling services were made available to those affected. A community fund has been created to help victims of the incident.

"The green hydrogen facility will be based at Whitelee Windfarm in East Renfrewshire A wind farm is to become home to a state-of-the-art hydrogen storage facility which could eventually produce enough clean energy to help power the next generation of public transport. The UK government has awarded the project, based at Whitelee Windfarm in East Renfrewshire, Â£9.4m. It said the project would help Glasgow reach net zero by 2030. The cash will go towards developing the country's largest electrolyser, which converts water into hydrogen. The hydrogen produced can be easily stored and transported to where it is needed. Splitting water and capturing the released hydrogen requires energy, and the project will use electricity produced from the wind farm, the largest onshore farm in the UK, to create the gas. This video can not be played Watch: What is hydrogen energy and why is it important? One use for the hydrogen generated will be to support local transport. The facility is expected to make so much of the zero-carbon fuel that it could provide the equivalent of enough zero-carbon fuel for 225 buses travelling to and from Glasgow to Edinburgh each day. Greg Hands, the UK government's energy and climate change minister, said: ""This first-of-a-kind hydrogen facility will put Scotland at the forefront of plans to make the UK a world-leading hydrogen economy, bringing green jobs to Glasgow, while also helping to decarbonise local transport - all immediately following the historic COP26 talks."" And Alister Jack, secretary of state for Scotland, said the project showed ""how serious the UK government is about supporting projects that will see us achieve net zero by 2050"". He added that it had never been more important to ""champion"" projects like this, which embrace new hydrogen technology while creating highly-skilled jobs. The partnership, made up of ScottishPower, ITM Power and BOC, is currently going through the planning process for the new facility and aims to have green hydrogen available to the commercial market by 2023. Some argue that for public transport vehicles like buses, hydrogen is too expensive and electricity would be a better, cheaper alternative. However Dr Graham Cooley, chief executive of ITM Power, told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that hydrogen was particularly good for heavy vehicles ""where you value payload"". He said: ""You can make a vehicle that's very long duration - in other words, it can travel a long range without compromising the weight. ""If you want to travel a long distance using a battery, you need more and more batteries which makes the vehicles very heavy. You see vehicle manufacture now all over the world rolling out commercial vehicles based on hydrogen which have very long ranges and very short recharging or refuelling time."" Meanwhile, Friends of the Earth Scotland director Richard Dixon argued that green hydrogen should be reserved for ""special uses"" in industry, rather than mainstream uses like public transport. He told the programme: ""It's three times more sensible to use it [renewable electricity] as electricity rather than to use it to turn it into hydrogen - you've lost two thirds of the energy in making the hydrogen and then using it. ""We have such a desperate need to convert our homes to electric heating and to convert transport to electricity to get out of fossil fuels. That should be absolute top priority.""

"England's international travel rules will be reviewed in January, the UK's aviation minister says Robert Courts says the government wants to ""reduce testing"" and other ""restrictive measures"" Austria has returned to a full lockdown, despite protests in the capital, Vienna Protesters also clashed with police in the Netherlands and Belgium over the weekend, as cases surge in Europe and restrictions return Australia says it will begin significantly relaxing bans on foreigners entering the country, prioritising certain groups People in England aged over 40 can book their Covid booster jabs from today Stormont ministers will meet later to discuss proposals to help curb the spread of Covid in NI Edited by Hamish Mackay That's it for our live coronavirus coverage today. We'll be back with more updates tomorrow. Here's a look back at some of the day's main developments  The live page was brought to you by Hamish Mackay, James Clarke, Emma Harrison, Matt Murphy, Lauren Turner, Doug Faulkner, and Francesca Gillett. If you're just joining us on the commute home, we've got news about England's travel rules - the government has confirmed they will be reviewed in January. Aviation minister Robert Courts was speaking at the Airlines 2021 conference in Westminster earlier. Although travel rules eased last month, even fully-vaccinated travellersstill have to pay for a test- either a PCR or lateral flow - when they arrive home in the UK. ""We all want to see aviation bounce back,"" said Courts. ""We all want to reduce not just testing but all the restrictive measures. ""We're going to review the policy in January. We'll be looking to see what we can do at that stage."" The minister refused to say which aspects of the travel rules could be amended. Meanwhile Virgin Atlantic's boss told the conference that he expected flights on its important transatlantic routes to be
60% to 70% full in the weeks running up to Christmas, Reuters reported. The UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has been speaking to business leaders this afternoon at the Confederation of British Industry's conference. Asked for the advice he would give business leaders, Whitty says: ""We're still firmly in Covid, anyone who reads the news knows that."" He says the two ways businesses can help is by making it as easy as possible for employees to get vaccinated and their booster jabs. ""And then the second is we've realised the extraordinary importance of improving the ventilation of workplaces, not just for Covid but also for many other respiratory infections,"" he says. ""If we invest in that now, we'll both help the aftermath of Covid but also cut down on things like flu outbreaks in workplaces."" The average number of daily confirmed cases in the UK has bounced around since mid-July and has been rising again over the last few days. Today, a further 44,917 cases were announced which, although high, remains below the peak of last winter. The latest available figures for show there are currently more than 8,000 people being treated for Covid in hospital. This, again, is well below the January peak. Thanks to vaccines, fewer people are dying from Covid, but the seven-day average for Covid deaths is still 147 per day. Earlier this month, new rules came into force in England stating staff have to have two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, unless medically exempt, in order to work in care homes. We've already reported that some care home bossesfeared losing 8% of their staff. Now Hertfordshire County Council says almost 300 staff left their jobs in the county's care homes in the weeks before the rule came into force on 11 November, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. The county council says in a statement: ""Whatever people's reasons for leaving, we'd like to thank them for all they have done to help keep both older and less able residents safe."" Read more More than half of over-50s in England have now received an extra dose of the Covid jab, new figures from NHS England show. A total of 11,093,652 booster jabs and third doses (for people who are considered clinically vulnerable) had been given to over-50s in England as of Sunday - equivalent to 52% of the age group. England is the second UK nation to reach the milestone, after Scotland hit the halfway point last week. Not everyone aged 50 or over will yet be eligible for an extra jab - as people have to wait at least six months after their second dose before getting a booster. Over-40s are now being offered booster jabs across the UK.We've got more information here. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has condemned rioters after a third night of unrest  hit the country over anti-Covid measures. Rutte calls the unrest âpure violenceâ unleashed by âidiotsâ and vows to prosecute those responsible. âI realise that there are a lot of tensions in society because we have been dealing with all the misery of coronavirus for so long,â Rutte tells Dutch media. But he says that the riots, which took pace in several cities across the Netherlands, had ânothing to do with demonstrating"". ""This is a pure explosion of violence directed against our police, against our firefighters, against ambulance drivers.â He adds he will always defend the right to protest, but what he âwill never accept is that idiots use pure violence against people â¦ who keep this country safeâ. Around 145 people have been arrested by Dutch police during the unrest, which began after the Dutch government announced a new partial lockdown in the country. We've had the latest coronavirus figures from the UK government, showing another 44,917 confirmed cases. A further 45 deaths have also been reported. Meanwhile, a further 237,995 people received a third Covid jab - whether a booster or a third dose - on Sunday. The vast majority of federal employees in the US are now in compliance with President Joe Biden's vaccination mandate, the White House says. More than 90% of federal employees have now received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, while another 5% have received some form of exemption or extension. In September, Biden signed an order requiring all 3.5 million civilian federal workers to provide proof of vaccination by 22 November. A similar requirement was brought in for members of the military and people working in nursing homes, hospitals and doctor's offices. On 1 November the Pentagon separately announced that 97% of active duty military personal had received at least one dose of vaccine.

The new restrictions will also apply to hospital and prison visits, as well as to government buildings for used for education, immigration and tax purposes.

We'll be back with more updates tomorrow. Here's a look back at some of the day's main developments  The live page was brought to you by Hamish Mackay, James Clarke, Emma Harrison, Matt Murphy, Lauren Turner, Doug Faulkner, and Francesca Gillett. If you're just joining us on the commute home, we've got news about England's travel rules - the government has confirmed they will be reviewed in January. Aviation minister Robert Courts was speaking at the Airlines 2021 conference in Westminster earlier. Although travel rules eased last month, even fully-vaccinated travellersstill have to pay for a test- either a PCR or lateral flow - when they arrive home in the UK. ""We all want to see aviation bounce back,"" said Courts. ""We all want to reduce not just testing but all the restrictive measures. ""We're going to review the policy in January. We'll be looking to see what we can do at that stage."" The minister refused to say which aspects of the travel rules could be amended. Meanwhile Virgin Atlantic's boss told the conference that he expected flights on its important transatlantic routes to be
60% to 70% full in the weeks running up to Christmas, Reuters reported. The UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has been speaking to business leaders this afternoon at the Confederation of British Industry's conference. Asked for the advice he would give business leaders, Whitty says: ""We're still firmly in Covid, anyone who reads the news knows that."" He says the two ways businesses can help is by making it as easy as possible for employees to get vaccinated and their booster jabs. ""And then the second is we've realised the extraordinary importance of improving the ventilation of workplaces, not just for Covid but also for many other respiratory infections,"" he says. ""If we invest in that now, we'll both help the aftermath of Covid but also cut down on things like flu outbreaks in workplaces."" The average number of daily confirmed cases in the UK has bounced around since mid-July and has been rising again over the last few days. Today, a further 44,917 cases were announced which, although high, remains below the peak of last winter. The latest available figures for show there are currently more than 8,000 people being treated for Covid in hospital. This, again, is well below the January peak. Thanks to vaccines, fewer people are dying from Covid, but the seven-day average for Covid deaths is still 147 per day. Earlier this month, new rules came into force in England stating staff have to have two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, unless medically exempt, in order to work in care homes. We've already reported that some care home bossesfeared losing 8% of their staff. Now Hertfordshire County Council says almost 300 staff left their jobs in the county's care homes in the weeks before the rule came into force on 11 November, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. The county council says in a statement: ""Whatever people's reasons for leaving, we'd like to thank them for all they have done to help keep both older and less able residents safe."" Read more More than half of over-50s in England have now received an extra dose of the Covid jab, new figures from NHS England show. A total of 11,093,652 booster jabs and third doses (for people who are considered clinically vulnerable) had been given to over-50s in England as of Sunday - equivalent to 52% of the age group. England is the second UK nation to reach the milestone, after Scotland hit the halfway point last week. Not everyone aged 50 or over will yet be eligible for an extra jab - as people have to wait at least six months after their second dose before getting a booster. Over-40s are now being offered booster jabs across the UK.We've got more information here. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has condemned rioters after a third night of unrest  hit the country over anti-Covid measures. Rutte calls the unrest âpure violenceâ unleashed by âidiotsâ and vows to prosecute those responsible. âI realise that there are a lot of tensions in society because we have been dealing with all the misery of coronavirus for so long,â Rutte tells Dutch media. But he says that the riots, which took pace in several cities across the Netherlands, had ânothing to do with demonstrating"". ""This is a pure explosion of violence directed against our police, against our firefighters, against ambulance drivers.â He adds he will always defend the right to protest, but what he âwill never accept is that idiots use pure violence against people â¦ who keep this country safeâ. Around 145 people have been arrested by Dutch police during the unrest, which began after the Dutch government announced a new partial lockdown in the country. We've had the latest coronavirus figures from the UK government, showing another 44,917 confirmed cases. A further 45 deaths have also been reported. Meanwhile, a further 237,995 people received a third Covid jab - whether a booster or a third dose - on Sunday. The vast majority of federal employees in the US are now in compliance with President Joe Biden's vaccination mandate, the White House says. More than 90% of federal employees have now received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, while another 5% have received some form of exemption or extension. In September, Biden signed an order requiring all 3.5 million civilian federal workers to provide proof of vaccination by 22 November. A similar requirement was brought in for members of the military and people working in nursing homes, hospitals and doctor's offices. On 1 November the Pentagon separately announced that 97% of active duty military personal had received at least one dose of vaccine. Failure to comply with the order may lead to a range of penalties, including suspension. These figures are significantly above the wider US population, of which just 71% are vaccinated. Holidaymakers are being urged to use Â£132m worth ofunspent vouchers issued during the pandemicbefore they lose financial protection. The credit notes were offered by travel firms as alternatives to cash refunds when holidays had to be cancelled. The vouchers, backed by the Atol insurance scheme, can be used towards new holidays or exchanged for cash. But the regulator says the refund protection against firms going bust will end on 30 September 2022. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) also says travel firms would not longer be able to issue the Atol-protected cover after 20 December.

Speaking to the CBI conference, the PM also quoted Lenin and performed an impression of a car. Halting his speech led to an awkward 21 seconds of apologies and paper shuffling from the Tory leader. Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, called the speech ""shambolic"". She added: ""No one was laughing, because the joke's not funny anymore."" A senior Downing Street source told the BBC: ""Business was really looking for leadership today and it was shambolic."" They added there was ""a lot of concern inside the building"" about Mr Johnson. ""Cabinet needs to wake up and demand serious changes otherwise it'll keep getting worse. If they don't insist, he just won't do anything about it."" A Downing Street spokesperson pointed out that CBI head Tony Danker had welcomed the PM's words on the private sector working with the government. PM defends social care plan amid cap criticism The UK migrant dilemma - it's all about Brexit Do more to end North-South divide, says CBI Mr Johnson's 25-minute speech to assembled business leaders focused on levelling up, but also took some awkward turns as the prime minister tried to fuel enthusiasm for hisgreen industrial revolution. After saying government ""cannot fix everything"" and that ""the true driver of growth is not government but the energy and dynamism and originality of the private sector"", Mr Johnson turned to CBI chief Mr Danker and said: ""Yesterday I went, as we all must, to Peppa Pig World."" He asked the audience for a show of hands for who had been to the Hampshire attraction, and after saying ""not enough"", the PM continued. ""I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,"" he said. ""Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. ""It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig.""

""I think that is pure genius don't you? No government in the world, no Whitehall civil servant, would have conceivably come up with Peppa."" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: ""Businesses are crying out for clarity. Instead, all they got was Boris Johnson rambling on about Peppa Pig. ""It is a perfect metaphor for Johnson's chaotic, incompetent government as it trashes our economy, but it is not worthy of a British prime minister."" During the section in the speech on electric cars, accompanied by a potted history of his career as a motoring correspondent, Mr Johnson launched into a seemingly well-practised impression of a car. ""[Electric vehicles] may not burble like sucking doves,"" he said. ""And they may not have that 'vrrrom vrrrom raaah raaah' that you like. ""But they have so much torque that they move off the lights faster than a Ferrari."" The PM then moved onto his personal10 point planto support businesses going greener in the future. But he made an ambitious jump when he appeared to compare himself to Moses as he ""came down from [Mount] Sinai and [told] my officials [about] the new 10 commandments"" - pledges includingmore investment in wind powerand hydrogen technologies. That was still less of a surprise than a Conservative prime minister, known for his quotations, turning to a Russian revolutionary to drive his point home. ""Lenin once said that the Communist Revolution was Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country,"" he told the crowd. ""Well, I hesitate to quote Lenin before the Confederation of British Industry, but the coming industrial revolution is green power plus the electrification of the whole country."" After urging people back to office, saying there were ""reasons why Mother Nature does not like working from home"", the PM then lost his place in his speech What followed was 21 seconds of silence, filled with the occasional mumble of ""forgive me"" and much ruffling of papers.

After questions on other issues of the day - the government's announcements on rail, and criticism of plans for the social care cap - Mr Johnson left the stage.

"This video can not be played Watch: Witnesses recount how the Wisconsin parade crash happened Wisconsin officials will seek to charge a driver who ploughed into a Christmas parade on Sunday with five counts of intentional homicide. It comes as hundreds of people gathered for a candlelight vigil in Waukesha to remember those who lost their lives. Darrell Edward Brooks Jr, 39, killed five people, aged between 52 and 81, and injured 48 others, including young children, in Waukesha. Police say he was fleeing a domestic dispute when he mowed into the crowd. Waukesha police also said the incident was not an act of terrorism. Several school children and grandparents were among the victims. Warning: This article contains upsetting content. The victims named on Monday were: Mr Wilhelm Hospel, 81 Ms Virginia Sorenson, 79 Ms LeAnna Owen, 71 Ms Tamara Durand, 52 Ms Jane Kulich, 52 They include members of the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies, who are a regular fixture in the city's parades. ""Our group was doing what they loved, performing in front of crowds in a parade putting smiles on faces of all ages,"" the group wrote in a statement on Facebook. ""Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies."" Waukesha Christmas Parade: Who were the victims? Hundreds of people gathered in Waukesha on Monday night for a candlelight vigil On Monday night hundreds of people gathered for a candlelight vigil at Waukesha's Cutler Park to remember the victims. Braving freezing conditions, community members listened as an interfaith service read out the names of the victims and volunteers handed out sandwiches, hot chocolate and candles to mourners. Mayor Shawn Reilly told the crowd that the event was the ""beginning of many nights where we will grieve and mourn for those we lost"". Dozens of people still remain in hospital. Police said the injured were taken to six area hospitals by first responders as well as other residents who were at the parade. Eighteen children were admitted after the incident, the Children's Wisconsin paediatric hospital told reporters on Monday. Care providers described the incident as one of the state's largest mass casualty events involving children in recent history. Physicians said some children sustained serious head injuries and broken bones. The injured range in age from three to 16 and include three sets of siblings, medical staff said. Ten children required treatment in the intensive care unit. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee said one of its priests, multiple parishioners and students at a local Catholic school were also among the injured. Darrell Brooks faces at least five other criminal charges ""A lone subject intentionally drove his maroon SUV through barricades and into a crowd of people that was celebrating the Waukesha Christmas parade,"" city police chief Dan Thompson told reporters at a news conference on Monday. He added that an officer had fired shots at the vehicle, but had to stop due to the number of people on the street. This video can not be played Watch: Waukesha police chief gets choked up naming victims Police said they were responding to a domestic incident involving Mr Brooks when he fled the scene and mowed through the parade crowd. Earlier media reports suggested he was escaping a knife fight, but police have not confirmed those details. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper reported Mr Brooks is currently facing at least five other criminal charges - including for domestic abuse and battery - and had been released from jail on bond just two days earlier. BBC News has also reviewed the records belonging to the suspect. In a statement on Monday, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, said the bail recommendation in Mr Brooks' open court case was ""inappropriately low in light of the nature of recent charges and the pending charges"" against him. Mr Brooks is from the city of Milwaukee, about 24 km (15 miles) east of Waukesha. The parade in Waukesha - a community of about 72,000 located to the west of Milwaukee - is traditionally held every year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, and includes fancy dress, floats, dancers and marching bands. This year's theme was ""comfort and joy"". Families lined the sides of the road to watch the event, which was returning after a year's absence due to the coronavirus pandemic. Local resident Angelito Tenorio toldthe Journal Sentinel,externalhe had just finished marching in the parade when the SUV ""put the pedal to the metal and just [started] zooming full speed along the parade route"" at about 16:40 (22:40 GMT) on Sunday. ""Then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle,"" he said. Corey Montiho, whose daughter's dance team was hit by the SUV, told the paper: ""There were pom-poms and shoes and spilled hot chocolate everywhere. I had to go from one crumpled body to the other to find my daughter.""

Police officers ran down the street during the incident, telling people to take shelter in shops. Emergency responders and passers-by attended to injured people Mayor Shawn Reilly described the incident as a ""horrible, senseless tragedy"". ""I am deeply saddened to know that so many in our community went to a parade but ended up dealing with injury and heartache,"" he said. President Joe Biden said he was praying for the community and ""monitoring the situation very closely"". Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff across the state in honour of the victims.

"This video can not be played Footage of the parade shows a red SUV driving into a school marching band at high speed At least five people have been killed and more than 40 injured after a car ploughed into a Christmas parade in the US state of Wisconsin, police say. School bands and a dance troupe of grannies were among those marching through the city of Waukesha when a red SUV came speeding down the road. It hit dozens of people, including children. One person is in custody. The incident does not appear ""at this time"" to be an act of terrorism, one official said. Warning: This article contains upsetting content. The suspect appeared to have been fleeing another scene - possibly a knife fight - when he ran into people at the parade, the law enforcement official, who is familiar with the early findings of the investigation, told the BBC's US partner CBS News. It is unclear if the individual in custody was the driver of the vehicle. Local resident Angelito Tenorio toldthe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper,externalhe had just finished marching in the parade when the SUV ""put the pedal to the metal and just [started] zooming full speed along the parade route"" at about 16:40 (22:40 GMT) on Sunday.

Jason Kellner told the New York Times newspaper he had just watched his son go past with his school marching band when the car came towards the crowd and ""started mowing people down"". ""I've never felt a worse feeling; wondering what I'm going to find when I get to my kid,"" he said. Mr Kellner found his son standing unharmed at the side of the road, but saw several injured people and pulled a bloody saxophone off the street.

"Naomi Long says it would be ""inappropriate"" for her department to oversee face covering compliance Businesses need to ""step up"" and help ensure the use of face coverings in their premises, Justice Minister Naomi Long has said. Aa health paperhas suggested Mrs Long's department should oversee plans to raise compliance levels above 80%. The minister said her department did not have enforcement powers, adding personal responsibility was needed. She said there should be a ""co-ordinated effort"" across departments to encourage greater usage. The Alliance Party leader said the public needed to take ""personal responsibility"" for the wearing of face masks and adhering to other public health messaging such as maintaining hand hygiene and doing regular lateral flow tests. ""If we turn this into a just justice issue, then the automatic presumption is that it is for the police to enforce and it isn't that simple,"" the minister told BBC 's Evening Extra programme. ""We all have to take personal responsibility. ""Businesses need to step up too and say we will not grant admission to our premises, whether it's a retail environment or whether it's a cafe or restaurant, and say we will not grant admission unless you wear a mask and do the things we're asking you to do. ""Then if customers are difficult or abusive, that's the time the police can come in and enforce, but we cant reasonably expect the police to be in every shop, in every coffee shop, in every restaurant and in every setting."" Since summer 2020,customers have been required to wear face masks in shops, on public transport and in a number of indoor settings- unless they are exempt. Health Minister Robin Swann circulated a document to executive ministers last week with a range of proposals aimed at reducing transmission of the virus. In it, he suggested that Mrs Long should ""take the lead in pursuing a minimum of 80% adherence to face coverings requirements, to gather evidence of this for the executive and to report of the number of fixed penalty notices issued"". Health officials say they are worried about a drop in compliance with face covering rules Mrs Long said she did not ""have a team of enforcers to send out even if I had the authority to do so, so it's not that simple"". ""There are a number of bodies that have an enforcement role, for example, the PSNI has a role, local councils have a role, the Health and Safety Executive has a role across the board,"" she added. Executive to discuss Swann's Covid-19 proposals Health minister advises more working from home Tougher Covid rules 'could be needed by Christmas' NI ministers vote in favour of Covid passports Stormont Executive ministers met on Monday to discuss the paper from the Department of Health. Mrs Long said it was ""not unusual"" for departments to write a paper and then for other departments to give feedback and the paper be amended. She said the issue had become a ""storm in a teacup"". ""The difficulty then comes when that paper is leaked and it looks as though there is a row between the ministers,"" she said. ""The ministers are all very much agreed that we need to see a step up in terms of personal levels of responsibility that people take."" Robin Swann issued a paper to executive ministers last week warning more ""severe"" restrictions could be required before Christmas Last week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, thenmore ""severe"" restrictions could be required before Christmas. However, Mrs Long said the executive's focus at the minute is ""not on closure but on trying to keep businesses open"". In a written response to the health minister's paper, the justice minister said she was ""at a loss to understand"" why Mr Swann suggested she take on responsibility for the matter. In the letter to Mr Swann, seen by BBC News NI, she said a number of agencies were involved in overseeing compliance to Covid-19 restrictions including councils and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). ""The PSNI will also, rightly, only enforce where necessary,"" she added. Mrs Long warned that the executive had to be aware of the ""wider impact"" of expecting the PSNI to adjust its approach to enforcement. ""We have seen public confidence in policing being adversely affected whenever the public believe the PSNI are taking a disproportionate approach."" Where are masks still compulsory in the UK? She said the police and other enforcement agencies were there to be called on as a ""final measure"", as the duty remained with businesses to encourage compliance. She said: ""The idea that compliance can be solely or even primarily an issue for justice is fundamentally flawed, as recognised by previous decisions of the executive."" Mrs Long said she also believed a ""key problem"" in improving compliance was the lack of consistent messaging across the executive. She suggested that ministers needed to agree several ""key messages"" on public health advice at Monday's executive meeting and promote them ""relentlessly"". Mark Lindsay, chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, told BBC Radio Foyle that compliance can not solely be the responsibility of the PSNI. ""Police do have a role to play. It should not be misconstrued that police do not want to have anything to do with this, but it's about where we sit in the chain,"" he said. He said funding a warden scheme could be ""a more effective way... than expecting police to step away from more urgent and risky situations to come and deal with this"". Meanwhile, Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, said businesses do not have the power to make people wear face coverings. He told BBC's Radio Ulster's Nolan show: ""It is not our responsibility to police [it]. ""Retailers and their staff do not have the power of sanction, they do not have the power to legally enforce what they have been doing and they have spent millions and millions on making sure their shops are safe, their staff are trained, their staff are safe, encouraging and reminding customers of their responsibility. ""If there is going to be enforcement, it is a matter for the police."" Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts says enforcement of face coverings will be a matter for police On Thursday, Mr Swann advisedanyone who worked from home when the pandemic began last year should do so again now. His document also suggested introducing a ""scores on the doors"" Covid compliance rating for businesses. Decisions on whether to strengthen current mitigations must be agreed by the executive first. Health officials believe the proposals could help reduce transmission of the virus. Stormont ministers have said they do not want to have to impose tougher mitigations that could damage trade. They have already agreed to put in placeproof of Covid status for certain sectors, which will become enforceable from 13 December.

"This video can not be played Footage of the parade shows a red SUV driving into a school marching band at high speed At least five people have been killed and more than 40 injured after a car ploughed into a Christmas parade in the US state of Wisconsin, police say. School bands and a dance troupe of grannies were among those marching through the city of Waukesha when a red SUV came speeding down the road. It hit dozens of people, including children. One person is in custody. The incident does not appear ""at this time"" to be an act of terrorism, one official said. Warning: This article contains upsetting content. The suspect appeared to have been fleeing another scene - possibly a knife fight - when he ran into people at the parade, the law enforcement official, who is familiar with the early findings of the investigation, told the BBC's US partner CBS News. It is unclear if the individual in custody was the driver of the vehicle. Local resident Angelito Tenorio toldthe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper,externalhe had just finished marching in the parade when the SUV ""put the pedal to the metal and just [started] zooming full speed along the parade route"" at about 16:40 (22:40 GMT) on Sunday. ""Then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle,"" he said. Corey Montiho said his daughter's dance team was hit by the SUV. ""There were pom-poms and shoes and spilled hot chocolate everywhere. I had to go from one crumpled body to the other to find my daughter,"" he told the paper. Sarah Saldivar, who was at the parade with her two young children, told CBS News she saw ""a red blur"" and then saw ""little girls flying through the air"". The parade in Waukesha - a community of about 72,000 located to the west of Milwaukee - is traditionally held every year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, and includes fancy dress, floats, dancers and marching bands. This year's theme was ""comfort and joy"". Families lined the sides of the road to watch the event, which was returning after a year's absence due to the coronavirus pandemic. One video shared on social media shows the car crashing at high speed through street barriers, while another shows the vehicle driving into what looks like a group of musicians. Police officers ran down the street during the incident, telling people to take shelter in shops. Police chief Dan Thompson told reporters that officers had fired at the car to try to stop it. Jason Kellner told the New York Times newspaper he had just watched his son go past with his school marching band when the car came towards the crowd and ""started mowing people down"". ""I've never felt a worse feeling; wondering what I'm going to find when I get to my kid,"" he said. Mr Kellner found his son standing unharmed at the side of the road, but saw several injured people and pulled a bloody saxophone off the street. Another witness told Milwaukee's Fox6 TV station that there was silence, followed by screaming, running and checking on those injured after the vehicle hit a dance team of girls aged between about nine and 15. Video posted online showed the vehicle as it was about to hit the parade in Waukesha The Milwaukee Dancing Grannies said some of its members ""were impacted and we are waiting for word on their conditions"". ""Please keep the Grannies, all those injured, and all those who witnessed this horrible event in your thoughts and prayers,""the group wrote on its Facebook page,external. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee said one of its priests, multiple parishioners and students at a local Catholic school were among the injured. Photos of a red SUV with a crumpled bonnet parked in a driveway wereposted on Twitter by TV station CBS 58,external. Chief Thompson said officers had recovered a ""suspect vehicle"" and a person of interest was in custody, but gave no further details. He added that the investigation was ""very fluid"". Officials in Waukesha warned that the number of fatalities and injuries could change as additional information is collected. They said some people had transported themselves to local hospitals. Emergency responders and passers-by attended to injured people Fire chief Steven Howard told reporters that his department had taken 11 adults and 12 children to nearby hospitals after the incident. The Children's Wisconsin hospital said it had received 15 patients as of 20:00, while the Aurora Medical Center-Summit said it was treating 13 people, including three in a critical condition. Mayor Shawn Reilly described the incident as a ""horrible, senseless tragedy"". ""I am deeply saddened to know that so many in our community went to a parade but ended up dealing with injury and heartache,"" he said. The White House has said President Joe Biden is being regularly updated on the incident and has offered support to local officials. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff across the state in honour of the victims. Waukesha's public schools will be closed on Monday, and counselling services have been made available to those affected. A community fund has been created to help victims of the incident.

"Boris Johnson was pictured enjoying the ride at Peppa Pig World on Sunday Boris Johnson has been criticised after he lost his place in a speech to British businesses leaders and referred to the children's cartoon Peppa Pig. Speaking to the CBI conference, the PM also quoted Lenin and performed an impression of a car. Halting his speech led to an awkward 21 seconds of apologies and paper shuffling from the Tory leader. Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, called the speech ""shambolic"". She added: ""No one was laughing, because the joke's not funny anymore."" A senior Downing Street source told the BBC: ""Business was really looking for leadership today and it was shambolic."" They added there was ""a lot of concern inside the building"" about Mr Johnson. ""Cabinet needs to wake up and demand serious changes otherwise it'll keep getting worse. If they don't insist, he just won't do anything about it."" A Downing Street spokesperson pointed out that CBI head Tony Danker had welcomed the PM's words on the private sector working with the government. PM defends social care plan amid cap criticism The UK migrant dilemma - it's all about Brexit Do more to end North-South divide, says CBI Mr Johnson's 25-minute speech to assembled business leaders focused on levelling up, but also took some awkward turns as the prime minister tried to fuel enthusiasm for hisgreen industrial revolution. After saying government ""cannot fix everything"" and that ""the true driver of growth is not government but the energy and dynamism and originality of the private sector"", Mr Johnson turned to CBI chief Mr Danker and said: ""Yesterday I went, as we all must, to Peppa Pig World."" He asked the audience for a show of hands for who had been to the Hampshire attraction, and after saying ""not enough"", the PM continued. ""I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,"" he said. ""Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. ""It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig."" This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister is asked if he's OK after talking about Peppa Pig in a speech to business leaders Mr Johnson added: ""The real lesson for me going to Peppa Pig World... was about the power of UK creativity. ""Who would have believed a pig who looks like... a Picasso like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC, would now be exported to 180 countries and theme parks both in America and China, as well as in the New Forest and be a business worth at least Â£6bn to this country and counting. ""I think that is pure genius don't you? No government in the world, no Whitehall civil servant, would have conceivably come up with Peppa."" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: ""Businesses are crying out for clarity. Instead, all they got was Boris Johnson rambling on about Peppa Pig. ""It is a perfect metaphor for Johnson's chaotic, incompetent government as it trashes our economy, but it is not worthy of a British prime minister."" During the section in the speech on electric cars, accompanied by a potted history of his career as a motoring correspondent, Mr Johnson launched into a seemingly well-practised impression of a car. ""[Electric vehicles] may not burble like sucking doves,"" he said. ""And they may not have that 'vrrrom vrrrom raaah raaah' that you like. ""But they have so much torque that they move off the lights faster than a Ferrari."" The PM then moved onto his personal10 point planto support businesses going greener in the future. But he made an ambitious jump when he appeared to compare himself to Moses as he ""came down from [Mount] Sinai and [told] my officials [about] the new 10 commandments"" - pledges includingmore investment in wind powerand hydrogen technologies. That was still less of a surprise than a Conservative prime minister, known for his quotations, turning to a Russian revolutionary to drive his point home. ""Lenin once said that the Communist Revolution was Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country,"" he told the crowd. ""Well, I hesitate to quote Lenin before the Confederation of British Industry, but the coming industrial revolution is green power plus the electrification of the whole country."" After urging people back to office, saying there were ""reasons why Mother Nature does not like working from home"", the PM then lost his place in his speech What followed was 21 seconds of silence, filled with the occasional mumble of ""forgive me"" and much ruffling of papers. But he returned to his script to talk about building up skills and the government'sIntegrated Rail Plan, which despite a raft of critical coverage, he claimed it would be ""transformatory"". After questions on other issues of the day - the government's announcements on rail, and criticism of plans for the social care cap - Mr Johnson left the stage. But later, before heading back to Downing Street, the PM gave an interview to a reporter, who simply asked: ""Is everything OK?"" Mr Johnson said he thought people had ""got the vast majority of the points"" he wanted to make and that the speech ""went over well"".

"Holidaymakers are being urged to use Â£132m worth of unspent vouchers issued during the pandemic before they lose financial protection. The credit notes were offered by travel firms as alternatives to cash refunds when holidays had to be cancelled. The vouchers, backed by the Atol insurance scheme, can be used towards new holidays or exchanged for cash. But the regulator said the refund protection against firms going bust will end on 30 September 2022. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) also said travel firms would not longer be able to issue the Atol-protected cover after 20 December. The refund credit notes (RCNs) were issued from March last year, the month of the first UK coronavirus lockdown. Michael Budge, head of Atol, which is run by the CAA, said: ""With over Â£130m of Atol refund credit notes yet to be redeemed, and international travel opening up again, we want to remind consumers to redeem any unused credits to make sure they do not lose out."" He said RCNs were a fantastic tool to reassure consumers and support the industry. Many travel firms faced ruin if they were forced to hand back huge refunds in cash after large swathes of the industry closed down. But travellers were outraged at being offered credit notes instead of cash refunds, fearing that if firms went bust they would lose money. In July 2020, the CAA decided to cover credit notes under the Atol scheme, and Â£131.7m of them remain unspent. ""The decision to end the scheme reflects the changing of international travel restrictions with significantly increased demand from consumers over recent months due to the opening up of more destinations."" Mr Budge said. Under the Atol scheme, if a firm goes out of business holiday costs will be refunded. If it happens when travellers are abroad they will be able to finish their holidays and fly home. All tour operators selling package holidays by air must hold an Atol licence. How are travel rules being relaxed?

"The green hydrogen facility will be based at Whitelee Windfarm in East Renfrewshire A wind farm is to become home to a state-of-the-art hydrogen storage facility which could eventually produce enough clean energy to help power the next generation of public transport. The UK government has awarded the project, based at Whitelee Windfarm in East Renfrewshire, Â£9.4m. It said the project would help Glasgow reach net zero by 2030. The cash will go towards developing the country's largest electrolyser, which converts water into hydrogen. The hydrogen produced can be easily stored and transported to where it is needed. Splitting water and capturing the released hydrogen requires energy, and the project will use electricity produced from the wind farm, the largest onshore farm in the UK, to create the gas. This video can not be played Watch: What is hydrogen energy and why is it important? One use for the hydrogen generated will be to support local transport. The facility is expected to make so much of the zero-carbon fuel that it could provide the equivalent of enough zero-carbon fuel for 225 buses travelling to and from Glasgow to Edinburgh each day. Greg Hands, the UK government's energy and climate change minister, said: ""This first-of-a-kind hydrogen facility will put Scotland at the forefront of plans to make the UK a world-leading hydrogen economy, bringing green jobs to Glasgow, while also helping to decarbonise local transport - all immediately following the historic COP26 talks."" And Alister Jack, secretary of state for Scotland, said the project showed ""how serious the UK government is about supporting projects that will see us achieve net zero by 2050"". He added that it had never been more important to ""champion"" projects like this, which embrace new hydrogen technology while creating highly-skilled jobs. The partnership, made up of ScottishPower, ITM Power and BOC, is currently going through the planning process for the new facility and aims to have green hydrogen available to the commercial market by 2023. Some argue that for public transport vehicles like buses, hydrogen is too expensive and electricity would be a better, cheaper alternative. However Dr Graham Cooley, chief executive of ITM Power, told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that hydrogen was particularly good for heavy vehicles ""where you value payload"". He said: ""You can make a vehicle that's very long duration - in other words, it can travel a long range without compromising the weight. ""If you want to travel a long distance using a battery, you need more and more batteries which makes the vehicles very heavy. You see vehicle manufacture now all over the world rolling out commercial vehicles based on hydrogen which have very long ranges and very short recharging or refuelling time."" Meanwhile, Friends of the Earth Scotland director Richard Dixon argued that green hydrogen should be reserved for ""special uses"" in industry, rather than mainstream uses like public transport. He told the programme: ""It's three times more sensible to use it [renewable electricity] as electricity rather than to use it to turn it into hydrogen - you've lost two thirds of the energy in making the hydrogen and then using it. ""We have such a desperate need to convert our homes to electric heating and to convert transport to electricity to get out of fossil fuels. That should be absolute top priority.""

"This video can not be played CBI boss Tony Danker says economic growth should be across the UK Economic growth must be evenly spread around the UK rather than concentrated in south-east England, the boss of the CBI business group has said. Speaking at the CBI's annual conference, director general Tony Danker said that ""levelling up"" could not be left to the free market. He added ""high-valued"" sectors, firms and jobs were needed across the UK. Boris Johnson told the same conference levelling up was still his ""moral mission"" and an ""economic imperative"". The prime minister also defendedthe scaled-back plans for rail in the North, insisting the government's new schemes would still be ""transformatory"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer outlined ""five fiscal rules"" at the CBI conference that the next Labour government intended to follow, saying the Conservatives had ""missed an opportunity to remake Britain"" with the autumn Budget. Mr Danker told the CBI conference that the headquarters of many businesses were currently ""too often based in London and theâ¯Southâ¯East"", with the UK operatingâ¯asâ¯a ""branch line economy"", showing that the free market had failed to create prosperity across the country. But he said the rise of new industries such as biotech provided the opportunity for a ""new industrial revolution"" across the UK and ""a shot at redemption"". ""For five decades we've had no idea how to [tackle the divide], but now we've got industries like clean and renewable energy, life sciences, cyber-security and they don't have to be based in the South East,"" Mr Danker told the BBC's Today programme earlier on Monday. UK growth slows as supply issues hit the recovery Fairer, greener economy 'offers prizes for all' The CBI is concerned that old industries such as textiles in Lancashire, shipbuilding on the Clyde, and steel in Sheffield have been allowed to ""die"" since the 1980s. It also disagrees with the government's decision to scrap the Leeds leg of the HS2 high-speed rail line, which was originally billed as being key to levelling up. Last week, the government dropped plans to extend the HS2 line to Leeds and said the Northern Powerhouse Rail route from Liverpool to Leeds would run partly on existing lines rather than new ones. Many cities became known for the industries which operate in them, such as steel production in Sheffield The CBI also thinks firms should be encouraged to cluster in towns, and should have more power in decisions over local infrastructure and in coming up with economic strategies. Mr Danker told the Today programme: ""I do think we need a much firmer, more ambitious growth strategy from the government. ""At the end of the day, if we [the UK] don't get growth up back to our pre-crisis, pre 2008 growth rates, what we're going to have is cuts to spending, rises in taxes, so growth has to be the North Star."" Speaking at the same conference, the prime minister acknowledged there were ""chronic problems"" underlying the UK economy, including the imbalance between firms which were ""go-getting world-beaters"" and the ""long comet tail"" of firms which lacked the necessary skills and investment to boost productivity. But he said levelling-up was achievable and would help the UK become a bigger economy than Germany. ""If this country could achieve the same kind of geographical balance and dispersion of growth and wealth that you find in most of our most successful economic comparators, and if all our businesses could reach more balance in their levels of productivity, then there would be absolutely no stopping us. ""We would achieve - what I believe we can - and become the biggest and most successful economy in Europe."" Labour's Sir Keir told the CBI conference that the next Labour government would make a ""contract"" with business where it made fiscal discipline and investment into skills a priority. ""What we need now is a sector-by-sector plan, for the car industry, for the steel industry, for all industry - our competitors are already doing it, we can't afford not to,"" he said. ""This is our side of the contract - to run a stable government and a tight ship, to equip the next generation for work, to invest in British business and to create a wave of high-skilled jobs.""

"One school says it called in the police over ""very upsetting"" allegations on the video-sharing app Some teachers are leaving the profession after being labelled paedophiles on TikTok, a union says. A craze on the social media app has seen children share videos of staff with inappropriate hashtags and comments and, sometimes, superimposing their faces onto pornography. A Swansea Valley school said it called the police after staff were secretly filmed and labelled #paedo on the app. TikTok said it had no place for hateful behaviour, bullying and harassment. Assistant head teacher Gemma Morgan Gemma Morgan, assistant head teacher at Cwmtawe Community School, Pontardawe, said a fake school TikTok account had been set up. It contained edited videos of virtual parents' evenings and lessons, as well as covert filming of staff that had been uploaded and doctored. ""They had edited them, put hashtags over the top, they created memesâ¦ there were several hashtags with 'paedo',"" she said. ""Some members of staff had been filmed discreetly within classrooms."" She said there were ""extremely derogatory comments"" and ""very bad language"". ""In all honesty, things that were of great concern and we engaged with the local police."" More than 80 reports over TikTok school abuse TikTok takes extra steps to curb dangerous challenges TikTok abuse 'is pushing teachers over the edge' The situation had been ""very upsetting"" for staff, she said. ""Especially for the families of these members of staffâ¦ it's a massive, massive concern."" Helen Jones, head teacher at Maesteg Comprehensive School in Bridgend, said footage of her teachers had been used to create memes, some of which had been ""relatively innocent"". ""But where they have been unpleasant it's been quite cruel and it's easy to be cruel when the account holder is anonymous,"" she said. Helen Jones said she did not want to see children's behaviour criminalised She said the ""implication and nuances"" of one meme suggested the teacher in question was a paedophile. ""Those sorts of things are causing great upset and distress,"" she said. She said everyone had been exhausted by the pandemic and both staff and pupil absence was at an ""all time high"". Neither school has excluded students but had focussed on educating pupils and parents. A number of councils and some of Wales' police forces have written to parents to inform them of the craze and ask them to discuss the appropriate use of social media with their children. ""I don't think they realise the consequences of their actions, at the end of the day they're still children,"" said Ms Jones. TikTok content creator Ellis Lloyd Jones says some people on social media do not realise the impact of their actions Ellis Lloyd Jones, is a TikTok content creator with over 190,000 followers. The 23-year-old from Treorchy in Rhondda Cynon Taf discouraged school children from taking part in the craze. ""As a child, you might think the teacher's not going to care and not going to see it but that probably will affect them behind closed doorsâ¦ it could really affect them,"" he said. ""It's just keyboard warriors, people think 'I''m behind a screen, I can say whatever I want'."" He does not believe the media interest around the craze will do TokTok any harm: ""The more controversy that comes, the more people are talking about it, the more popular is going to get,"" he said. Neil Butler says parents must understand their children's behaviour could result in them being arrested NASUWT's National Official for Wales Neil Butler said the craze was having a ""huge detrimental impact on the wellbeing of teachers in schools across the UK"". ""We have examples of teachers going off on sick, on stress, we have examples of teachers leaving the profession, which of course is the greatest worry - we can't afford to lose experienced teachers from the classroom,"" he said. ""It's the last straw really - it was bad enough what they had to go through during the pandemic.. and now [they're] having to face this."" He said he had seen one post encouraging pupils to hit a teacher. ""We will ensure that the full force of the law - if the law is broken - is brought to bear, because we have to protect our members,"" he said. Eithne Hughes, Cymru Director at ASCL union, said she had also seen examples of racial slurs and teachers accused of having affairs. ""It is just horrible nasty dreadful stuff,"" she said. Eithne Hughes wants to see more action from TikTok ""Teachers are looking over their shoulders... it's been a very squalid and sorry affair. ""It's cruel and unnecessary and the profession should not have to put up with it frankly."" She said complaints to TikTok had been met in one of two ways: ""No response at all, or that it does not violate TikTok's own protocols, which is extraordinary."" She said after talks with the company they still needed to do more: ""We don't need nice words, we actually need some action,"" she said. Mrs Morgan said TikTok had taken ""a long time"" for the videos to be taken down. Ms Jones, said they had received ""quite a quick response"" from TikTok, adding it had had provided useful generic advice to the school's media marketing manager. ""I'm well aware of the lack of speed other schools have reported,"" she added. A spokeswoman for TikTok said: ""We are crystal clear that hateful behaviour, bullying and harassment have no place on TikTok. ""We regret the distress caused to some teachers as a result of abusive content posted to our platform."" She said the company had deployed additional technical measures and guidance and continued to ""proactively detect and remove violative content and accounts"". She said the partner had partnered with the Professional Online Safety Helpline (POSH) to provide teachers with an additional way to report content and written to every school in the UK to ensure all staff had access to the resources they need. Mr Butler said a letter has gone from his union's general secretary to the education minister of each UK nation and called for action from the Welsh government ""I don't think any government is doing enough on this,"" he said. ""The Welsh government has overarching control of education in Wales, it is becoming an extremely serious issue, so we would like now to see a more robust response from them to this issue."" The Welsh government said: ""It is completely unacceptable that teachers are being targeted with abuse on social media."" It said it had asked TikTok to remove any instances of inappropriate or offensive content immediately and  advise affected staff to report any instances directly to TikTok and contact POSH.

"This video can not be played Watch: Water cannons and tear gas fired at Covid protesters in Brussels Austria has returned to a full national lockdown as protests against new restrictions aimed at curbing Covid-19 infections spread across Europe. From midnight, Austrians have been asked to work from home and non-essential shops have closed. New restrictions have sparked protests throughout Europe. People clashed with police in the Netherlands and Belgium. Infection rates have risen sharply on the continent, prompting warnings from the World Health Organization (WHO). On Saturday WHO regional directorDr Hans Kluge told the BBCthat unless measures were tightened across Europe - such as on vaccines, wearing masks and with Covid passes for venues - half a million more deaths could be recorded by next spring. Last week Austria became the first European country to make Covid vaccination a legal requirement, with the law due to take effect in February. Politicians in neighbouring Germany are debating similar measures as intensive care units there fill up and case numbers hit fresh records. This is Austria's fourth national lockdown since the pandemic began. Authorities have ordered residents to stay home for all but essential reasons, including work, exercise and shopping for food. Restaurants, bars, hairdressers, theatres and non-essential shops must all close their doors. These measures will continue until 12 December, although officials said they will be reassessed after 10 days. Speaking on ORF TV on Sunday night, health minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said the government had to ""react now"". Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? ""A lockdown, a relatively tough method, a sledgehammer, is the only option to reduce the numbers [of infections] here,"" he told the broadcaster. Tens of thousands of people protested in the capital Vienna ahead of the lockdown. Brandishing national flags and banners reading ""Freedom"", protesters shouted ""Resistance!"" and booed the police. Rallies against Austria's new Covid-19 measures were held over the weekend Resinger Harald, a 62-year-old from the southern Carinthia region, is fully vaccinated and feels the lockdown is not necessary. ""It will hurt some of the smaller businesses severely and they might run into financial difficulties,"" she told the BBC. Jennifer Wall, a British woman who moved to Vienna about two years ago, has also been double-jabbed. She described the protests over the weekend as ""disruptive"" and ""scary"". ""The situation here is really tense,"" she said. ""There is a clear divide between vaccinated and not vaccinated."" About 65% of Austria's population is fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in Western Europe. The country's daily vaccination rate has risen sharply in November, but some people are still hesitant. In Vienna, one unvaccinated woman told the BBC that Austria's plan to make vaccinations compulsory amounted to a ""restriction of human rights"". ""It's always a person's choice,"" she said. Several European countries saw angry protests against tougher restrictions turn violent over the weekend. InBelgium'scapital, Brussels, demonstrators clashed with police after tens of thousands of people marched through the city centre. Protesters are mainly opposed to Covid passes that stop the unvaccinated from entering cafes, restaurants and entertainment venues. The march started peacefully but some launched stones and fireworks at officers, who responded with tear gas and water cannon. Across the border inthe Netherlands, rioting took place for the third night in a row. Local media report that police arrested 15 people in the southern city of Roosendaal where a primary school was set ablaze. An emergency order has also been imposed in the town of Enschede to keep people off the streets overnight. This video can not be played Watch: Fireworks and chaos on the streets as Dutch Covid riots break out On Saturday, people hurled fireworks at police and set fire to bicycles in The Hague. That followedwhat Rotterdam's mayor called ""an orgy of violence"" on Friday, when officers opened fire after protesters threw rocks and fireworks and set police cars ablaze. Four people thought to have been hit by police bullets remain in hospital, authorities said on Sunday. The Netherlands is under a three-week nationwide partial lockdown, forcing restaurants to shut earlier and banning fans at sports events. Protesters are also angry at a ban on fireworks on New Year's Eve and government plans to introduce a vaccine pass for indoor venues. Thousands of demonstrators were also on the streets inCroatia'scapital Zagreb on Saturday, while inDenmarkaround 1,000 people protested in Copenhagen against government plans to order public sector workers to be vaccinated in order to enter workplaces. TheFrenchCaribbean department of Guadeloupe, meanwhile, has been rocked by three days of looting and vandalism, over a mandatory vaccine order for health workers as well as high fuel prices. Some 38 people were reportedly arrested and special police forces were sent to the island on Sunday in a bid to quell the unrest after protesters ransacked and torched shops.

"England's international travel rules will be reviewed in January, the UK's aviation minister says Robert Courts says the government wants to ""reduce testing"" and other ""restrictive measures"" Austria has returned to a full lockdown, despite protests in the capital, Vienna Protesters also clashed with police in the Netherlands and Belgium over the weekend, as cases surge in Europe and restrictions return Australia says it will begin significantly relaxing bans on foreigners entering the country, prioritising certain groups People in England aged over 40 can book their Covid booster jabs from today Stormont ministers will meet later to discuss proposals to help curb the spread of Covid in NI Edited by Hamish Mackay That's it for our live coronavirus coverage today. We'll be back with more updates tomorrow. Here's a look back at some of the day's main developments  The live page was brought to you by Hamish Mackay, James Clarke, Emma Harrison, Matt Murphy, Lauren Turner, Doug Faulkner, and Francesca Gillett. If you're just joining us on the commute home, we've got news about England's travel rules - the government has confirmed they will be reviewed in January. Aviation minister Robert Courts was speaking at the Airlines 2021 conference in Westminster earlier. Although travel rules eased last month, even fully-vaccinated travellersstill have to pay for a test- either a PCR or lateral flow - when they arrive home in the UK. ""We all want to see aviation bounce back,"" said Courts. ""We all want to reduce not just testing but all the restrictive measures. ""We're going to review the policy in January. We'll be looking to see what we can do at that stage."" The minister refused to say which aspects of the travel rules could be amended. Meanwhile Virgin Atlantic's boss told the conference that he expected flights on its important transatlantic routes to be
60% to 70% full in the weeks running up to Christmas, Reuters reported. The UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has been speaking to business leaders this afternoon at the Confederation of British Industry's conference. Asked for the advice he would give business leaders, Whitty says: ""We're still firmly in Covid, anyone who reads the news knows that."" He says the two ways businesses can help is by making it as easy as possible for employees to get vaccinated and their booster jabs. ""And then the second is we've realised the extraordinary importance of improving the ventilation of workplaces, not just for Covid but also for many other respiratory infections,"" he says. ""If we invest in that now, we'll both help the aftermath of Covid but also cut down on things like flu outbreaks in workplaces."" The average number of daily confirmed cases in the UK has bounced around since mid-July and has been rising again over the last few days. Today, a further 44,917 cases were announced which, although high, remains below the peak of last winter. The latest available figures for show there are currently more than 8,000 people being treated for Covid in hospital. This, again, is well below the January peak. Thanks to vaccines, fewer people are dying from Covid, but the seven-day average for Covid deaths is still 147 per day. Earlier this month, new rules came into force in England stating staff have to have two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, unless medically exempt, in order to work in care homes. We've already reported that some care home bossesfeared losing 8% of their staff. Now Hertfordshire County Council says almost 300 staff left their jobs in the county's care homes in the weeks before the rule came into force on 11 November, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. The county council says in a statement: ""Whatever people's reasons for leaving, we'd like to thank them for all they have done to help keep both older and less able residents safe."" Read more More than half of over-50s in England have now received an extra dose of the Covid jab, new figures from NHS England show. A total of 11,093,652 booster jabs and third doses (for people who are considered clinically vulnerable) had been given to over-50s in England as of Sunday - equivalent to 52% of the age group. England is the second UK nation to reach the milestone, after Scotland hit the halfway point last week. Not everyone aged 50 or over will yet be eligible for an extra jab - as people have to wait at least six months after their second dose before getting a booster. Over-40s are now being offered booster jabs across the UK.We've got more information here. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has condemned rioters after a third night of unrest  hit the country over anti-Covid measures. Rutte calls the unrest âpure violenceâ unleashed by âidiotsâ and vows to prosecute those responsible. âI realise that there are a lot of tensions in society because we have been dealing with all the misery of coronavirus for so long,â Rutte tells Dutch media. But he says that the riots, which took pace in several cities across the Netherlands, had ânothing to do with demonstrating"". ""This is a pure explosion of violence directed against our police, against our firefighters, against ambulance drivers.â He adds he will always defend the right to protest, but what he âwill never accept is that idiots use pure violence against people â¦ who keep this country safeâ. Around 145 people have been arrested by Dutch police during the unrest, which began after the Dutch government announced a new partial lockdown in the country. We've had the latest coronavirus figures from the UK government, showing another 44,917 confirmed cases. A further 45 deaths have also been reported. Meanwhile, a further 237,995 people received a third Covid jab - whether a booster or a third dose - on Sunday. The vast majority of federal employees in the US are now in compliance with President Joe Biden's vaccination mandate, the White House says. More than 90% of federal employees have now received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, while another 5% have received some form of exemption or extension. In September, Biden signed an order requiring all 3.5 million civilian federal workers to provide proof of vaccination by 22 November. A similar requirement was brought in for members of the military and people working in nursing homes, hospitals and doctor's offices. On 1 November the Pentagon separately announced that 97% of active duty military personal had received at least one dose of vaccine. Failure to comply with the order may lead to a range of penalties, including suspension. These figures are significantly above the wider US population, of which just 71% are vaccinated. Holidaymakers are being urged to use Â£132m worth ofunspent vouchers issued during the pandemicbefore they lose financial protection. The credit notes were offered by travel firms as alternatives to cash refunds when holidays had to be cancelled. The vouchers, backed by the Atol insurance scheme, can be used towards new holidays or exchanged for cash. But the regulator says the refund protection against firms going bust will end on 30 September 2022. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) also says travel firms would not longer be able to issue the Atol-protected cover after 20 December. The refund credit notes (RCNs) were issued from March last year, the month of the first UK coronavirus lockdown. Kenyans will be barred from using public transport and government buildings from 21 December if they are not fully vaccinated against Covid-19, Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe has said. The new restrictions will also apply to hospital and prison visits, as well as to government buildings for used for education, immigration and tax purposes. Fewer than 10% of Kenyans are currently vaccinated and the country has administered just 6.4 million jabs out of the 10.7 million it has received. ""We have given time for Kenyans to get the vaccine by December 21. As much as we will enforce these measures, accountability on implementing these measures will lie on individuals,"" Kagwe says. Despite low vaccination numbers, official figures suggest that coronavirus cases remain low in Kenya, with just 59 new infections reported on average each day. England's rules for international travel will be reviewed in January, the aviation minister says. Robert Courts says he wants the aviation industry to ""bounce back"" from the pandemic. Travel rules were eased last month but fully vaccinated travellers continue to be required to pay for a test and fill out a passenger locator form when they enter the UK. Speaking at the Airlines 2021 conference, Courts says: ""We all want to reduce not just testing but all the restrictive measures."" Willie Walsh, the former boss of British Airways' parent company IAG, then tells the summit: ""I think we've had overly restrictive measures in place in the UK for far too long, and that's definitely slowed down the recovery."" Read more:What are the UK travel rules? Widespread adoption of vaccines could allow the UK to become the first country to exit the coronavirus pandemic, a senior government minister has said. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi tells LBC that a combination of natural immunity and the UK's high vaccination rate could allow the country to transition into a post coronavirus world before other countries. ""Our four-step plan meant that we were able to open up the economy in the summer. Some said it was a mistake - I think it was absolutely the right thing to do,"" former vaccines minister Zahawi says. âWe will probably, I hope, without being complacent, be the first major economy in the world to demonstrate how you transition [from] pandemic to endemic using vaccines."" A disease like Covid-19 becomes endemic when the virus becomes ever-present, but does not pose a societal threat. The view from inside a hospital in Gyor, Hungary, as the country offers walk-in jabs amid a rise in infections Lengthy queues for jabs are also pictured at Prague's main train station, as new rules came into force in the Czech Republic that mean proof of vaccination is needed to enter venues such as pubs and restaurants Meanwhile, a Christmas market opens in Trento in Italy - with people required to prove their vaccine status to get in But the Christmas market in Salzburg, Austria, is closed as a new national lockdown begins with all non-essential shops shut People over 40 in England are able to book their booster dose of a Covid vaccine from today. More than a million 40 to 49-year-oldscan now pre-book appointments,external, and a further 1.5 million invites will be sent out in the coming weeks, NHS England says. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed, particularly in older age groups. Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according toUK Health Security Agency data,external. Throughout the UK, booster jabs are (or will soon be, depending on which nation people live in) available if:  Read more in our explainer here The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is evaluating the use of a booster dose of the Janssen (also known as Johnson & Johnson) Covid vaccine being given two months after the first jab. The European medicines watchdog will carry out an accelerated assessment of data from the company, with an outcome expected ""within weeks"". Janssen is currently approved for use as a single shot jab in people aged 18 and over. You can find out more about different Covid vaccineshere. Austrians have been asked to work from home and non-essential shops have closed If you're just going us, here's a round-up of what's been happening across the world. Earlier we reported on the unrest in the French overseas territory of Guadeloupe. French President Emmanuel Macron
says the protests over Covid-19 restrictions have created a ""very explosive""
situation. Local police have arrested at least 38 people and dozens of
shops have been looted after trade unions launched protests against mandatory vaccinations for healthcare workers and a new health pass required to access hospitality settings. Macron is urging the island's leaders to convince people of the importance of the vaccination campaign in the face of rising coronavirus cases. ""We must explain, explain, explain and convince, convince,
convince, because one must not play around with the peoples'
health,"" he says. However, he accepts that the violence was also influenced by ""very local context and tensions which we know about,
which are historic"". Over the weekend, France announced it would send police
special forces to restore order in the French overseas
territory amid reports that rioters had broken into an arms depot in the city of
Pointe-a-Pitre and taken rifles. Helen Penny said very few people were wearing masks on the matchday train services People who travelled by train to Cardiff for the rugby on Saturday have expressed worry at how busy the carriages were. Wales won their final autumn international match against Australia on Saturday with fans packing on to trains to get to and from the match. Passengers took to Twitter to complain about the Covid risk on the trains, with one fan telling the BBC very few people were wearing masks. Masks are a legal requirement on public transport in Wales. Transport for Wales has faced criticism over how busy services have been during sporting events in recent weeks. It said it had used all available trains and strengthened services on Saturday - but the busy trains meant conductors and police officers could not always walk through the carriages to enforce face mask laws.

Several European countries saw angry protests against tougher restrictions turn violent over the weekend. InBelgium'scapital, Brussels, demonstrators clashed with police after tens of thousands of people marched through the city centre. Protesters are mainly opposed to Covid passes that stop the unvaccinated from entering cafes, restaurants and entertainment venues. The march started peacefully but some launched stones and fireworks at officers, who responded with tear gas and water cannon. Across the border inthe Netherlands, rioting took place for the third night in a row. Local media report that police arrested 15 people in the southern city of Roosendaal where a primary school was set ablaze. An emergency order has also been imposed in the town of Enschede to keep people off the streets overnight.

That followedwhat Rotterdam's mayor called ""an orgy of violence"" on Friday, when officers opened fire after protesters threw rocks and fireworks and set police cars ablaze. Four people thought to have been hit by police bullets remain in hospital, authorities said on Sunday. The Netherlands is under a three-week nationwide partial lockdown, forcing restaurants to shut earlier and banning fans at sports events. Protesters are also angry at a ban on fireworks on New Year's Eve and government plans to introduce a vaccine pass for indoor venues. Thousands of demonstrators were also on the streets inCroatia'scapital Zagreb on Saturday, while inDenmarkaround 1,000 people protested in Copenhagen against government plans to order public sector workers to be vaccinated in order to enter workplaces. TheFrenchCaribbean department of Guadeloupe, meanwhile, has been rocked by three days of looting and vandalism, over a mandatory vaccine order for health workers as well as high fuel prices. Some 38 people were reportedly arrested and special police forces were sent to the island on Sunday in a bid to quell the unrest after protesters ransacked and torched shops.

"Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. The PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. Under the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023: those with assets of less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay anything from these towards care fees - although they might have to pay from their income those with more than Â£100,000 in assets - the value of their home, savings or investments - will not get any financial help from the council those with assets between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 will qualify for council help, but will have to pay Â£86,000 out of their own pocket to reach the cap On Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246. Nineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead. The bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. What could care changes cost you and your family? Claims about social care fact-checked What are the challenges facing social care? Will the cap really fix the social care system? Defending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win. Pushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament. The Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a ""step in the right direction"" and ""an improvement on what we have today"". But he said its plans for calculating the cap were a ""big disappointment"" and ""not as generous as people like me wanted"". After a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like. But that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place. And on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable. The vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own. Read Laura's blog in full Under the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit. The threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to Â£100,000 able to qualify, rather than Â£23,250 currently. The governmentannounced last week,externalthat only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap. Local authorities will meet care costs beyond the Â£86,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded througha new health and social care tax. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care. Sally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was ""sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment"". ""The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,"" she said. ""It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this."" When asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I can't predict individual situations."" After the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: ""Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected."" But the prime minister said the new system would be ""progressive"" and ""much better"" than the existing one. ""Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of Â£23,000 or more - now you get support if you have Â£100,000 or less, so we're helping people,"" Mr Johnson said. He added: ""We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country."" Lorraine, pictured as a child, and her mother Roma Lorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent ""every penny that she ever earned"" on care. Despite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of Â£140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. She says for her mother, 83, selling her home was ""probably the worst thing ever"". ""She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,"" Lorraine adds. ""Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances."" Every adult receiving care will have an account measuring how much they spend on care fees from their own income or assets Those with total assets worth more than Â£100,000 will have to pay all the care fees themselves Once assets fall below Â£100,000, people will be able to claim means-tested payments from their council to help with costs If they cannot pay for care from their income, they will have to contribute Â£1 for every Â£250 they have in assets Care home fees - such as for food and rent - will not count towards the Â£86,000 limit but will be capped at Â£200 a week People with assets under Â£20,000 won't have to contribute to their care costs, although they might have to contribute from their income.

"England's international travel rules will be reviewed in January, the UK's aviation minister says Robert Courts says the government wants to ""reduce testing"" and other ""restrictive measures"" Austria has returned to a full lockdown, despite protests in the capital, Vienna Protesters also clashed with police in the Netherlands and Belgium over the weekend, as cases surge in Europe and restrictions return Australia says it will begin significantly relaxing bans on foreigners entering the country, prioritising certain groups People in England aged over 40 can book their Covid booster jabs from today Stormont ministers will meet later to discuss proposals to help curb the spread of Covid in NI Edited by Hamish Mackay That's it for our live coronavirus coverage today. We'll be back with more updates tomorrow. Here's a look back at some of the day's main developments  The live page was brought to you by Hamish Mackay, James Clarke, Emma Harrison, Matt Murphy, Lauren Turner, Doug Faulkner, and Francesca Gillett. If you're just joining us on the commute home, we've got news about England's travel rules - the government has confirmed they will be reviewed in January. Aviation minister Robert Courts was speaking at the Airlines 2021 conference in Westminster earlier. Although travel rules eased last month, even fully-vaccinated travellersstill have to pay for a test- either a PCR or lateral flow - when they arrive home in the UK. ""We all want to see aviation bounce back,"" said Courts. ""We all want to reduce not just testing but all the restrictive measures. ""We're going to review the policy in January. We'll be looking to see what we can do at that stage."" The minister refused to say which aspects of the travel rules could be amended. Meanwhile Virgin Atlantic's boss told the conference that he expected flights on its important transatlantic routes to be
60% to 70% full in the weeks running up to Christmas, Reuters reported. The UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has been speaking to business leaders this afternoon at the Confederation of British Industry's conference. Asked for the advice he would give business leaders, Whitty says: ""We're still firmly in Covid, anyone who reads the news knows that."" He says the two ways businesses can help is by making it as easy as possible for employees to get vaccinated and their booster jabs. ""And then the second is we've realised the extraordinary importance of improving the ventilation of workplaces, not just for Covid but also for many other respiratory infections,"" he says. ""If we invest in that now, we'll both help the aftermath of Covid but also cut down on things like flu outbreaks in workplaces."" The average number of daily confirmed cases in the UK has bounced around since mid-July and has been rising again over the last few days. Today, a further 44,917 cases were announced which, although high, remains below the peak of last winter. The latest available figures for show there are currently more than 8,000 people being treated for Covid in hospital. This, again, is well below the January peak. Thanks to vaccines, fewer people are dying from Covid, but the seven-day average for Covid deaths is still 147 per day. Earlier this month, new rules came into force in England stating staff have to have two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, unless medically exempt, in order to work in care homes. We've already reported that some care home bossesfeared losing 8% of their staff. Now Hertfordshire County Council says almost 300 staff left their jobs in the county's care homes in the weeks before the rule came into force on 11 November, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. The county council says in a statement: ""Whatever people's reasons for leaving, we'd like to thank them for all they have done to help keep both older and less able residents safe."" Read more More than half of over-50s in England have now received an extra dose of the Covid jab, new figures from NHS England show. A total of 11,093,652 booster jabs and third doses (for people who are considered clinically vulnerable) had been given to over-50s in England as of Sunday - equivalent to 52% of the age group. England is the second UK nation to reach the milestone, after Scotland hit the halfway point last week. Not everyone aged 50 or over will yet be eligible for an extra jab - as people have to wait at least six months after their second dose before getting a booster. Over-40s are now being offered booster jabs across the UK.We've got more information here. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has condemned rioters after a third night of unrest  hit the country over anti-Covid measures. Rutte calls the unrest âpure violenceâ unleashed by âidiotsâ and vows to prosecute those responsible. âI realise that there are a lot of tensions in society because we have been dealing with all the misery of coronavirus for so long,â Rutte tells Dutch media. But he says that the riots, which took pace in several cities across the Netherlands, had ânothing to do with demonstrating"". ""This is a pure explosion of violence directed against our police, against our firefighters, against ambulance drivers.â He adds he will always defend the right to protest, but what he âwill never accept is that idiots use pure violence against people â¦ who keep this country safeâ. Around 145 people have been arrested by Dutch police during the unrest, which began after the Dutch government announced a new partial lockdown in the country. We've had the latest coronavirus figures from the UK government, showing another 44,917 confirmed cases. A further 45 deaths have also been reported. Meanwhile, a further 237,995 people received a third Covid jab - whether a booster or a third dose - on Sunday. The vast majority of federal employees in the US are now in compliance with President Joe Biden's vaccination mandate, the White House says. More than 90% of federal employees have now received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, while another 5% have received some form of exemption or extension. In September, Biden signed an order requiring all 3.5 million civilian federal workers to provide proof of vaccination by 22 November. A similar requirement was brought in for members of the military and people working in nursing homes, hospitals and doctor's offices. On 1 November the Pentagon separately announced that 97% of active duty military personal had received at least one dose of vaccine. Failure to comply with the order may lead to a range of penalties, including suspension. These figures are significantly above the wider US population, of which just 71% are vaccinated. Holidaymakers are being urged to use Â£132m worth ofunspent vouchers issued during the pandemicbefore they lose financial protection. The credit notes were offered by travel firms as alternatives to cash refunds when holidays had to be cancelled. The vouchers, backed by the Atol insurance scheme, can be used towards new holidays or exchanged for cash. But the regulator says the refund protection against firms going bust will end on 30 September 2022. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) also says travel firms would not longer be able to issue the Atol-protected cover after 20 December. The refund credit notes (RCNs) were issued from March last year, the month of the first UK coronavirus lockdown. Kenyans will be barred from using public transport and government buildings from 21 December if they are not fully vaccinated against Covid-19, Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe has said. The new restrictions will also apply to hospital and prison visits, as well as to government buildings for used for education, immigration and tax purposes. Fewer than 10% of Kenyans are currently vaccinated and the country has administered just 6.4 million jabs out of the 10.7 million it has received. ""We have given time for Kenyans to get the vaccine by December 21. As much as we will enforce these measures, accountability on implementing these measures will lie on individuals,"" Kagwe says. Despite low vaccination numbers, official figures suggest that coronavirus cases remain low in Kenya, with just 59 new infections reported on average each day. England's rules for international travel will be reviewed in January, the aviation minister says. Robert Courts says he wants the aviation industry to ""bounce back"" from the pandemic. Travel rules were eased last month but fully vaccinated travellers continue to be required to pay for a test and fill out a passenger locator form when they enter the UK. Speaking at the Airlines 2021 conference, Courts says: ""We all want to reduce not just testing but all the restrictive measures."" Willie Walsh, the former boss of British Airways' parent company IAG, then tells the summit: ""I think we've had overly restrictive measures in place in the UK for far too long, and that's definitely slowed down the recovery."" Read more:What are the UK travel rules? Widespread adoption of vaccines could allow the UK to become the first country to exit the coronavirus pandemic, a senior government minister has said. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi tells LBC that a combination of natural immunity and the UK's high vaccination rate could allow the country to transition into a post coronavirus world before other countries. ""Our four-step plan meant that we were able to open up the economy in the summer. Some said it was a mistake - I think it was absolutely the right thing to do,"" former vaccines minister Zahawi says. âWe will probably, I hope, without being complacent, be the first major economy in the world to demonstrate how you transition [from] pandemic to endemic using vaccines."" A disease like Covid-19 becomes endemic when the virus becomes ever-present, but does not pose a societal threat. The view from inside a hospital in Gyor, Hungary, as the country offers walk-in jabs amid a rise in infections Lengthy queues for jabs are also pictured at Prague's main train station, as new rules came into force in the Czech Republic that mean proof of vaccination is needed to enter venues such as pubs and restaurants Meanwhile, a Christmas market opens in Trento in Italy - with people required to prove their vaccine status to get in But the Christmas market in Salzburg, Austria, is closed as a new national lockdown begins with all non-essential shops shut People over 40 in England are able to book their booster dose of a Covid vaccine from today. More than a million 40 to 49-year-oldscan now pre-book appointments,external, and a further 1.5 million invites will be sent out in the coming weeks, NHS England says. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed, particularly in older age groups. Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according toUK Health Security Agency data,external. Throughout the UK, booster jabs are (or will soon be, depending on which nation people live in) available if:  Read more in our explainer here The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is evaluating the use of a booster dose of the Janssen (also known as Johnson & Johnson) Covid vaccine being given two months after the first jab. The European medicines watchdog will carry out an accelerated assessment of data from the company, with an outcome expected ""within weeks"". Janssen is currently approved for use as a single shot jab in people aged 18 and over. You can find out more about different Covid vaccineshere. Austrians have been asked to work from home and non-essential shops have closed If you're just going us, here's a round-up of what's been happening across the world. Earlier we reported on the unrest in the French overseas territory of Guadeloupe. French President Emmanuel Macron
says the protests over Covid-19 restrictions have created a ""very explosive""
situation. Local police have arrested at least 38 people and dozens of
shops have been looted after trade unions launched protests against mandatory vaccinations for healthcare workers and a new health pass required to access hospitality settings. Macron is urging the island's leaders to convince people of the importance of the vaccination campaign in the face of rising coronavirus cases. ""We must explain, explain, explain and convince, convince,
convince, because one must not play around with the peoples'
health,"" he says. However, he accepts that the violence was also influenced by ""very local context and tensions which we know about,
which are historic"". Over the weekend, France announced it would send police
special forces to restore order in the French overseas
territory amid reports that rioters had broken into an arms depot in the city of
Pointe-a-Pitre and taken rifles. Helen Penny said very few people were wearing masks on the matchday train services People who travelled by train to Cardiff for the rugby on Saturday have expressed worry at how busy the carriages were. Wales won their final autumn international match against Australia on Saturday with fans packing on to trains to get to and from the match. Passengers took to Twitter to complain about the Covid risk on the trains, with one fan telling the BBC very few people were wearing masks. Masks are a legal requirement on public transport in Wales. Transport for Wales has faced criticism over how busy services have been during sporting events in recent weeks. It said it had used all available trains and strengthened services on Saturday - but the busy trains meant conductors and police officers could not always walk through the carriages to enforce face mask laws.

Father-of-four Dr Irfan Halim, 45, who worked on the coronavirus ward at Swindon's Great Western Hospital, died after catching Covid. His father, Dr Kamal Halim, also died with the virus. Paying tribute to his brother and father, Amir Halim said: ""Even when Irfan was in ICU his primary focus was always Dad."" We have more on this story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Bulb Energy, which has 1.7 million customers, has announced that the firm will be put into administration. It is the largest UK energy company to face difficulties following a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices this year. Bulb will become the first energy company to be placed into ""special administration"", where it is run by the government through the regulator Ofgem. ""Customers of Bulb do not need to worry - Bulb will continue to operate as normal,"" Ofgem said. ""Customers will see no disruption to their supply and their account and tariff will continue as normal. Bulb staff will still be available to answer calls and queries."" The special administration measure is only used if Ofgem is unable to find another company to take over an energy firm's customers. The regulator said it was planning to apply to a court to appoint an administrator who will run the company. Bulb said energy supplies were ""secure and all credit balances are protected"". Bulb is the UK's seventh biggest energy company and has 1,000 staff. It has been trying to shore up its finances for several weeks. Ofgem set up the Special Administrator Regime (SAR) for when an energy company goes bust but is too big to have its customers transferred to another firm. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? The aim of the regime is to stop financial failure spreading across the industry. Under the SAR scheme, the government can make grants and loans to the company while its future is sorted out. It could come in the shape of a takeover by another company, selling parts of its business or customers being transferred to another firm. Provision for special administration, owing to the collapse of a major player in the UK energy sector, has been part of the law for 10 years. It had never been needed until now. So, this decision will be a hugely significant moment in this gas crisis. But it is one to which customers of Bulb are being urged to respond by remaining calm and essentially doing nothing. It is written into the rules that a special administrator, unlike an ordinary administrator, has an obligation to consider consumers' interests as well as those of creditors who are owed money by Bulb. It means customers have short-term certainty that their supply, their current tariff, their credit balance and their bills will continue as normal. That means switching now would be a bad, and expensive, idea. Longer-term, some of that certainty diminishes as decisions are made about the future sale or wind-up of the company. Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that in effect it meant the ""taxpayer is likely to take the strain, so we might all end up paying a price"". A host of energy companies have gone bust over the last three months as wholesale gas prices have soared, affecting nearly four million customers. On Monday, Ofgem said British Gas would take on customers from Neon Reef and Social Energy Supply, which went bust last week. The two firms had a combined 35,000 customers. The UK's energy price cap - which limits what providers can charge - has exacerbated the problem, firms say. Justina Miltienyte, an energy policy expert at Uswitch, said the failure of Bulb signalled the ""tipping point"" of the UK energy crisis. ""Ultimately this demise wasn't caused by a badly run business model. Instead, Bulb was choked off by the way the government decided to structure the current energy market with the price cap."" But Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said Bulb's fall into administration should ""focus minds on how the market operates"" and ""why so many companies have been allowed to operate so recklessly for so long"". ""The government has had to step in to protect customers from a failure of unprecedented size, and it will have to use taxpayers' money to do so,"" he added. John Arnold, a Bulb customer for several years from Potters Bar in Hertfordshire, told the BBC he was ""not surprised"" by the supplier's struggles given the current market, but added he was ""more than a little disappointed"" they had gone into administration. Bulb customer John Arnold says it has been a ""good company to deal with"" ""In my experience they have been a good company to deal with. I like their green credentials and their tariffs have been very fair,"" the 69-year-old said. Deborah Davenport, from Easton on the Hill in the East Midlands, said Bulb's customer service was ""absolutely brilliant"". While renovating her cottage which involved installing solar panels and a new gas supply, Ms Davenport said there were a few ""hiccups"" with meter readings and bills, but added Bulb solved the problems promptly. Bulb was ""just really pragmatic"" to deal with, she said, compared to some other energy firms who she believes ""do not care about people"". ""I just thought I had a voice with Bulb."" London-based Bulb, which caters to 5-6% of the UK energy market, said the gas price crisis meant it was unable to raise the financing it needed from investors to keep on operating. ""The rising energy crisis... has concerned investors who can't go ahead while wholesale prices are so high and the price cap - designed to protect customers - currently means suppliers provide energy at a significant loss,"" Bulb said on its website. Bulb was founded in 2015 to compete with the Big Six energy firms and claimed to offer cheaper and greener electricity than its rivals. It grew quickly and launched divisions in France, Spain and the US, which will continue to trade. According to Bulb's latest available accounts, in the year to 31 March 2020 the company made losses of Â£63m. It also had a Â£55m loan facility due for repayment on 31 December this year. In September, Bulb appointed investment bank Lazard to look into restructuring options, which reportedly included a joint venture or merger with another firm, and a cash injection from existing shareholders. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here.

"Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. The PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. Under the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023: those with assets of less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay anything from these towards care fees - although they might have to pay from their income those with more than Â£100,000 in assets - the value of their home, savings or investments - will not get any financial help from the council those with assets between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 will qualify for council help, but will have to pay Â£86,000 out of their own pocket to reach the cap On Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246. Nineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead. The bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. What could care changes cost you and your family? Claims about social care fact-checked What are the challenges facing social care? Will the cap really fix the social care system? Defending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win. Pushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament. The Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a ""step in the right direction"" and ""an improvement on what we have today"". But he said its plans for calculating the cap were a ""big disappointment"" and ""not as generous as people like me wanted"". After a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like. But that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place. And on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable. The vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own. Read Laura's blog in full Under the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit. The threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to Â£100,000 able to qualify, rather than Â£23,250 currently. The governmentannounced last week,externalthat only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap. Local authorities will meet care costs beyond the Â£86,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded througha new health and social care tax. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care. Sally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was ""sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment"". ""The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,"" she said. ""It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this."" When asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I can't predict individual situations."" After the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: ""Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected."" But the prime minister said the new system would be ""progressive"" and ""much better"" than the existing one. ""Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of Â£23,000 or more - now you get support if you have Â£100,000 or less, so we're helping people,"" Mr Johnson said. He added: ""We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country."" Lorraine, pictured as a child, and her mother Roma Lorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent ""every penny that she ever earned"" on care. Despite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of Â£140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. She says for her mother, 83, selling her home was ""probably the worst thing ever"". ""She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,"" Lorraine adds. ""Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances."" Every adult receiving care will have an account measuring how much they spend on care fees from their own income or assets Those with total assets worth more than Â£100,000 will have to pay all the care fees themselves Once assets fall below Â£100,000, people will be able to claim means-tested payments from their council to help with costs If they cannot pay for care from their income, they will have to contribute Â£1 for every Â£250 they have in assets Care home fees - such as for food and rent - will not count towards the Â£86,000 limit but will be capped at Â£200 a week People with assets under Â£20,000 won't have to contribute to their care costs, although they might have to contribute from their income.

"New homes and buildings in England will be required by law to install electric vehicle charging points from next year, the prime minister has announced. The government said the move will see up to 145,000 charging points installed across the country each year. New-build supermarkets, workplaces and buildings undergoing major renovations will also come under the new law. The move comes as the UK aims to switch to electric cars, with new petrol and diesel cars sales banned from 2030. Announcing the new laws at the Confederation of British Industry's conference on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK was going to ""radically"" change its cars, trucks, buses and other modes of transport. ""The force driving that change won't be government, it won't even be business...it will be the consumer. It will be the young people of today, who can see the consequences of climate change and will be demanding better from us."" But Labour said the announcement does not address the ""appalling"" geographical divide in available charging points. ""London and the South East have more public car charging points than the rest of England and Wales combined. Yet there is nothing here to help address this. ""Nor is there help so lower and middle income families can afford electric vehicles or the investment required to build the gigafactories we need,"" Labour said. The government said the new laws will ""make it as easy as refuelling a petrol or diesel car today"". It said ""simpler ways to pay"" to charge vehicles through contactless payments would also be introduced at ""all new fast and rapid charge points"". Britain currently has about 25,000 charging points, but the Competition and Markets Authority has said it could need 10 times as many before 2030. The switch to electric vehicles is part of the UK's strategy to hit climate targets, with cars and taxis accounting for 16% of UK emissions in 2019. Several major car manufacturers, such as Jaguar and Volvo plan to go all electric from 2025 and 2030 and Ford has said all vehicles sold in Europe will be electric by 2030. However, four of the world's biggest carmakers, Volkswagen, Toyota, Renault-Nissan and Hyundai-Kia failed to sign aCOP 26 summit pledge to only sell zero emissions cars and vans by 2035. UK electric car sales are growing, with about 10% of cars sold in 2020 being electric, up from 2.5% in 2018. However, concerns have been raised about the lack of charging infrastructure. The Policy Exchange think tank has warned the rollout of charging points has fallen behind and said there is a risk of ""charging blackspots"" in small towns and rural areas unless it speeds up. MPs on the Transport Select Committee have also said people must be protected from excessive pricing for public electric car charging,with home charging being much cheaper. Mike Childs, Friends of the Earth's head of policy, welcomed the government's announcement, adding that electric vehicles had a ""significant role to play in building a zero-carbon future"". ""New housing should also include secure cycle storage and access to high quality public transport, to provide real alternatives to driving and help cut congestion,"" Mr Childs added. Along with its announcement on charging points, the government also confirmed almost Â£10m will fund a new hydrogen project at the UK's largest onshore windfarm near Glasgow. The cash injection will help the Whitelee green hydrogen project develop the UK's largest electrolyser, a system which converts water into hydrogen gas as a way to store energy and supply local transport providers with zero-carbon fuel.

"This video can not be played CBI boss Tony Danker says economic growth should be across the UK Economic growth must be evenly spread around the UK rather than concentrated in south-east England, the boss of the CBI business group has said. Speaking at the CBI's annual conference, director general Tony Danker said that ""levelling up"" could not be left to the free market. He added ""high-valued"" sectors, firms and jobs were needed across the UK. Boris Johnson told the same conference levelling up was still his ""moral mission"" and an ""economic imperative"". The prime minister also defendedthe scaled-back plans for rail in the North, insisting the government's new schemes would still be ""transformatory"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer outlined ""five fiscal rules"" at the CBI conference that the next Labour government intended to follow, saying the Conservatives had ""missed an opportunity to remake Britain"" with the autumn Budget. Mr Danker told the CBI conference that the headquarters of many businesses were currently ""too often based in London and theâ¯Southâ¯East"", with the UK operatingâ¯asâ¯a ""branch line economy"", showing that the free market had failed to create prosperity across the country. But he said the rise of new industries such as biotech provided the opportunity for a ""new industrial revolution"" across the UK and ""a shot at redemption"". ""For five decades we've had no idea how to [tackle the divide], but now we've got industries like clean and renewable energy, life sciences, cyber-security and they don't have to be based in the South East,"" Mr Danker told the BBC's Today programme earlier on Monday. UK growth slows as supply issues hit the recovery Fairer, greener economy 'offers prizes for all' The CBI is concerned that old industries such as textiles in Lancashire, shipbuilding on the Clyde, and steel in Sheffield have been allowed to ""die"" since the 1980s. It also disagrees with the government's decision to scrap the Leeds leg of the HS2 high-speed rail line, which was originally billed as being key to levelling up. Last week, the government dropped plans to extend the HS2 line to Leeds and said the Northern Powerhouse Rail route from Liverpool to Leeds would run partly on existing lines rather than new ones. Many cities became known for the industries which operate in them, such as steel production in Sheffield The CBI also thinks firms should be encouraged to cluster in towns, and should have more power in decisions over local infrastructure and in coming up with economic strategies. Mr Danker told the Today programme: ""I do think we need a much firmer, more ambitious growth strategy from the government. ""At the end of the day, if we [the UK] don't get growth up back to our pre-crisis, pre 2008 growth rates, what we're going to have is cuts to spending, rises in taxes, so growth has to be the North Star."" Speaking at the same conference, the prime minister acknowledged there were ""chronic problems"" underlying the UK economy, including the imbalance between firms which were ""go-getting world-beaters"" and the ""long comet tail"" of firms which lacked the necessary skills and investment to boost productivity. But he said levelling-up was achievable and would help the UK become a bigger economy than Germany. ""If this country could achieve the same kind of geographical balance and dispersion of growth and wealth that you find in most of our most successful economic comparators, and if all our businesses could reach more balance in their levels of productivity, then there would be absolutely no stopping us. ""We would achieve - what I believe we can - and become the biggest and most successful economy in Europe."" Labour's Sir Keir told the CBI conference that the next Labour government would make a ""contract"" with business where it made fiscal discipline and investment into skills a priority. ""What we need now is a sector-by-sector plan, for the car industry, for the steel industry, for all industry - our competitors are already doing it, we can't afford not to,"" he said. ""This is our side of the contract - to run a stable government and a tight ship, to equip the next generation for work, to invest in British business and to create a wave of high-skilled jobs.""

"Naomi Long says it would be ""inappropriate"" for her department to oversee face covering compliance Businesses need to ""step up"" and help ensure the use of face coverings in their premises, Justice Minister Naomi Long has said. Aa health paperhas suggested Mrs Long's department should oversee plans to raise compliance levels above 80%. The minister said her department did not have enforcement powers, adding personal responsibility was needed. She said there should be a ""co-ordinated effort"" across departments to encourage greater usage. The Alliance Party leader said the public needed to take ""personal responsibility"" for the wearing of face masks and adhering to other public health messaging such as maintaining hand hygiene and doing regular lateral flow tests. ""If we turn this into a just justice issue, then the automatic presumption is that it is for the police to enforce and it isn't that simple,"" the minister told BBC 's Evening Extra programme. ""We all have to take personal responsibility. ""Businesses need to step up too and say we will not grant admission to our premises, whether it's a retail environment or whether it's a cafe or restaurant, and say we will not grant admission unless you wear a mask and do the things we're asking you to do. ""Then if customers are difficult or abusive, that's the time the police can come in and enforce, but we cant reasonably expect the police to be in every shop, in every coffee shop, in every restaurant and in every setting."" Since summer 2020,customers have been required to wear face masks in shops, on public transport and in a number of indoor settings- unless they are exempt. Health Minister Robin Swann circulated a document to executive ministers last week with a range of proposals aimed at reducing transmission of the virus. In it, he suggested that Mrs Long should ""take the lead in pursuing a minimum of 80% adherence to face coverings requirements, to gather evidence of this for the executive and to report of the number of fixed penalty notices issued"". Health officials say they are worried about a drop in compliance with face covering rules Mrs Long said she did not ""have a team of enforcers to send out even if I had the authority to do so, so it's not that simple"". ""There are a number of bodies that have an enforcement role, for example, the PSNI has a role, local councils have a role, the Health and Safety Executive has a role across the board,"" she added. Executive to discuss Swann's Covid-19 proposals Health minister advises more working from home Tougher Covid rules 'could be needed by Christmas' NI ministers vote in favour of Covid passports Stormont Executive ministers met on Monday to discuss the paper from the Department of Health. Mrs Long said it was ""not unusual"" for departments to write a paper and then for other departments to give feedback and the paper be amended. She said the issue had become a ""storm in a teacup"". ""The difficulty then comes when that paper is leaked and it looks as though there is a row between the ministers,"" she said. ""The ministers are all very much agreed that we need to see a step up in terms of personal levels of responsibility that people take."" Robin Swann issued a paper to executive ministers last week warning more ""severe"" restrictions could be required before Christmas Last week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, thenmore ""severe"" restrictions could be required before Christmas. However, Mrs Long said the executive's focus at the minute is ""not on closure but on trying to keep businesses open"". In a written response to the health minister's paper, the justice minister said she was ""at a loss to understand"" why Mr Swann suggested she take on responsibility for the matter. In the letter to Mr Swann, seen by BBC News NI, she said a number of agencies were involved in overseeing compliance to Covid-19 restrictions including councils and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). ""The PSNI will also, rightly, only enforce where necessary,"" she added. Mrs Long warned that the executive had to be aware of the ""wider impact"" of expecting the PSNI to adjust its approach to enforcement. ""We have seen public confidence in policing being adversely affected whenever the public believe the PSNI are taking a disproportionate approach."" Where are masks still compulsory in the UK? She said the police and other enforcement agencies were there to be called on as a ""final measure"", as the duty remained with businesses to encourage compliance. She said: ""The idea that compliance can be solely or even primarily an issue for justice is fundamentally flawed, as recognised by previous decisions of the executive."" Mrs Long said she also believed a ""key problem"" in improving compliance was the lack of consistent messaging across the executive. She suggested that ministers needed to agree several ""key messages"" on public health advice at Monday's executive meeting and promote them ""relentlessly"". Mark Lindsay, chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, told BBC Radio Foyle that compliance can not solely be the responsibility of the PSNI. ""Police do have a role to play. It should not be misconstrued that police do not want to have anything to do with this, but it's about where we sit in the chain,"" he said. He said funding a warden scheme could be ""a more effective way... than expecting police to step away from more urgent and risky situations to come and deal with this"". Meanwhile, Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, said businesses do not have the power to make people wear face coverings. He told BBC's Radio Ulster's Nolan show: ""It is not our responsibility to police [it]. ""Retailers and their staff do not have the power of sanction, they do not have the power to legally enforce what they have been doing and they have spent millions and millions on making sure their shops are safe, their staff are trained, their staff are safe, encouraging and reminding customers of their responsibility. ""If there is going to be enforcement, it is a matter for the police."" Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts says enforcement of face coverings will be a matter for police On Thursday, Mr Swann advisedanyone who worked from home when the pandemic began last year should do so again now. His document also suggested introducing a ""scores on the doors"" Covid compliance rating for businesses. Decisions on whether to strengthen current mitigations must be agreed by the executive first. Health officials believe the proposals could help reduce transmission of the virus. Stormont ministers have said they do not want to have to impose tougher mitigations that could damage trade. They have already agreed to put in placeproof of Covid status for certain sectors, which will become enforceable from 13 December.

""We all want to see aviation bounce back,"" said Courts. ""We all want to reduce not just testing but all the restrictive measures. ""We're going to review the policy in January. We'll be looking to see what we can do at that stage."" The minister refused to say which aspects of the travel rules could be amended. Meanwhile Virgin Atlantic's boss told the conference that he expected flights on its important transatlantic routes to be
60% to 70% full in the weeks running up to Christmas, Reuters reported. The UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has been speaking to business leaders this afternoon at the Confederation of British Industry's conference. Asked for the advice he would give business leaders, Whitty says: ""We're still firmly in Covid, anyone who reads the news knows that."" He says the two ways businesses can help is by making it as easy as possible for employees to get vaccinated and their booster jabs. ""And then the second is we've realised the extraordinary importance of improving the ventilation of workplaces, not just for Covid but also for many other respiratory infections,"" he says. ""If we invest in that now, we'll both help the aftermath of Covid but also cut down on things like flu outbreaks in workplaces."" The average number of daily confirmed cases in the UK has bounced around since mid-July and has been rising again over the last few days. Today, a further 44,917 cases were announced which, although high, remains below the peak of last winter. The latest available figures for show there are currently more than 8,000 people being treated for Covid in hospital. This, again, is well below the January peak. Thanks to vaccines, fewer people are dying from Covid, but the seven-day average for Covid deaths is still 147 per day. Earlier this month, new rules came into force in England stating staff have to have two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, unless medically exempt, in order to work in care homes. We've already reported that some care home bossesfeared losing 8% of their staff. Now Hertfordshire County Council says almost 300 staff left their jobs in the county's care homes in the weeks before the rule came into force on 11 November, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. The county council says in a statement: ""Whatever people's reasons for leaving, we'd like to thank them for all they have done to help keep both older and less able residents safe."" Read more More than half of over-50s in England have now received an extra dose of the Covid jab, new figures from NHS England show. A total of 11,093,652 booster jabs and third doses (for people who are considered clinically vulnerable) had been given to over-50s in England as of Sunday - equivalent to 52% of the age group. England is the second UK nation to reach the milestone, after Scotland hit the halfway point last week. Not everyone aged 50 or over will yet be eligible for an extra jab - as people have to wait at least six months after their second dose before getting a booster. Over-40s are now being offered booster jabs across the UK.We've got more information here. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has condemned rioters after a third night of unrest  hit the country over anti-Covid measures. Rutte calls the unrest âpure violenceâ unleashed by âidiotsâ and vows to prosecute those responsible. âI realise that there are a lot of tensions in society because we have been dealing with all the misery of coronavirus for so long,â Rutte tells Dutch media. But he says that the riots, which took pace in several cities across the Netherlands, had ânothing to do with demonstrating"". ""This is a pure explosion of violence directed against our police, against our firefighters, against ambulance drivers.â He adds he will always defend the right to protest, but what he âwill never accept is that idiots use pure violence against people â¦ who keep this country safeâ. Around 145 people have been arrested by Dutch police during the unrest, which began after the Dutch government announced a new partial lockdown in the country. We've had the latest coronavirus figures from the UK government, showing another 44,917 confirmed cases. A further 45 deaths have also been reported. Meanwhile, a further 237,995 people received a third Covid jab - whether a booster or a third dose - on Sunday. The vast majority of federal employees in the US are now in compliance with President Joe Biden's vaccination mandate, the White House says. More than 90% of federal employees have now received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, while another 5% have received some form of exemption or extension. In September, Biden signed an order requiring all 3.5 million civilian federal workers to provide proof of vaccination by 22 November. A similar requirement was brought in for members of the military and people working in nursing homes, hospitals and doctor's offices. On 1 November the Pentagon separately announced that 97% of active duty military personal had received at least one dose of vaccine. Failure to comply with the order may lead to a range of penalties, including suspension. These figures are significantly above the wider US population, of which just 71% are vaccinated. Holidaymakers are being urged to use Â£132m worth ofunspent vouchers issued during the pandemicbefore they lose financial protection. The credit notes were offered by travel firms as alternatives to cash refunds when holidays had to be cancelled. The vouchers, backed by the Atol insurance scheme, can be used towards new holidays or exchanged for cash. But the regulator says the refund protection against firms going bust will end on 30 September 2022. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) also says travel firms would not longer be able to issue the Atol-protected cover after 20 December. The refund credit notes (RCNs) were issued from March last year, the month of the first UK coronavirus lockdown. Kenyans will be barred from using public transport and government buildings from 21 December if they are not fully vaccinated against Covid-19, Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe has said. The new restrictions will also apply to hospital and prison visits, as well as to government buildings for used for education, immigration and tax purposes. Fewer than 10% of Kenyans are currently vaccinated and the country has administered just 6.4 million jabs out of the 10.7 million it has received. ""We have given time for Kenyans to get the vaccine by December 21. As much as we will enforce these measures, accountability on implementing these measures will lie on individuals,"" Kagwe says. Despite low vaccination numbers, official figures suggest that coronavirus cases remain low in Kenya, with just 59 new infections reported on average each day. England's rules for international travel will be reviewed in January, the aviation minister says. Robert Courts says he wants the aviation industry to ""bounce back"" from the pandemic. Travel rules were eased last month but fully vaccinated travellers continue to be required to pay for a test and fill out a passenger locator form when they enter the UK. Speaking at the Airlines 2021 conference, Courts says: ""We all want to reduce not just testing but all the restrictive measures."" Willie Walsh, the former boss of British Airways' parent company IAG, then tells the summit: ""I think we've had overly restrictive measures in place in the UK for far too long, and that's definitely slowed down the recovery."" Read more:What are the UK travel rules? Widespread adoption of vaccines could allow the UK to become the first country to exit the coronavirus pandemic, a senior government minister has said. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi tells LBC that a combination of natural immunity and the UK's high vaccination rate could allow the country to transition into a post coronavirus world before other countries. ""Our four-step plan meant that we were able to open up the economy in the summer. Some said it was a mistake - I think it was absolutely the right thing to do,"" former vaccines minister Zahawi says. âWe will probably, I hope, without being complacent, be the first major economy in the world to demonstrate how you transition [from] pandemic to endemic using vaccines."" A disease like Covid-19 becomes endemic when the virus becomes ever-present, but does not pose a societal threat.

More than a million 40 to 49-year-oldscan now pre-book appointments,external, and a further 1.5 million invites will be sent out in the coming weeks, NHS England says. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed, particularly in older age groups. Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according toUK Health Security Agency data,external. Throughout the UK, booster jabs are (or will soon be, depending on which nation people live in) available if:  Read more in our explainer here The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is evaluating the use of a booster dose of the Janssen (also known as Johnson & Johnson) Covid vaccine being given two months after the first jab.

Janssen is currently approved for use as a single shot jab in people aged 18 and over. You can find out more about different Covid vaccineshere. Austrians have been asked to work from home and non-essential shops have closed If you're just going us, here's a round-up of what's been happening across the world. Earlier we reported on the unrest in the French overseas territory of Guadeloupe. French President Emmanuel Macron
says the protests over Covid-19 restrictions have created a ""very explosive""
situation. Local police have arrested at least 38 people and dozens of
shops have been looted after trade unions launched protests against mandatory vaccinations for healthcare workers and a new health pass required to access hospitality settings. Macron is urging the island's leaders to convince people of the importance of the vaccination campaign in the face of rising coronavirus cases. ""We must explain, explain, explain and convince, convince,
convince, because one must not play around with the peoples'
health,"" he says. However, he accepts that the violence was also influenced by ""very local context and tensions which we know about,
which are historic"". Over the weekend, France announced it would send police
special forces to restore order in the French overseas
territory amid reports that rioters had broken into an arms depot in the city of
Pointe-a-Pitre and taken rifles. Helen Penny said very few people were wearing masks on the matchday train services People who travelled by train to Cardiff for the rugby on Saturday have expressed worry at how busy the carriages were. Wales won their final autumn international match against Australia on Saturday with fans packing on to trains to get to and from the match. Passengers took to Twitter to complain about the Covid risk on the trains, with one fan telling the BBC very few people were wearing masks. Masks are a legal requirement on public transport in Wales. Transport for Wales has faced criticism over how busy services have been during sporting events in recent weeks. It said it had used all available trains and strengthened services on Saturday - but the busy trains meant conductors and police officers could not always walk through the carriages to enforce face mask laws.

"An organisation wants to help farmers make the most of their land without selling Farmers could turn their poorest land into profitable assets under plans to help rural communities survive. Large-scale investment companieshave been buying farms across the countryfor afforestation - planting trees to offset carbon emissions. About 12 sites have been sold recently and the Farmers Union of Wales warned of a threat to culture and language. A new project called Stump Up for Trees wants to keep land in the hands of people in the area. The group is urging farmers not to sell up, but to look at carbon offset as an opportunity to use land unsuitable for crops themselves. Brecon carbon offset project Why are firms buying Welsh farms? A reasonbig companies outside Wales are buying up the landis to take advantage of Welsh government forestry grants, aimed at encouraging trees to be planted to  improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gases. In the Black Mountains, which straddle Monmouthshire and Powys, thousands of trees have already been planted on land so poor, even sheep do not wander on to its slopes. If they do stray here, it is a farmer's nightmare to get them back. There is some land that even sheep will not venture on to This is common land, but across Wales there are thousands of acres like this covered in bracken, owned by farmers, which is lying largely unused and unprofitable. But it is this land which the Black Mountains tree planters say could now become key to saving family farms and a way of life. ""We've seen the wholesale purchase and planting of farms by corporates. As a tree planting charity you'd think we'd think it was great, but actually we think its a disaster,"" said Stump Up for Trees' Keith Powell. ""If you destroy the local economy, there are no jobs, no community. It will also affect our food security and we need to have domestic food security."" Although trees are being planted to offset carbon emissions, there are concerns the loss of farmland harms rural communities He believes there is enough land in Wales for the country to maintain its food security and wants farmers to make the most of ""unproductive land"". The project is working with Coed Cymru, which provides grant advice to farmers. ""We are hoping to make it possible for farmers to have other choices (apart from selling to corporations) and farmers are really up for this from the number of inquiries we are getting,"" said director Gareth Davies. Underlining this is the fact London-based utility company UW has invested a large sum of money in the project. Chief executive Andrew Lindsay believes it is good marketing to be associated with a scheme which is planting trees while not damaging land that could be used for food production. He believes other large companies will come to regret buying up farms simply for carbon offsetting that could remain productive in other ways. ""We are definitely seeing big companies coming in with big cheque books saying we've got to plant trees, but its not going to work if it's all about money,"" he added. ""Trees matter, but people matter, the rural community is already under pressure.  We want to be perceived as a company that cares about communities."" NFU Cymru has backed the plans, saying it means farmers make the decisions on where trees are planted and livelihoods are protected. ""Wales has been exploited before, people from outside Wales have made significant amounts of money and we need to make sure people in Wales benefit from the opportunity that Wales can provide,"" said chief executive John Davies. Farmers Union of Wales county executive for Gwent and Glamorgan Sharon Pritchard said it was important rural communities kept a ""united front"". ""It's a massive threat. I was in Maesteg last week where we are talking in the last couple of years over 500 acres had been sold to an outside-of-Wales purchaser, so that grant funding is accessed by that person outside of wales,"" she said. ""That money is lost to Welsh agriculture. We are seeing it on a weekly basis, worries and concerns that prime agricultural productive land is being taken out of food production.""

"The green hydrogen facility will be based at Whitelee Windfarm in East Renfrewshire A wind farm is to become home to a state-of-the-art hydrogen storage facility which could eventually produce enough clean energy to help power the next generation of public transport. The UK government has awarded the project, based at Whitelee Windfarm in East Renfrewshire, Â£9.4m. It said the project would help Glasgow reach net zero by 2030. The cash will go towards developing the country's largest electrolyser, which converts water into hydrogen. The hydrogen produced can be easily stored and transported to where it is needed. Splitting water and capturing the released hydrogen requires energy, and the project will use electricity produced from the wind farm, the largest onshore farm in the UK, to create the gas. This video can not be played Watch: What is hydrogen energy and why is it important? One use for the hydrogen generated will be to support local transport. The facility is expected to make so much of the zero-carbon fuel that it could provide the equivalent of enough zero-carbon fuel for 225 buses travelling to and from Glasgow to Edinburgh each day. Greg Hands, the UK government's energy and climate change minister, said: ""This first-of-a-kind hydrogen facility will put Scotland at the forefront of plans to make the UK a world-leading hydrogen economy, bringing green jobs to Glasgow, while also helping to decarbonise local transport - all immediately following the historic COP26 talks."" And Alister Jack, secretary of state for Scotland, said the project showed ""how serious the UK government is about supporting projects that will see us achieve net zero by 2050"". He added that it had never been more important to ""champion"" projects like this, which embrace new hydrogen technology while creating highly-skilled jobs. The partnership, made up of ScottishPower, ITM Power and BOC, is currently going through the planning process for the new facility and aims to have green hydrogen available to the commercial market by 2023. Some argue that for public transport vehicles like buses, hydrogen is too expensive and electricity would be a better, cheaper alternative. However Dr Graham Cooley, chief executive of ITM Power, told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that hydrogen was particularly good for heavy vehicles ""where you value payload"". He said: ""You can make a vehicle that's very long duration - in other words, it can travel a long range without compromising the weight. ""If you want to travel a long distance using a battery, you need more and more batteries which makes the vehicles very heavy. You see vehicle manufacture now all over the world rolling out commercial vehicles based on hydrogen which have very long ranges and very short recharging or refuelling time."" Meanwhile, Friends of the Earth Scotland director Richard Dixon argued that green hydrogen should be reserved for ""special uses"" in industry, rather than mainstream uses like public transport. He told the programme: ""It's three times more sensible to use it [renewable electricity] as electricity rather than to use it to turn it into hydrogen - you've lost two thirds of the energy in making the hydrogen and then using it. ""We have such a desperate need to convert our homes to electric heating and to convert transport to electricity to get out of fossil fuels. That should be absolute top priority.""

"Lord Frost said it was possible to generate momentum after meeting MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ on Friday There has been progress in talks between the EU and UK but ""significant gaps remain"", Lord Frost has said. The UK Brexit minister made the comments after meeting European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ. Lord Frost said there was the potential to ""generate some momentum"" in the talks, which will continue next week. The men were discussing the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the deal between the EU and UK which was agreed as a way to avoid a hardening of the Irish land border. It leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, meaning goods can flow freely with the Republic of Ireland. However, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control - amounting to a so-called Irish Sea border. The EU has acknowledged its is causing difficulties to some businesses and needs to be improved. However the UK is seeking more fundamental changes, including removing the European Court of Justice from an oversight role. Technical talks ahead of Friday's meeting had focused on guaranteeing the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Mr Å efÄoviÄ said there had been progress in this area, adding: ""We now need to press on and get this crucial issue across the line. ""This is a real test of political goodwill."" He said that on the issue of customs there had been ""initial useful engagement at a technical level"". Goods arriving in Belfast from GB are subject to checks and controls Lord Frost said that with medicines, any solution needed to ensure that products were available at the same time and on the same basis across the whole of the UK. He added that there had not been ""substantive progress on the fundamental customs and SPS (agrifood) issues relating to goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland"". The two men are due to meet again in London next Friday. Earlier, UK cabinet minister Michael Gove saidhe was confident of making progress on issues over the Northern Ireland Protocolwithouttriggering Article 16. Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem What is Article 16 and why does it matter? Article 16 of the protocol allows unilateral ""safeguard"" measures to be taken if either the EU or UK concluded that the deal was leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade. That would amount to a suspension of parts of the deal. On Thursday, the Lord Frost reiterated that triggering Article 16 remained an option for the UK. The EU believes the use of Article 16 is unjustified and would be used by the UK as pretext to repudiate the protocol. Mr Gove said the protocol had meant disruption to trade and inconvenience for people in Northern Ireland. But he praised a constructive approach from the European Commission. Speaking at the British-Irish Council summit in Cardiff, Mr Gove said Lord Frost had ""signalled that while of course it is always possible Article 16 may require to be invoked - we are confident we will be able to make progress without it"". This video can not be played What's the Irish PM's message to the UK? Late on Thursday night, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin saidthere was ""serious intent"" in the EU to solve the disagreementon Northern Ireland. He said the mood music surrounding EU-UK negotiations had improved in recent weeks but he admitted feeling frustrated that the issue had hindered the ""full flowering"" of the two sides' alliance.

"Robin Swann says closures may come if infections continue to rise, but it is not inevitable There is a possibility that hospitality venues may be asked to close over Christmas if Covid-19 cases continue to increase, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. But he told the Northern Ireland Assembly it was not ""inevitable"". Stormont ministers have met to discuss plans to help curb the spread of Covid-19 and will meet again on Tuesday. On Thursday, Mr Swann advisedanyone who worked from home when the pandemic began last year to do so again now. His document also suggested introducing a ""scores on the doors"" Covid compliance rating for businesses. Mr Swann said on Monday that ""if the current trajectory continues with regard to the increased cases we are seeing, we may once again face the possibility where venues are asked to close their doors during the Christmas season"". ""But let me be clear, it is not inevitable and I do not want to have to re-introduce further restrictions unless completely unavoidable,"" he added. Mr Swann also expressed disappointment that some hospitality venues had not acted responsibly after social distancing rules were relaxed. Allow Twitter content?

Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill tweeted that Mr Swann had presented a paper to ministers who met on Monday morning to consider it. She said that while the ""meeting was constructive and progress was made, it was agreed more work was needed"". ""The executive will meet again in the morning to finalise the approach,"" she added. Health Minister Robin Swann said he did not want to have to re-introduce further restrictions unless unavoidable Decisions on whether to strengthen current mitigations must first be agreed by the executive. Health officials believe the proposals could help reduce transmission of the virus. On Monday,three Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Irelandand a further 1,469 new cases. Northern Ireland's infection ratehas been climbing over the past week or so. It is currently the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland. Justice Minister Naomi Long said on Monday that the executive was ""not planning for Christmas closures"". ""We started off in terms of looking at vaccine certification as one means of trying to ensure that we drive down transmission and as those who are in more high-risk environments are less likely to become seriously ill as a result, that's one means of keeping the doors open on businesses,"" she added. ""We've been considering the paper today around how we actually try to get the basics right and get people to comply with things like handwashing, wearing masks, trying to voluntarily reduce their number of close contacts, trying to ensure where people can work from home they do work from home. ""Our focus at the minute is not on closure but on trying to keep businesses open."" Ms O'Neill said on Twitter that it was ""vitally important that all executive ministers work together to get us through this difficult period"". ""It's time to redouble our efforts to limit the spread of the virus, protect lives and our hospital system,"" she added. I think this was the strongest warning from Robin Swann that unless people do change their ways, it is not inevitable, but a distinct possibility [that venues may be asked to close]. If we are talking about carrot and stick, I think that is potentially the stick. Mr Swann will hope that hits home, because nobody wants that to happen. Certainly the people who run these establishments don't want it to happen. People would like a Christmas, but Robin Swann is saying people have got to change their ways. Last week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, thenmore ""severe"" restrictions could be required before Christmas. Stormont ministers have said they do not want to have to impose tougher mitigations that could damage trade. They have already agreed to put in placeproof of Covid status for certain sectors, which will become enforceable from 13 December. The plan means people will have to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or proof of a negative coronavirus test result to access nightclubs, pubs, cinemas, theatres and restaurants. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had voted against the proposals but Mr Swann and other Stormont ministers said the use of Covid status certification would save lives. The health minister suggests plans to encourage employees to return to the workplace should be reversed DUP ministers had said they wanted to see other measures explored by health officials, which could also help reduce the number of Covid cases. At present, executive advice on working from home is that people should continue to do so where they can. Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI? Tough Covid choices return - but what's the data? Meanwhile,Northern Ireland's justice minister has raised concerns about a proposal for her departmentto ""take the lead"" in managing compliance around face coverings to help combat Covid-19. The health paper suggested Naomi Long should oversee plans to raise compliance levels above 80%. She said the proposal was ""entirely inappropriate"". In Mr Swann's paper to ministers ahead of Monday's meeting, he suggested that a decision taken by the executive on 23 September encouraging employers to ""begin planning a gradual return to the workplace"" for employees should be reversed. The proposal goes on to say that the message should be communicated by stating that if a person worked from home when the pandemic began in March 2020 then ""they should be working from home now"". On Friday, Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride, said research had shown that working from home was ""one of the single most effective interventions"" to control the virus. Another proposal raised by the minister is a ""Covid score"" for businesses based on their compliance with regulations and Covid safety measures. Mr Swann said while this suggestion was dismissed as an option last year, he believes it should be revisited and has suggested the executive's Covid taskforce take on the development of such a scheme. Mr Swann has advised more enforcement is needed against those breaching Covid-19 restrictions The document also advises ensuring enforcement against those breaching existing Covid restrictions, including people who do not comply with wearing face coverings where they are legally required. Mr Swann said that since rules on mandatory face coverings in shops and public transport were introduced in summer 2020, only five fines had been issued to people for failing to follow the law. The minister added that unless enforcement was strengthened, the public would see ""compliance as unimportant and optional"". Most of the proposals in the paper are aimed at improving messaging and communication of current coronavirus advice.

"Robin Swann says closures may come if infections continue to rise, but it is not inevitable There is a possibility that hospitality venues may be asked to close over Christmas if Covid-19 cases continue to increase, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. But he told the Northern Ireland Assembly it was not ""inevitable"". Stormont ministers have met to discuss plans to help curb the spread of Covid-19 and will meet again on Tuesday. On Thursday, Mr Swann advisedanyone who worked from home when the pandemic began last year to do so again now. His document also suggested introducing a ""scores on the doors"" Covid compliance rating for businesses. Mr Swann said on Monday that ""if the current trajectory continues with regard to the increased cases we are seeing, we may once again face the possibility where venues are asked to close their doors during the Christmas season"". ""But let me be clear, it is not inevitable and I do not want to have to re-introduce further restrictions unless completely unavoidable,"" he added. Mr Swann also expressed disappointment that some hospitality venues had not acted responsibly after social distancing rules were relaxed. Allow Twitter content?

Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill tweeted that Mr Swann had presented a paper to ministers who met on Monday morning to consider it. She said that while the ""meeting was constructive and progress was made, it was agreed more work was needed"". ""The executive will meet again in the morning to finalise the approach,"" she added. Health Minister Robin Swann said he did not want to have to re-introduce further restrictions unless unavoidable Decisions on whether to strengthen current mitigations must first be agreed by the executive. Health officials believe the proposals could help reduce transmission of the virus. On Monday,three Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Irelandand a further 1,469 new cases. Northern Ireland's infection ratehas been climbing over the past week or so. It is currently the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland. Justice Minister Naomi Long said on Monday that the executive was ""not planning for Christmas closures"". ""We started off in terms of looking at vaccine certification as one means of trying to ensure that we drive down transmission and as those who are in more high-risk environments are less likely to become seriously ill as a result, that's one means of keeping the doors open on businesses,"" she added. ""We've been considering the paper today around how we actually try to get the basics right and get people to comply with things like handwashing, wearing masks, trying to voluntarily reduce their number of close contacts, trying to ensure where people can work from home they do work from home. ""Our focus at the minute is not on closure but on trying to keep businesses open."" Ms O'Neill said on Twitter that it was ""vitally important that all executive ministers work together to get us through this difficult period"". ""It's time to redouble our efforts to limit the spread of the virus, protect lives and our hospital system,"" she added. I think this was the strongest warning from Robin Swann that unless people do change their ways, it is not inevitable, but a distinct possibility [that venues may be asked to close]. If we are talking about carrot and stick, I think that is potentially the stick. Mr Swann will hope that hits home, because nobody wants that to happen. Certainly the people who run these establishments don't want it to happen. People would like a Christmas, but Robin Swann is saying people have got to change their ways. Last week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, thenmore ""severe"" restrictions could be required before Christmas. Stormont ministers have said they do not want to have to impose tougher mitigations that could damage trade. They have already agreed to put in placeproof of Covid status for certain sectors, which will become enforceable from 13 December. The plan means people will have to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or proof of a negative coronavirus test result to access nightclubs, pubs, cinemas, theatres and restaurants. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had voted against the proposals but Mr Swann and other Stormont ministers said the use of Covid status certification would save lives. The health minister suggests plans to encourage employees to return to the workplace should be reversed DUP ministers had said they wanted to see other measures explored by health officials, which could also help reduce the number of Covid cases. At present, executive advice on working from home is that people should continue to do so where they can. Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI? Tough Covid choices return - but what's the data? Meanwhile,Northern Ireland's justice minister has raised concerns about a proposal for her departmentto ""take the lead"" in managing compliance around face coverings to help combat Covid-19. The health paper suggested Naomi Long should oversee plans to raise compliance levels above 80%. She said the proposal was ""entirely inappropriate"". In Mr Swann's paper to ministers ahead of Monday's meeting, he suggested that a decision taken by the executive on 23 September encouraging employers to ""begin planning a gradual return to the workplace"" for employees should be reversed. The proposal goes on to say that the message should be communicated by stating that if a person worked from home when the pandemic began in March 2020 then ""they should be working from home now"". On Friday, Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride, said research had shown that working from home was ""one of the single most effective interventions"" to control the virus. Another proposal raised by the minister is a ""Covid score"" for businesses based on their compliance with regulations and Covid safety measures. Mr Swann said while this suggestion was dismissed as an option last year, he believes it should be revisited and has suggested the executive's Covid taskforce take on the development of such a scheme. Mr Swann has advised more enforcement is needed against those breaching Covid-19 restrictions The document also advises ensuring enforcement against those breaching existing Covid restrictions, including people who do not comply with wearing face coverings where they are legally required. Mr Swann said that since rules on mandatory face coverings in shops and public transport were introduced in summer 2020, only five fines had been issued to people for failing to follow the law. The minister added that unless enforcement was strengthened, the public would see ""compliance as unimportant and optional"". Most of the proposals in the paper are aimed at improving messaging and communication of current coronavirus advice. Mr Swann is also understood to have said in his paper that communications on public health are ""much more effective when delivered with a united voice by all executive ministers"".

"New homes and buildings in England will be required by law to install electric vehicle charging points from next year, the prime minister has announced. The government said the move will see up to 145,000 charging points installed across the country each year. New-build supermarkets, workplaces and buildings undergoing major renovations will also come under the new law. The move comes as the UK aims to switch to electric cars, with new petrol and diesel cars sales banned from 2030. Announcing the new laws at the Confederation of British Industry's conference on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK was going to ""radically"" change its cars, trucks, buses and other modes of transport. ""The force driving that change won't be government, it won't even be business...it will be the consumer. It will be the young people of today, who can see the consequences of climate change and will be demanding better from us."" But Labour said the announcement does not address the ""appalling"" geographical divide in available charging points. ""London and the South East have more public car charging points than the rest of England and Wales combined. Yet there is nothing here to help address this. ""Nor is there help so lower and middle income families can afford electric vehicles or the investment required to build the gigafactories we need,"" Labour said. The government said the new laws will ""make it as easy as refuelling a petrol or diesel car today"". It said ""simpler ways to pay"" to charge vehicles through contactless payments would also be introduced at ""all new fast and rapid charge points"". Britain currently has about 25,000 charging points, but the Competition and Markets Authority has said it could need 10 times as many before 2030. The switch to electric vehicles is part of the UK's strategy to hit climate targets, with cars and taxis accounting for 16% of UK emissions in 2019. Several major car manufacturers, such as Jaguar and Volvo plan to go all electric from 2025 and 2030 and Ford has said all vehicles sold in Europe will be electric by 2030. However, four of the world's biggest carmakers, Volkswagen, Toyota, Renault-Nissan and Hyundai-Kia failed to sign aCOP 26 summit pledge to only sell zero emissions cars and vans by 2035. UK electric car sales are growing, with about 10% of cars sold in 2020 being electric, up from 2.5% in 2018. However, concerns have been raised about the lack of charging infrastructure. The Policy Exchange think tank has warned the rollout of charging points has fallen behind and said there is a risk of ""charging blackspots"" in small towns and rural areas unless it speeds up. MPs on the Transport Select Committee have also said people must be protected from excessive pricing for public electric car charging,with home charging being much cheaper. Mike Childs, Friends of the Earth's head of policy, welcomed the government's announcement, adding that electric vehicles had a ""significant role to play in building a zero-carbon future"". ""New housing should also include secure cycle storage and access to high quality public transport, to provide real alternatives to driving and help cut congestion,"" Mr Childs added. Along with its announcement on charging points, the government also confirmed almost Â£10m will fund a new hydrogen project at the UK's largest onshore windfarm near Glasgow. The cash injection will help the Whitelee green hydrogen project develop the UK's largest electrolyser, a system which converts water into hydrogen gas as a way to store energy and supply local transport providers with zero-carbon fuel.

"WhatsApp is rewriting its privacy policy as a result of a huge data protection fine earlier this year. Following an investigation, the Irish data protection watchdog issued a â¬225m (Â£190m) fine - the second-largest in history over GDPR - and ordered WhatsApp to change its policies. WhatsApp is appealing against the fine, but is amending its policy documents in Europe and the UK to comply. However, it insists that nothing about its actual service is changing. Instead, the tweaks are designed to ""add additional detail around our existing practices"", and will only appear in the European version of the privacy policy, which is already different from the version that applies in the rest of the world. ""There are no changes to our processes or contractual agreements with users, and users will not be required to agree to anything or to take any action in order to continue using WhatsApp,"" the company said, announcing the change. The new policy takes effect immediately. In January, WhatsApp users complained about an update to the company's terms that many believed would result in data being shared with parent company Facebook, which is now called Meta. Many thought refusing to agree to the new terms and conditions would result in their accounts being blocked. In reality, very little had changed. However, WhatsApp was forced todelay its changes and spend monthsfighting the public perception to the contrary. During the confusion,millions of users downloaded WhatsApp competitors such as Signal. WhatsApp issued second-largest GDPR fine WhatsApp launches privacy campaign after backlash Writing about the new tweaks required by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), WhatsApp directly addressed those kinds of concerns. ""This update does not change how we process, use or share user data with anyone, including Meta, nor does it change how we operate our service,"" it wrote. And ""users will not be required to agree to anything new or to take any action in order to keep using WhatsApp"", it added. The company was also keen to stress that its service is, and continues to be, end-to-end encrypted, meaning messages can only be read by the sender and recipient. The new privacy policy contains substantially more information about what exactly is done with users' information, and how WhatsApp works with Meta, the parent company for WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. The fine handed to WhatsApp in September was the result of a years-long investigation into whether the social media giant was transparent enough about how it handles user information. This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? The Irish DPC had originally found against WhatsApp in some areas and not others, and proposed a fine of between â¬30m-50m. But after it consulted with other EU nations' regulators as part of the process, it reassessed the amount. OnlyAmazon has been issued a larger GDPR fine. WhatsApp continues to appeal against the decision, saying it believes that it had always provided the required information to its users.

"This video can not be played CBI boss Tony Danker says economic growth should be across the UK Economic growth must be evenly spread around the UK rather than concentrated in south-east England, the boss of the CBI business group has said. Speaking at the CBI's annual conference, director general Tony Danker said that ""levelling up"" could not be left to the free market. He added ""high-valued"" sectors, firms and jobs were needed across the UK. Boris Johnson told the same conference levelling up was still his ""moral mission"" and an ""economic imperative"". The prime minister also defendedthe scaled-back plans for rail in the North, insisting the government's new schemes would still be ""transformatory"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer outlined ""five fiscal rules"" at the CBI conference that the next Labour government intended to follow, saying the Conservatives had ""missed an opportunity to remake Britain"" with the autumn Budget. Mr Danker told the CBI conference that the headquarters of many businesses were currently ""too often based in London and theâ¯Southâ¯East"", with the UK operatingâ¯asâ¯a ""branch line economy"", showing that the free market had failed to create prosperity across the country. But he said the rise of new industries such as biotech provided the opportunity for a ""new industrial revolution"" across the UK and ""a shot at redemption"". ""For five decades we've had no idea how to [tackle the divide], but now we've got industries like clean and renewable energy, life sciences, cyber-security and they don't have to be based in the South East,"" Mr Danker told the BBC's Today programme earlier on Monday. UK growth slows as supply issues hit the recovery Fairer, greener economy 'offers prizes for all' The CBI is concerned that old industries such as textiles in Lancashire, shipbuilding on the Clyde, and steel in Sheffield have been allowed to ""die"" since the 1980s. It also disagrees with the government's decision to scrap the Leeds leg of the HS2 high-speed rail line, which was originally billed as being key to levelling up. Last week, the government dropped plans to extend the HS2 line to Leeds and said the Northern Powerhouse Rail route from Liverpool to Leeds would run partly on existing lines rather than new ones. Many cities became known for the industries which operate in them, such as steel production in Sheffield The CBI also thinks firms should be encouraged to cluster in towns, and should have more power in decisions over local infrastructure and in coming up with economic strategies. Mr Danker told the Today programme: ""I do think we need a much firmer, more ambitious growth strategy from the government. ""At the end of the day, if we [the UK] don't get growth up back to our pre-crisis, pre 2008 growth rates, what we're going to have is cuts to spending, rises in taxes, so growth has to be the North Star."" Speaking at the same conference, the prime minister acknowledged there were ""chronic problems"" underlying the UK economy, including the imbalance between firms which were ""go-getting world-beaters"" and the ""long comet tail"" of firms which lacked the necessary skills and investment to boost productivity. But he said levelling-up was achievable and would help the UK become a bigger economy than Germany. ""If this country could achieve the same kind of geographical balance and dispersion of growth and wealth that you find in most of our most successful economic comparators, and if all our businesses could reach more balance in their levels of productivity, then there would be absolutely no stopping us. ""We would achieve - what I believe we can - and become the biggest and most successful economy in Europe."" Labour's Sir Keir told the CBI conference that the next Labour government would make a ""contract"" with business where it made fiscal discipline and investment into skills a priority. ""What we need now is a sector-by-sector plan, for the car industry, for the steel industry, for all industry - our competitors are already doing it, we can't afford not to,"" he said. ""This is our side of the contract - to run a stable government and a tight ship, to equip the next generation for work, to invest in British business and to create a wave of high-skilled jobs.""

"Mark Drakeford (left) had been in talks with Plaid Cymru's Adam Price over the deal Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru's co-operation agreement in the Senedd is set to last for ""the coming three years"". The deal aims to ""address issues which take the greatest political and policy effort to resolve"". It includes a plan to get independent advice onbringing the net zero target date from 2050 to 2035. Both parties said they would also support plans to increase the size of the Senedd. In the document, seen by BBC Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said they would support an expansion from 60 to ""80 to 100 members"", a voting system ""which is as proportional - or more - than the current one"" and to introduce gender quotas in law. Once a cross-party group has finisheddrawing up policies for a Senedd reform bill, Labour and Plaid Cymru promise to introduce the draft law ""12 to 18 months"" later. Mr Drakeford said the deal would give the ""stability we need in the Senedd to go on delivering for Wales"", while Mr Price said the parties were taking a ""historic step forward together"". There is an aim to ""work towards the creation of Ynni Cymru, a publicly owned energy company for Wales, over the next two years, to expand community-owned renewable energy generation"". Labour and Plaid Cymru approve Senedd deal New group to work on plans for bigger Senedd Council tax could change under a Labour-Plaid deal Major reform to post-EU farm subsidies in Waleswill not be brought in until 2025. The parties have agreed to ""introduce a transition period as we reform the system of farm payments so stability payments will continue to be a feature of the Sustainable Farming Scheme during and beyond this Senedd term"" as the parties agree ""the longer-term arrangements for Welsh agriculture"". The co-operation agreement promises to ""commission an independent review of the local government section 19 and Natural Resources Wales reports""into the widespread flooding across south Wales after Storm Dennis last February. Other policies featuring in the 11-page document include: Asking Transport for Wales ""to explore the development of transport links between north and south Wales Invest more in flood management and mitigation Working with farmers to improve water and air quality Aim to change the school year and school day Develop a new culture strategy Introduce a new law around Welsh language education Extend Welsh language standards to more public bodies Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru's ruling bodiesboth approved the deal on Saturday. The deal could still be scuppered if, against expectations, Plaid members vote against it at the party's virtual conference on the weekend. The deal includes a pledge to extend free school meals to all primary school pupils, andexpand the free childcare offer for two-year-olds. Some families told researchers the free childcare scheme had saved them hundreds of pounds The deal includes a cap on second and holiday home numbers, a commitment to work towards parity of ""reward and recognition"" for health and care workers, and to reform building safety and provide more cash to help people in flats with cladding problems. Other policies, already reported, include introducing local tourism taxes, publishing proposals on rent controls to make properties affordable for locals, reforming housing law to end homelessness and plans to change council tax. The first minister has previously explained the talks were necessary because Welsh Labour has no overall majority to deal with ""challenging and ambitious issues""as it has 30 of the 60 seats in Cardiff Bay. The deal would not amount to a coalition between the parties, and Plaid Cymru members of the Senedd will not be entering government. But BBC Wales has been told Plaid would be able to appoint special advisers to work on the deal in government. A Welsh Conservatives spokesman said the ""deal is remarkable for its absence of solutions to fix the NHS - currently experiencing its worst performance on record - or improve the economy in Wales"". ""Labour's latest deal with the nationalists does not deliver on the priorities of working families across Wales, and will only cause constitutional chaos that risks holding back our economic recovery,"" he added. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Mr Drakeford said: ""The chance to work with other parties wherever we have shared and common interests is something that has been here in the Senedd since the start of devolution and this agreement means we can continue to do that here in Wales. ""Today's agreement is a bespoke deal, this type of agreement has not been done before in the way that we are committed to doing."" ""My focus and the focus of the government is on those bread and butter issues, which improve people's every day lives and which will help Wales to recover from this long pandemic."" Mr Price said: ""Through it we plant together the seed beneath the snow of a new society, a new Wales, a new beginning."" He added the party leaders ""continue to disagree on many things"", but have an ""ability to come together on some things"". Mr Price also criticised the ""selfishness and greed"" of Westminster and said Wales would be a ""beacon of hope, progress and civility"". This agreement has been a long time coming and it is extremely wide-ranging, which demonstrates just how much Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru have in common in their political outlook. But some commitments are aspirational in tone and throw forward well beyond the scope of the three-year deal. Plans to enlarge the Senedd are there, but Labour hasn't committed to a more proportional voting system. Some of the potentially big - and difficult -reforms being promise, such as council tax and social care for example, don't give much of a clue as to how the parties hope to get there. While this is not a coalition, Adam Price has argued for some Plaid special advisers in Welsh government to keep up momentum on this plan. But momentum is key for Mark Drakeford, too - remember, he has said he's stepping down midway through this term. If he wants legacy projects, like a fundamental reform of council tax - the nettle that no-one grasps because finding an alternative is so politically tricky - the clock is ticking.

"This video can not be played Watch: Water cannons and tear gas fired at Covid protesters in Brussels Austria has returned to a full national lockdown as protests against new restrictions aimed at curbing Covid-19 infections spread across Europe. From midnight, Austrians have been asked to work from home and non-essential shops have closed. New restrictions have sparked protests throughout Europe. People clashed with police in the Netherlands and Belgium. Infection rates have risen sharply on the continent, prompting warnings from the World Health Organization (WHO). On Saturday WHO regional directorDr Hans Kluge told the BBCthat unless measures were tightened across Europe - such as on vaccines, wearing masks and with Covid passes for venues - half a million more deaths could be recorded by next spring. Last week Austria became the first European country to make Covid vaccination a legal requirement, with the law due to take effect in February. Politicians in neighbouring Germany are debating similar measures as intensive care units there fill up and case numbers hit fresh records. This is Austria's fourth national lockdown since the pandemic began. Authorities have ordered residents to stay home for all but essential reasons, including work, exercise and shopping for food. Restaurants, bars, hairdressers, theatres and non-essential shops must all close their doors. These measures will continue until 12 December, although officials said they will be reassessed after 10 days. Speaking on ORF TV on Sunday night, health minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said the government had to ""react now"". Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? ""A lockdown, a relatively tough method, a sledgehammer, is the only option to reduce the numbers [of infections] here,"" he told the broadcaster. Tens of thousands of people protested in the capital Vienna ahead of the lockdown. Brandishing national flags and banners reading ""Freedom"", protesters shouted ""Resistance!"" and booed the police. Rallies against Austria's new Covid-19 measures were held over the weekend Resinger Harald, a 62-year-old from the southern Carinthia region, is fully vaccinated and feels the lockdown is not necessary. ""It will hurt some of the smaller businesses severely and they might run into financial difficulties,"" she told the BBC. Jennifer Wall, a British woman who moved to Vienna about two years ago, has also been double-jabbed. She described the protests over the weekend as ""disruptive"" and ""scary"". ""The situation here is really tense,"" she said. ""There is a clear divide between vaccinated and not vaccinated."" About 65% of Austria's population is fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in Western Europe. The country's daily vaccination rate has risen sharply in November, but some people are still hesitant. In Vienna, one unvaccinated woman told the BBC that Austria's plan to make vaccinations compulsory amounted to a ""restriction of human rights"". ""It's always a person's choice,"" she said. Several European countries saw angry protests against tougher restrictions turn violent over the weekend. InBelgium'scapital, Brussels, demonstrators clashed with police after tens of thousands of people marched through the city centre. Protesters are mainly opposed to Covid passes that stop the unvaccinated from entering cafes, restaurants and entertainment venues. The march started peacefully but some launched stones and fireworks at officers, who responded with tear gas and water cannon. Across the border inthe Netherlands, rioting took place for the third night in a row. Local media report that police arrested 15 people in the southern city of Roosendaal where a primary school was set ablaze. An emergency order has also been imposed in the town of Enschede to keep people off the streets overnight.

That followedwhat Rotterdam's mayor called ""an orgy of violence"" on Friday, when officers opened fire after protesters threw rocks and fireworks and set police cars ablaze. Four people thought to have been hit by police bullets remain in hospital, authorities said on Sunday. The Netherlands is under a three-week nationwide partial lockdown, forcing restaurants to shut earlier and banning fans at sports events. Protesters are also angry at a ban on fireworks on New Year's Eve and government plans to introduce a vaccine pass for indoor venues. Thousands of demonstrators were also on the streets inCroatia'scapital Zagreb on Saturday, while inDenmarkaround 1,000 people protested in Copenhagen against government plans to order public sector workers to be vaccinated in order to enter workplaces. TheFrenchCaribbean department of Guadeloupe, meanwhile, has been rocked by three days of looting and vandalism, over a mandatory vaccine order for health workers as well as high fuel prices. Some 38 people were reportedly arrested and special police forces were sent to the island on Sunday in a bid to quell the unrest after protesters ransacked and torched shops.

"This video can not be played Footage of the parade shows a red SUV driving into a school marching band at high speed At least five people have been killed and more than 40 injured after a car ploughed into a Christmas parade in the US state of Wisconsin, police say. School bands and a dance troupe of grannies were among those marching through the city of Waukesha when a red SUV came speeding down the road. It hit dozens of people, including children. One person is in custody. The incident does not appear ""at this time"" to be an act of terrorism, one official said. Warning: This article contains upsetting content. The suspect appeared to have been fleeing another scene - possibly a knife fight - when he ran into people at the parade, the law enforcement official, who is familiar with the early findings of the investigation, told the BBC's US partner CBS News. It is unclear if the individual in custody was the driver of the vehicle. Local resident Angelito Tenorio toldthe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper,externalhe had just finished marching in the parade when the SUV ""put the pedal to the metal and just [started] zooming full speed along the parade route"" at about 16:40 (22:40 GMT) on Sunday. ""Then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle,"" he said. Corey Montiho said his daughter's dance team was hit by the SUV. ""There were pom-poms and shoes and spilled hot chocolate everywhere. I had to go from one crumpled body to the other to find my daughter,"" he told the paper. Sarah Saldivar, who was at the parade with her two young children, told CBS News she saw ""a red blur"" and then saw ""little girls flying through the air"". The parade in Waukesha - a community of about 72,000 located to the west of Milwaukee - is traditionally held every year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, and includes fancy dress, floats, dancers and marching bands. This year's theme was ""comfort and joy"". Families lined the sides of the road to watch the event, which was returning after a year's absence due to the coronavirus pandemic. One video shared on social media shows the car crashing at high speed through street barriers, while another shows the vehicle driving into what looks like a group of musicians. Police officers ran down the street during the incident, telling people to take shelter in shops. Police chief Dan Thompson told reporters that officers had fired at the car to try to stop it. Jason Kellner told the New York Times newspaper he had just watched his son go past with his school marching band when the car came towards the crowd and ""started mowing people down"". ""I've never felt a worse feeling; wondering what I'm going to find when I get to my kid,"" he said. Mr Kellner found his son standing unharmed at the side of the road, but saw several injured people and pulled a bloody saxophone off the street. Another witness told Milwaukee's Fox6 TV station that there was silence, followed by screaming, running and checking on those injured after the vehicle hit a dance team of girls aged between about nine and 15. Video posted online showed the vehicle as it was about to hit the parade in Waukesha The Milwaukee Dancing Grannies said some of its members ""were impacted and we are waiting for word on their conditions"". ""Please keep the Grannies, all those injured, and all those who witnessed this horrible event in your thoughts and prayers,""the group wrote on its Facebook page,external. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee said one of its priests, multiple parishioners and students at a local Catholic school were among the injured. Photos of a red SUV with a crumpled bonnet parked in a driveway wereposted on Twitter by TV station CBS 58,external. Chief Thompson said officers had recovered a ""suspect vehicle"" and a person of interest was in custody, but gave no further details. He added that the investigation was ""very fluid"". Officials in Waukesha warned that the number of fatalities and injuries could change as additional information is collected. They said some people had transported themselves to local hospitals. Emergency responders and passers-by attended to injured people Fire chief Steven Howard told reporters that his department had taken 11 adults and 12 children to nearby hospitals after the incident. The Children's Wisconsin hospital said it had received 15 patients as of 20:00, while the Aurora Medical Center-Summit said it was treating 13 people, including three in a critical condition. Mayor Shawn Reilly described the incident as a ""horrible, senseless tragedy"". ""I am deeply saddened to know that so many in our community went to a parade but ended up dealing with injury and heartache,"" he said. The White House has said President Joe Biden is being regularly updated on the incident and has offered support to local officials. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff across the state in honour of the victims. Waukesha's public schools will be closed on Monday, and counselling services have been made available to those affected. A community fund has been created to help victims of the incident.

"This video can not be played CBI boss Tony Danker says economic growth should be across the UK Economic growth must be evenly spread around the UK rather than concentrated in south-east England, the boss of the CBI business group has said. Speaking at the CBI's annual conference, director general Tony Danker said that ""levelling up"" could not be left to the free market. He added ""high-valued"" sectors, firms and jobs were needed across the UK. Boris Johnson told the same conference levelling up was still his ""moral mission"" and an ""economic imperative"". The prime minister also defendedthe scaled-back plans for rail in the North, insisting the government's new schemes would still be ""transformatory"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer outlined ""five fiscal rules"" at the CBI conference that the next Labour government intended to follow, saying the Conservatives had ""missed an opportunity to remake Britain"" with the autumn Budget. Mr Danker told the CBI conference that the headquarters of many businesses were currently ""too often based in London and theâ¯Southâ¯East"", with the UK operatingâ¯asâ¯a ""branch line economy"", showing that the free market had failed to create prosperity across the country. But he said the rise of new industries such as biotech provided the opportunity for a ""new industrial revolution"" across the UK and ""a shot at redemption"". ""For five decades we've had no idea how to [tackle the divide], but now we've got industries like clean and renewable energy, life sciences, cyber-security and they don't have to be based in the South East,"" Mr Danker told the BBC's Today programme earlier on Monday. UK growth slows as supply issues hit the recovery Fairer, greener economy 'offers prizes for all' The CBI is concerned that old industries such as textiles in Lancashire, shipbuilding on the Clyde, and steel in Sheffield have been allowed to ""die"" since the 1980s. It also disagrees with the government's decision to scrap the Leeds leg of the HS2 high-speed rail line, which was originally billed as being key to levelling up. Last week, the government dropped plans to extend the HS2 line to Leeds and said the Northern Powerhouse Rail route from Liverpool to Leeds would run partly on existing lines rather than new ones. Many cities became known for the industries which operate in them, such as steel production in Sheffield The CBI also thinks firms should be encouraged to cluster in towns, and should have more power in decisions over local infrastructure and in coming up with economic strategies. Mr Danker told the Today programme: ""I do think we need a much firmer, more ambitious growth strategy from the government. ""At the end of the day, if we [the UK] don't get growth up back to our pre-crisis, pre 2008 growth rates, what we're going to have is cuts to spending, rises in taxes, so growth has to be the North Star."" Speaking at the same conference, the prime minister acknowledged there were ""chronic problems"" underlying the UK economy, including the imbalance between firms which were ""go-getting world-beaters"" and the ""long comet tail"" of firms which lacked the necessary skills and investment to boost productivity. But he said levelling-up was achievable and would help the UK become a bigger economy than Germany. ""If this country could achieve the same kind of geographical balance and dispersion of growth and wealth that you find in most of our most successful economic comparators, and if all our businesses could reach more balance in their levels of productivity, then there would be absolutely no stopping us. ""We would achieve - what I believe we can - and become the biggest and most successful economy in Europe."" Labour's Sir Keir told the CBI conference that the next Labour government would make a ""contract"" with business where it made fiscal discipline and investment into skills a priority. ""What we need now is a sector-by-sector plan, for the car industry, for the steel industry, for all industry - our competitors are already doing it, we can't afford not to,"" he said. ""This is our side of the contract - to run a stable government and a tight ship, to equip the next generation for work, to invest in British business and to create a wave of high-skilled jobs.""
