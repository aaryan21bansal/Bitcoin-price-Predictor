"This video can not be played Chloe Ayling: ""I've been through a terrifying experience"" Model Chloe Ayling says she feels ""vindicated"" after the man she accused of kidnapping her was convicted and jailed for almost 17 years. Ms Ayling was lured to Italy from London on the promise of a photo shoot by Lucasz Herba, who drugged her and took her to a farmhouse in a holdall. Herba, 30, held her there for six days in July 2017, and demanded a 300,000 Euro (Â£265,000) ransom. The Polish national was jailed following a trial at a court in Milan. The court heard he offered Ms Ayling for sale online, before handing her over to the British consulate. Herba - described by prosecutors as a ""narcissist and a fantasist who was obsessed with Miss Ayling"" - was also found guilty of attempted extortion and carrying false documents. He was jailed for 16 years and nine months. Herba had claimed Ms Ayling went with him willingly, which she denied. At the start of the trial in February, a police officer told the court that Ms Ayling had suffered mental and physical abuse during the six-day ordeal. Lucasz Herba was sentenced at a court in Milan following a trial Her agent Adrian Sington said: ""This has been an incredible burden on her shoulders for the last year in the face of media criticism of her motivation and this is vindication - her story is true. ""It means now she can get on with her life. It's hard if you're being painted in the press as a liar and now she's able to say, 'I know it's a bizarre story but it's a true one'."" He called Herba a ""psychopath and a narcissist"" who ""behaves in such a way that it's almost impossible to believe that someone could be so stupid"". ""So, in some ways, it's not surprising that the media found Chloe's story difficult to believe,"" he said. ""Let's not forget she was bundled into a suitcase, injected with ketamine in the boot of a car and thought she was going to die."" The BBC's Gavin Lee said Herba orchestrated ""an extraordinary kidnap plot"" in an attempt to win the model's affections. Herba, who lived in Oldbury, West Midlands, posed as a photographer in July last year and lured the 20-year-model, from Coulsdon, south London, to a fake studio in Milan. He then injected Ms Ayling with the tranquilliser drug ketamine. Herba was jailed for 16 years and nine months She was stripped, handcuffed, placed in a holdall bag and driven 120 miles (193km) in the boot of a car to a remote farmhouse near Turin. The model was held captive for six days. It was heard in court that Herba then pretended to be from a group called the Black Death, involved with selling models as sex slaves in Saudi Arabia, but ultimately released Ms Ayling after discovering she had a child. Our correspondent added: ""This, according to the prosecution, was another elaborate lie, set up in an attempt to win the model's sympathy and affection before releasing her."" In his defence, Herba said he had previously met Ms Ayling and had fallen in love with her. He claimed he wanted to create a scandal to help her career by creating extra publicity. Herba said that he was inspired after watching the film By Any Means - in which a similar kidnap plot was carried out. The court ruled out any involvement from Ms Ayling. Herba's brother Michal is alleged to have been involved in the kidnap and is in the process of being extradited from the UK. He denies any involvement.

"If a woman decides not to breastfeed her baby it is her choice and must be respected, midwives are being told. The Royal College of Midwives' new position statement makes it explicitly clear that women should be supported if, after being given advice, information and support, they opt to bottle feed using formula milk. Although breast is best, often some women struggle to start or sustain breastfeeding, says the RCM. Informed choice must be promoted. TheNational Childbirth Trust,externalsays women can experience unacceptable levels of pressure however they feed their babies - from family and friends, as well as from people they hardly know. Mothers who breastfeed their babies often feel pressurised and constrained about whether, where, how often, and how long they breastfeed. Similarly, mothers who use formula milk often feel judged or guilty too, particularly - but not only - if they planned to breastfeed. Quarter of mums made 'uncomfortable breastfeeding in public Paying mothers to breastfeed Hospital's 'artificial feeding' letter to mothers criticised Are there downsides to 'breast is best'? Researchers at Liverpool University studied the experiences of more than 1,600 new mums in 2016. Among the 890 who did formula feeding, 67% reported feeling guilty, 68% felt stigmatised and 76% felt the need to defend their feeding choice. Similar emotions were less common but still present among the breastfeeding mums, particularly for those who supplemented breastfeeding with formula. Investigator Dr Victoria Fallon, from the university's school of psychology, said: ""We looked at a range of emotions and found that women who started exclusively breastfeeding but then stopped were most likely to feel guilty, while those who bottle-fed from birth often felt stigma."" Nicola Kay had a very difficult birth, but wanted to breastfeed her son Ethan. It took several days for her milk came through. ""He was crying and sleeping a lot because he wasn't getting the food he needed,"" she said. Nicola and Ethan ""Most of the midwives were insistent that I continue to breastfeed, but then in the middle of the night he wouldn't stop crying, and I couldn't feed him. ""A midwife came in and asked me if I wanted to give him some formula. I did and I felt a mixture of guilt and relief that he was eating."" The 32-year-old did begin expressing milk, but she had to feed her son from a bottle rather than a breast. ""I was given loads of advice, but in the end it just wasn't happening and I thought the best thing to do was feed with formula."" The scientist from North Wales said she did not receive the same support when she switched to formula, and added: ""It felt like I'd been abandoned. ""No-one said I'd made the wrong choice, but it was hinted that I made the wrong choice."" Tabby, 33 and from North London, wanted to breastfeed exclusively but was worried that her son, Arthur, was not putting on enough weight. Tabby and Arthur ""I tried for three weeks. It was incredibly stressful. You feel like you're not providing for your child. I felt like I was failing him."" Tabby spoke with her midwife who organised for a breastfeeding advisor to visit her and Arthur at home. ""That gave me the confidence to know what I had been doing was right. I was feeding properly, but Arthur still wasn't putting on enough weight. We ended up putting him on some formula as well as breast milk. They were concerned that he might have dairy intolerance so I also stopped drinking milk and eating any dairy. ""I'm so glad the midwife acted quickly. By giving some formula it helped me continue to breastfeed Arthur."" Keilly, from London, says she was given conflicting advice about how to feed her baby girl, Amelie. Amelie, aged six months in this photo with her mum, Keilly, is now 22 months and has recently stopped breastfeeding ""One health visitor told me I should top Amelie up with formula because she was underweight, but another one said I absolutely should not put her on a bottle. It was so confusing. ""I think it's hard for first-time mums to know what to do for the best. In the end, we gave Amelie one bottle a day and did the rest with breastfeeding. With hindsight, we probably didn't need to and could have stuck with exclusive breastfeeding instead, but it worked for us as a family."" The UK has one of the lowest rates of breastfeeding in Europe. Although most new mothers try it initially, less than half are still exclusively breastfeeding when their baby is six weeks old. This drops to about 1% at six months,figures suggest,external. Experts recommend, whenever possible, babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of their life, and breastfeeding should continue for up to two years or beyond alongside introducing solid foods. But, ultimately, it should be the woman's choice, says the RCM. Proportion of infants breastfed at 6-8 weeks in England Chief Executive Gill Walton said: ""The RCM believes that women should be at the centre of their own care and as with other areas of maternity care, midwives and maternity support workers should promote informed choice. ""If, after being given appropriate information, advice and support on breastfeeding, a woman chooses not to do so, or to give formula as well as breastfeeding, her choice must be respected. ""We recognise that some women cannot or do not wish to breastfeed and rely on formula milk. They must be given all the advice and support they need on safe preparation of bottles and responsive feeding to develop a close and loving bond with their baby."" Dr Fallon says the advice is a step in the right direction, but she is concerned that current breastfeeding promotional strategies are not ""mum-friendly"" enough and can foster negative emotional experiences. ""We can't dispute the health benefits of breastfeeding, but in the UK we have one of the world's worst breastfeeding rates even though lots of women do say they want to breastfeed. ""Breastfeeding promotion needs to be accompanied by practical and emotional support."" TheNHS Start4Life website,externalhas useful tips on breastfeeding and infant nutrition.

"Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has said it will move production of its Land Rover Discovery SUV from the West Midlands to Slovakia from next year. The Solihull factory, where the Discovery is manufactured, will be used to build a new generation of Range Rover models, the firm said. The company warned that there may be some job losses in the UK as a result. JLR - which is owned by the Indian group Tata Motors - said that it remained ""committed to the UK"". The company has previously said all its cars would be available in either an electric, hybrid, petrol or diesel version from 2020. It has not put an exact figure on the level of investment in the Solihull plant, but it runs into hundreds of millions of pounds. Jaguar Land Rover profits fall as sales slow Jaguar Land Rover to shed 1,000 contract staff ""The potential losses of some agency employed staff in the UK is a tough one but forms part of our long-term manufacturing strategy as we transform our business globally,"" JLR said in a statement. There are 1,800 agency workers in the Solihull plant, out of a workforce of 10,000. Previously, JLR had said the manufacture of the Discovery would be split between Solihull and Slovakia. Professor David Bailey, motor industry specialist at Aston Business School, said if JLR was ""really committed"" to UK production and moving the Discovery did ""pave the way"" for other models to be built in the West Midlands, then that was a ""good thing"". ""But at the moment, JLR has not told us what other models this will open the door to, and what level of investment they are pledging at Solihull."" He said given previous job losses at JLR and production cut backs at Castle Bromwich this latest development was ""arguably further negative news"". ""We need to know how many jobs, what other models this will open the door to and what level of investment they are talking about,"" he added. Steve McCabe, business expert at Birmingham City University, said the ""silver lining"" to the latest announcement was that Tata had said it would increase its production of electric cars in Solihull. ""But at the same time, we can talk about the statistics and the numbers of jobs lost, but for many families this news will be truly devastating. ""Every day we seem to hear more about job losses and closures and as Brexit moves closer and closer in the horizon, it'll be even more difficult to predict where we will be in a year's time,"" he added. JLR's latest annual results revealed that in the year to 31 March its pre-tax profits fell to Â£1.5bn, down from Â£1.6bn the previous year, because of slower sales growth and rising business investment. And while overall annual sales grew 1.7%, helped by strong demand in China, UK sales fell by 12.8%, and European sales also declined. The company blamed the sharp fall in UK sales on ""consumer uncertainty surrounding diesel models, Brexit and vehicle taxation"". Car production leaving the UK for Slovakia looks like bad news. Originally the Slovakia plant was meant to ""complement"" UK production of the Discovery. Now it will replace it entirely - with the likely loss of hundreds more agency workers at Solihull on top of the 1,000 layoffs announced last month. Jaguar Land Rover says this is merely clearing space at Solihull to produce a new range of hybrid and electric powered Range Rovers - cars of the future. In time more workers will be added as production ramps up. The company described the decision as part of their long-term strategic planning. Company insiders say Brexit was not a factor - and added that most of the new Range Rovers built in Solihull will be exported to non-EU countries anyway. Nevertheless, it also said it was a ""tough"" decision. Acknowledgement that shuffling the pack of global car production is never without casualties.

"Half of England's Â£8.6bn children's services budget is being spent on just 73,000 of the most serious cases - those in care, analysis reveals. The rest of the money is spent on the remaining 11.7 million children, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The children's commissioner said help reached many children too late, leading to more ending up in violent street gangs, in care or in the courts system. The government said it was spending a record amount on education. The report, Public Spending on Children in England: 2000 to 2020, commissioned by the children's commissioner, is published at a time when gang violence is in the spotlight after a wave of shootings and stabbings in London. It said while public spending on children overall had been broadly maintained over the past 20 years, millions of vulnerable children were missing out. This was, it said, because of the huge cost of helping the relatively small number of children in extreme crisis and the fact authorities and agencies were focusing on providing the statutory services required by law. Meanwhile, the report added, spending on youth services and prevention had been cut by 60% over the past decade. Children's commissioner for England Anne Longfield said: ""While every child should receive the support they need, the economic and social costs of this current strategy are unsustainable. ""The cost to the state is ultimately greater than it should be and the cost to those vulnerable children missing out on support will last a lifetime. ""Every day we are seeing the consequences of helping children too late - in pressures on the family courts system, special schools and the care system, and in the spiralling numbers of school exclusions and the consequent increase in younger and younger children linked to violent street gangs. ""Children do not arrive in extreme need overnight and many could be prevented from getting to that point if we helped them sooner in a more effective way. ""We are, in effect, attempting to manage and contain crisis in children's lives after allowing it to escalate."" Councillor Richard Watts, who chairs the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said it had warned that the current situation facing children's services was ""unsustainable"". ""Last year saw the biggest annual increase in children in care numbers since 2010, and councils are now starting more than 500 child protection investigations every day on average,"" he said. Nick Brook, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""Schools and colleges are now using their own impossibly tight budgets to make up for cuts to children's health and social care services. And most young people are losing out in some way or another. ""As the report says, we are attempting to manage and contain crises in children's lives after allowing them to escalate."" A government spokesperson said: ""This report recognises the government is maintaining the amount spent on children's services, spending a record amount on education and making more than Â£200bn available to councils up to 2020 for local services, including those for children and young people. ""We are reviewing school exclusions to make sure they are only used as a last resort and this government has launched a new Serious Violence Strategy which puts a stronger focus on steering young people away from violence through early intervention. ""A further Â£200m programme is supporting councils to develop innovative ways to improve the lives of vulnerable children and families.""

"The German government has ordered car maker Daimler to recall 238,000 vehicles in Germany after they were found to be fitted with illegal software that masks diesel emissions. Across Europe a total of 774,000 diesel vehicles contain ""defeat devices"" and Daimler said it would recall them all. The diesel versions of the Mercedes C-Class, Vito and GLC models are the main ones affected, the ministry said. Daimler said it would refit the software but denied any wrongdoing. It comes three years after VW admitted having fitted ""cheat"" devices in vehicles that made their engines appear less polluting than they actually were. About eleven million cars worldwide were affected in that case. German transport minister Andreas Scheuer said the ministry and Daimler had ""negotiated intensively for many hours"" on Monday. Afterwards he said the ministry had ordered the ""immediate"" recall of Daimler models in Germany because they contained ""illegal shutdown devices"". ""Daimler states that it will, at maximum speed and with co-operative transparency with the authorities, remove the applications in the engine control system which the government objects to,"" he said. The Transport Ministry only has authority to force the recall of vehicles within Germany. Daimler refused to elaborate on where the other vehicles would be recalled. It also said the legality of the software would still need to be clarified. Earlier Daimler chairman, Dieter Zetsche, had said a technical solution had been found to the software problems and that he did not expect the company to be fined. It is not the first time Daimler has faced problems with its emissions software. Last year it retrofitted three million Mercedes diesel cars built since 2011, but did not call the exercise a recall. Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said the recall would not harm the company. ""The criticised software is part of engine management and so called auxiliary emissions control devices [which can turn off emissions controls during driving for other reasons, such as to protect the engine]. ""We don't see any evidence that Daimler was designing software to deliberately cheat on emission testing."" Other car makers have been found to have fitted defeat devices. BMW recalled 12,000 diesel cars over the issue in February, while Porsche recalled 60,000 in May. Neither admitted wrongdoing. 75,000 Mercedes-Benz cars recalled in UK Mercedes-Benz recalls 400,000 cars in UK Porsche told to recall 22,000 cars Audi in emissions fix for 850,000 cars Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Vulnerable old and disabled people will see cuts to vital care services and higher charges, council chiefs say. The annual budget survey by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services shows councils expect to spend Â£21.4bn this year in England. While this is a rise from Â£20.8bn last year, the cost of inflation combined with growing demand means this will not be enough, ADASS said. The warning comes as ministers prepare to unveil plans to reform the system. A green paper on social care is expected to be published in the coming months. ADASS said it was desperately needed given the pressures on councils - local government has seen cuts in the amount of funding it gets from central government over the past decade. It surveyed all 152 councils in England. This video can not be played ""I'll be broke if I live to 100"" Three-quarters said they would be cutting the amount of care they provided, while nearly half said they would be introducing higher charges - people are expected to contribute to the cost of care where they can. It means more people are likely to be pushed into the private market. Currently only a fifth of those needing care get help from councils. The ADASS report showed that councils were also concerned about the impact on the care firms they pay to provide these services. Nearly one in three had seen home care services close or cease trading in the past six months, while slightly more had seen residential and nursing homes go under. The stresses and the strains faced by a care system under pressure usually play out quietly in the lives of people who are older and disabled - but the consequences can be no less devastating. If, as this survey of local authority directors of adult care suggests, councils end up supporting  fewer people, it will mean only those with the very highest needs get help. For many that will mean they have to reach a crisis, whether it is a fall which takes them to hospital or the illness of a husband and wife unable to cope any more with caring for their partner.  It is hard to underestimate the human cost of that. The government has acknowledged the pressures on the system and promised reform - something other governments have failed to do. Most experts agree the biggest challenge will be sorting out the money needed to pay for care - with the NHS also under pressure, the fear is that the less visible crisis in social care will be overlooked again. ADASS president Glen Garrod said the findings were of ""serious concern"" and described the care market as ""fragile"". Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said it was a ""disgrace"" that there were people who were not getting the support they needed for daily essentials like ""getting dressed, going to the toilet, taking their medication or preparing their food"". ""Unless policy makers are willing to invest in care, hundreds of thousands of older people face a bleak future, living without their needs being met,"" she added. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said plans would be set out soon to create a ""diverse, vibrant and stable market"". She also pointed out that extra money had been found in recent years to relieve some of the pressures, but conceded the system was ""under pressure"".

"Violence in Central American nations spurs many to try to leave The US attorney general has ruled that victims of domestic abuse and gang violence should no longer generally qualify for asylum in the US. Jeff Sessions' ruling overturns a 2016 decision which granted asylum to a woman from El Salvador who had been raped and abused by her husband. Activists criticised the move, saying it will affect tens of thousands. Mr Sessions has said he has a ""zero tolerance"" stance toward illegal immigration on the country's border. ""Generally, claims by aliens pertaining to domestic violence or gang violence perpetrated by non-governmental actors will not qualify for asylum,""Mr Sessions wrote in his 31-page ruling released on Monday,external. ""The mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes - such as domestic violence or gang violence - or that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, cannot itself establish an asylum claim."" The unnamed woman - known in court documents as A-B - entered the US illegally in 2014, and requested asylum on the basis her former spouse had repeatedly abused her ""emotionally, physically and sexually"". America's top law official has a ""zero tolerance"" policy on illegal migration US and international law currently say that people can seek asylum if they fear persecution at home on the basis of their race, political opinion, nationality, religion or because they belong to a particular social group. The US Board of Immigration Appeals found in 2016 that the woman qualified under the ""particular social group"" definition, but Mr Sessions overturned the finding on Monday. US federal prison for immigration detainees Immigrant detained after delivering pizza He wrote in his ruling that the category was currently ""inherently ambiguous"" and concluded it should not be used as ""'some omnibus catch-all' for solving every 'heart-rending situation""'. This video can not be played ""Why I joined Central America's brutal MS-13 gang"" ""The asylum statute does not provide redress for all misfortune,"" he said, adding that the woman was a victim of ""private criminal activity"" rather than state-sponsored persecution. ""Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even all serious problems, that people face every day all over the world,"" the attorney general said in advance of his ruling. It is unclear how many cases are affected by the ruling, but activists say that at least 10,000 people per year are granted asylum in the US on the basis of domestic abuse and gang violence in their home countries. Pro-immigration groups say they plan to fight Mr Sessions' decision, which is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to place restrictions on immigration. Last week, Mr Sessions defended the department's policy of separating migrant children from their parents after they have crossed into the US. This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown Activists say the ruling will especially resonate in Central America, where gang violence is rampant. Is US only country to separate migrant children? Migrants from that region frequently cite gang violence as the reason for seeking refuge in the US.

"England wore black armbands in memory of Ray Wilkins and ray Wilson ahead of their World Cup warm-up win over Nigeria England should wear black armbands during the World Cup to protest against the Russian regime, an MP has said. Labour's Stephen Kinnock said the Fifa tournament is a ""massive propaganda coup"" for Russia. Fifa bans players from wearing political, religious or commercial symbols and the FA has previously beenchallenged over UK teams choosing to wear poppiesnear to Remembrance Day. The FA said it would not respond to the suggestion from the MP for Aberavon. After the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in March, Mr Kinnock told a parliamentary debate Russia should be stripped of the right to host the tournament. TheUK government blamed the Russian authoritiesfor the nerve agent attack - which also injured a police officer. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? What fans going to Russia should know Is the poppy a political symbol? Mr Kinnock said: ""We are using the beautiful game to launder the reputation of a dangerous authoritarian regime and that poses some major questions. ""We should think creatively about what we might be able to do to send a message."" Fifa has previously said players are banned from wearing poppies Mr Kinnock said pulling England out of the World Cup ""would have been wrong"" as it would have made it seem as if there were only an issue between Russia and the UK. He said there are universal human rights norms of which Russia is in violation. England, who were visited by the Duke of Cambridge ahead of their last warm-up match, will start their World Cup against Tunisia on 18 June Wearing black armbands would ""mark the death"" of Alexander Litvinenko, whodied after being poisonedin London in 2006, as well as the attack on the Skripals, he said. He acknowledged such a move would see the FA ""probably sanctioned by Fifa"", but added: "" At some point we've got to make a decision about the role and responsibility of football in the world."" The MP, who worked in Russia for three years as director of the British Council, said footballers have a big social media following and are ""role models"". He said: ""It would great if they were able to say 'we're here in Russia now, but what's happened on the streets of the United Kingdom raises concerns for all of us. An attack on one is an attack on all'.""

"This video can not be played This car is on Autopilot. What happens next? The motor insurance industry is warning carmakers against the use of the word ""autonomous"" in their marketing. A report for the Association of British Insurers says the way some advanced vehicles are described can convince motorists that they have self-driving cars when that is not the case. There are no fully autonomous cars on British roads. However, manufacturers such as Tesla, BMW and Nissan offer features that can partially automate the driving process. These include systems that keep the car within its lane, control its speed and keep it at a safe distance from the vehicle in front. Thatcham Research, which conducts safety tests for the motor insurers, says the manufacturers need to be far clearer about the difference between these assisted-driving systems and autonomous cars. The organisation says misleading names such as ""Autopilot"" and ""ProPilot"" give drivers the impression their cars can drive themselves in all circumstances. ""There's a problem with the manufacturers trying to introduce technology and consumers not being ready for it, not being sure if it's automated or 'Do I need to keep watching?'"" says Matthew Avery, of Thatcham Research. ""We want it very clear. Either you are driving - assisted - or you're not driving - automated."" Tesla says it makes very clear that its Autopilot function does not mean the car drives itself To demonstrate the dangers of partial automation, Thatcham took a Tesla out on its test track at Upper Heyford, in Oxfordshire. Tesla Autopilot's name is deceptive, claim US groups Jaguar self-drive car revealed in New York Driverless cars on UK roads by 2021 - really? With the Autopilot system switched on, the Model S kept in lane and slowed to a halt when a car it was following encountered standing traffic. But on a second run the car in front switched lanes at the last moment, and the Tesla was unable to brake in time, running into a stationary vehicle. ""This is an example of what happens when the driver is over-reliant on the system,"" says Matthew Avery. In April, a British driver lost his licence after being filmed on the motorway sitting in the passenger seat of his Tesla using its Autopilot system. A Tesla spokeswoman said:  ""When using Autopilot, drivers are continuously reminded of their responsibility to keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of the vehicle at all times. ""Tesla has always been clear that Autopilot doesn't make the car impervious to all accidents and the issues described by Thatcham won't be a problem for drivers using Autopilot correctly."" Thatcham Research, which works for the Association of British Insurers, is launching a testing programme to assess assisted-driving systems. ""Manufacturers must be responsible in how they describe and name what their vehicles can do, and the insurance industry is ready to hold them to account on this,"" said James Dalton, from the ABI. The insurers are are also concerned about manufacturers' plans to introduce cars with level-three automation, where the driver can take their hands off the wheel for long periods. They would like the carmakers to skip this step and wait until they are ready to go straight to level four, where the vehicle is fully automated. In response, Mike Hawes, chief executive of the society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: Fully self-driving cars are still a long way off, but industry is working now with regulators in the UK and at UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) level to determine what makes a vehicle fully autonomous. ""This will ensure there is a common understanding and that all autonomous cars meet exacting international standards.""

"Vicky Featherstone, the Royal Court Theatre's artistic director, said the BBC was ""amused"" by the name Snatches A theatre director has spoken of her disbelief that the BBC approved the name Snatches for her new TV series. Vicky Featherstone, the Royal Court Theatre's artistic director, has curated eight monologues for BBC Four to mark 100 years of women's suffrage. On the word Snatches - which can be a derogatory term for a vagina - she told the Radio Times magazine: ""It's reclaiming the word, isn't it?"" She said BBC Four ""were rather amused by it"". ""It was my first idea, and I thought, 'There's no way they're going to let it happen,'"" she said. But it was allowed and Featherstone says it ""fits very well"". ""Our monologues are literally snatches of women's lives but a lot of those stories are about people and issues that aren't really known, so we're reclaiming the history and we're reclaiming the word,"" she told the magazine. The eight short 15-minute episodes, directed by Vanessa Caswill and Rachna Suri, have been penned by writers including Abi Morgan and Tanika Gupta. Atonement actress Romola Garai, Downton Abbey star Siobhan Finneran and Three Girls actress Liv Hill are among the stars involved. One of the monologues is based on rape within marriage, while another is about an actress's experience meeting a producer. Suffrage centenary: The women getting creative 10 reasons why men opposed votes for women Actresses and arsonists - Women who won the vote The series, which will air this summer as part of the broadcaster's Hear Her season, marks the centenary of women over the age of 30, and who owned property, being able to vote in the UK.

It seems the historic summit has boosted President Trump's chances of winning the Nobel Peace Prize - at least in the eyes of the bookmakers. They have slashed the odds on him winning following the summit. Ladbrokes cut the odds from 10/1 to 6/4, and William Hill offered the same odds for Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un to win it jointly in the next couple of years. But Mr Trump wouldn't be the first US president to bag the award. In 2009, only a year into his term of office,US President Barack Obama wonfor ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"". The US ambassador to Nato, Kay Bailey Hutchison, has told BBC Newsnight that ""there has to be verification"" on denuclearisation, following the joint agreement. But she praised the two leaders' first meeting, calling it ""very strong"". This video can not be played 'Verification is key' says US ambassador President Trump's translator, longtime state department employee Lee Yun-hyang, was at times the only woman in the room during the negotiations between the US and North Korea. According to reports in Korean media, she has worked for the US full time since 2009 and has translated for George W Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. She also was at Mr Trump's side whenhe met with the South Korean president,externalin May and when he greeted the US citizens who were released from North Korea last month, Quartz reports. The 61-year-old's counterpart, North Korean Kim Ju-song, had previously met Mr Trump when he accompanied general Kim Yong-chol on his visit to the US in preparation for the summit.

what he wanted â the pomp, circumstance and prestige of a meeting with the
President of the United States â while making no specific commitments in
return"". Delaware senator Chris Coons added: ""This was a dream outcome for Kim Jong-un... legitimacy on the world stage,
an invitation to the White House, no concessions on human rights, and no clear
concessions on a timeline or a process for denuclearisation."" ""For this agreement with North Korea to mean anything, for it to be
anything more than a reality TV handshake summit, thereâs going to need to be a
lot of hard work in the months ahead and Iâm concerned that the Trump
Administration isnât prepared to do that hard work,"" Mr Coons said in an interview with MSNBC. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Koreatown residents watch the talks at a noodle restaurant A man skates by a mural in LA's Koreatown neighbourhood Impersonators at the Santa Monica pier The Republican Chairman for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce, just sent us this statement. ""Protecting America from North Koreaâs nuclear threats is an urgent
priority, and Iâm glad the president is seeking peace through diplomacy. Kim
Jong-Un has gained much from step one, including an apparent promise from the
president regarding important US-South Korea defensive military drills."" The California congressman adds that he is looking forward to a ""detailed briefing"" on the talks, and that ""congress has an important oversight role in this process"". ""Kim Jong-Un should not receive a dime of relief until he fully and
verifiably denuclearises,"" he concludes.  ""Resolving this 65-year old
international challenge will take a great deal of hard work,"" Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said minutes ago on the floor of the US Senate. He says that he supports the goals, as outlined in the joint statement, but adds that ""if North Korea does not prove
willing to follow through, we and our allies must be prepared to restore the
policy of maximum pressure."" ""Today, I
congratulate the president on this major step, and share his hope that it will
begin a process that leads to an historic peace."" Trump tells Voice of America, the US government-sponsored news network, that Kim ""liked"" him. ""I think he liked me and I like him.

"Jess Phillips has called for people's real identities to be revealed to social media providers An MP who has been the victim of abuse by social media trolls has called for them to lose their anonymity online. Birmingham Yardley Labour MP Jess Phillips said in one night she received 600 rape threats and was threatened with violence and aggression every day.

"This video can not be played Big planes and jogging guards: Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have arrived in Singapore The world once again got a glimpse of Kim Jong-un's suited running bodyguards as they escorted his motorcade in Singapore. But they're more than just a piece of spectacle, because when it comes to the leader's security, North Korea leaves absolutely nothing to chance. Analyst Michael Madden explains more about this mysterious group of men. When in North Korea, Mr Kim's close bodyguard has three different lines that surround him.  There's a modified version of this on display in Singapore and all eyes are on the men in dark suits. The bodyguards running alongside Mr Kim's limousine and those who walk in close proximity to him are part of something called Central Party Office #6, or formally, it's known as the Main Office of Adjutants. They form the immediate line around Mr Kim and are selected from Korean People's Army (KPA) recruits fulfilling their national service conscription obligations. Criteria for selection include a height requirement - they need to be approximately the same height as the supreme leader - and must not have any visual impairments. N Korea eyes 'new relationship' with US The crisis in 300 words 'Stop romanticising a dictator', say N Korean artists They must demonstrate certain accomplishments or a high aptitude for skills such as marksmanship - firing a gun - and martial arts.

Finally, a bodyguard is subjected to a rigorous background investigation in which his or her family, going back two generations, is vetted.  Many personnel of the Main Office of Adjutants are related to the Kim family, or to other elite North Korean families. Once they are accepted to become bodyguards (refusing the job offer is not really an option), they are subjected to an intensive training programme. Bodyguards are trained in a manner similar to the KPA's Special Operations Forces. This includes training in the use of handguns, evasion techniques and a variety of martial arts. Bodyguard trainees undergo physical endurance challenges, behavioural conditioning and physically rigorous drills. The bodyguards form a ring around him with the protective perimeter having a 360-degree view of both the people near him and the location. Walking, riding ahead, or in advance of Mr Kim are between three to five bodyguards including the director of the Main Office of Adjutants. Alongside him are between four to six bodyguards, with two to three on his right and left. Bringing up the rear are an additional four to five bodyguards. In a sign of their power in the regime, they are some of the only North Korean citizens permitted to carry loaded firearms next to their country's leader, usually a semi-automatic handgun and a back-up weapon. The bodyguards were first seen running beside Mr Kim's motorcade at the inter-Korean summit in April Despite carrying firearms, the bodyguards' main defence for Mr Kim are their skills of observation (of people near the leader and the premises), and neutralising any perceived threat with their hands and bodies. When Kim Jong-il was alive, there was a ratio of one bodyguard to two of the senior officials accompanying him. Kim Jong-un's bodyguards, in contrast to his father, are fewer in number and have a less obtrusive presence. Bodyguards are usually attired in Western-style suits and ties, as we see in Singapore, or the Zhongshan suits of party officials. Mr Kim's chauffeurs always wear linen or leather gloves to handle the steering wheel.  They also use radio communications with earpieces. What does Kim Jong-un want? North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis How the outcast became popular What should Donald Trump call Kim Jong-un? However, their primary communication methods are distinctly old school: they wear specific badges and pins on their clothing for a given event to establish their identification, and use a series of spoken passwords and code phrases. The Main Office of Adjutants has an estimated 200-300 personnel, of whom over half are bodyguards, and the remainder are drivers and technical staff.  While some of the leader's bodyguards have long careers, most only work in that capacity for 10 years. The Guard Command (GC) comprises the second and third lines of security around Mr Kim. Whereas the Main Office of Adjutants protects the Supreme Leader himself, the GC is mainly responsible for securing the physical premises of wherever he happens to be, whether it's his office buildings, private residences or locations he visits domestically or outside North Korea. In addition to that, the GC fulfils a number of logistical or technical functions to support the leader in his job. Guard Command personnel undergo a similar selection and vetting process as Mr Kim's bodyguards in the Main Office of Adjutants.  In fact most bodyguards rotate out of the latter department into the GC. Recent observation and reporting about Mr Kim's visit to Singapore noted that three planes arrived to the city state from Pyongyang. Guard Command personnel were on board at least two of these planes. These men and women are involved in a diverse number of support missions for Mr Kim. They will operate and maintain the secure telephone lines that the leader will use, as well as provide him with whatever computers he uses and IT security required. In addition to that, they have whatever liquor, foods, and cigarettes that Mr Kim will want during his time in Singapore, and will inspect any food or drink before it is served to him. It also has a medical department where his personal physicians and medical staff work, and at least two of these people are with him in Singapore. In terms of Mr Kim's personal security, the GC's #2 Department forms two of the three outer lines of security around him, and they normally focus on where Mr Kim works, stays or visits. The GC establishes one line immediately outside of the bodyguard group around him, followed by a third outer line near any roads, fences or other infrastructure within a half mile of any location. North Korean security personnel seen outside Mr Kim's hotel in Singapore If one were to pop down to the lobby of the St Regis hotel where he is staying in Singapore, one would most certainly encounter them. This three-tier personal security structure is virtually unheard of for any other world leader. And while the running bodyguards are a striking image, it is the additional and not immediately visible layers of security further out that are the most sophisticated and extreme in the lengths they will go to ensure the preservation of the Kim dynasty.

"Khalid Ali denies preparing a terrorist act in the UK and possessing explosives abroad An alleged Taliban bomb-maker says he was held captive in Pakistan and forced to bundle up parts of explosive devices to prove he was not a British spy. Khalid Ali told his trial he travelled there as a tourist, but was taken to a complex where he was under armed guard. Prosecutors say Mr Ali's fingerprints were found on bomb parts handed to US forces in Afghanistan in 2012. Mr Ali, 28, from north London, denies preparing a terrorist act in the UK and possessing explosives abroad. He was arrested in Westminster in April 2017, in possession of three knives. Giving evidence at his trial, Mr Ali, from Edmonton, said he visited Pakistan's city of Quetta as a tourist with someone he had met on his travels, before he was taken to a complex in a remote, rural area. There he was accused of being a British spy and beaten, he told the Old Bailey. He told the jury he was then asked to bundle up detonators for improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and to match up transmitters and receivers - which he carried on doing under armed guard for three months. He said he would have been shot if he had not done what he was told to do. Mr Ali was arrested in Westminster in April 2017 Earlier, Mr Ali told the court that MI5 had tried to recruit him. He said he had met representatives from the security services for the first time at Gatwick airport in 2010, when they had asked him to ""keep an eye out"" on what was happening on the Road to Hope aid convoy to Gaza. Mr Ali said he had two further meetings with people who said they were attached to ""counter-terrorism"" who had asked him to spy on individuals. On one occasion he said he was paid Â£80-100 for his time. He said he told them that he was not willing to help them and part of the reason that he decided to leave the country in 2011 was due to his fear that ""they may come after me"". Mr Ali arrived back in the UK from Istanbul in November 2016. The trial continues.

"Edgar Valdez - known as ""La Barbie"" for his light eyes and fair skin - has a brutal reputation A former US high school athlete who became a Mexican crime lord has been sentenced to 49 years in prison on drug and money-laundering charges. A federal judge in Atlanta, Georgia, ruled Edgar Valdez Villarreal, called ""La Barbie"" for his light eyes and fair skin, must also forfeit $192m (Â£143m). He was brought up in a middle-class family in Texas, where he was born, but turned to gang crime as a teenager. Arrested in Mexico in 2010, he was extradited to the US in 2015. He pleaded guilty to the charges in 2016. Valdez, 44, was a member of the Beltran Levya drug cartel. He distributed thousands of kilos of cocaine in the eastern US between 2004-06 and shipped millions of dollars in cash back to Mexico. Before he joined the Mexican drug cartel, Valdez was a high school American football linebacker in Laredo, Texas. After years dealing drugs in the US, Valdez is reported to have moved to Mexico.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-un toured the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore The US says its discussions with North Korea are moving ""more quickly than expected"" ahead of the summit in Singapore on Tuesday. The preliminary talks between officials have been taking place ahead of the unprecedented first meeting. The White House also confirms that President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un will hold a one-to-one meeting, with only translators present. The outcome may determine the fate of North Korea's nuclear programme. The US insists it will accept nothing less than complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. North Korea has said it is willing to commit to denuclearisation, but that term is open to interpretation. It is also unclear what concessions Pyongyang could demand in return - which makes the summit very hard to predict, according to analysts. As night closed in, Mr Kim made a tour of some city sights. He waved at spectators who cheered as he arrived to visit a high-end hotel. Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan also tweeted a picture of them going ""jalan-jalan"", a local term meaning to go out for a walk, in the Gardens by the Bay park.

Mr Kim is reported to be flying out even earlier, at 14:00 local time. Highly unusually, North Korea's state-run media are already reporting on Mr Kim's trip to Singapore to meet Mr Trump.

The two leaders have had an extraordinary up-and-down relationship over the past 18 months. Mr Trump's first year in office was marked by bitter exchanges between himself and Mr Kim - as North Korea conducted several ballistic missile tests in defiance of the international community. The US president successfully sought to tighten UN sanctions on the North, and to get its traditional ally, China, to go along. He also famously vowed to unleash ""fire and fury""if Pyongyang kept threatening the US.Mr Kim has called him ""mentally deranged"" and a ""dotard"". A defiant North Korea carried out its sixth nuclear test in September 2017. Soon after, Mr Kim declared that his country had achieved its mission of becoming a nuclear state, with missiles that could reach the US. Who's pulling the strings in this breakthrough?

"This video can not be played Trump Kim: The moment they shook hands Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have become the first sitting US president and North Korean leader to meet, an unprecedented development after a year of exchanging threats. The pair shook hands at a luxury hotel on Singapore's Sentosa island before proceeding to talks. After the summit the leaders signed a ""comprehensive"" document, promising a new relationship between the nations. They had been discussing defusing tensions and nuclear disarmament. The document commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.

""I think both sides will be very impressed with the result,"" Mr Trump said at a signing ceremony with Mr Kim. The US president said more details would be provided at a press conference due shortly. Mr Trump said his meeting with Mr Kim went ""better than anybody could have expected"" The pair signed a document pledging they would work towards new relations Mr Trump spoke of a ""special bond"" with the North Korean leader and said he was ""absolutely"" willing to invite him to the White House. ""We've decided to leave the past behind,"" Mr Kim said. ""The world will see major changes."" Still, analysts remain divided on what the summit will ultimately achieve. Some see it as a propaganda win for Mr Kim, others a potential path to peace. Analysis: Laura Bicker, BBC News, Singapore The agreement the two sides have signed is vague and lacking in detail. It only commits the US and North Korea to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. There is no mention that the process should be verifiable or irreversible - which is what the US has been pushing for. There is no timetable to disarm North Korea nor is there any invitation for weapons inspectors to be allowed in. The US has said it will provide security guarantees without specifying what that might mean - or if that could involve the removal of some American troops based in South Korea. The two sides have promised to hold follow up talks and work on efforts to build a lasting peace regime. This could eventually result in a treaty to end the near 70-year war. It is at least a start. Something to build on. The summit began with a striking image, unimaginable just months ago. The two men walked towards each other and firmly gripped each other's hands in front of US and North Korean flags. Mr Trump patted Mr Kim's arm as they stood on red carpet and exchanged a few words before turning to face the gathered press. ""I feel really great. We're going to have a great discussion and will be tremendously successful,"" the US president said. Sitting alongside each other, ahead of a one-on-one meeting, the pair appeared relaxed against the odds.

This video can not be played Trump-Kim summit: The view from South Koreans The unprecedented event carries great potential prestige for each leader - but also, in the long run, a possibly catastrophic loss of face. For the moment Mr Trump will credit any successful outcome of talks to his ""maximum pressure"" campaign on North Korea, that tightened economic sanctions and threatened military action. Many believe that no matter what is achieved this will be the narrative. For Mr Kim, securing a stage with the US leader is seen as a victory in itself, something which neither his father or grandfather could achieve. Such a meeting has long been seen as a prize in the eyes of North Korea for the legitimacy it would confer on its leader. The leaders walk together at the Capella hotel in Singapore For decades, North Korea has been a pariah state, and now its latest hereditary leader is being treated as a world statesman. Last year, it would have been a rare sight to see a North Korean flag flying anywhere in Asia. Now, Mr Kim - who runs a totalitarian regime with extreme censorship and forced-labour camps - is meeting and greeting dignitaries. Kim: The new kid on the diplomatic block North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis On the eve of the summit, Mr Kim toured Singapore's tourist sites, waving to excited crowds and snapped a selfie with the city state's foreign minister. Tuesday's front page of North Korea's official newspaper featured the extraordinary scenes on display in Singapore, offering many in the country an unprecedented glimpse of their leader in a setting utterly at odds with their daily life. This video can not be played Kim Jong-un toured the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore This is an outcome that seemed unimaginable less than a year ago - when Mr Trump and Mr Kim exchanged streams of fiery insults - and North Korea conducted several ballistic missile tests in defiance of the international community. Who's pulling the strings of the N Korea breakthrough? Who are Kim's running bodyguards? How well has Trump prepared for Singapore? Mr Trump famously vowed to unleash ""fire and fury"" if Pyongyang kept threatening the US. Meanwhile,Mr Kim has called Mr Trump ""mentally deranged"" and a ""dotard"". But earlier this year North Korea showed a new openness to diplomacy and held direct talks with Seoul. The rapid improvement in relations between the North and South Korea - technically still at war - culminated with ahistoric leaders' summit in April.

"One of the biggest moments of Donald Trump's presidency is looming large. We asked experts what they think of his preparations to meet Kim Jong-un. When asked about his planning for the Singapore summit, the president was straightforward. ""I don't think I have to prepare very much,"" he said. ""It's about the attitude. It's about willingness to get things done."" He's said he'll work on the flight, bringing with him 15 boxes of material to pore over. This week, he met Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others, to discuss negotiations in Singapore. But by almost any measure, the preparations for the summit were fast-tracked - officials who worked in previous administrations said they would start getting ready months or even years for their meetings with North Korean officials. Trump's supporters applauded him for his speed at organising the work before the meeting was scheduled. ""It would've taken two weeks just for Kerry to get his bicycles to Singapore,"" said Fox Business' Lou Dobbs, making fun of John Kerry, the former US secretary of state. For others, though, Trump's quickfire approach - and the speeded-up timetable - is worrisome. They say the pace of the preparations could put the negotiations in jeopardy. Meeting that could change the world Who is in Team Trump? Trump wants Kim to give up his nuclear weapons and has spoken of the Nobel Peace Prize for his own role in the high-stakes negotiations. Chief of Staff John Kelly told me they have ""great hope"" for the talks in Singapore. Some former US state department officials say that Trump's work has already produced results. ""The North Koreans have taken steps - like stopping missile tests - that no-one would have predicted six months ago, including me,"" says Joel Wit, a former US state department official and founder of a North Korea website, 38North. ""Of course - there's a lot more that needs to be done,"" he says. ""But these are steps that no one would have predicted."" Trump and Kim impersonators cause a stir in Singapore Others say Trump's already lost to Kim by going to the talks with no preconditions. ""There's too much focus on the meeting,"" says Albright Stonebridge Group's Eric Altbach, who served on the national security council under President George W Bush, rather than the meeting as a way to achieve an outcome. One thing is clear - the president brings excitement to diplomacy and believes that confidence - not prep work - is what matters. He cancelled the summit last month after the North Koreans issued statements about a nuclear showdown. Days later the president met a North Korean envoy who carried a letter from Kim. The summit was back on, and the president's policy goal had shifted - at first he had said that he wanted denuclearisation immediately. A senior White House aide told me that he has not backed down from his goal, but over time he began to understand that the process would take longer than he originally thought. North Korean human rights sidelined What do N Koreans know about summit? For some, the shifting of the president's ideas about denuclearisation is a problem. Brookings Institution's Ken Lieberthal, who was a national security council senior director for Asia from 1998-2000, says: ""It's very hard to figure out what the bottom line."" In the meantime, the president's aides were helping him get ready for the negotiations. On Wednesday morning I watched the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, head past the East Wing of the White House and asked him about preparations. ""Things are going well,"" he said. On Friday the president made it clear that he felt that he was on top of things - or at least he didn't need any advice from Democrats who, he said, had done ""NOTHING about North Korea'"".

No-one can predict how the meeting will go - or the negotiations. North Koreans want economic sanctions lifted, and they don't want to talk about human rights. They also want the US to reduce troops in South Korea. Trump likes to keep an open mind. He could leave the meeting abruptly if things go badly - or invite President Kim to the White House. They could also come up with a new agreement on that day. For some, the prospect is unsettling. ""The idea that the president is sort of walking into the room in an open-ended negotiation is beyond frightening,"" says Jeremy Shapiro, a former US state department official. ""Freelancing ideas in these meetings is dangerous,"" explains Shapiro. ""There's all these implications of a policy shift"", whether the issue is human rights, nuclear non-proliferation or the economic sanctions. As a diplomat, he says, he learned about the nuances of various issues - and also how hard it is for any one individual to grasp all the different aspects of a policy in a short period of time. Dennis Rodman the matchmaker? What not to say to North Korea Besides that, says Shapiro, the president has not appeared especially interested in the details of these policy matters. Instead he prefers to go into a meeting and see what happens. Shapiro says he believes this strategy can work well in certain settings - such as the business world and reality television, areas where the president has worked in the past. But translating that style into the realm of nuclear negotiations, says Shapiro, is ""a very serious mistake"". Human Rights Watch's John Sifton says: ""He could decide the only solution is a military technical one, and as a result hundreds of thousands of people will die."" Others say that they understand why the president would want to enter into negotiations with an open mind. ""Yeah, there is a danger that he'll go off the reservation and make a comment that could actually do harm,"" says Wit. ""But presidents in the past sometimes run with the ball themselves."" Life in Singapore goes on as anticipation builds Wit says: ""When you're president, you think: 'I'm not just a puppet that does everything my advisors tell me. I have my own ideas.'"" Wit says that President Ronald Reagan acted in an independent manner when he met Mikhail Gorbachev. They held a summit in 1985. Reagan's advisers wanted him to follow their talking points and were mortified, says Wit, when he made it clear that he wanted to speak in his own fashion - and on his own terms. Reagan and Gorbachev didn't come to an agreement on any substantive issues, but nevertheless they were able to speak directly at the summit and, as Reagan said later, ""understand each other better."" When it comes to the summit in Singapore, Wit says he's optimistic. ""It's not going to be a flop. I think the North Koreans are serious, and the president himself is pretty serious. He wants a win.""

"Andrew Kim had a spot at the table in May for Pompeo's talks with Kim A US team of negotiators has been talking to counterparts in North Korea ahead of the showdown talks between the two leaders in Singapore. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has played a leading role in a number of working sessions that concluded on Monday. Their aim was to hammer out the vital questions and areas to discuss later. TheWashington Post reports that the two leaders,externalwill meet one-on-one before the teams of experts join them. As well as Mr Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Adviser John Bolton are expected to be there - he has already infuriated the North Koreans with his tough line. So who else will there be on the US side? Korean-American Andrew Kim is the head of the CIA's Korea Mission Centre. Mr Kim was born and raised in South Korea under the name Kim Sung-hyun, the Washington Post reported. He attended the prestigious Seoul High School, which boasts South Korea's national security adviser and intelligence agency head as alumni, before moving to the US during college. Andrew Kim (circled) arrives in North Korea with Mike Pompeo in May He worked with the CIA for the majority of his career, serving in Moscow, Beijing, Bangkok and Seoul. Mr Kim had retired, but the CIA brought him back to lead the new Korea Mission Centre last May. In the lead up to the summit, he seems to have become Mr Pompeo's right-hand-man for all things North Korea related - including planning strikes, a South Korean presidential adviser said. He has been described by South Korean and Japanese media as a ""messenger from hell"" due to his hawkish stance on North Korea. Veteran diplomat Sung Kim is the current US ambassador to the Philippines. He served as the ambassador to South Korea between 2011-2014 and was a US special envoy in the Six-Party talks. Ambassador Kim at a ceremony in the Philippines Mr Kim was born in Seoul but grew up in Los Angeles. As a diplomat, he served in Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong. During his time in Washington, he was the special representative for North Korea policy in Washington, director of the Office of Korean Affairs and Staff Assistant in the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs. He recently led the US delegation to meet North Korean officials at the border to discuss talks, Reuters reported. A South Korean official told Reuters Mr Kim was ""capable, level-headed, cautious"", with a ""solid grasp of the issues and [he] knows North Koreans well"". A top aide to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, he has been instrumental in laying the groundwork for the upcoming summits, according to the White House. The former Navy intelligence officer and State Department diplomat now serves as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs, and has been holding talks with North Korean delegates at the DMZ for weeks. Randall Schriver is a top aide to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis In June he travelled to Pyongyang with Mr Pompeo. From 1994-98 he worked for the Pentagon on day-to-day relations with the Chinese military and bilateral relations with Taiwan. He previously served as president and CEO of Project 2049, a think tank specialising in Asian security issues. The native of the US state of Oregon has run in four triathlons, according to Armitage International consulting firm, which he co-founded. She is a Korean peninsula specialist on the White House National Security Council, which she joined in 2014 under former President Barack Obama. She was formerly a member of the Department of State Bureau of Intelligence and Research where she was tasked with North Korean nuclear policy. Allison Hooker, right, with Vice-President Biden at a nuclear security summit in 2016 In 2017, she was chosen by the White House to be part of the US delegation to the closing ceremony of the Olympic games in PyeongChang. However, she reportedly did not meet with any North Korean officials during her time there. In 2014, under President Obama, she travelled to North Korea with then-director of National Intelligence James Clapper to negotiate the release of two American detainees. During the brief trip, she also met powerful Korean General Kim Yong-chol. Ivanka was at the heart of the Winter Games diplomacy The wild card on the US delegation is the US president's own daughter, and White House adviser, who led the US delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics. The games, which were attended by North Korea, paved the way for these peace talks. During her time there, she sat in the stands beside the North Korean leader's sister, Kim Yo Jong. At one point the two women shook hands as cameras documented the moment. The absence of US First Lady Melania Trump from Singapore has only added to the speculation that Ms Trump may make a surprise appearance.

"This video can not be played Charity workers look after migrants on the Aquarius Spain's prime minister has said the country will take in a rescue ship stranded in the Mediterranean, to help avoid a humanitarian disaster. Pedro SÃ¡nchez said he would give ""safe harbour"" to the Aquarius and the 629 people on board, after Italy and Malta both refused to let the ship dock. The UN refugee agency and the EU had both called for a swift end to the stand-off between the two countries. Mr SÃ¡nchez, who took office a week ago, said the ship would dock in Valencia. The migrants aboard the Aquarius were picked up from inflatable boats off the coast of Libya at the weekend, in six different rescue operations, according to the NGO SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e. ""It is our duty to help avoid a humanitarian catastrophe and offer a safe port to these people, to comply with our human rights obligations,"" Mr Sanchez's office said. The Council of Europe welcomed Spain's move, with the organisation's Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatovic, tweeting: ""Saving lives at sea is an obligation that states must  always uphold."" Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat tweeted his gratitude to Spain, saying Italy had broken international rules and caused a standoff. He said Malta would be sending fresh supplies to the vessel, adding: ""We will have to sit down and discuss how to prevent this from happening again. This is a European issue."" Spain's decision to take in the ship was hailed by Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini as a ""victory"" for his government's hardline immigration policy. Those saved include 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 younger children and seven pregnant women, SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e said. This video can not be played Former Aquarius volunteer: ""The whole deck will be full of people"" The minors are aged between 13 and 17 and come from Eritrea, Ghana, Nigeria and Sudan, according to a journalist on the ship, Anelise Borges. ""Most of them are sleeping outside. They are obviously exhausted, they have been exposed to the elements, they have been at sea for 20 to 30 hours prior to their rescue,"" she told the BBC. ""They are fragile and we have yet to learn what's going to happen to them,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Salvini refused to let the ship in, saying: ""Saving lives is a duty, turning Italy into a huge refugee camp is not."" ""Italy is done bending over backwards and obeying - this time THERE IS SOMEONE WHO SAYS NO,"" he wrote on Twitter, with the hashtag #closethedoors. Mr Salvini, leader of the right-wing League party, promised during Italy's recent general election to take a tough stance against migration. Reality Check: Claims about migrants arriving in Italy Desperate migrants rescued from the sea UN sanctions for people traffickers in Libya He said Malta should accept the Aquarius, but it refused, arguing that it falls under Italy's jurisdiction. Italy is the main entry point for migrants crossing from North Africa to Europe. Mr Salvini has previously said he is considering action against organisations that rescue migrants at sea. He has accused them of being in cahoots with people-smugglers. This video can not be played On a visit to Sicily, Matteo Salvini said Italy must increase its deportations of migrants On Sunday, he said that Italy was saying ""no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration"". ""Malta takes in nobody,"" he added. ""France pushes people back at the border, Spain defends its frontier with weapons."" SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e said late on Sunday that the Aquarius had been instructed by the Italian Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre to stand by in its current position, 35 nautical miles (65km) from Italy and 27 nautical miles from Malta. Despite Mr Salvini's stance, the mayors of Taranto and Naples had both offered to welcome the migrants, with Taranto's Rinaldo Melucci saying the Italian port city was ""ready to embrace every life in danger"". Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Populists take power in Italy: What comes next? Italy country profile Naples mayor Luigi de Magistris tweeted that ""if a minister without a heart leaves pregnant women, children, old people, human beings to die, the port of Naples is ready to welcome them"". By Guy Hedgecoe, BBC News, Madrid While Spain's willingness to take in the Aquarius has surprised many observers, for the new Spanish government it does make political sense for several reasons. The move solves a potentially thorny problem for the European Union, bolstering Pedro SÃ¡nchez's hopes of becoming an influential leader within the bloc. The new prime minister appears keen to distance himself from the legacy of his predecessor, Mariano Rajoy, whose international impact was discreet and who only took in a fraction of the refugees agreed upon in a 2015 accord with the EU. In addition, this gesture is likely to impress left-leaning parties such as Podemos which were instrumental in voting the Socialist in to office on 1 June, and whose support he still needs. Rules on disembarking and assisting rescue ships such as Aquarius are governed by international law. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea dictates that any ship learning of distress at sea must assist regardless of the circumstances. It says that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking them from the ship. It also clearly states that the relevant government ""shall arrange for such disembarkation to be effected as soon as reasonably practicable"". German charity SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e posted photos of rescued migrants By Kevin Connolly, Europe Correspondent, BBC News The European Union wrote its rules about how migrants should be handled in the 1990s when no-one could have imagined the collapse of Libya would create huge flows of desperate people heading across the Mediterranean from sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. The rules say migrants are the responsibility of the first member state where they land - an overwhelming problem in countries like Greece and Italy where the election of a populist government is at least in part a response to the pressure. So the migrants are starting to shape the politics of Southern Europe. And when Italy's Trumpish Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini proclaims ""victory"", he's telling his voters that the promise of a tougher line on immigration is real. He's challenging the EU to find a proper solution too, based on forcing other member states to accept quotas of migrants - something it's failed to do so far. And he's incidentally created a big question for Spain. Will its offer to the Aquarius be extended to further ships in the future?

"The PM wants to avoid defeats ahead of a crucial summit of EU leaders later this month The UK's negotiating position will be undermined if MPs defeat the government in key votes on its Brexit bill, Theresa May has told Tory MPs. The prime minister told backbenchers to ""think about the message Parliament will send to the European Union"". She wants to overturn a series of amendments made by the House of Lords. A compromise proposal is being worked on which could help Mrs May avoid defeat on whether the UK should seek to stay in a customs union with the EU. The move, being brokered by former Cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, came after rebel MPs suggested they have sufficient numbers to threaten the government and wanted more concessions. Flashpoints ahead for the Brexit bill Why is the customs union so important? This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? There will be two days of votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill on Tuesday and Wednesday. The bill is the key legislation the government needs to pass to make its Brexit strategy work. But the House of Lords has put forward changes to it which would require a different approach in some key areas. This week the government wants to kill off most of these changes - but numbers in the House of Commons are finely balanced, with the Conservatives needing the help of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to get a majority. The two amendments set to be most tricky for the government are one on Tuesday, which gives Parliament a decisive vote over the final Brexit deal, and another on Wednesday which instructs Mrs May to negotiate a customs union with the EU. Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was ""minded"" to vote against the government on the first of these, which calls for Parliament to get a ""meaningful vote"" on any final deal struck between the UK and EU. She also called for ""further concessions"" from the government on the customs union amendment. Conservative backbench MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said he thought the government would win the day. Speaking on LBC, Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs, predicted ""there will be unity, it won't be perfect"" but that it would be ""enough to get the bill through"". Please upgrade your browser to view this content. It is the legislation aimed at ensuring the UK has a smooth transition out of the EU. It will repeal the European Communities Act, which took Britain into what was then the European Economic Community, meaning EU law is no longer supreme in the UK. And to avoid a sudden ""cliff edge"" on Brexit day, 29 March 2019, it would also convert existing EU law into UK law so the government and Parliament can decide at a later date which bits they want to keep or change. The bill has also become of the focus of several attempts by MPs and peers to change parts of the government's approach to Brexit. The legislation is now back before the House of Commons after a total of 15 defeats by the House of Lords. The government opposes these amendments: Grant new powers to oversee changes made to EU law by the government Remove the precise day of Brexit from the wording of the bill Remove a section allowing ministers to use secondary legislation to establish when individuals can challenge the validity of retained EU law after exit Only let ministers use delegated powers to amend retained EU law where ""necessary"" Prevent ministers from using delegated powers to implement the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement Force the government to report on ""steps taken to negotiate a customs union with the EU"" by 31 October Make staying in the European Economic Area, like Norway, a ""negotiating objective"" for the UK Transfer the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights - which the government says will no longer apply - into UK law Allow ""enhanced scrutiny"" when ministers use delegated powers to change EU employment, equality health and safety, consumer and environment rules The government has proposed its own version of these ones: Give Parliament the power to decide what happens if MPs and peers reject the final Brexit deal Explicitly preserve cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic and commit to no new border arrangements without the agreement of the UK and Irish governments Allow people to challenge UK law if it fails to comply with the general principles of EU law Force ministers to maintain EU environmental principles in domestic law after Brexit Compel ministers to aim for a deal allowing unaccompanied child refugees to join relatives in the UK The government has accepted this amendment: Allow the UK to replicate EU law made after Brexit day and continue to participate in EU agencies At a specially convened meeting in Parliament, Mrs May told her MPs they ""must think about the message Parliament will send to the European Union this week"". ""I am trying to negotiate the best deal for Britain. I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible. ""But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined."" Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington set out the government's plea to potential rebels, saying the House of Lords had tried to damage the Brexit process by changing the EU bill. The purpose of the bill is to ensure ""legal certainty"" around Brexit, and it is ""profoundly in our national interest"" that MPs do not ""allow hostile amendments to frustrate those essential aims"" he said. ""This week, I hope that MPs from all parties, including those Labour MPs who want to see their constituents' votes in the referendum acted upon, will give the prime minister their backing,"" he added. His comments follow the claim from two senior Conservatives, Remainer Amber Rudd and Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith, that any rebellion will only play into the Labour leader's hands. Please upgrade your browser Some pro-EU Tories were reported to be backing away from voting against government, over fears that a defeat could prompt a leadership contest and see Mrs May replaced by a far more hard-line Brexiteer. Others, such as veteran Conservative MP Ken Clarke, however, have said the prime minister is being ""undermined"" by her ministers and needs to be ""rescued"". Labour are urging Tory rebels to side with them in the Commons on Tuesday and Wednesday with Labour's Sir Keir Starmer saying Tory rebels had a ""real chance to change the course of the Brexit negotiations"". But Jeremy Corbyn's party is also divided on Brexit, with pro-EU campaigners urging him to shift policy to support staying part of the EU's single market like Norway, which is the subject of another of the Lords amendments. Separately, David Davis began the latest round of negotiationswith his EU counterpart Michael Barnier in Brussels at a breakfast meeting.

"Discount retailer Poundworld has appointed administrators, putting 5,100 jobs at risk. The move came after talks with a potential buyer, R Capital, collapsed leaving Poundworld with no option other than administration. Poundworld, which serves two million customers a week from 335 stores, also trades under the Bargain Buys name. Administrators Deloitte stress the stores will continue to trade as normal with no redundancies at this time. What's eating the pound shops? It said in a statement: ""Like many high street retailers, Poundworld has suffered from high product cost inflation, decreasing footfall, weaker consumer confidence and an increasingly competitive discount retail market. Clare Boardman, joint administrator at Deloitte, said: ""The retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging and Poundworld has been seeking to address this through a restructure of its business. ""Unfortunately, this has not been possible."" She said Deloitte believed  a buyer could be found for the business, or at least part of it. A spokesperson for Poundworld''s owner, TPG said filing for administration had been ""a difficult decision"". ""Despite investing resources to strengthen the business, the decline in UK retail and changing consumer behaviour affected Poundworld significantly,"" they added. Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Five things to do with empty retail space Poundworld has been losing money for the past two years. Losses for the financial year 2016-17 were Â£17.1m, up from Â£5.4m the year before. It's the latest High Street retailer to run into trouble. Just last week,department store chain House of Fraser saidit would close 31 of its 59 shops, citing  the need to adapt to ""fundamental change"" in the retail industry. A combination of falling consumer confidence, rising overheads, the weaker pound and the growth of online shopping have made it tough for traditional retailers. Electronics chain Maplin and toy chain Toys 'R' Us both collapsed into administration earlier this year. Other High Street chains such as Mothercare and Carpetright have been forced to close stores in order to survive. Restaurant chains such as Italian chain Carluccio's, pizza restaurant Prezzo and burger chain Byron have also had to close stores as they battle a triple-whammy of falling trade, higher costs and increased competition. Only a few years ago Poundworld was expanding aggressively, now it is set to become yet another High Street casualty. It has, of course, been hit by the usual suspects, lower consumer confidence, falling footfall and more online shopping. But for pound shops these problems can be multiplied; for a start they depend on high turnover because the margin of profit when everything is sold for a pound is minute. Then they import a lot of what they sell, including large amounts from specialised suppliers in China. The weakness of the pound has pushed up the cost of imports and when by definition it is impossible to increase their prices, the squeeze on pound shop profits can be dramatic and very sudden. Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman said Poundworld was simply not managing its business well enough. ""The clue's in the name: These days having a fixed price in the title is a disadvantage but it is not a killer disadvantage. ""Importing products is not peculiar to Poundworld but others have been getting round this by getting manufacturers to put fewer biscuits in the pack, for example. ""The bigger picture is there are too many retailers with too many stores for the market to feed."" But despite the collapse of so many stores, David Gill, the national officer for the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, was not wholly pessimistic: ""When Toys R Us went into administration we had a number of retailers we work closely with saying 'there are job vacancies can you point them in this direction?', but whether you can absorb all 5,000 jobs that's another discussion."" Poundworld, which has its headquarters in West Yorkshire, was formed in 2004, but it says it can trace its origins ""back to 1974 and a market stall in Wakefield, West Yorkshire"". In 2014 Poundworld's founderChris Edwards took a central part in a BBC documentaryabout the intense competition between the company and its rivals Poundstretcher and Poundland. Investment company TPG, which bought a majority stake in Poundworld in 2015, also controls the restaurant chain Prezzo whose landlords and creditors agreed a restructuring last month.

"Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will ""always regret"" not meeting the residents of Grenfell Tower in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Writing in the Evening Standard,external, Mrs May said she understood her actions may have made it appear she ""didn't care"". Ahead of Thursday's one-year anniversary, she said she wanted to make clear that was ""never the case"". A total of 72 people died as a result of the blaze, the judge-led inquiry into the fire has said. Mrs May said it was ""clear"" that the initial response to the disaster was ""not good enough"", adding: ""I include myself in that."" What happened at Grenfell Tower?

""And I will always regret that by not meeting them that day, it seemed as though I didn't care."" Theresa May visited Grenfell Tower the day after the fire but did not meet survivors The public inquiry into the fire is currently paused for a week of memorials and vigils to mark the anniversary. In addition to the 71 victims who died in the blaze, Maria Del Pilar Burton, 74, died in January. She had been in hospital since she was rescued from the 19th floor. Members of the north Kensington community will come together for a 24-hour vigil on the eve of the anniversary. At 1:30 BST on Thursday, the names of the fire's victims will be read out at the nearby St Clement's church.

"The five gang members appeared in drill music videos with violent lyrics Five gang members who made ""drill"" music videos glorifying violence have been sentenced after being caught with machetes and baseball bats. Micah Bedeau, 19, Yonas Girma, 21, Isaac Marshall, 18, Jordan Bedeau, 17, and Rhys Herbert, 17, were jailed or detained for conspiracy to commit violent disorder, in Notting Hill. Police also applied for a court order to stop the group making drill music. Drill is a dark form of urban dance music often featuring violent lyrics. It originated in south Chicago and is derived from ""trap"" music, which is noted for its bleak atmosphere and references to drug dealing. Performers have also been accused of misogynistic content. The gang were caught in November 2017 carrying machetes and baseball bats as well as masks, balaclavas and gloves Officers caught the gang ""red-handed"" on 9 November 2017 after a two-year anti-gang operation. The members of the Ladbroke Grove gang, 1011, were thought to have been about to attack rivals from the 12 Worlds gang from Shepherds Bush. Kingston Crown Court heard that the attack was in retaliation to a YouTube video posted by 12 Worlds of the grandmother of the Bedeau brothers being harassed. YouTube deletes 'violent' music videos How a drill music video foreshadowed a murder Jurors were shown seven YouTube videos of the gang wearing balaclavas and full-face masks. This video can not be played Drill music spilling out of London 'reflects youth experience' The footage, which has since been removed, featured sounds of gunshots and lyrics glamorising violent crime. Jurors heard that the long-established major UK label Polydor Records had offered to work with the group. The court was told that music videos made by the gang members had been watched more than 15 million times online, and that they had earned thousands of pounds from music streaming sites. Before pleading guilty, the gang insisted the weapons they were caught with were simply props to be used in a new music video. Det Ch Supt Kevin Southworth, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ""When in this instance you see a particular genre of music being used specifically to goad, to incite, to provoke, to inflame, that can only lead to acts of very serious violence being committed, that's when it becomes a matter for the police. ""We're not in the business of killing anyone's fun, we're not in the business of killing anyone's artistic expression - we are in the business of stopping people being killed."" The court was shown seven videos featuring the gang including Yonas Girma, pictured The Met asked the judge, Recorder Ann Mulligan, to consider applications for Criminal Behaviour Orders (CBOs) to be handed to the gang to stop them from making any more drill music. This decision has been adjourned to a later date. Ms Mulligan said there was ""undeniably real musical talent on display"" in the videos and that a ""potentially promising music career"" lay ahead of the defendants. But she added that much of the content was ""menacingly violent"" and showed ""truly appalling attitudes to women"". She said she was certain ""serious violence would have ensued"" if the men had not been arrested. YouTube recently deleted just over half of the music videosthat the Met Commissioner, Cressida Dick, said were inciting violence. The Met has built up a database of more than 1,400 videos to use as an intelligence tool. Micah Bedeau was sent to a young offenders' unit for his part in the group's conspiracy to commit violent disorder The force is tackling a recent rise in killings and other violent crime, with more than 70 murder investigations launched already this year. Speaking about the spread of drill music in the UK, an academic said it gave an insight into the needs of deprived young people, rather than simply glorifying violence. Criminologist Dr Anthony Gunter told the BBC: ""If you see violence and pain and suffering all around you, because you live in a deprived neighbourhood, you're going to make music that's intense, violent and painful. ""If we want them to make beautiful music - nice, kind music - we've got to invest in these urban communities."" Micha Bedeau, Yonas Girma and Isaac Marshall were caught ""red-handed"" by anti-gang officers Micah Bedeau, 19, of Colville Square, Notting Hill - three years and three months in a young offenders' unit Yonas Girma, 21, of Hounslow Road, Hanworth - imprisoned for three years and six months Isaac Marshall, 18, of Ladbroke Grove - two-year detention order Jordan Bedeau, 17, from the W11 area - one-year detention and training order Rhys Herbert, 17, from the W11 area - one-year detention and training order Reporting restrictions preventing the identification of Jordan Bedeau and Rhys Herbert were lifted YouTube deletes 'violent' music videos The Met Buying Coordinator (14 months FTC) Robot-guided âsmart biopsyâ technique tested on patients in UK first South London's Christmas Lane Community pays tribute to 14-year-old with âpure heartâ stabbed to death on bus The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"This video can not be played Big planes and jogging guards: Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have arrived in Singapore The world once again got a glimpse of Kim Jong-un's suited running bodyguards as they escorted his motorcade in Singapore. But they're more than just a piece of spectacle, because when it comes to the leader's security, North Korea leaves absolutely nothing to chance. Analyst Michael Madden explains more about this mysterious group of men. When in North Korea, Mr Kim's close bodyguard has three different lines that surround him.  There's a modified version of this on display in Singapore and all eyes are on the men in dark suits. The bodyguards running alongside Mr Kim's limousine and those who walk in close proximity to him are part of something called Central Party Office #6, or formally, it's known as the Main Office of Adjutants. They form the immediate line around Mr Kim and are selected from Korean People's Army (KPA) recruits fulfilling their national service conscription obligations. Criteria for selection include a height requirement - they need to be approximately the same height as the supreme leader - and must not have any visual impairments. N Korea eyes 'new relationship' with US The crisis in 300 words 'Stop romanticising a dictator', say N Korean artists They must demonstrate certain accomplishments or a high aptitude for skills such as marksmanship - firing a gun - and martial arts.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Finally, a bodyguard is subjected to a rigorous background investigation in which his or her family, going back two generations, is vetted.  Many personnel of the Main Office of Adjutants are related to the Kim family, or to other elite North Korean families. Once they are accepted to become bodyguards (refusing the job offer is not really an option), they are subjected to an intensive training programme. Bodyguards are trained in a manner similar to the KPA's Special Operations Forces. This includes training in the use of handguns, evasion techniques and a variety of martial arts. Bodyguard trainees undergo physical endurance challenges, behavioural conditioning and physically rigorous drills. The bodyguards form a ring around him with the protective perimeter having a 360-degree view of both the people near him and the location. Walking, riding ahead, or in advance of Mr Kim are between three to five bodyguards including the director of the Main Office of Adjutants. Alongside him are between four to six bodyguards, with two to three on his right and left. Bringing up the rear are an additional four to five bodyguards. In a sign of their power in the regime, they are some of the only North Korean citizens permitted to carry loaded firearms next to their country's leader, usually a semi-automatic handgun and a back-up weapon. The bodyguards were first seen running beside Mr Kim's motorcade at the inter-Korean summit in April Despite carrying firearms, the bodyguards' main defence for Mr Kim are their skills of observation (of people near the leader and the premises), and neutralising any perceived threat with their hands and bodies. When Kim Jong-il was alive, there was a ratio of one bodyguard to two of the senior officials accompanying him. Kim Jong-un's bodyguards, in contrast to his father, are fewer in number and have a less obtrusive presence. Bodyguards are usually attired in Western-style suits and ties, as we see in Singapore, or the Zhongshan suits of party officials. Mr Kim's chauffeurs always wear linen or leather gloves to handle the steering wheel.  They also use radio communications with earpieces. What does Kim Jong-un want? North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis How the outcast became popular What should Donald Trump call Kim Jong-un? However, their primary communication methods are distinctly old school: they wear specific badges and pins on their clothing for a given event to establish their identification, and use a series of spoken passwords and code phrases. The Main Office of Adjutants has an estimated 200-300 personnel, of whom over half are bodyguards, and the remainder are drivers and technical staff.  While some of the leader's bodyguards have long careers, most only work in that capacity for 10 years. The Guard Command (GC) comprises the second and third lines of security around Mr Kim. Whereas the Main Office of Adjutants protects the Supreme Leader himself, the GC is mainly responsible for securing the physical premises of wherever he happens to be, whether it's his office buildings, private residences or locations he visits domestically or outside North Korea. In addition to that, the GC fulfils a number of logistical or technical functions to support the leader in his job. Guard Command personnel undergo a similar selection and vetting process as Mr Kim's bodyguards in the Main Office of Adjutants.  In fact most bodyguards rotate out of the latter department into the GC. Recent observation and reporting about Mr Kim's visit to Singapore noted that three planes arrived to the city state from Pyongyang. Guard Command personnel were on board at least two of these planes. These men and women are involved in a diverse number of support missions for Mr Kim. They will operate and maintain the secure telephone lines that the leader will use, as well as provide him with whatever computers he uses and IT security required. In addition to that, they have whatever liquor, foods, and cigarettes that Mr Kim will want during his time in Singapore, and will inspect any food or drink before it is served to him. It also has a medical department where his personal physicians and medical staff work, and at least two of these people are with him in Singapore. In terms of Mr Kim's personal security, the GC's #2 Department forms two of the three outer lines of security around him, and they normally focus on where Mr Kim works, stays or visits. The GC establishes one line immediately outside of the bodyguard group around him, followed by a third outer line near any roads, fences or other infrastructure within a half mile of any location. North Korean security personnel seen outside Mr Kim's hotel in Singapore If one were to pop down to the lobby of the St Regis hotel where he is staying in Singapore, one would most certainly encounter them. This three-tier personal security structure is virtually unheard of for any other world leader. And while the running bodyguards are a striking image, it is the additional and not immediately visible layers of security further out that are the most sophisticated and extreme in the lengths they will go to ensure the preservation of the Kim dynasty.

"One of the biggest moments of Donald Trump's presidency is looming large. We asked experts what they think of his preparations to meet Kim Jong-un. When asked about his planning for the Singapore summit, the president was straightforward. ""I don't think I have to prepare very much,"" he said. ""It's about the attitude. It's about willingness to get things done."" He's said he'll work on the flight, bringing with him 15 boxes of material to pore over. This week, he met Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others, to discuss negotiations in Singapore. But by almost any measure, the preparations for the summit were fast-tracked - officials who worked in previous administrations said they would start getting ready months or even years for their meetings with North Korean officials. Trump's supporters applauded him for his speed at organising the work before the meeting was scheduled. ""It would've taken two weeks just for Kerry to get his bicycles to Singapore,"" said Fox Business' Lou Dobbs, making fun of John Kerry, the former US secretary of state. For others, though, Trump's quickfire approach - and the speeded-up timetable - is worrisome. They say the pace of the preparations could put the negotiations in jeopardy. Meeting that could change the world Who is in Team Trump? Trump wants Kim to give up his nuclear weapons and has spoken of the Nobel Peace Prize for his own role in the high-stakes negotiations. Chief of Staff John Kelly told me they have ""great hope"" for the talks in Singapore. Some former US state department officials say that Trump's work has already produced results. ""The North Koreans have taken steps - like stopping missile tests - that no-one would have predicted six months ago, including me,"" says Joel Wit, a former US state department official and founder of a North Korea website, 38North. ""Of course - there's a lot more that needs to be done,"" he says. ""But these are steps that no one would have predicted."" Trump and Kim impersonators cause a stir in Singapore Others say Trump's already lost to Kim by going to the talks with no preconditions. ""There's too much focus on the meeting,"" says Albright Stonebridge Group's Eric Altbach, who served on the national security council under President George W Bush, rather than the meeting as a way to achieve an outcome. One thing is clear - the president brings excitement to diplomacy and believes that confidence - not prep work - is what matters. He cancelled the summit last month after the North Koreans issued statements about a nuclear showdown. Days later the president met a North Korean envoy who carried a letter from Kim. The summit was back on, and the president's policy goal had shifted - at first he had said that he wanted denuclearisation immediately. A senior White House aide told me that he has not backed down from his goal, but over time he began to understand that the process would take longer than he originally thought. North Korean human rights sidelined What do N Koreans know about summit? For some, the shifting of the president's ideas about denuclearisation is a problem. Brookings Institution's Ken Lieberthal, who was a national security council senior director for Asia from 1998-2000, says: ""It's very hard to figure out what the bottom line."" In the meantime, the president's aides were helping him get ready for the negotiations. On Wednesday morning I watched the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, head past the East Wing of the White House and asked him about preparations. ""Things are going well,"" he said. On Friday the president made it clear that he felt that he was on top of things - or at least he didn't need any advice from Democrats who, he said, had done ""NOTHING about North Korea'"".

No-one can predict how the meeting will go - or the negotiations. North Koreans want economic sanctions lifted, and they don't want to talk about human rights. They also want the US to reduce troops in South Korea. Trump likes to keep an open mind. He could leave the meeting abruptly if things go badly - or invite President Kim to the White House. They could also come up with a new agreement on that day. For some, the prospect is unsettling. ""The idea that the president is sort of walking into the room in an open-ended negotiation is beyond frightening,"" says Jeremy Shapiro, a former US state department official. ""Freelancing ideas in these meetings is dangerous,"" explains Shapiro. ""There's all these implications of a policy shift"", whether the issue is human rights, nuclear non-proliferation or the economic sanctions. As a diplomat, he says, he learned about the nuances of various issues - and also how hard it is for any one individual to grasp all the different aspects of a policy in a short period of time. Dennis Rodman the matchmaker? What not to say to North Korea Besides that, says Shapiro, the president has not appeared especially interested in the details of these policy matters. Instead he prefers to go into a meeting and see what happens. Shapiro says he believes this strategy can work well in certain settings - such as the business world and reality television, areas where the president has worked in the past. But translating that style into the realm of nuclear negotiations, says Shapiro, is ""a very serious mistake"". Human Rights Watch's John Sifton says: ""He could decide the only solution is a military technical one, and as a result hundreds of thousands of people will die."" Others say that they understand why the president would want to enter into negotiations with an open mind. ""Yeah, there is a danger that he'll go off the reservation and make a comment that could actually do harm,"" says Wit. ""But presidents in the past sometimes run with the ball themselves."" Life in Singapore goes on as anticipation builds Wit says: ""When you're president, you think: 'I'm not just a puppet that does everything my advisors tell me. I have my own ideas.'"" Wit says that President Ronald Reagan acted in an independent manner when he met Mikhail Gorbachev. They held a summit in 1985. Reagan's advisers wanted him to follow their talking points and were mortified, says Wit, when he made it clear that he wanted to speak in his own fashion - and on his own terms. Reagan and Gorbachev didn't come to an agreement on any substantive issues, but nevertheless they were able to speak directly at the summit and, as Reagan said later, ""understand each other better."" When it comes to the summit in Singapore, Wit says he's optimistic. ""It's not going to be a flop. I think the North Koreans are serious, and the president himself is pretty serious. He wants a win.""

"China is Pyongyang's only ally, and Washington's most powerful rival As the US and North Korea prepare for their historic summit, China is the elephant in the room. Beijing is Pyongyang's only significant, long-standing ally, as well as Washington's most powerful, long-term strategic rival. That gives it a huge role in determining whether or not any agreement reached between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un can be turned into success. As those two leaders hog the limelight, here are three key questions about the powerful player lurking off stage. In a word, stability. Answered the other way round, what China most definitely doesn't want is any more nuclear brinkmanship on its border. It knows only too well Pyongyang's paranoia. It mistrusts Washington's wildcard president. And it genuinely fears another war of words leading to military miscalculation and escalation. The meeting the world's been waiting for How outcast Kim became popular Human rights: The issue they won't talk about With that in mind, a return to diplomacy and dialogue has sometimes seemed like an end in itself for Beijing. But while China's patience with North Korea has been seen to be wearing thin in recent years, it is still an old ally, and America is still a common strategic rival. It is likely to be far more pragmatic about the possibility of Kim Jong-un unilaterally negotiating away his hard-won nuclear deterrent. And if Mr Kim is able to win any concessions from Mr Trump - any shift in the US military posture on or around the Korean peninsula for example - China will see an advantage for itself of course. Some. China accounts for up to 90% of North Korea's trade with the outside world. But China has not forced North Korea to the negotiating table. This video can not be played Barbed wire and smuggled crabs: Watching North Korea from China Beijing may have signed up for the toughest sanctions ever against its neighbour, but it did so arguing, with some logic, that the more economically isolated Pyongyang becomes, the more the regime is incentivised to pursue its strategy of nuclear deterrence. Kim Jong-un is off to Singapore on his own terms and for his own strategic reasons. Instead, China's sanctions enforcement serves mainly Chinese purposes. The goodwill generated can be traded in its wider, geopolitical contest with America. And it has the limited, but still useful effect of reminding North Korea that it can't ignore Chinese interests entirely. The effect is limited, of course, because North Korea knows that China fears an economic collapse on its border much more than it fears the nuclear status quo. It's is a classic case of the tail wagging the dog. Remarkably, President Xi and Chairman Kim met for the first time just three months ago,and they've met again since. Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un have now met twice The two meetings came only after the Trump-Kim summit was announced. Was this flurry of diplomacy, some analysts wondered, a sign that China was desperate not to be sidelined? There are suggestions that the sanctions are suddenly easing a bit. And Donald Trump has also hinted that China has begun meddling. ""I will say I'm a little disappointed"", he said, ""because when Kim Jong-un had the meeting with President Xi... I think there was a little change in attitude from Kim Jong-un. So I don't like that."" For China, success will be anything - a treaty, a roadmap, a warm handshake and a vague plan - that keeps the dialogue going. From its perspective, the most significant thing about the young North Korean leader is not any ambiguous talk of denuclearisation, but his fledgling, domestic economic reforms. Last month, according to the Chinese foreign ministry, a senior North Korean delegation visited Beijing ""to learn about the achievements of China's domestic economic development"". This has always been China's preferred model. Could the recent demolition of North Korea's nuclear test indicate that the country is moving away from its status as a isolated pariah state? It would not be a disaster, perhaps, from China's point of view to see North Korea (with its limited nuclear stockpile) locked into a never-ending set of disarmament negotiations while Chinese businesses get on with the job of building infrastructure and expanding trade. It's the ""Chinese dream"" made for export; stability through prosperity, with of course a good measure of lasting authoritarianism thrown in. Zhao Tong is a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre in Beijing. ""Regardless of how much nuclear progress is made during the summit, China has a more important long term strategic goal,"" he told me. ""Which is to help North Korea grow its economy and transform itself from isolated pariah state into a more normal and more open country."" But if the summit runs off the rails, if there's a return to the US talk of limited military strikes, China may push on with its plan anyway. North Korea crisis in 300 words North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea has its bomb and is now clearly in statesman mode. Displays of North Korean ""restraint"" would not be lost on China and if talks collapse, it would be likely to point a finger of blame not at Mr Kim, but at Mr Trump. ""If the United States walks out of the summit and goes back to the maximum pressure campaign, China would blame the United States for the failure of diplomacy,"" says Mr Zhao from the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre. ""And if the US shows any willingness to launch a military strike to disarm North Korea it's possible I think China would try to mobilise its own forces to send a signal of deterrence against Washington."" China is waiting in the wings. The Singapore summit, one way or another, is likely to increase its influence. How Kim the outcast became popular What crosses the China-North Korea border?

"Students are paying artificially high interest rates, says a cross-party committee The tuition fee system for England's universities is ripping off students and giving taxpayers poor value for money, says a parliamentary committee. The House of Lords economic affairs committee revealed evidence the student loan book would grow to over Â£1 trillion over the next 25 years. The committee attacked a ""deeply unfair"" system of fees and loans. But the Department for Education said its review of fees would ""make sure students are getting value for money"". Are you paying off a student loan? BBC News has set up a new UK Facebook group all about affordable living. Join the Affordable Living group here,external. This hard-hitting report accuses the government of using ""accounting tricks"" to conceal the real cost of higher education and to pile up huge debts for future generations. It calls for ""immediate reforms"" - such as cutting interest rates on repayments and restoring grants for disadvantaged students. Committee chairman and former Conservative minister, Lord Forsyth, said they had also been ""quite astonished by the complete collapse in part-time education"". The report warns of the lack of funding for vocational training - and claims that the apprenticeship system has been damaged by artificial targets invented to sound impressive for a manifesto promise. Peers say there have been ""fiscal illusions"" over the real cost of student borrowing The cross-party committee, with two former chancellors and two ex-chief secretaries to the Treasury, says the student loan system seems to have been used for a ""fiscal illusion"" to make the deficit look smaller. ""The thing that shocked me - and I thought I was pretty unshockable - was that I had not understood that by moving to a system of funding through loans, because of the accounting methods of the Treasury, it was possible for George Osborne [then chancellor] to appear to increase funding for higher education by Â£3bn but at the same time cut his deficit by Â£3.8bn,"" says Lord Forsyth. The cost of unpaid loans will not be included until they are officially written off after 30 years. Lord Forsyth says a parliamentary question revealed how much student borrowing was really piling up for the future. By 2044, when many of today's students will still be paying off their loans, the student loan book will have grown to more than Â£1tn, rising to Â£1.2tn by 2049. ""The public argument for cutting the deficit was so that debt wasn't handed on to the next generation. ""But for this generation, being asked to pay these loans, when they've eventually paid them off, they'll suddenly find there's a bill for Â£1.2tn. ""I hadn't realised that was happening."" But Lord Forsyth says this system has had ""devastating consequences"". It has produced excessive interest rates, set to rise again to 6.3%, which the committee says should be no higher than the rate at which the government borrows, at present 1.5%. The committee heard that some existing training had been re-badged as an apprenticeship The conversion of means-tested grants into loans has meant that the poorest students end up graduating with the biggest debts, says Lord Forsyth. And he warns that the current repayment system was more expensive for people in middle income jobs such as nursing, rather than high-paid lawyers or financiers, who would pay off their debts more quickly. ""The people who get screwed by this are those in the middling jobs,"" says Lord Forsyth. ""This was all done on the basis that it would create a market in higher education - and that has failed, there isn't a market."" Lord Forsyth says that there is no meaningful consumer choice or competition - and he dismissed the system for rating teaching quality in universities, the teaching excellence framework, as a ""bit of a joke"". ""Because no-one ever turns up to look at the teaching,"" says Lord Forsyth. The report says that the student finance system has failed to recognise the need to improve vocational skills and to help those wanting to re-train. Part-time student numbers have fallen by about 60% over the past decade - with accusations that the funding system is based around school-leavers beginning full-time degree courses. ""There's been a huge distorting effect. It's a huge mistake,"" says the committee chair. Lord Forsyth says there have been concerns about the apprenticeship policy - and the committee heard suggestions that the target for three million apprentices was not the result of any strategy, but was chosen as an impressive number for a manifesto promise. The consequence of such target setting, he says, is to ""encourage quantity rather than quality"". It means more attention is paid to the numbers starting than completing and there were signs that some employers were re-badging existing training as ""apprenticeships"" as a way of getting funding. ""There is clear evidence that what the economy needs is more people with technical and vocational skills. But the way that the funding for fees and maintenance operates makes it pretty well impossible for us to meet that demand,"" says Lord Forsyth. Alice Barnard, chief executive of the Edge Foundation, which promotes vocational education, said the report ""clearly highlights how the funding bias in our higher education system has favoured universities at the expense of choice and opportunity for young people"". The head of the MillionPlus group of new universities, Greg Walker, said the report had produced ""robust evidence"" to support the return of maintenance grants and to find ways to make universities more accessible to part-time students. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We agree that for too long young people have not had a genuine choice post-16 about where and what they wish to study. ""That is exactly why we have overhauled apprenticeships to focus on quality and why we are fundamentally transforming technical education, investing Â£500m a year in new T-levels that will provide a high quality, technical alternative to A-levels. ""On top of this, we are undertaking a major review of post-18 education and funding, to make sure students are getting value for money and genuine choice between technical, vocational and academic routes.""

"This video can not be played Big planes and jogging guards: Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have arrived in Singapore The world once again got a glimpse of Kim Jong-un's suited running bodyguards as they escorted his motorcade in Singapore. But they're more than just a piece of spectacle, because when it comes to the leader's security, North Korea leaves absolutely nothing to chance. Analyst Michael Madden explains more about this mysterious group of men. When in North Korea, Mr Kim's close bodyguard has three different lines that surround him.  There's a modified version of this on display in Singapore and all eyes are on the men in dark suits. The bodyguards running alongside Mr Kim's limousine and those who walk in close proximity to him are part of something called Central Party Office #6, or formally, it's known as the Main Office of Adjutants. They form the immediate line around Mr Kim and are selected from Korean People's Army (KPA) recruits fulfilling their national service conscription obligations. Criteria for selection include a height requirement - they need to be approximately the same height as the supreme leader - and must not have any visual impairments. N Korea eyes 'new relationship' with US The crisis in 300 words 'Stop romanticising a dictator', say N Korean artists They must demonstrate certain accomplishments or a high aptitude for skills such as marksmanship - firing a gun - and martial arts.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Finally, a bodyguard is subjected to a rigorous background investigation in which his or her family, going back two generations, is vetted.  Many personnel of the Main Office of Adjutants are related to the Kim family, or to other elite North Korean families. Once they are accepted to become bodyguards (refusing the job offer is not really an option), they are subjected to an intensive training programme. Bodyguards are trained in a manner similar to the KPA's Special Operations Forces. This includes training in the use of handguns, evasion techniques and a variety of martial arts. Bodyguard trainees undergo physical endurance challenges, behavioural conditioning and physically rigorous drills. The bodyguards form a ring around him with the protective perimeter having a 360-degree view of both the people near him and the location. Walking, riding ahead, or in advance of Mr Kim are between three to five bodyguards including the director of the Main Office of Adjutants. Alongside him are between four to six bodyguards, with two to three on his right and left. Bringing up the rear are an additional four to five bodyguards. In a sign of their power in the regime, they are some of the only North Korean citizens permitted to carry loaded firearms next to their country's leader, usually a semi-automatic handgun and a back-up weapon. The bodyguards were first seen running beside Mr Kim's motorcade at the inter-Korean summit in April Despite carrying firearms, the bodyguards' main defence for Mr Kim are their skills of observation (of people near the leader and the premises), and neutralising any perceived threat with their hands and bodies. When Kim Jong-il was alive, there was a ratio of one bodyguard to two of the senior officials accompanying him. Kim Jong-un's bodyguards, in contrast to his father, are fewer in number and have a less obtrusive presence. Bodyguards are usually attired in Western-style suits and ties, as we see in Singapore, or the Zhongshan suits of party officials. Mr Kim's chauffeurs always wear linen or leather gloves to handle the steering wheel.  They also use radio communications with earpieces. What does Kim Jong-un want? North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis How the outcast became popular What should Donald Trump call Kim Jong-un? However, their primary communication methods are distinctly old school: they wear specific badges and pins on their clothing for a given event to establish their identification, and use a series of spoken passwords and code phrases. The Main Office of Adjutants has an estimated 200-300 personnel, of whom over half are bodyguards, and the remainder are drivers and technical staff.  While some of the leader's bodyguards have long careers, most only work in that capacity for 10 years. The Guard Command (GC) comprises the second and third lines of security around Mr Kim. Whereas the Main Office of Adjutants protects the Supreme Leader himself, the GC is mainly responsible for securing the physical premises of wherever he happens to be, whether it's his office buildings, private residences or locations he visits domestically or outside North Korea. In addition to that, the GC fulfils a number of logistical or technical functions to support the leader in his job. Guard Command personnel undergo a similar selection and vetting process as Mr Kim's bodyguards in the Main Office of Adjutants.  In fact most bodyguards rotate out of the latter department into the GC. Recent observation and reporting about Mr Kim's visit to Singapore noted that three planes arrived to the city state from Pyongyang. Guard Command personnel were on board at least two of these planes. These men and women are involved in a diverse number of support missions for Mr Kim. They will operate and maintain the secure telephone lines that the leader will use, as well as provide him with whatever computers he uses and IT security required. In addition to that, they have whatever liquor, foods, and cigarettes that Mr Kim will want during his time in Singapore, and will inspect any food or drink before it is served to him. It also has a medical department where his personal physicians and medical staff work, and at least two of these people are with him in Singapore. In terms of Mr Kim's personal security, the GC's #2 Department forms two of the three outer lines of security around him, and they normally focus on where Mr Kim works, stays or visits. The GC establishes one line immediately outside of the bodyguard group around him, followed by a third outer line near any roads, fences or other infrastructure within a half mile of any location. North Korean security personnel seen outside Mr Kim's hotel in Singapore If one were to pop down to the lobby of the St Regis hotel where he is staying in Singapore, one would most certainly encounter them. This three-tier personal security structure is virtually unheard of for any other world leader. And while the running bodyguards are a striking image, it is the additional and not immediately visible layers of security further out that are the most sophisticated and extreme in the lengths they will go to ensure the preservation of the Kim dynasty.

""I'm up at three o'clock in the morning these days and I go to bed at half seven. ""I've had 18 and a half years of it, Mrs Wright, we pass like ships in the night and you're looking around and thinking, at some point you've got to have a change."" The Wright Stuff rated relatively well, had a proven formula, and its longevity made it a key part of the Channel 5 brand. It also made noise on social media, and occasionally generated news and profile for the channel. Over the past several months, the show has maintained its audience share, but away from the cameras there has been tension aplenty. ITN is an outstanding international production company, with an exceptional record in News. The Wright Stuff is an entertaining chat show. It is certainly driven by the news and presented by a former tabloid hack; but its jovial and fun spirit struggled to make the transition into a new culture.

"This video can not be played Peter Navarro: ""There's a special place in hell"" for Justin Trudeau US President Donald Trump has renewed his attacks on America's closest allies following the divisive G7 summit in Canada at the weekend. In a string of angry tweets Mr Trump said the US paid ""close to the entire cost of Nato"" to help protect countries that ""rip us off on trade"". The US actually contributes about a fifth of Nato's direct funding under a formula based on national income. G7 allies criticised Mr Trump's decision to reject a joint communique. German Chancellor Angela Merkel described his change of heart as ""sobering and a little depressing"". The French presidency had earlier condemned ""fits of anger"". After Mr Trump had left the summit in Quebec he rounded on Justin Trudeau personally, suggesting the Canadian prime minister was ""very dishonest and weak"" and ""acts hurt when called out"". Trump's jibe angers Canadians Reality Check: Is Trump right about trade? During a news conference Mr Trudeau had reasserted his opposition to US tariffs on steel and aluminium, and vowed to press ahead with retaliatory moves on 1 July. UK Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs on Monday that she wanted to pay ""a particular tribute"" to Mr Trudeau for his leadership and skilful chairing. She said it had been ""a difficult summit with, at times, some very candid discussions"" and that the UK would honour its commitments in the joint communique. Mr Trump's latest twitter tirade came after he arrived in Singapore for his summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. ""Fair trade is now to be called fool trade,"" he added in response to the threat of the retaliatory tariffs against the US. The war of words comes after Mr Trump rejected the final communique agreed by G7 leaders The president tweeted on Monday that America was paying disproportionately more towards the costs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) than fellow members. ""They pay only a fraction of the cost - and laugh,"" he wrote, adding that the EU needed to pay ""much more"" to help fund the international military alliance, which comprises 28 members including the UK, US, Germany, Canada and Turkey. Not all EU members are Nato members. What's happening in this G7 picture? Trump prefers unscripted Kim summit to G7 ritual Trump's 'obsolete' comment worries Nato Mr Trump went on to say that the US gets ""unfairly clobbered"" on trade despite ""protecting Europe at great financial loss"". ""Change is coming!"" he warned. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump has consistently said that countries that have a trade surplus with the US - meaning they export more to the US than they import - are ""taking advantage"" of the US. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC News defence and diplomatic correspondent While only part of the greater US spending is directed to the collective defence of its Nato allies, President Trump has argued since before his election that the allies are freeloading on the backs of US taxpayers and are failing to spend enough of their own resources on their defence. This will be an issue at the Nato summit in Brussels in July. Many Nato countries are now spending more. Will President Trump welcome this trend and encourage them to go further or will he simply castigate the allies collectively for not doing enough? Mr Trump said his decision to reject the joint G7 communique was based on Mr Trudeau's ""false statements... and the fact that Canada is charging massive tariffs to our US farmers, workers and companies"". This video can not be played Trudeau: ""I don't want to hurt American workers"" Mr Trudeau had said that while he did not want to ""punish American workers"", his job was to protect Canadians and as such he would press ahead with tariffs on some US imports. ""Canadians are polite and reasonable but we will also not be pushed around,"" he said. Late on Sunday Angela Merkel went on German TV to denounce Mr Trump's stance. ""We won't let ourselves be ripped off again and again. We will then act too,"" she said in reference to US import tariffs. She did, however, accept that Germany had to pay more for its own security even if it was an unpopular step. Other G7 partners also seemed stunned by Mr Trump's reaction, and pledged to support the communique. This video can not be played Who left their mark on President Trump at the G7 summit? French President Emmanuel Macron said international co-operation could not be ""dictated by fits of anger and throwaway remarks"". ""Let's be serious and worthy of our people,"" a statement from the French presidency said. ""We make commitments and keep to them."" Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister who as an MEP currently co-ordinates Brexit talks for the European Parliament, mocked Mr Trump's temper and supposed closeness to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In recent weeks, trading partners of the US have criticised new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports imposed by the Trump administration. On 1 June, the US imposed a 25% tariff for steel and 10% for aluminium on imports from the European Union (EU), Canada, and Mexico. Mr Trump said the move would protect domestic producers that were vital to US security. The EU then announced retaliatory tariffs on US goods ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon. Canada and Mexico are also taking action. A looming row over trade What is a trade war?

"England wore black armbands in memory of Ray Wilkins and ray Wilson ahead of their World Cup warm-up win over Nigeria England should wear black armbands during the World Cup to protest against the Russian regime, an MP has said. Labour's Stephen Kinnock said the Fifa tournament is a ""massive propaganda coup"" for Russia. Fifa bans players from wearing political, religious or commercial symbols and the FA has previously beenchallenged over UK teams choosing to wear poppiesnear to Remembrance Day. The FA said it would not respond to the suggestion from the MP for Aberavon. After the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in March, Mr Kinnock told a parliamentary debate Russia should be stripped of the right to host the tournament. TheUK government blamed the Russian authoritiesfor the nerve agent attack - which also injured a police officer. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? What fans going to Russia should know Is the poppy a political symbol? Mr Kinnock said: ""We are using the beautiful game to launder the reputation of a dangerous authoritarian regime and that poses some major questions. ""We should think creatively about what we might be able to do to send a message."" Fifa has previously said players are banned from wearing poppies Mr Kinnock said pulling England out of the World Cup ""would have been wrong"" as it would have made it seem as if there were only an issue between Russia and the UK. He said there are universal human rights norms of which Russia is in violation. England, who were visited by the Duke of Cambridge ahead of their last warm-up match, will start their World Cup against Tunisia on 18 June Wearing black armbands would ""mark the death"" of Alexander Litvinenko, whodied after being poisonedin London in 2006, as well as the attack on the Skripals, he said. He acknowledged such a move would see the FA ""probably sanctioned by Fifa"", but added: "" At some point we've got to make a decision about the role and responsibility of football in the world."" The MP, who worked in Russia for three years as director of the British Council, said footballers have a big social media following and are ""role models"". He said: ""It would great if they were able to say 'we're here in Russia now, but what's happened on the streets of the United Kingdom raises concerns for all of us.

"The star will perform a duet with Russian soprano Aida Garifullina Robbie Williams is to open the 2018 World Cup in Moscow - just two years after Russian newspapers said he should be banned from performing there. The pop star, whose hits include Angels and Let Me Entertain You, will headline the tournament's opening ceremony at the Luzhniki Stadium on Thursday. He will perform alongside Russian soprano Aida Garifullina, just half an hour before the first match kicks off. But he will presumably exclude the song Party Like A Russian from his setlist. The track, which portrays Russia's elite as unsmiling, super-rich autocrats who party on superyachts and hire thugs to settle disputes by putting ""the boots in"", was roundly criticised in Russia upon its release in 2016. A number of Russian media outlets criticised Williams' ""offensive"" stereotyping, while others predicted he would never play in the country again. ""This will upset those who previously wanted him to perform, who brought him to Moscow, or wanted him to perform at their events abroad,"" said Sergey Knyazev, a member of the National Association of Event Organizers, in an interview with the Pro-Kremlin channel Life News.

""I've done a lot in my career, and opening the Fifa World Cup to 80,000 football fans in the stadium and many millions all over the world is a boyhood dream."" Meanwhile, on Sunday, Williams' team won the annual Soccer Aid tournament at Old Trafford in Manchester.

"This video can not be played Charity workers look after migrants on the Aquarius Spain's prime minister has said the country will take in a rescue ship stranded in the Mediterranean, to help avoid a humanitarian disaster. Pedro SÃ¡nchez said he would give ""safe harbour"" to the Aquarius and the 629 people on board, after Italy and Malta both refused to let the ship dock. The UN refugee agency and the EU had both called for a swift end to the stand-off between the two countries. Mr SÃ¡nchez, who took office a week ago, said the ship would dock in Valencia. The migrants aboard the Aquarius were picked up from inflatable boats off the coast of Libya at the weekend, in six different rescue operations, according to the NGO SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e. ""It is our duty to help avoid a humanitarian catastrophe and offer a safe port to these people, to comply with our human rights obligations,"" Mr Sanchez's office said. The Council of Europe welcomed Spain's move, with the organisation's Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatovic, tweeting: ""Saving lives at sea is an obligation that states must  always uphold."" Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat tweeted his gratitude to Spain, saying Italy had broken international rules and caused a standoff. He said Malta would be sending fresh supplies to the vessel, adding: ""We will have to sit down and discuss how to prevent this from happening again. This is a European issue."" Spain's decision to take in the ship was hailed by Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini as a ""victory"" for his government's hardline immigration policy. Those saved include 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 younger children and seven pregnant women, SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e said. This video can not be played Former Aquarius volunteer: ""The whole deck will be full of people"" The minors are aged between 13 and 17 and come from Eritrea, Ghana, Nigeria and Sudan, according to a journalist on the ship, Anelise Borges. ""Most of them are sleeping outside. They are obviously exhausted, they have been exposed to the elements, they have been at sea for 20 to 30 hours prior to their rescue,"" she told the BBC. ""They are fragile and we have yet to learn what's going to happen to them,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Salvini refused to let the ship in, saying: ""Saving lives is a duty, turning Italy into a huge refugee camp is not."" ""Italy is done bending over backwards and obeying - this time THERE IS SOMEONE WHO SAYS NO,"" he wrote on Twitter, with the hashtag #closethedoors. Mr Salvini, leader of the right-wing League party, promised during Italy's recent general election to take a tough stance against migration. Reality Check: Claims about migrants arriving in Italy Desperate migrants rescued from the sea UN sanctions for people traffickers in Libya He said Malta should accept the Aquarius, but it refused, arguing that it falls under Italy's jurisdiction. Italy is the main entry point for migrants crossing from North Africa to Europe. Mr Salvini has previously said he is considering action against organisations that rescue migrants at sea. He has accused them of being in cahoots with people-smugglers. This video can not be played On a visit to Sicily, Matteo Salvini said Italy must increase its deportations of migrants On Sunday, he said that Italy was saying ""no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration"". ""Malta takes in nobody,"" he added. ""France pushes people back at the border, Spain defends its frontier with weapons."" SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e said late on Sunday that the Aquarius had been instructed by the Italian Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre to stand by in its current position, 35 nautical miles (65km) from Italy and 27 nautical miles from Malta. Despite Mr Salvini's stance, the mayors of Taranto and Naples had both offered to welcome the migrants, with Taranto's Rinaldo Melucci saying the Italian port city was ""ready to embrace every life in danger"". Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Populists take power in Italy: What comes next? Italy country profile Naples mayor Luigi de Magistris tweeted that ""if a minister without a heart leaves pregnant women, children, old people, human beings to die, the port of Naples is ready to welcome them"". By Guy Hedgecoe, BBC News, Madrid While Spain's willingness to take in the Aquarius has surprised many observers, for the new Spanish government it does make political sense for several reasons. The move solves a potentially thorny problem for the European Union, bolstering Pedro SÃ¡nchez's hopes of becoming an influential leader within the bloc. The new prime minister appears keen to distance himself from the legacy of his predecessor, Mariano Rajoy, whose international impact was discreet and who only took in a fraction of the refugees agreed upon in a 2015 accord with the EU. In addition, this gesture is likely to impress left-leaning parties such as Podemos which were instrumental in voting the Socialist in to office on 1 June, and whose support he still needs. Rules on disembarking and assisting rescue ships such as Aquarius are governed by international law. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea dictates that any ship learning of distress at sea must assist regardless of the circumstances. It says that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking them from the ship. It also clearly states that the relevant government ""shall arrange for such disembarkation to be effected as soon as reasonably practicable"". German charity SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e posted photos of rescued migrants By Kevin Connolly, Europe Correspondent, BBC News The European Union wrote its rules about how migrants should be handled in the 1990s when no-one could have imagined the collapse of Libya would create huge flows of desperate people heading across the Mediterranean from sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. The rules say migrants are the responsibility of the first member state where they land - an overwhelming problem in countries like Greece and Italy where the election of a populist government is at least in part a response to the pressure. So the migrants are starting to shape the politics of Southern Europe. And when Italy's Trumpish Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini proclaims ""victory"", he's telling his voters that the promise of a tougher line on immigration is real. He's challenging the EU to find a proper solution too, based on forcing other member states to accept quotas of migrants - something it's failed to do so far. And he's incidentally created a big question for Spain. Will its offer to the Aquarius be extended to further ships in the future?

"This video can not be played Chloe Ayling: ""I've been through a terrifying experience"" Model Chloe Ayling says she feels ""vindicated"" after the man she accused of kidnapping her was convicted and jailed for almost 17 years. Ms Ayling was lured to Italy from London on the promise of a photo shoot by Lucasz Herba, who drugged her and took her to a farmhouse in a holdall. Herba, 30, held her there for six days in July 2017, and demanded a 300,000 Euro (Â£265,000) ransom. The Polish national was jailed following a trial at a court in Milan. The court heard he offered Ms Ayling for sale online, before handing her over to the British consulate. Herba - described by prosecutors as a ""narcissist and a fantasist who was obsessed with Miss Ayling"" - was also found guilty of attempted extortion and carrying false documents. He was jailed for 16 years and nine months. Herba had claimed Ms Ayling went with him willingly, which she denied. At the start of the trial in February, a police officer told the court that Ms Ayling had suffered mental and physical abuse during the six-day ordeal. Lucasz Herba was sentenced at a court in Milan following a trial Her agent Adrian Sington said: ""This has been an incredible burden on her shoulders for the last year in the face of media criticism of her motivation and this is vindication - her story is true. ""It means now she can get on with her life. It's hard if you're being painted in the press as a liar and now she's able to say, 'I know it's a bizarre story but it's a true one'."" He called Herba a ""psychopath and a narcissist"" who ""behaves in such a way that it's almost impossible to believe that someone could be so stupid"". ""So, in some ways, it's not surprising that the media found Chloe's story difficult to believe,"" he said. ""Let's not forget she was bundled into a suitcase, injected with ketamine in the boot of a car and thought she was going to die."" The BBC's Gavin Lee said Herba orchestrated ""an extraordinary kidnap plot"" in an attempt to win the model's affections. Herba, who lived in Oldbury, West Midlands, posed as a photographer in July last year and lured the 20-year-model, from Coulsdon, south London, to a fake studio in Milan. He then injected Ms Ayling with the tranquilliser drug ketamine. Herba was jailed for 16 years and nine months She was stripped, handcuffed, placed in a holdall bag and driven 120 miles (193km) in the boot of a car to a remote farmhouse near Turin. The model was held captive for six days. It was heard in court that Herba then pretended to be from a group called the Black Death, involved with selling models as sex slaves in Saudi Arabia, but ultimately released Ms Ayling after discovering she had a child. Our correspondent added: ""This, according to the prosecution, was another elaborate lie, set up in an attempt to win the model's sympathy and affection before releasing her."" In his defence, Herba said he had previously met Ms Ayling and had fallen in love with her. He claimed he wanted to create a scandal to help her career by creating extra publicity. Herba said that he was inspired after watching the film By Any Means - in which a similar kidnap plot was carried out. The court ruled out any involvement from Ms Ayling. Herba's brother Michal is alleged to have been involved in the kidnap and is in the process of being extradited from the UK. He denies any involvement.

"Detectives say the family was threatened with a large knife A family of four were robbed by two masked men on a moped as they sat in a stationary car in Croydon, south London. One of the suspects threatened the family with a large knife on Keats Way, Coulsdon, at about 17:45 BST on Friday. Police say the pair made off with a ""small quantity of jewellery"".

"Manhattan Beach Police released this photograph of Vaughn following his arrest Vince Vaughn has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving, police in the US have confirmed. The Hollywood star was stopped at a police checkpoint outside of Los Angeles in the early hours of Sunday morning. Vaughn and his passenger were also charged for public intoxication and resisting, delaying or obstructing officers. Both men were taken to the Manhattan Beach jail, and later released. The incident occurred between Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, just south of LA International airport. Sgt Tim Zins, a spokesman for the Manhattan Beach Police Department, said the charges for resisting arrest were not to do with Vaughn ""fighting police officers, but more of delaying the investigation"". The arrest occurred around 01:00 PST (09:00 BST) on Sunday and is Vaughn's first drink-driving arrest. Vaughn played Peter La Fleur in 2004's Dodgeball The actor, best known for films including Dodgeball and Wedding Crashers, was previously arrested in 2001 following a bar brawl which saw fellow actor Steve Buscemi stabbed in the face, throat, and arm when he intervened in a fight between Vaughn, screenwriter Scott Rosenberg, and another man. Vaughn was arrested for assault following the incident, but the charges were later dropped. The 49-year-old actor's most recent film was Brawl in Cell Block 99 in which he played a former boxer.

"This video can not be played 'I felt as though I didn't count. It was all right for him to do what he had done. He got put away for it but that was it' A woman sexually abused by her stepfather between the ages of four and 16 is challenging a law which stops victims of crime who lived under the ""same roof"" as their attacker prior to 1979, from receiving compensation. Her case is brought in courts covering England and Wales. There are separate challenges against the so-called ""same roof rule"" in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse wants the rule scrapped. The Ministry of Justice says rules were changed in October 1979 so that any future child victims of domestic crimes can claim compensation, but the changes are not retrospective. From the age of four until she was 16 the childhood of the woman, known for legal reasons as JT, was one of almost unimaginable suffering at the hands of her stepfather. ""He raped me, he sexually abused me,"" she says. ""Abuse happened on a daily basis. The rape happened every now and again. ""My mam used to work at a fish shop, and she worked nights. So, that's when it would happen, when she wasn't in. It was the absolute norm. It was every day. It was like getting up and getting your teeth brushed. It was the normal for me. ""The worst time was in the loft. I don't know how he got me there. I was about 11 or 12. There was a mattress on the loft boards and he would put me in the loft on the mattress and he would have sex with me. He'd rape me there."" she recalls. Finally, in her 40s, JT found the courage to go to the police. In 2012 her stepfather faced justice.  JT was the main witness at his trial, where he was convicted of eight offences including rape and sexual assault and jailed for 14 years. But when she applied for compensation under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, which provides state-funded compensation to victims of violent crime, she was refused. The problem was the ""same roof rule"" which says that compensation will not be paid if, prior to 1979, the victim and the assailant were living together as members of the same family at the time of the attack. ""I just couldn't believe it, I thought it was wrong.  I was absolutely disgusted with the judicial system in this country. JT says the refusal of compensation ""was like a kick in the teeth"" ""It was like a kick in the teeth and I felt as though I didn't count.  It was all right for him to do what he done. He got put away for it, but that was it.  My life still has to go on and I don't have a life.  I exist, but I don't have a life,"" she says. JT's case points out the kind of anomaly the rule creates. A relative who was abused by JT's stepfather in a much more minor way was awarded compensation because, unlike JT, she was not living with JT's stepfather at the time as part of the same family. The legal challenge that will take place at the Court of Appeal next week argues that the ""same roof"" rule discriminates against the group of victims who were living with their attacker before 1979 as members of the same family. It reasons that if you were a young child before 1 October 1979 you could not have left the home where your abuser lived, so cannot now receive compensation - but any other victim who was not living in the house could receive it. In what is a highly unusual situation, similar legal challenges are also being brought before the courts in Scotland and Northern Ireland by victims denied compensation. In its interim report in April, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) recommended that the rule be scrapped. JT's solicitor Alistair Smith, from the firm Watson Woodhouse, says: ""The basis of the 'same roof' rule was to stop people who were assaulting people living in the same house, from benefitting financially if compensation was awarded. ""It was never envisaged to take into account people like JT who were children at the time and had no choice as to where and with whom they lived."" Whatever the outcome of the legal challenges to the ""same roof rule"", for JT the effects of the abuse remain. 'I have recurring nightmares.  It's always the same one.  I was about 11, 12 and my cousin had come to stay and they'd brought him in the middle of the night. ""And he carried me out of my single bed and put me in their double bed so that my nephew could sleep in my bed, and I woke up with him on top of me, with his hand over my mouth - and I have that dream every night."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""The sexual abuse of children is abhorrent and the perpetrator in this case faced a lengthy term in prison. ""The rules were changed in 1979 so that any future child victims of domestic crimes can claim compensation.""

"This video can not be played Big planes and jogging guards: Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have arrived in Singapore North Korean state media have raised the possibility that the isolated country could ""establish a new relationship"" with the United States. It comes a day before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un meets US President Donald Trump for historic talks. The comments mark a shift in tone from North Korea after decades of animosity towards the US. Meanwhile Mr Trump has said he has a ""good feeling"" about Tuesday's much-anticipated summit. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Both leaders arrived for the talks - the first ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader - in Singapore on Sunday. Mr Trump tweeted on Monday morning that there was ""excitement in the air"" ahead of the summit. He hopes the meeting will kick-start a process that eventually sees Mr Kim give up nuclear weapons. But North Korea's perspective has always been more opaque. Later on Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US was willing to offer ""unique"" security guarantees to North Korea so the isolated state would know that denuclearisation was ""not something that ends badly for them"". He stressed that the US objective of the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula had not changed. Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, who met Mr Trump and Mr Kim separately on Sunday evening, told the BBC that both leaders were feeling ""supremely confident"" ahead of their meeting. North Korea's state media do not usually report on the leader's activities in real time,and the summit has only had a passing mention so far. This video can not be played How to talk to North Korea - advice from three North Korean experts The editorial in Rodong Sinmun confirmed that Mr Kim had travelled to Singapore to meet Mr Trump and that ""we will establish a new relationship to meet the changing demands of the new era"". Trump Kim summit: Your need-to-know guide Who are Kim's running bodyguards? 'Stop romanticising a dictator', say N Korean artists North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis It said ""broad and in-depth opinions"" would be exchanged to ""establish a permanent and peaceful regime in the Korean peninsula and to solve problems that are of common concern, including issues to realise the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"". ""Even if a country had a hostile relationship with us in the past, our attitude is that if this nation respects our autonomy... we shall seek normalisation through dialogue,"" it reads. Analysis: Laura Bicker, BBC News, Singapore This video can not be played What should Donald Trump call Kim Jong-un? For decades the US has been a sworn enemy. There are even anti-American museums in Pyongyang. But the state is now trying to sell the idea of talking to what it once described as ""the incarnation of all sorts of evil, the empire of devils"". And that was some of its milder language. So let's examine a couple of key phrases from Rodong Sinmun. In the English version, the summit is sold as a chance to realise ""the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and other issues of mutual concern, as required by the changed era"". It's the ""changed era"" that is important. North Korea has spent decades building up a nuclear arsenal at great personal cost. Kim Jong-un needs to tell his people why he's willing to negotiate. His New Year speech - the one that kick-started this diplomatic process- was all about North Korea's strategy of building the economy having achieved the goal of becoming a nuclear power. This has echoes of that. These pages in the paper are significant because they pave the way for a possible change in the state's message and it helps those watching argue that this time with North Korea - things could be different. Read more from Laura:How Kim the outcast became popular Preparation for the unprecedented summit has been both frenzied and unusual. A meeting of this kind is usually reserved as the end result of months of discussions and diplomacy. The two men arrived in Singapore several hours apart Few details of the agenda have been released and they continue to be fleshed out on the eve of the summit. Mr Pompeo said that senior officials from both countries were meeting in Singapore on Monday and those talks ""were moving quite rapidly"". The team Trump is taking to Singapore North Korea crisis in 300 words Kim Jong-un: the king of Pyongyang The US president and North Korean leader are staying in separate hotels, not far from each other, and will meet on Tuesday at a hotel on Sentosa, a popular tourist island a few hundred metres off the main island of Singapore. Mr Balakrishnan confirmed that Singapore was paying for the North Korean delegation's stay, describing it as ""hospitality that we would have offered"". The two leaders have had an extraordinary up-and-down relationship over the past 18 months. Mr Trump's first year in office was marked by bitter exchanges between himself and Mr Kim - as North Korea conducted several ballistic missile tests in defiance of the international community. The US president successfully sought to tighten UN sanctions on the North, and to get its traditional ally, China, to go along.He also famously vowed to unleash ""fire and fury""if Pyongyang kept threatening the US.Mr Kim has called him ""mentally deranged"" and a ""dotard"". A defiant North Korea carried out its sixth nuclear test in September 2017. Soon after, Mr Kim declared that his country had achieved its mission of becoming a nuclear state, with missiles that could reach the US. In early 2018, a remarkable turnaround in the relationship occurred. It started with significant diplomatic overtures from North Korea towards South Korea during the Winter Olympics. In March, Mr Trump shocked the world by accepting an invitation from Mr Kim to meet in person. Denuclearisation has been the central issue in the run-up to the talks. The US wants North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, but North Korea is widely expected to resist that and it is unclear what it might ask for in return.

Mr Kim has also said he wants to focus on building the North Korean economy - and thus wants sanctions relief and international investment.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-un toured the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore The US says its discussions with North Korea are moving ""more quickly than expected"" ahead of the summit in Singapore on Tuesday. The preliminary talks between officials have been taking place ahead of the unprecedented first meeting. The White House also confirms that President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un will hold a one-to-one meeting, with only translators present. The outcome may determine the fate of North Korea's nuclear programme. The US insists it will accept nothing less than complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. North Korea has said it is willing to commit to denuclearisation, but that term is open to interpretation. It is also unclear what concessions Pyongyang could demand in return - which makes the summit very hard to predict, according to analysts. As night closed in, Mr Kim made a tour of some city sights. He waved at spectators who cheered as he arrived to visit a high-end hotel. Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan also tweeted a picture of them going ""jalan-jalan"", a local term meaning to go out for a walk, in the Gardens by the Bay park.

"This video can not be played Chief Constable Matt Jukes said new investigators would be tasked with looking into burglaries Graduates can become detectives ""in a matter of months"" with the help of a new fast-track training programme. The 12-week scheme is being developed in response to a shortfall of 5,000 investigators across England and Wales. Recruits will begin working on cases within three months but receive training over a two-year period. Police Federation secretary Karen Stephens described the programme as ""an insult to the experienced hard-working detectives"". The government has set aside Â£350,000 forthe new detective entry programme,external, which will focus on problem-solving, crime prevention and safeguarding. South Wales Police Chief Constable Matt Jukes said: ""Crime is changing, so we need people who are going to be cyber investigators, who can deal with a massive amount of information that's coming through social media."" He added that investigators are currently under pressure due to the shortage of available staff. Police forces are also looking at attracting PCs and civilian detectives to make up the 5,000 shortfall. Mr Jukes said that new detectives would work on crime and robbery cases at the beginning of their training, rather than more complex cases. ""[We must] recognise they're working under enormous pressure, this is the opportunity to bring in a diverse and talented group of people,"" he said. Can you become a detective in 12 weeks? 'Why I quit my dream job as a police detective' In March, it was revealed that there was a shortfall of 5,000 police detectives across England and Wales. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) called it ""a national crisis"", with one in five detective desks either empty or filled with unqualified staff. The shortfall is believed to be the consequence of a rise in demand for personnel in specialist areas such as counter-terrorism, as well as the difficulties in retaining investigators in the face of a well-paid commercial sector. The Police Federation warned last year that morale among detectives had hit ""rock bottom"" amid mounting workloads, exhaustion and stress. Ms Stephens said: ""Whilst we welcome any new investment in policing, this appears to be divisive and ill-conceived. ""A direct entry scheme will serve to shatter morale even more and do nothing to instil public confidence and trust."" The Home Office is working with Police Now, a police graduate recruitment programme, to develop the entry scheme. David Spencer, a former detective and co-founder of Police Now, said he hoped the programme ""will encourage a new group of diverse and brilliant individuals to enter the police service and contribute to the outstanding work being done by existing detectives up and down the country."" The scheme has no start date at present, but the Home Office said it hopes it will boost the number of detectives by up to 1,000 over the next five years.

"Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will ""always regret"" not meeting the residents of Grenfell Tower in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Writing in the Evening Standard,external, Mrs May said she understood her actions may have made it appear she ""didn't care"". Ahead of Thursday's one-year anniversary, she said she wanted to make clear that was ""never the case"". A total of 72 people died as a result of the blaze, the judge-led inquiry into the fire has said.

""And I will always regret that by not meeting them that day, it seemed as though I didn't care.""

In addition to the 71 victims who died in the blaze, Maria Del Pilar Burton, 74, died in January. She had been in hospital since she was rescued from the 19th floor. Members of the north Kensington community will come together for a 24-hour vigil on the eve of the anniversary. At 1:30 BST on Thursday, the names of the fire's victims will be read out at the nearby St Clement's church. At midday on the day of the anniversary, survivors and the bereaved will gather close to the tower's base to observe a minute's silence. This video can not be played Grenfell Tower was a death trap, says survivors' lawyer In a show of solidarity, 12 tower blocks in the surrounding area will be illuminated in green. The buildings, plus Grenfell, will be lit up from 00:54 on Thursday - the time the fire is thought to have started - until 5:00. For the following four evenings they will be illuminated from dusk until midnight. The following day, schools across the country are expected to take part in ""Green for Grenfell"", a day to ""celebrate the spirit of people coming together"".

"Migrants are rescued by staff members of the Aquarius A rescue ship carrying 629 migrants is stranded in the Mediterranean after Italy's new interior minister refused permission for it to dock. Matteo Salvini, leader of the right-wing League party, promised during Italy's recent general election to take a tough stance against migration. He says Malta should accept the Aquarius, but it refused, arguing that it falls under Italy's jurisdiction. Italy is the main entry for migrants crossing from North Africa to Europe. Reality Check: Claims about migrants arriving in Italy Desperate migrants rescued from the sea UN sanctions for people traffickers in Libya German charity SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e says the ship has been instructed by the Italian Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre to stand by in its current position, 35 nautical miles (65km) from Italy and 27 nautical miles from Malta. It says the migrants, many of whom are children, were picked up in six different rescue operations off Libya's coast. Meanwhile, Mr Salvini says a second ship has rescued hundreds more migrants near Libya and is heading for Italy. ""Italy has stopped bowing its head to obey, this time there are those who say NO,"" he tweeted in response. There are more than 600 people on board the Aquarius, and the majority were rescued by the Italian authorities and transferred to the ship. Among those saved were 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 younger children and seven pregnant women, SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e says. The minors are aged between 13 and 17 and come from Eritrea, Ghana, Nigeria and Sudan, according to a journalist on the ship, Anelise Borges. ""Most of them are sleeping outside. They are obviously exhausted, they have been exposed to the elements, they have been at sea for 20 to 30 hours prior to their rescue,"" she told the BBC. ""They are fragile and we have yet to learn what's going to happen to them,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rules on disembarking and assisting rescue ships such as Aquarius are governed by international law. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea dictates that any ship learning of distress at sea must assist regardless of the circumstances. It says that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking them from the ship. It also clearly states that the relevant government ""shall arrange for such disembarkation to be effected as soon as reasonably practicable"". Given that the migrants were rescued off the coast of Libya, the closest ports are likely to be either Sicily in Italy or Malta, which is why there is a stand-off between the two countries. Both the United Nations and the European Union have called for a quick resolution to the situation that will allow the migrants to be disembarked safely. This video can not be played On a visit to Sicily, Matteo Salvini said Italy must increase its deportations of migrants As interior minister, Mr Salvini is a key figure in Italy's new populist government and he has promised to take a tough stance on migration.

Populists take power in Italy: What comes next? Italy country profile Both parties insist that half a million undocumented migrants in Italy must be deported ""as a priority"". But critics say its plan to repatriate these migrants is unworkable. Earlier this month, Mr Salvini said during a visit to Sicily that it must stop being ""the refugee camp of Europe"". He also says he is considering action against organisations rescuing migrants at sea. He has previously accused them of being in cahoots with people-smugglers. On Sunday, he said that Italy was saying ""no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration"". ""Malta takes in nobody,"" he added. ""France pushes people back at the border, Spain defends its frontier with weapons."" A spokesman for the Maltese government told AFP news agency Malta was ""neither the co-ordinating nor the competent authority"" in the rescue operation. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Grenfell Tower: Audio of first 999 call A catalogue of safety problems allowing the Grenfell Tower fire to take hold have been indentified in reports from five experts for the blaze inquiry. Dr Barbara Lane says a ""non-compliance"" culture had existed with basic fire measures missing or ""inadequate"". She listed issues with ventilation systems, lifts, fire mains and doors. The reports suggested cladding was incorrectly installed, and the primary cause of the ""catastrophic"" spread of June's fire, which caused 72 deaths. The inquiry also heard the fire service advice to residents to ""stay put"" in their flats had ""effectively failed"" within around half an hour of the blaze starting. The reports have beenpublished at the start of the fact-finding stage,externalof the public inquiry. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal Visual guide to the fire What happened at Grenfell Tower? Listen: The Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast with Eddie Mair The hearing was played the audio of the first 999 call made on the night, by the tenant of flat 16 on the fourth floor - where the fire started - Behailu Kebede, who survived. In it he told the operator: ""Quick, quick, quick. It's burning."" A montage of video sent in by the public of fire, showing burning debris falling from the tower was also shown. ""Oh my god,"" says one woman , while another could be heard crying as the fire became out of control. Photos from inside the flat where the fire started were contained in the reports from experts Dr Lane said: ""The building envelope itself was therefore a major hazard on the night of the fire. ""The active and passive fire protection measures within Grenfell Tower were required to mitigate an extraordinary event. As a result, the consequences were catastrophic."" The experts' reports highlighted: Most of the fire doors at the entrance to the 120 flats had been replaced in 2011 but neither they or the original doors still left in place complied with fire test evidence The lifts failed to perform effectively, hindering the transportation of firefighting equipment and creating an ""unnecessary risk"" to residents who could not use it to escape The stairwell, the only escape route in the tower, became clogged with smoke and then hit by fire The fire service had to pump its own water into Grenfell Tower - the building's ""dry fire main"" system was ""non-compliant"" with guidance at the time of construction and was ""non-compliant with current standards"" The smoke control system did not operate correctly, reducing the ability to improve both escape and firefighting conditions A lack of regulations requiring a central alarm system in residential buildings such as Grenfell Tower Existing building guidelines and tests allow ""obvious dangers"" to be incorporated into cladding systems routinely An ""architecture crown"" fitting at the top of the tower caught alight and fell down, allowing the fire to move around the tower not just up When the fire was first reported at 00:54 BST, residents were initially given the advice to ""stay put"" inside the building. The kitchen in flat 16 where the fire started In her report, Dr Lane said this advice had ""effectively failed"" by 01:26. A change in policy recommending residents try to leave was not made until 02:47 BST, one hour and 53 minutes after the first emergency call. Prof Jose Torero's report said a ""stay put"" strategy was appropriate while the fire was only in flat 16, but not once the fire started to spread up the building. He said that after the fire had breached the flat - the ""second phase"" - it would have been better for residents to have left their flats and exited the building. Grenfell Tower before and after renovations By Tom Symonds, BBC News Grenfell Tower was built in 1974 of reinforced concrete with a clear fire safety feature in mind.   In the event of a fire in a flat, the design of the building should have prevented it spreading. Concrete, after all, does not burn. This is called ""passive fire protection"" and experts say there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  Very few people (before Grenfell) died in a tower block fire which spread from one flat to another. But today's detailed expert reports suggest that since 1974, the major changes to the building entirely destroyed that protection. Though these are early findings, which the inquiry will test, the key theory is that the design of the new windows, surrounded not by concrete, but stuff which burns, offered a way for the fire to break out from the flat to the rest of the building. Read more from Tom Symonds Dr Lane's report said cladding on Grenfell Tower did not comply with recommended fire performance. A newly-installed kitchen window did not have fire resisting cavity barriers and was surrounded by combustible material within the cladding system, and this is thought to have been the ""primary cause of the early stage of the fire spread"", she added. ""The assembly failed adequately to resist the spread of fire to an extent that supported the required 'stay put' strategy for this high-rise residential building,"" Dr Lane said. Grenfell cladding failed to meet standard The burn marks underneath the fridge-freezer in flat 16 While attempts had been made to construct fire stopping compartments within the cladding, she said they were ""installed incorrectly, and no evidence has been provided that they were ever tested for performance in the type of cladding installed at Grenfell Tower"". Police hadpreviously said the fire had started in a fridge-freezer. But Prof Niamh Nic Daeid's report stated that while the fire began in the south-east corner of the kitchen in flat 16 and there was ""insufficient"" evidence to determine the exact cause. She said the origin was more than likely to be ""in and around"" the fridge-freezer but the ""cause of the fire remains undetermined"". Prof Luke Bisby said there was currently ""insufficient evidence"" to support the view the fridge was the cause ""even based on a balance of probabilities... and to exclude all other potential sources of ignition"". His report also said the evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that the polyethylene material in the cladding on Grenfell was the primary cause of the spread of the fire. He said the polyethylene sandwiched between aluminium is highly combustible and melts, drips and flows at elevated temperatures and using this type of cladding on buildings should be carefully considered as it represents a ""clear and significant"" fire hazard. The report quoted the first firefighter to enter the flat, Daniel Brown, who said: ""I walked towards the fridge to inspect it... immediately I noticed little pieces of hot embers/debris falling outside what I could now see was a window that had completely given way leaving a hole in the wall."" This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? Having already heard seven full days of tributes to the tragedy's victims, the public inquiry, which is expected to last 18 months, has turned to the cause and spread of the fire. The reports include three studies of how the fire spread - including one examining the contribution of the highly flammable cladding and insulation which had been installed as part of a refurbishment. Another report considered the building's own fire protection measures, and another the safety regulations in place at the time of the tragedy. Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, said in his opening remarks: ""The fundamental question which lies at the heart of our work is how, in London in 2017, a domestic fire developed so quickly and so catastrophically that an entire high rise block was engulfed"". Who were the victims? Grenfell United, the main organisation for bereaved families and survivors, said in a statement ahead of the hearing: ""This is the beginning of a long road to justice."" It continued: ""It is going to be difficult to see some organisations trying to defend their actions, but we have trust that as the evidence emerges over the coming months, this inquiry will reveal the truth about how our community was treated before, during, and after the fire.""

"A teenager has been found guilty of plotting a terror attack on the British Museum in London with Britain's first all-woman cell. Safaa Boular, 18, of Vauxhall, London, has become Britain's youngest convicted female Islamic State terrorist. A jury at the Old Bailey found her guilty of two offences of preparation of terrorism acts. She was also found guilty over an earlier attempt to travel to Syria for terrorism. Boular was accused of planning to travel to Syria to join IS militants and later preparing to carry out a terrorist attack in London after her fiancÃ©, an Islamic State fighter, died. Her sister Rizlaine 22, of Clerkenwell, London, has already admitted planning a knife attack on London and their mother Mina Dich, 44, has pleaded guilty to assisting her. Boular will be sentenced in around six weeks time. How a teenage girl turned to terror During her trial, the court heard how Boular - then 17 - plotted a gun and grenade attack at the British Museum. The sisters and Dich discussed their plans using Alice in Wonderland coded language, with Rizlaine as the Mad Hatter. Boular had originally hoped to travel to Syria and marry IS fighter Naweed Hussain Aged 16, Boular was radicalised online in the wake of the 2015 Paris terror attacks. She met IS fighter Naweed Hussain on Instagram and after months of chatting, declared her love for him with an online marriage ceremony. The court heard how she had wanted to join Hussain in Syria, but her plan was thwarted when British security services became involved and confiscated her passport. Boular told the police about Hussain and security services deployed officers to pose as fellow extremists and speak to the pair online. On 4 April 2017, it was a security services officer, posing as an IS commander, who told Boular that Hussain had been killed in a drone attack. The prosecution claimed this only strengthened her determination to carry out an attack in the UK. Boular went on to tell officers posing as extremists about plans for an attack and on 12 April, she was charged with preparing terrorist acts in Syria. Mina Dich (left) and her daughter Rizlaine Boular, have both plead guilty to terror charges Despite being in custody, Boular continued to talk to her sister and mother about an Alice in Wonderland-themed tea party - code for an attack. In one call Boular complained: ""Mate, you guys are partying without me."" Rizlaine and Dich carried out reconnaissance of major landmarks in Westminster and bought knives and a rucksack, the court heard. They were arrested on 27 April, the date of the planned attack, along with friend, Khawla Barghouthi. Counter-terrorism coordinator Dean Haydon said social services were called in to act back in 2016. ""As a family unit, they are pretty dysfunctional. There was a major safeguarding issue we had to manage. It did involve social services, local authorities, schools, education and family courts trying to safeguard the wider family,"" he said. ""But despite all that activity it was quite clear Safaa was still continuing with her attack plans.""

"This video can not be played Video shows Guatemala's most violent volcano eruption in more than a century Guatemala's most violent volcanic eruption in more than a century has killed 62 people, officials say. Dozens more are missing, the country's disaster agency says, and it is feared the death toll could rise. Villages on the slopes of Fuego volcano were buried in volcanic ash, mud and rocks during Sunday's 16-hour eruption. Pyroclastic flows, which are fast-moving mixtures of very hot gas and volcanic matter, rushed down the mountainside and engulfed villages. President Jimmy Morales has declared three days of national mourning. Eruption in pictures How many people do volcanoes kill? A further pyroclastic flow on Monday sparked alarm. Guatemala's coast has also been hit by an earthquake though there are no reports of damage so far. Fuego, about 40km (25 miles) south-west of the capital Guatemala City, spewed rock, gas and ash into the sky. Fast-moving flows hit villages, killing people inside their homes. The destruction wreaked by the flows can be seen from the air Sergio CabaÃ±as, head of the country's National Disaster Management Agency (Conred), said the town of El Rodeo had been ""buried"". Other towns affected include Alotenango and San Miguel Los Lotes. Rescuers are still trying to reach a number of villages. Temporary shelters have been set up for about 3,000 residents who have been evacuated. A woman in San Miguel Los Lotes has missing relatives Efrain Gonzalez, who fled El Rodeo with his wife and one-year-old daughter, said he had had to leave behind his two older children, aged four and ten, trapped in the family home. Local resident Ricardo Reyes was forced to abandon his home: ""The only thing we could do was run with my family and we left our possessions in the house. Now that all the danger has passed, I came to see how our house was - everything is a disaster."" This video can not be played Volcano survivor: ""I think my family was buried"" About 1.7 million people have been affected in four regions. The country's main airport has now reopened. Officials have advised people to wear masks as protection against falling ash. Fuego is one of Latin America's most active volcanoes. A major eruption devastated nearby farms in 1974, but no deaths were recorded. Another eruption in February this year sent ash 1.7km (1.1 mile) into the sky. Sunday's event was on a much greater scale. This eruption is one of Guatemala's deadliest such events since 1902, when an eruption of the Santa Maria volcano killed thousands of people.

Guatemala's national institute of volcanology, Insivumeh, told people to keep away from the affected ravines as there is a possibility of ""a reactivation"". The institute also warned of the possibility of lahars - when water mixes with volcanic deposits forming a destructive debris flow - which could affect villages and hamlets to the south, south-west and south-east. By Paul Rincon, science editor, BBC News website A pyroclastic flow is a fast-moving mixture of gas and volcanic material, such as pumice and ash. They are a common outcome of explosive volcanic eruptions, like the Fuego event, and are extremely dangerous to populations living downrange. Just why they are so threatening can be seen from some of the eyewitness videos on YouTube of the Guatemalan eruption.In one, people stand on a bridge filming the ominous mass of gas and volcanic debris,externalas it expands from Fuego. Some bystanders only realise how fast it is travelling as the flow is almost upon them. The speed it travels depends on several factors, such as the output rate of the volcano and the gradient of its slope. But they have been known to reach speeds of up to 700km/h - close to the cruising speed of a long-distance commercial passenger aircraft. In addition, the gas and rock within a flow are heated to extreme temperatures, ranging between 200C and 700C. If you're directly in its path, there is little chance of escape. The eruption of Vesuvius, in Italy, in 79 AD produced a powerful pyroclastic flow, burying the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum under a thick blanket of ash. From Jorge Luis Altuve, member of Guatemala's mountain rescue brigade A team of about 40 of us from mountain rescue were up on the volcano searching for a person who had gone missing last week. We'd located the body of the missing person and were going to retrieve it when the activity of the volcano increased quite suddenly. We were at a height of about 3,700m (12,000ft) and not far from the crater when we decided to abort the operation and descend. At first, we thought it had started to rain but then I heard something hitting my safety helmet and I said to one of my colleagues: ""This is not rain, these are stones!"" The stones raining down on us started getting bigger and bigger. Some were as big as 5cm (2in) in diameter. We'd already started our descent from the mountain when the ash cloud reached us and day turned into night. This police officer stumbled as he ran through pyroclastic deposits on Monday From daylight it went to being as dark as at 10pm. Luckily we were carrying all of our equipment which includes torches and helmets and we also know the volcano very well. We started to move a lot more quickly. We were also in constant communication with our colleagues at the mountain rescue command post and they kept telling us: ""Get out of there! Get down, quick!"" In total it took us three or four hours to reach the command post. Luckily we got away unscathed, just with some bruises from the falling stones. This really came as a surprise, there had been no alert when we'd set out to search for this missing person. We only really realised the magnitude of this when we got back down and saw everything covered in ash and bridges destroyed.

"Migrants are rescued by staff members of the Aquarius A rescue ship carrying 629 migrants is stranded in the Mediterranean after Italy's new interior minister refused permission for it to dock. Matteo Salvini, leader of the right-wing League party, promised during Italy's recent general election to take a tough stance against migration. He says Malta should accept the Aquarius, but it refused, arguing that it falls under Italy's jurisdiction. Italy is the main entry for migrants crossing from North Africa to Europe. Reality Check: Claims about migrants arriving in Italy Desperate migrants rescued from the sea UN sanctions for people traffickers in Libya German charity SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e says the ship has been instructed by the Italian Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre to stand by in its current position, 35 nautical miles (65km) from Italy and 27 nautical miles from Malta. It says the migrants, many of whom are children, were picked up in six different rescue operations off Libya's coast. Meanwhile, Mr Salvini says a second ship has rescued hundreds more migrants near Libya and is heading for Italy. ""Italy has stopped bowing its head to obey, this time there are those who say NO,"" he tweeted in response. There are more than 600 people on board the Aquarius, and the majority were rescued by the Italian authorities and transferred to the ship. Among those saved were 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 younger children and seven pregnant women, SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e says. The minors are aged between 13 and 17 and come from Eritrea, Ghana, Nigeria and Sudan, according to a journalist on the ship, Anelise Borges. ""Most of them are sleeping outside. They are obviously exhausted, they have been exposed to the elements, they have been at sea for 20 to 30 hours prior to their rescue,"" she told the BBC. ""They are fragile and we have yet to learn what's going to happen to them,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rules on disembarking and assisting rescue ships such as Aquarius are governed by international law. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea dictates that any ship learning of distress at sea must assist regardless of the circumstances. It says that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking them from the ship. It also clearly states that the relevant government ""shall arrange for such disembarkation to be effected as soon as reasonably practicable"". Given that the migrants were rescued off the coast of Libya, the closest ports are likely to be either Sicily in Italy or Malta, which is why there is a stand-off between the two countries. Both the United Nations and the European Union have called for a quick resolution to the situation that will allow the migrants to be disembarked safely. This video can not be played On a visit to Sicily, Matteo Salvini said Italy must increase its deportations of migrants As interior minister, Mr Salvini is a key figure in Italy's new populist government and he has promised to take a tough stance on migration. The government is made up of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League, which is strongly anti-immigration. Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Populists take power in Italy: What comes next? Italy country profile Both parties insist that half a million undocumented migrants in Italy must be deported ""as a priority"". But critics say its plan to repatriate these migrants is unworkable. Earlier this month, Mr Salvini said during a visit to Sicily that it must stop being ""the refugee camp of Europe"". He also says he is considering action against organisations rescuing migrants at sea. He has previously accused them of being in cahoots with people-smugglers. On Sunday, he said that Italy was saying ""no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration"". ""Malta takes in nobody,"" he added. ""France pushes people back at the border, Spain defends its frontier with weapons."" A spokesman for the Maltese government told AFP news agency Malta was ""neither the co-ordinating nor the competent authority"" in the rescue operation. Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Joseph Muscat insisted that Malta would not allow Aquarius to dock at its ports and said Italy's instructions to the boat were dangerous. ""They manifestly go against international rules, and risk creating a dangerous situation for all those involved,"" he said in a tweet. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"This video can not be played Being English 'is about fish and chips' Young people are far less likely to feel proud to be English than older generations, a major survey for the BBC reveals. Eight out of 10 people in England identify strongly as English but pride varies by age. YouGov surveyed 20,081 people and found 72% of over-65s are proud to be English, compared with 45% of 18-24s. Half of those surveyed think England was better in the past, with one in six believing its best days lie ahead. Humour, tradition and good manners are thecharacteristics most associated with being English. The poll was conducted for the BBC's The English Question project and is the largest and most comprehensive of its kind. Respondents were asked to complete a detailed online questionnaire on identity and belonging. The English question: What is the nation's identity? You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. If the postcode search does not launchclick here,external. The results of the survey highlighted that: Parts ofLincolnshireand the Midlands identity particularly strongly as English, with more than nine out of 10 respondents saying they felt very strongly or fairly strongly English London, Oxford and Cambridge are at the opposite end, with between 32% and 45% of respondents saying they did not identify strongly as English English pride is felt by about two thirds of people in coastal and former industrial towns but less than half of people in major cities like Liverpool and Manchester In London boroughs such as Hackney and Lambeth, pride in being English is felt only 37% and 38% of people respectively The further from London someone lives, the more they identify with a particular part of England About half of the 20,081 people surveyed (49%) believe England's best years are over while one in six (17%) thought they were still to come. The survey does not reveal at which point England apparently passed its best, but the results suggest: Despite their pride in being English, the majority of over 65s (60%) believe England was better in the past Two thirds of over 65s (67%) said England is better than most other countries in the world Slightly more Remain voters (20%) than Leavers (15%) believe England's best years lie ahead Young people are the most optimistic, with 28% of 18 to 24-year-olds believing England's best years are still in the future 55% of people aged 50-64 and 60% of people aged 65 and over say England was better in the past John Denham, director of the Centre for English Identity and Politics at the University of Winchester, said ""pessimism"" was not unique to one group or area of England. The former Labour cabinet minister said he believed giving people a greater say over how they are governed would reduce the pessimism. The English question: What is the nation's identity? Revisiting London's iconic album cover images ""Older people do tend to think things were better in the past but what's striking is that there isn't a demographic where the optimists outweigh the pessimists,"" said Mr Denham. ""This pessimism is not as universal in Wales and Scotland, where more people think the future will be better than the past, and where devolution has asked people what sort of nation they wanted to be in the 21st Century. ""England outside London has never had that. People have a sense that no-one is talking about the people outside the capital. In the EU referendum, the Leave campaign's slogan 'take back control' cut through for that reason."" Nearly three quarters of over-65s  are proud to be English compared with fewer than half of those aged 18 to 24. Mr Denham said: ""Young people will tend to be less patriotic than older people wherever they are, whether that's England, Scotland or Wales. ""They will have a more cosmopolitan view of the world. And in the younger generation there are more people from black and minority ethnic groups who are more likely to identify as British than as English. ""It doesn't mean that Englishness and English pride is disappearing, but we are looking at a future where both Britishness and Englishness will mean a lot to a lot of people."" Being born in England makes someone English according to eight out of 10 people surveyed. Living in England for less than five years qualifies someone as English in the minds of just 14% of those who responded. For just over a third of people (38%) considering yourself English is enough and trumps even living in England for 10 or more years or even being able to speak English. A sense of humour, tradition, manners and fair play are characteristics most people surveyed associate with being English. Although more than half of respondents consider strongly that generosity and plain-speaking were part of the English identity, less than half think the English are a liberal, outward-looking people. And less than four in 10 consider Englishness to be defined by ""yob culture"". Only one in four consider the English to be a ""loud"" people. ""So-called yob culture is not such a dominant image of Englishness as some people think,"" said Mr Denham. ""If you see footage of English football fans smashing up a town square, you're going to think about yob culture at the time, but most people associate Englishness with much more positive values most of the time. ""The stiff upper lip comes from stories of heroism but it's also about a cultural respect for qualities that people aspire to - of getting on with things and not making a fuss.""

"This video can not be played Duterte kissed the woman on stage Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has drawn criticism for kissing an overseas Filipina worker on the lips during a live event. Mr Duterte was speaking to a crowd in South Korea when he called the woman on stage then convinced her to kiss him. The scene drew cheers from the crowd, mostly made of up other Philippine workers. But it was described as ""disgusting theatrics of a misogynist president"" by Philippines rights group Gabriela. The woman involved later said that there was ""no malice"" in the kiss. It is not the first time Mr Duterte has been accused of inappropriate behaviour towards women. Duterte under fire for rape joke The controversial 'strongman' of the Philippines Duterte saying the unsayable The controversial incident took place when Mr Duterte was speaking to a crowd of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Seoul. Two Philippine women were invited to join the president on stage to receive a free copy of a book, and were visibly star struck standing next to Mr Duterte. Allow YouTube content?

He hugged the first and gave her a kiss on the cheek before gesturing the second woman to kiss him on the lips. After a protracted back and forth, with nervous laughter from the young woman and repeated gestures by Mr Duterte, the president eventually leaned in to kiss the woman on the lips. While the young woman was laughing and the crowd cheering, comments on the internet were a lot more critical. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Women's rights group Gabriela condemned the event,external, saying it was part of a bigger effort to deflect from real policy issues and Mr Duterte's waning popularity. ""His repeated acts of machismo are meant as entertainment to hide the reality of his rapidly slipping popularity due to the issues of extrajudicial killings, the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion law and big-time corruption scandals now plaguing his rule,"" it said in a statement on Monday. The woman - identified as Bea Kim - was later quoted by the Philippine News Agency as saying that the president had asked if she was single, to which she responded that she was married to a Korean. She said that there was ""no malice"" in the kiss, adding that the incident didn't ""mean anything except to entertain and make other Filipinos in the gathering happy"". Mr Duterte has sparked outrage before with a string of comments seen as misogynistic. In April 2016, he spoke to an election campaign rally about the 1989 murder and rape of a female Australian missionary in Davao, where he was mayor at the time. ""I was angry because she was raped,"" he said. ""That's one thing. But she was so beautiful, the mayor should have been first, what a waste."" His office later apologised for the comments. Earlier this year Mr Duterte told Filipino soldiers they should shoot female communist rebels in the vagina. Both incidents lead to strong criticism and a backlash on social media. Howard Johnson, BBC Philippines reporter Despite a string of accusations of misogyny against the president, he remains popular both in the Philippines and with Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW). OFWs I've spoken with say they like Mr Duterte because he projects a strong, assertive image of the Philippines; a father figure to look after the country and its children while they are working abroad. On a recent trip to the UK, I met a Filipino nurse working in a hospital in London. She said she thought the Western media were biased against the president and didn't report news about him accurately. Critics of the government say that many OFWs are targeted by pro-government bloggers on social media feeds. They say postings on platforms like Facebook and Twitter spin an inaccurate, glowing image of the president.

"Accountancy giant PwC has banned all-male shortlists for jobs in the UK in an attempt to increase the number of women in senior roles at the firm. It said the move was prompted by itsrecent pay gap report,externalshowing men on average earned 43.8% more than women. The company said recruitment was one of the areas it was looking at as a way to narrow the gap. PwC also plans to ban all-male interview panels and examine how ""career defining roles"" are awarded. Making sure that ""everybody in the firm"" had access to important career opportunities such as working on big projects or for well known clients, would be ""a real game changer"", said PwC's chief people officer Laura Hinton. She said the move was part of the firm's wider plan to improve the diversity of its workforce, which includes looking at the attitude of senior management. 'Staggering' failure to pick woman for MPC 'All the good women have been snapped up' It also has a returnship programme, which encourages those who have taken a break from work, such as maternity leave, to do six months paid work experience. The company has also started to allocate  ""progression coaches"" - usually partners - who will work with women and ethnic minorities employees to help develop their careers. The Daily Mail,which first reported,externalPwC's decision, said it was the first of the big four accountancy firms to ban all-male shortlists. Jill Miller, policy adviser at the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD), said it did not have data on the number of firms which had banned all-male shortlists for jobs, but said it was becoming ""more common"". She said new rules forcing firms to publish their gender pay gaps had increased transparency and focused leaders' attention on how to improve the figures. However, many firms were failing to exploit the data they had on their workforce, she said, such as when and why women were leaving the firm. ""It's important to look at as wide a talent pool as possible. Overall it's about levelling the playing field and getting best person for the job."" The Business Committee's Rachel Reeves called the Bank's decision ""truly staggering"" PwC's decision comes amid a furore over diversity atthe Bank of England, which recently appointed a male economistto its rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee despite a shortlist of four women and one man. The Treasury said the role had been awarded on merit. Ms Hinton said that hiring diverse people at a senior level was ""a real challenge"" because candidates tended to be ""disproportionately male"". Improving diversity at graduate and school-leaver levels was easier because the firm had more control, she said. For example, it had found that male graduates tended to apply for graduate placements earlier on in their university career. As a result, rather than filling up their assessment centres on a first-come first-served basis, it makes sure each centre has a 50/50 split between male and female applicants. ""Little things like that can stack up against women,"" she said. ""The challenge is making sure that at every stage in the process we are saying yes to get the right person and not excluding. The objective is to keep pushing and to encourage others to do the same.""

Ms Allsopp told theSun newspaper,externalthat she and her partner sometimes sit in the business class cabin, while her children, 10 and 12, sit in economy.
