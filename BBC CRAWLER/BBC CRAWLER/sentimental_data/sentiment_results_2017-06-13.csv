"Diane Abbott has revealed she has Type 2 diabetes and that the condition is what forced her to take a break from the election campaign. The shadow home secretarytold the Guardian,externalshe was diagnosed with the condition two years ago and it was ""out of control"" during the campaign, when she gave some faltering performances. ""During the election campaign, everything went crazy,"" she said. She said she was managing the condition and was ready to get back to work. Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high. It can be controlled by taking medication to reduce glucose to normal levels and also by making lifestyle and dietary changes. Ms Abbott was criticised for her performance during the election campaign, in which she stumbled several times during interviews and appeared unable to give detailed answers to questions. In one interview with LBC Radio, she mistakenly said plans to boost police numbers by 10,000 would cost Â£300,000. It led to a barrage of criticism from the Conservatives who said she could not ""add up"". She pulled out of an interview on BBC's Woman's Hour with just a few minutes' notice amid unconfirmed reports that some within the party leadership had lost confidence in her. Just 48 hours before polling day, Labour said Ms Abbott was taking a period of sick leave and would be replaced ""indefinitely"" by Lyn Brown. Ms Abbott, a key ally and friend of Jeremy Corbyn, said she was badly affected after facing six or seven interviews in a row without eating enough food - vital to managing blood sugar levels. ""During the election campaign, everything went crazy - and the diabetes was out of control, the blood sugar was out of control,"" she said. Ms Abbott, who was re-elected as MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington with a majority of more than 30,000, accused her political opponents of mounting a ""vicious"" campaign against her. She told the newspaper she was disappointed a female prime minister had singled her out as a national target. The Guardian says a Conservative source ""angrily rejected"" Ms Abbott's accusations and said it was ""legitimate in a campaign to point out weaknesses in the opposition's front bench"" The source wished Ms Abbott well with her health, adding: ""No-one knows more about the difficulties of diabetes than the prime minister."" Theresa May revealed in 2013 that she had type 1 diabetes. During the election campaign she said she managed it by injecting herself with insulin six times a day. Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar to become too high. Type 1 Diabetes can develop at any age, but often begins in childhood. It is not related to diet or lifestyle Type 2 is far more common than type 1, but is still rare in childhood. It is usually seen in adults and is often associated with obesity Type 2 diabetes can lead to serious complications, including kidney failure, blindness and heart disease It's the most common cause of vision loss and blindness in people of working age Type 2 diabetes is also responsible for most cases of kidney failure and lower limb amputation, other than accidents People with type 2 diabetes are up to five times more likely to have cardiovascular disease, such as a stroke, than those without diabetes Symptoms include feeling very thirsty; passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night; feeling very tired; weight loss and loss of muscle bulk More than three million people suffer from type 1 and and type 2 diabetes in the UK.

"This video can not be played US student Otto Warmbier said he was ""a poor scapegoat"" before he was jailed in 2016 US student Otto Warmbier has been freed from jail in North Korea, but his parents say he has been in a coma for a year. The 22-year-old was flown to the US and landed in Ohio late on Tuesday. The Warmbier family told US media they had found out only last week that their son has been in a coma since shortly after his trial in March 2016. Mr Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. On arrival in Ohio, he was being taken by ambulance to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, US media reported. Who is Otto Warmbier? Otto Warmbier is an economics student from the University of Virginia, originally from Cincinnati, Ohio. He was in North Korea as a tourist with Young Pioneer Tours when he was arrested on 2 January 2016. He appeared emotional at a news conference a month later, in which he tearfully confessed to trying to take the sign as a ""trophy"" for a US church, adding: ""The aim of my task was to harm the motivation and work ethic of the Korean people."" Foreign detainees in North Korea have previously recanted confessions, saying they were made under pressure. Otto Warmbier's parents feared for his safety as tensions rose between the US and North Korea Aftera short trial on 16 March, Mr Warmbier was given a 15-year prison sentence for crimes against the state. His parents Fred and Cindytold CNN in early May,externalthat they had had no contact with their son for more than a year. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr and Mrs Warmbier said: ""Sadly, he is in a coma and we have been told he has been in that condition since March 2016. We learned of this only one week ago."" They werequoted by the Washington Post,externalas saying they had been told Otto had contracted botulism, a rare illness that causes paralysis, soon after his trial in March 2016. He was given a sleeping pill and had been in a coma ever since, the newspaper said. The US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made no mention of Mr Warmbier's conditionin a statement,,externalsaying only that he was on his way home to be reunited with his family and would not make any further comment, out of respect for the privacy of the family. There are reported to be three other US citizens in custody in North Korea. They are: Kim Dong-chul, a 62-year-old naturalised US citizen born in South Korea, who wassentenced to 10 years hard labourin April 2016 for spying Korean-American professor Kim Sang-duk (or Tony Kim) who was detained in April 2017. The reasons for his arrest are not yet clear Kim Hak-song, like Kim Sang-duk, worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) and wasdetained in May 2017on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" against the state The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining its citizens to use them as pawns in negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme. Kim Dong-chul appeared on North Korea television a month after Otto Warmbier, also giving a tearful confession The arrests have come at a time of heightened tension between North Korea and the US and its regional neighbours. In other news on Tuesday, South Korea said it had found a North Korean drone that had crashed after taking photos of the US-funded Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad),which aims to protect the South from the North's missiles. South Korea's military also reported that a North Korean soldier had defected across the heavily-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a rare occurrence. Mr Warmbier's release comes hours after US basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea. Mr Rodman is a friend of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and has made several visits to the country in recent years. Dennis Rodman was mobbed by the press at Beijing airport en route to Pyongyang There was some speculation that he might plead the case for the American detainees, buten route to North Koreahe told reporters ""my purpose is to actually see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea"". He also said ""I'm just trying to open the door"", and added that he was ""pretty much sure that [US President Trump] is happy with the fact that I am over here trying to accomplish something that we both need"". Mr Trump said in 2013 of Mr Rodman's then visit to North Korea: ""You look at the world, the world is blowing up around us. Maybe Dennis is a lot better than what we have.""

"The two girls are pictured returning to Angela Wrightson's home in the early hours of 9 December, where they would continue the attack For two young teenagers the night of 8 December 2014 began like many others. But by the next morning the two girls would be murderers, having taken their time to batter a vulnerable woman to death with a variety of weapons. The attack lasted for seven hours. Then aged 13 and 14, the pair spent the early evening roaming the streets of Hartlepool drinking strong cider, smoking pilfered cigarettes, and taking selfies. Despite the drinking and drug-taking - the older girl had also taken illicit prescription medicine - they were not atypical teenagers. They frequently posted on Facebook, declaring love and eternal friendship to a multitude of friends. They liked clothes, makeup, and styling their hair. In court, much was made of a message sent about five weeks before the murder, where the younger girl referred to the older as her ""partner in crime"" and proclaimed: ""We will be with each other through thick and thin."" Was it a harbinger of what was to happen? Or phrases people - especially excitable teenagers - use? Failures revealed over Angela Wrightson murder Can children be natural born killers? Teenage girls sentenced for torture killing The chaotic life and brutal death of Angela Wrightson There was no indication the two of them would launch such a brutal attack. The judge, Lord Justice Globe, warned the jury to bear in mind the younger girl had no history of violence. While the older girl had lashed out at staff at a care home, she also had no history of causing or attempting to cause serious harm. The pair were not off the radar, hidden away in an abusive family home. They were both in the care of the local authority. Children's Services knew about them. They had support workers, foster carers, and were catered for at special educational centres. The older girl had a mental health team and had received therapy and suggestions on how to manage her anger. There have been reports in the media that the girls frequently ""escaped"" from their care homes. But there was no question of ""escape"". They weren't locked up, they'd done nothing to suggest they should be. Both were allowed to visit friends in the evening, and foster parents and support workers would drive them into town and collect them afterwards. A blood-stained shovel was found next to Angela Wrightson They had known each other since early childhood but weren't especially close until a few months before the murder. They enjoyed hanging around with each other - the younger girl said the older was ""fun"" and ""not boring"" and they met up ""every other day"". The younger girl was interested in a couple of boys and would ""inbox"" them, as she called it. The older enjoyed rap music but also liked One Direction. They were both fans of Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and their favourite song was I Don't Care. The friendship was not encouraged by either girls' carers. Each family thought the other girl encouraged theirs to go missing. But they were from the same part of Hartlepool and naturally gravitated towards each other, and to the Stephen Street area, where both had family. It was not a particularly intense relationship. Both named a handful of other girls as their closest friends. Both would go missing, get drunk, smoke and stay out late - with or without each other. Angela Wrightson was a vulnerable alcoholic who lived in Stephen Street. Her house was known locally as a place where underage drinkers could hang out. Both girls had been there before and Ms Wrightson would buy the alcohol for them. However, that night, some terrible alchemy led to a brutal, bloody and sustained attack, culminating in murder. Ms Wrightson was left dead - having been tortured with a variety of weapons over a prolonged period. A wooden batten with protruding screws at either end was also used to attack Angela Wrightson How had this happened? Other cases of children who have killed in pairs shed little light on this case. The most notorious, the Bulger killers Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, had set out to abduct and murder a child. It was accepted by all parties in court that Ms Wrightson's murderers did not set out that evening to harm anyone, let alone kill them. No-one really knows what happened inside 14 Stephen Street that night. The older girl, drunk and high on prescription drugs, said she had passed out several times, or had fallen asleep. The younger claimed not to remember. Although not pre-meditated, the murder wasn't a one-off explosion of rage. The length of time the girls spent battering Ms Wrightson, the fact they had several breaks to sit around and drink and smoke, the way they chose weapons from around the house - and perhaps most damningly, the fact they had a two-hour break when they visited a friend before returning to 14 Stephen Street to carry on with their attack - scuppered any defence based on a lack of control. One of the items used to attack Angela Wrightson was a television, which was dropped on her head. Blood and hair were recovered from its surface The girls left 39-year-old Ms Wrightson surrounded by broken furniture and blood-stained implements, and covered in shards of broken glass. She had hundreds of injuries, was naked from the waist down, and had bled out over the sofa on which she had been placed. Some of the crime scene photographs were deemed by the judge in the murder trial as too distressing for the jury to see. Bloodied handprints were smeared on the walls, and blood was also found on the ceiling. Throughout the evening the girls posed for selfies, which were Snapchatted to friends. Some pictures showed Ms Wrightson looking distressed in the background. Others didn't show Ms Wrightson, although she was there. It's likely she was already seriously injured, bleeding on the floor, while the teenagers drank, smoked and danced around to music. Dr Elizabeth Yardley, associate professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, says the girls' use of social media suggested they did not care about the consequences. ""For many young people, social media is a 'performance of self',"" she says. ""They use it to tell stories about their lives in real time. Young people are generally quite savvy when it comes to what is and isn't appropriate to post on social media - they know that pictures of illegal activity will have consequences. ""The actions of these girls suggests that they did not care about the consequences, or were simply not thinking about them, as their values about what is right and wrong are significantly off kilter,"" Dr Yardley adds. More than a quarter of occupied households on Stephen Street are categorised as ""economically inactive"" The younger girl repeatedly told the jury ""she didn't remember"" what had happened the night Ms Wrightson was murdered. She told the police ""she hadn't known what was going on,"" claiming she was on Facebook on her phone while the other girl smashed up the living room and hurled tables, a television and a printer at Ms Wrightson. She said she hadn't noticed when Ms Wrightson was beaten with a stick studded with screws, or slashed across the head with broken glass, or had a mirror slammed over her face. Despite her claimed amnesia, it was pointed out in court, she had remarkable recall for remembering her co-accused was to blame. If one of the pair was the more dominant, it was the younger girl. Repeatedly telling the older girl to ""kick her head in"" and complaining ""why isn't [Ms Wrightson] knocked out yet?"" the younger girl sat and smoked and even spoke to a friend on the phone while orchestrating the attack. Her friend heard her say: ""Go on... kill her. Bray her."" The older girl was advised by carers to try to channel her anger through drawing The younger girl had been bored that night and had left another friend's house because they'd started bickering. She'd tried to arrange to meet up with a number of people, tried to organise a ""session"" or party. After their arrest and throughout the trial, the younger girl tried to push the blame on to the older one. Despite being the younger of the two, she is much bigger than her friend, tall and heavily built. She had a relatively stable home life. An only child, her parents are married and her father works as a delivery driver. When she was about 12 she began having serious arguments with her mother and started to go missing. On several occasions public appeals were put out by police. A respite arrangement was worked out, where she would stay with a foster carer for a few nights a week. This became full-time, but she was always in touch with her family. Her mother in particular would emphasise the importance of making sure she went back to the foster home on time, and behaved herself. Like the older girl, she was not at mainstream school, but was at an off-site educational centre. One of her support workers described her as ""a bright girl"". Both of her parents were at the court; her mother turned up every day for the seven-week trial, her father most days. They left the room - her mother in tears - when the girls were found guilty of murder. Angela Wrightson's body was discovered by her landlord The older girl is slight, pretty, and looks younger than her age. In many ways she is is childlike. She has a very low IQ of between 60 and 70, and believed a person could not die from anything other than ""being stabbed in the heart, shot in the head, or cancer"". When asked in court for her date of birth, she didn't know what the phrase meant. When it was altered to ""when is your birthday?"" she had no idea. When she was arrested for murder she didn't understand why - just as she didn't understand why staff at a children's home told her off for lighting cigarettes from an electric toaster. She looked up to her accomplice, saying the younger girl ""acted older than her"". In many ways the older girl was at the younger's beck and call - it was she who would demand they go out at night, would demand her Facebook password, would tell her to hold her coat for her. Angela Wrightson is pictured on CCTV buying 3 Hammers cider at her local shop at about 19:30. Shortly afterwards she returned to her home for the final time The older girl had a troubled and disorganised upbringing, living in turn with her mother, father, and at a number of foster homes. She was too unsettled to cope in mainstream school and was sent to a pupil referral unit. At the trial, one of her support workers told the court the older girl ""was the most volatile person"" she had ever worked with. The court heard she had a history of self-harming, using anything with a sharp edge to slash not just her arms and legs but even her face. She was also known to have smashed her own head into walls. The day she murdered Ms Wrightson, she visited her mother who told her to kill herself. The older girl was encouraged to use drawing as a way to channel her anger. This picture was found in her room after her arrest - she had drawn it several weeks beforehand During the trial she tried to kill herself a number of times - including one attempt in the court's toilets between sessions of giving evidence. When answering questions posed by the barristers at the trial, she was matter-of-fact - the tone of her voice similar to someone reading aloud a shopping list. ""I kicked Angie in the head and face. About seven times, I think. Then [the younger girl] told me to kick her again, so I kicked her some more in the belly and head and face"". She has five sisters with different fathers. Three of them are in jail - one for stabbing her mother and rupturing her spleen with a golf club. The fact violence was an everyday occurrence in her life ""trivialised"" it, psychiatrists agree. She saw people attacked - but they didn't die, which may have fed into hernotion that beatings don't kill. After Angela Wrightson's death, local people left flowers at the door of the house where she was killed. She is pictured on the right, aged 34 She both witnessed and experienced domestic violence, being taken to A&E 24 times for different injuries. She had her fingers broken by her mother, who suffered from severe psychiatric illness and had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The sisters were taught from a young age there was a ghost in the family home. The girl told the court her mother started giving her illicit prescription drugs - such as amphetamines, Tramadol and codeine - when she was about 11, and bought her strong cider at the same age. Since the night of the murder the girl has hallucinated, waking up sweating and screaming, seeing blood on the walls. She hears the phantom laughter of young girls and thinks men are shouting at her through air vents in the ceiling, and through the shower head. Both girls were from the industrial coastal town of Hartlepool Dr Yardley points out: ""Most of us gain an understanding of mainstream norms and values from our parents and families - we learn what is right and wrong and how to behave in particular circumstances in a socially appropriate and law abiding way. ""Children in care tend to come from backgrounds that prominently feature instability, abuse, violence and neglect. Having experienced a lack of control during their early childhoods, they will have an intense need to wrestle some control back later in their lives. ""In some cases, they will be drawing upon what they have learned from their home environments. They may see mum being hit by dad, mum drinking herself into oblivion - and see this as normal. ""Therefore they have a script or a framework, in which they learn how to react to particular events through observing what goes on around them. ""So for some children, they will learn that when they don't get what they want, they should react by physically attacking someone"". Neither of the older girl's parents attended her trial. The younger girl took a photo of the older in the back of the police van on their way home, and sent it to friends It seems that she maintained her loyalty to the younger girl, who was quick to jettison the friendship. A letter written by the older girl to the younger was intercepted by staff at one of the secure units where the girls were held. The paper, covered with a childish scrawl and littered with drawings of hearts exhorted her friend to ""keep your chin up"". ""Have missed you so much you know. I can't believe this has happened. I'm proper trashed. ""Whatever happens and however long we get, just keep your chin up bonny lass. I'm thinking of you every step of the way. Do our time, get out and start a new life. ""Wait until we get out, me and you on the sesh again but this time it will be bigger and better, I'm telling you."" However, following the brutal murder they committed, it's unlikely the girls will ever be allowed to see each other again.

"This video can not be played France & England fans unite in tribute to attack victims French football fans sang God Save The Queen ahead of the match between France and England in tribute to the victims of attacks in London and Manchester. After the Paris attacks in 2015, England fans sang La Marseillaise at the game against France at Wembley. Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron attended the match in Paris after holding talks. The Oasis track Don't Look Back In Anger was played by the Republican Guard at the Stade de France. Fans held up red and white placards to recreate the Flag of St George, and a minute's silence was held with players from both sides lining up together. The British national anthem was played second - the anthem of the home team is normally second in international fixtures. France v England at the Stade de France England manager Gareth Southgate said: ""We are very grateful to the French for offering this tribute to England as a country. ""It's nice that the history between us doesn't come between us at those moments."" England and France players lined up side-by-side The Wembley arch was lit in French colours after the Paris attacks Similar tributes took place when England played France at Wembleyin November 2015 just days after the terror attacks in Paris. Discussions between Mrs May and Mr Macron were expected to centre on counter-terrorism. Eight people were killed and 48 injuredwhen three attackers drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge then stabbed people in Borough Market on 3 June. The attackers were shot dead by police.

"This video can not be played Macron: 'Of course the door is always open' French President Emmanuel Macron says the possibility of the UK remaining in the European Union is an option until Brexit negotiations have concluded. He was speaking at a joint news conference with UK PM Theresa May. But he said he acknowledged and respected that a decision to leave had been taken by the British people. He echoed the words of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who also said the UK could change its mind about Brexit. ""If they want to change their decision, of course they would find open doors, but I think it's not very likely,"" Mr Schaeuble told Bloomberg Television. Quick guide to what's going on Brexit: What are the options? Gove says Brexit 'consensus' needed Has the election changed EU views of Brexit? After talks with Mrs May in Paris, Mr Macron told reporters: ""Of course the door remains open, always open until the Brexit negotiations come to an end. ""That being said, a sovereign decision was taken by the British people and that is to come out of the European Union, and I very much respect the decisions taken by the people, be it by the French people or the British people. ""In this case it's not for me to say whether or not this decision should be questioned... but until the negotiations come to an end, of course there is always the possibility to re-open the door. ""But let us be clear and organised,  and once the negotiations have started we should be well aware that it'll be more difficult to move backwards."" Mr Macron and Mrs May watched the France-England friendly together at Paris's Stade de France Formal talks are due to begin on 19 June, but Mrs May's hopes of going in with a strengthened mandate were dashed after she failed to secure a majority in last week's general election. Downing Street insists it will not change the approach to Brexit it set out last year. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, warned on Tuesday that no progress had been made on the ""extraordinarily complex"" talks since Mrs May invoked Article 50 in March. He urged the UK to begin talks ""very quickly"", telling the Financial Times: ""I can't negotiate with myself"". Under Article 50, the UK is due to leave the EU by the end of March 2019. Leaving with no deal in place could mean trade tariffs between the UK and the EU unless interim arrangements are made. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Enthusiastic Remainers have been quick to jump on the election result as their latest opportunity to mould the UK's departure from the EU. The various lobby groups, including former ministers still close to some in government, have been whirring with chatter and tactical planning about how to get their voices heard. There are ideas about commissions or ""neddies"" - groups of advisers from business and all political parties that met in years gone by. Even senior Tories like the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, one of their few success stories at the moment, told us yesterday ""it can't just be a Tory Brexit"". On first hearing, that is a staggering thing to hear from Tory lips. But before Remainers get swept up in their moment, and their ambitions swell, it's worth pondering what possibly might be on the table, and what might not, given the usual caveats about the unpredictability of what might come next.

"The Guardian and its sister Sunday title The Observer are to become tabloids, it has been announced. The papers will switch from a mid-size Berliner format in early 2018, 12 years after changing from broadsheets. It is part of a ""transformation programme"" aimed at seeing the loss-making papers break even by 2019, publisher Guardian Media Group said. The move will also see the closure of printing sites in Trafford Park, Manchester, and Stratford, east London. Printing will be outsourced to presses run by Trinity Mirror, the owner of the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People tabloids. GMG said its advertising business would be restructured and its cost base reduced. A consultation with print workers affected by the change - about 50 roles in total - has been launched. Amol Rajan: Five election lessons for the media Katharine Viner, Guardian editor and editor-in-chief of Guardian News & Media said: ""The Berliner is a beautiful format which has served our readers brilliantly for 12 years but we know that it is our award-winning, quality, independent journalism that our readers value most, rather than the shape or size of the newspapers. ""We are going to create a new look tabloid Guardian and Observer that are bold, striking and beautiful."" The Berliner format was introduced by Ms Viner's predecessor, Alan Rusbridger, who stepped down in 2015 after 20 years in charge. Although it is a popular size for titles in Europe, it had not been adopted by any national newspaper in the UK. The papers moved from Farringdon to a new site in King's Cross in 2008 GMG spent Â£50m on new presses for the September 2005 launch, which also saw a complete redesign of the papers. The Guardian's masthead which had been used since 1988 was replaced by a three tone blue and white logo, and new typefaces and layout were introduced. David Pemsel, chief executive of GMG, said: ""More people are reading and supporting our journalism than ever before, but the print industry continues to evolve, and we must evolve with it.""

"Scientists have developed a drug that mimics sunlight to make the skin tan, with no damaging UV radiation involved. The drug tricks the skin into producing the brown form of the pigment melanin in tests on skin samples and mice. Evidence suggests it will work even on redheads, who normally just burn in the sun. The team at Massachusetts General Hospital hope their discovery could prevent skin cancer and even slow the appearance of ageing. UV light makes the skin tan by causing damage. This kicks off a chain of chemical reactions in the skin that ultimately leads to dark melanin - the body's natural sunblock - being made. The drug is rubbed into the skin to skip the damage and kick-start the process of making melanin. Dr David Fisher, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: ""It has a potent darkening effect. ""Under the microscope it's the real melanin, it really is activating the production of pigment in a UV-independent fashion."" The drug was tested on the skin sample on the right. It is a markedly different approach to fake tan, which ""paints"" the skin without the protection from melanin, sun beds, which expose the skin to UV light or pills that claim to boost melanin production but still need UV light. But the team is not motivated by making a new cosmetic. Dr Fisher said the lack of progress in skin cancer - the most common type of cancer - was a ""very significant frustration"". He added: ""Our real goal is a novel strategy for protecting skin from UV radiation and cancer. ""Dark pigment is associated with a lower risk of all forms of skin cancer - that would be really huge."" Tests,detailed in the journal Cell Reports,external, have shown the melanin produced by the drug was able to block harmful UV rays. Eventually the scientists want to combine their drug with sun-cream to give maximum protection from solar radiation. Dr Fisher said everyone should ""absolutely"" use sun-cream but its weakness was it ""keeps you pale"". The way the drug works could also allow a ginger tan, as the genetic mutation that causes red hair and fair skin disrupts the normal process where UV light leads to dark melanin. It is not yet clear if the drug might have the unintended consequence of affecting the glorious hair colour, but it is thought the hair follicle is too deep in the skin for the drug to reach. But whether you are ginger, blonde or brunette, the drug is not yet ready for commercial use. The researchers want to do more safety testing, although so far there has been ""no hint of problems"". They will probably want to give it a better name than an SIK-inhibitor too. Matthew Gass, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said the study was a ""novel approach"" to preventing skin cancer. He added: ""A lot more research has to be done before we see this sort of technology being used on humans, however, it's certainly an interesting proposition. ""Skin cancer rates in the UK are going through the roof... any research into ways that we can prevent people from developing skin cancer in the first place is to be welcomed."" Stopping UV damage could have an extra boon beyond cancer - slowing the appearance of ageing. Dr Fisher's final piece of promise for the research is: ""Many people would say the obvious and most dramatic sign of ageing is what skin looks like and even casual UV damage over the years causes damage. ""Medically it is very difficult to focus on, but if it is tremendously safe then it could keep skin healthier for longer.""

"The Handmaid's Tale has inspired several protests in the US this year Activists in the US state of Ohio have been inspired by The Handmaid's Tale in their protest against a bill placing more restrictions on abortion. Several women held a silent protest in red robes and white bonnets - like the characters in the dystopian novel and TV series where fertile women are captured and forced to have children. The proposed state legislation would ban a method of abortion commonly carried out in the second trimester. Critics call the bill unconstitutional. Senate Bill 145,externalis sponsored by members of Ohio's Republican party who say they want to end what they describe as inhumane and brutal dismemberment abortions. The bill makes an exception where the mother's life is in danger. However, opponents say the ban against dilation and evacuation is an attempt to block access to a common and safe abortion method. They also argue it would particularly affect women who already struggle to obtain access to an abortion. The protesters gathered in the Ohio Statehouse rotunda The Handmaid's Tale has inspired several protests against anti-abortion bills this year, including in Texas and Missouri. The novel, by Margaret Atwood, is set in a future, dystopian America, where a violent dictatorship has been imposed and women have been stripped of all their rights. In the novel, much of the population has become sterile, so the few remaining fertile women are captured and given to society's highest-ranking men as ""handmaids"", to bear the children. Speaking to the BBCin October, Atwood said the book still had resonance, and had become a meme, because ""the religious right in the United States has not faded away"".

"This video can not be played Ms Foster said she would not 'negotiate over the airwaves' The Democratic Unionist Party leader has said she hopes to seal a deal on supporting Theresa May's minority government ""sooner rather than later"". After meeting the prime minister in Downing Street, Arlene Foster said discussions were ""going well"" and she hoped for a ""successful conclusion"". The BBC understands a final meeting to approve the deal is set for Wednesday. But ex-Conservative PM Sir John Major said he was ""dubious"" about the idea and its impact on the peace process. The Conservatives are having to rely on the support of 10 DUP MPs after they fell eight seats short of winning an overall majority at the general election. But Sir John told BBC Radio 4's World at One that if the party ""locked"" itself into a deal with one of the main parties in Northern Ireland, there was a danger the government would no longer be seen as an ""impartial honest broker"" in restoring the power-sharing arrangements and upholding NI institutions. BBC Election Live - rolling text and video updates Quick guide to what's going on Peace in Northern Ireland should ""not be regarded as a given"", said Sir John - whose government laid the foundations for the peace process in the 1990s -  and nothing should be done to ""exaggerate the differences"" between the unionist and nationalist communities. This video can not be played I am ""concerned"" about a deal with the DUP, says former prime minister Sir John Major He urged Theresa May to consider governing on her own, saying this would not ""carry the baggage"" for the Conservatives that an arrangement with the DUP would. Sir John suggested the DUP would be asking for money and that would be seen as the ""government paying cash for votes in Parliament"", and would be received badly in other parts of the UK. The agreement with the DUP is expected to be very different to the coalition deal agreed between the Conservatives and Lib Dems in 2010, with DUP politicians not getting cabinet jobs and their support for the majority of new legislation to be determined on a vote-by-vote basis. Asked about Sir John's comments during a trip to Paris, Mrs May said she was ""absolutely steadfast"" in her support for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement - which created the Northern Ireland Assembly - and efforts to revive the power-sharing executive. Mrs May, who has been holding talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on counter-terrorism and Brexit, said the ""productive"" talks with the DUP were about ""giving stability to the UK government that is necessary at this critical time"" ahead of the start of the Brexit process. Bercow: I'm a Speaker 'for testing times' May to meet Macron for anti-terror talks The clock's ticking, EU warns UK Reality Check: Has election changed EU views of Brexit? Conservative sources said ""constructive"" progress had been made in the talks and both sides were ""working carefully through the paperwork"" to complete the deal. Mrs Foster told the BBC areas being discussed including Brexit, counter-terrorism and ""doing what's right for Northern Ireland in respect of economic matters"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the DUP was likely to demand money for investment in Northern Ireland and an end to austerity. This video can not be played ""At least someone got a landslide"" - the PM's comment was met with laughter Sinn Fein, whose seven MPs will not take their seats in Westminster, said any deal must be approved by the Northern Ireland executive when it is back up and running. ""Any agreement reached with the DUP - financial or otherwise - cannot be to the detriment of anyone else in our society,"" said Belfast West MP Paul Maskey. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? Who is Arlene Foster? What won't be in the Queen's Speech? Earlier in the Commons, as MPs gathered for the first time since the election, Jeremy Corbyn congratulated Mrs May on ""returning as PM"" and said he ""looked forward to this Parliament, however short it may be"". The Labour leader joked that he welcomed the prospect of a Queen's Speech once this ""coalition of chaos has been negotiated"", but said if this did not happen, he was ""ready to offer strong and stable leadership in the national interest"". Mrs May has chaired the first meeting of the cabinet since the election and has been finalising her reshuffle, with changes including Steve Baker, a leading backbench Brexiteer, becoming a minister in the Department for Exiting The EU. The move was welcomed by Conservative commentators, but the Lib Dems said far from ""softening her stance"" on Brexit after the inconclusive election result, the PM had put a ""fox in charge of guarding the hen house"". This video can not be played Who are the DUP? This video can not be played Pollsters have had a pretty rough time of late, we asked one what's gone wrong Senior EU figures, meanwhile, have expressed their growing impatience with the UK and warned the clock is ticking for the negotiations, which have only 20 months to run. In a joint press conference with Mr Macron, Mrs May said Brexit talks would get under way next week as planned. Mr Macron told reporters that while respecting the decision of the British people to leave the EU, the door ""would always remain open"" if they changed their mind.

"Theresa May met France President Emmanuel Macron in Paris According to the Telegraph Theresa May has signalled she will not compromise over Brexit - despite growing demands for a change in approach following Thursday's election result. The paper says the prime minister is determined to enter talks in Brussels with a threat that Britain is prepared to leave the EU without securing a trade deal. It says Mrs May is determined to stick to her pre-election promise that the UK will leave the single market and negotiate free-trade partnerships around the world. However, the Times says Chancellor Philip Hammond is urging a softer approach - believing that Britain has to remain within the customs union after Brexit. The paper says Mr Hammond - who many had predicted would be sacked by Mrs May had she won a convincing majority - was in ""street fighting mode"". It says he would seek support from the prime minister's old friend, ally and newly appointed deputy, Damian Green. But it warns that any move along this course is likely to infuriate the Tory right. Speaking to the Guardian, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, accuses the Conservative party of unleashing the most negative and vicious general election campaign in living memory. In an interview in which she reveals that she has type two diabetes, Ms Abbott tells the paper that during the election campaign ""everything went crazy and her blood sugar was out of control"".

"This video can not be played Jeff Sessions: Russia collusion claim a 'detestable lie' US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has denied during a Congress hearing having undisclosed meetings with Russian officials at a Washington DC hotel. America's top law official also told the Senate Intelligence Committee any suggestion he colluded with the Kremlin was ""an appalling and detestable lie"". Mr Sessions repeatedly refused to answer questions about his private conversations with the president. He vowed to defend his honour ""against scurrilous and false allegations"". Mr Sessions' remarks came after sacked FBI boss James Comey said he believed he was fired to influence the agency's investigation into Russian political meddling. US intelligence agencies believe that Russia interfered in the election in order to help Republican President Donald Trump get elected. The Senate committee is of one several congressional panels that, along with a special counsel, is also investigating whether any Trump campaign officials colluded with the alleged Kremlin plot. Mr Sessions, the country's top law enforcement official, told the Senate committee he has never received a classified briefing about Russian meddling in last year's election. The Trump-Russia story - in 199 words Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake He also vehemently denied speaking to Russian officials about the election, during a campaign in which he was a close adviser to candidate Trump. ""I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States,"" he said on Tuesday. He is the most senior member of the Trump administration to testify before the Senate committee. Mr Sessions acknowledged he met Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak twice, but suggested he could not remember whether he met the envoy at a foreign policy speech event for then-candidate Mr Trump at the Mayflower Hotel on 27 April 2016,as US media have reported,external. The former Alabama senator also denied media reports that he offered his resignation when Mr Trump was reportedly angered by his recusal from the FBI Russia probe, telling the panel he ""will not be deterred"". Mr Sessions was often evasive and his accounting of details uncertain, littered with ""I don't recalls"" and ""I have no recollections"". He is far from the first politician to seek refuge in a fuzzy memory under sharp questioning. Definitive statements proven inaccurate under oath are more prone to accusations of perjury. When it came time to discuss his conversations with the president, Mr Sessions demurred, noting that he wanted to give Mr Trump the opportunity to review the question before sharing his thoughts. It was as if the attorney general was trying to pre-emptively invoke executive privilege - the right of a president to candid counsel from his advisers - without using those magic words. Where Mr Sessions' memory does serve, he forcefully condemned allegations of Russian collusion as ""appalling and detestable"". The controversy at this point is about more than just collusion, however. It's about obstruction of justice and the circumstances around the firing of an FBI director. In those areas the attorney general did little to turn down the heat. Read Anthony in full This video can not be played Angry exchange at Sessions hearing Vice-Chairman Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, pressed Mr Sessions about his role in the sacking of Mr Comey. Mr Sessions said he never spoke to the former FBI director, who reports to the US attorney general, about his job performance before Mr Trump fired him in May. But Mr Sessions did confirm Mr Comey's assertion that he told the US attorney general that he felt uncomfortable speaking directly to Mr Trump in a one-on-one setting. A legal 'dream team' looking at Trump How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded Several Democratic senators expressed frustration because Mr Sessions repeatedly refused to answer questions relating to conversations he had with the president, saying they were confidential. Similar answers were heard last week duringtestimony from the US intelligence chiefsbefore the same panel. US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, National Security Agency chief Admiral Mike Rogers, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were criticised for refusing to respond to some questions in a public hearing. But Mr Rogers ""thoroughly answered the committee's questions in a closed setting on Monday night"", Chairman Richard Burr said.

"The claim:Jeremy Corbyn had youth on his side. Reality Check verdict:If the YouGov and Ipsos Mori polls are accurate there was a big swing of young people to Labour and a considerable increase in their turnout. YouGov released,externalthe first big poll of how different groups voted at the general election on 13 June -the version from Ipsos Mori,externalcame out on 20 June. Both of these are estimates based on polling. There are no official figures because the general election is a secret ballot - the closest we have is the British Election Study, but that will not be released for months. YouGov estimated that voters aged between 18 and 29 preferred Labour to the Conservatives by 63% to 22%, having polled more than 50,000 people online since election day. The corresponding figures it gavein its poll after the 2015 election,externalwere 36% to 32% - if correct that is a huge swing among young voters. Ipsos Mori's methodology is somewhat different - it spoke to 7,500 people before the election and then adjusted its findings based on the actual results. But it also found a big swing to Labour among younger voters, beating the Conservatives by 62% to 27% among 18- to 24-year-olds, compared with a 43% to 27% split in 2015. It said: ""All the swing to Labour was among under-44s,"" although it actually found a bigger swing in the 25-34 age group than in the 18-24s. Lord Ashcroft's much smaller exit poll,externalputs support for Labour among young people even higher, with 67% of 18 to 24 year olds voting Labour and 18% voting Conservative. YouGov and Ipsos Mori also estimated the turnout among groups of voters. YouGov found that about 58% of people between the age of 18 and 24 voted, while Ipsos Mori estimated that it was 54%. Both of those figures are a proportion of all 18- to 24-year-olds, not just those who are registered to vote. If accurate, those figures would be considerably higher than recent elections, but lower than the widely quoted but poorly sourced figure of 72%, whichReality Check wrote about. We don't have comparable YouGov figures from the 2015 election. The corresponding figures fromIpsos Mori,externalwere 38% of all 18- to 24-year-olds and 43% of those registered to vote. The overall turnout (and these are actual figures - not based on polling) was 69%, compared with 66% in 2015, so it appears that the youth vote increased by considerably more than the overall turnout. Among the other findings of the YouGov poll was that 49% of graduates voted Labour compared with 32% voting Conservative. In 2015 that figure was 34% Labour and 35% Conservative. That compares with people with no academic qualifications above GCSE, who in 2017 split 33% for Labour and 55% for the Conservatives and in 2015 split 30% for Labour and 38% for the Conservatives. Ipsos Mori found broadly the same result broken down by level of education. Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter,external Reality Check: Has there been a surge in youth turnout?

What is the difference between a free trade area, a single market and a customs union? Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. Empty properties owned by the rich should be used for the homeless of Grenfell Tower, Labour's leader says. The prime minister has released a statement after meeting Northern Ireland's main parties saying agreement can be reached to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont ""if there is good will on all sides"". ""But time is running short and the parties must come together by the 29 June for the return of a strong voice at Stormont and for a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" She said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire would keep talking to the parties ""and if no resolution is reached then we will need to consider what steps we need to take, to ensure Northern Ireland has the political stability it needs"".

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Grenfell Tower disaster was an emergency of such gravity that it had already become a significant issue for the government, at a very volatile time. The priority was to focus on getting help to where it was needed - with the announcement that a scheme to provide extra cash for the council - before getting on with a full public inquiry, which would get going ""pretty soon"". But the handling of such an awful situation was very risky for politicians and uncomfortable truths could emerge from the public inquiry. ""Potentially, some people expect, it may well show that not just this government but previous governments have simply not done enough to make sure this kind of housing is safe,"" she said.     The Grenfell Tower block disaster has again been dominating the news agenda. Here's a round-up of the latest developments on this and other political stories today: The Lib Dems have warned the Conservatives they ""cannot go from weak and wobbly to business as usual"" after the government announced formal Brexit negotiations will begin on Monday. Lib Dem MP Alistair
Carmichael said: If the government cannot even secure a deal with the DUP, how on earth can they get a deal with the EU?

He said all parties in Northern Ireland ""need to be consulted on all of this"".

Dodds says the setting of a date for the Queen's Speech is separate and not
relevant to his party's discussions over a deal with the Conservatives. Questioned about whether a deal
would be announced before the Queen's speech next Wednesday, Mr Dodds said
there's no deadline for the discussions. Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP
wants to strengthen the UK, deliver Brexit in a proper and sensible manner for
Northern Ireland and spread prosperity around the UK. Asked if the Treasury was ""nitpicking"" over the
financial details, Mr Dodds said he'd seen the reports in the newspapers but
wouldn't comment on speculation. More on the Brexit talks. Formal negotiationswill begin on Monday, the UK and EU say. The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists. The UK is due to leave by the end of March 2019. Labour MP Harriet Harman has been speaking to the BBC after the Westminster Hall session earlier. The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people. She said tower blocks needed to be fitted with sprinklers and questions needed to be asked about whether refurbishing blocks could compromise fire safety - and whether the official ""stay put"" advice for people in burning buildings should be changed. Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay. It's wrong if there is a delay because people are living in thousands of tower blocks all around the country and they need to know the lessons are going to be learned quickly.""  She also said it was up to opposition parties to make sure the government ""doesn't slip off the hook"" in terms of providing resources to make sure buildings are safe. BBC political editor tweets...

"There is no doubt that Travis Kalanick, the billionaire founder of the Uber lift-sharing platform, built a company that is one of the giants of Silicon Valley. However, recent months have seen him make a series of apologies for both his own behaviour and that of members of his leadership team. He has now told staff he is going to takesome time away from the firm. He is set to have fewer responsibilities upon his return. Uber now operates in 662 cities around the world and is valued at nearly $70bn (Â£55bn). Mr Kalanick's reputation for ruthlessness and machismo has led to some deeply uncomfortable reports about the culture inside Uber: with persistent stories about organisational sexism and disputes with drivers over their terms and with local authorities and taxi companies. ""Travis's biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals,"" investor and mentor  Mark Cubantold the New York Times,external. ""Travis's biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That's the best way to describe him."" Travis Kalanick's informal ""bro-like"" tone has not always helped. Ina widely reported email to staff ahead of a company party in Miami in 2013,external, Mr Kalanick - known as TK - asked employees not to have sex with each other if they were in the ""same chain of command"" or to throw beer kegs off tall buildings, and levied a $200 (Â£158) ""puke charge"" for anyone who was sick, presumably as a result of over-indulgence. Arianna Huffington has said Travis Kalanick needs to change his leadership style It's difficult to imagine Apple's Tim Cook or Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg writing a similar missive. Board member Arianna Huffington said in March that Mr Kalanick needed to evolve his leadership style from ""scrappy entrepreneur"" to ""leader of a major global company."" President Jeff Jones is one of a stream of executives who have parted ways with the company in recent months. Mr Jones left after less than one year in post. ""It is now clear... that the beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the ride-sharing business,""he said in a statement to Recode,external. Mr Kalanick himself acknowledged that he needed to ""grow up"", aftera video of him swearing at an Uber driver,externalin a row over rates was shared online. He said he was ""ashamed"" of his behaviour and accepted that he needed ""leadership help"". He now has a private driver. It has been claimed that Mr Kalanick saw the medical records of a woman who accused an Uber driver of rape in India, after they wereobtained by Uber Asia executive Eric Alexander,external. Uber did not comment directly but confirmed that Mr Alexander no longer worked there. In February 2017,a blog post by former Uber engineer Susan J Fowler,external, which documented her experiences of sexism at Uber, went viral. It led to Mr Kalanick launching an investigation into the culture of the organisation. He described her experiences as ""abhorrent"" and against the company's values. Another Uber employeewho wrote about her time there,externalsaid it had been suggested to her - by another woman - that a male manager couldn't look her in the eye because she was wearing a sleeveless tank top. There are other anecdotes about Uber's attitude to women that have raised eyebrows. During aninterview with the magazine GQ,externalin 2014, Mr Kalanick joked about a service for women on demand, which he nicknamed ""Boob-er"". Uber chief Kalanick may face bumpy ride Dear Travis... leadership tips for Uber's beleaguered boss Uber investigates 'abhorrent' sexism claims Ex-girlfriend Gabi Holzwarth recalledgoing with Mr Kalanick and a team of employees to an escort-karaoke bar in Korea,externalwhere women sat in a circle at the bar, wearing tags with numbers on them. He did not get involved and the pair did not stay for long. She said she had later been asked by senior vice-president Emil Michael to tell reporters they had sung karaoke and ""had a good time"". Mr Michael said this was not his recollection of the conversation. Uber said the event had been reported to human resources and the workplace culture report investigators. Mr Michael left the company on 12 June. Also in 2014, a promotion by Uber in Lyon promised to pair riders with ""hot chick"" drivers for a maximum period of 20 minutes  -Buzzfeed obtained screenshots,externalof the blog post, subsequently deleted, which featured models in lingerie. The same year Emil Michael suggested at a dinner that the company should hire researchers to dig dirt on its critics, singling out one female journalist in particular. Mr Michael later apologised for the ""off the record"" remarks. Some of Uber's operations under Travis Kalanick's watch have been in decidedly grey areas. The New York Times revealed that it had beenusing a computer program called Greyball, which it claimed had been used to identify officials trying to catch its drivers and deny them service in areas where Uber had not yet been authorised. Uber said the program had been used to prevent ""fraudulent users"" from violating its terms. Apple forbids apps from tracking its devices It was also reported thatApple boss Tim Cook had personally intervenedwhen his company had discovered Uber had been using ""fingerprinting"" code to track iPhones by collecting their serial numbers, which is against the terms of the app store. Uber claimed the process deterred criminals from installing its app on stolen handsets. Waymo, the self-driving car firm owned by Google's parent firm Alphabet, has accused Uber of stealing trade secrets. In court, Waymo alleged that Anthony Levandowski, a former employee, downloaded 14,000 confidential files before leaving the company in 2016 and later joining Uber to head up its self-driving car project. Uber denies receiving or using stolen technology. In May 2017 itfired Mr Levandowski for allegedly declining to assist in its investigation relating to the lawsuit. An Uber driverless car in San Francisco The idea of driverless cars was never going to sit well with Uber's thousands of drivers, even though it appealed to its investors, and the company approached it with the steamrolling tactics favoured by Mr Kalanick. A research collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University's robotics centre soured after 40 of its researchers and scientists left to join the ride-sharing firm. Uber was criticised for raising prices during heavy snow in New York Uber has also been criticised over its price-surging policy, where the price of a journey goes up if it is in high demand. On that subject, Mr Kalanick was unapologetic. ""We did more trips because of our approach, not fewer,"" hetold Wired following a price surge during heavy snow in New York in 2013.,external ""We gave people more options to get around, and that is the whole fricking goal."" Perhaps it is his burning ambition to meet that one ""fricking goal"" that might ultimately have driven Travis Kalanick to bad behaviour. ""We characterise him as aggressive, dog-eat-dog, and he's obviously an extremely driven individual, that's how he's achieved what he's achieved,"" said John Blakey, executive coach and author of The Trusted Executive, in a recent BBC interview. ""[But] what got you here, won't get you there. Those attributes - the challenge, the boldness, the brashness - to get to the next stage of the game, he has to recognise he needs new qualities.""

"She likes dollars, she likes diamonds, she likes throwing high-heeled shoes at people she doesn't like very much. Cardi B's ongoing feud with Nicki Minaj turned physical over the weekend as the pairclashed at a New York Fashion Week event. Footage posted on TMZ showed the pair trading verbal insults, with Cardi eventually throwing a red-heeled shoe at Minaj after allegedly being elbowed in the face by a security guard. Minaj appeared unscathed from the incident. The exclamation mark key on Cardi's smartphonetook a much worse battering,externalas the rapper continued the beef on Instagram, in a post which also featured a great deal of bad language. It's certainly not the first music industry feud in history. It's not even the first Nicki Minaj feud with another female rapper in history. Here's a look at some of the others. When Lady Gaga dropped Born This Way in 2011, a few people thought it sounded vaguely familiar. One of those people was Madonna, who thought it was so similar to her 1989 hit Express Yourself that she performedputting the two songs together,externalas a mash-up on tour. ""The only time I ever criticised Lady Gaga was when I felt like she blatantly ripped off one of my songs,""Madonna said in 2015,external. ""It's got nothing to do with 'she's taking my crown' or 'she's in some space of mine.' She has her thing. I do think she's a very talented singer and songwriter. It was just that one issue."" That one issue, however, was enough to spark a feud which lasted several years. Gaga - real name Stefani Germanotta - addressed it in her documentary Five Foot Two, released last year, suggesting that she was disappointed that Madonna didn't speak to her about it directly. ""No matter how much respect I have for her as a performer, I could never wrap my head around the fact that she wouldn't look me in the eye and tell me that I was reductive or whatever,"" she said. As a band, Oasis were no strangers to scrapes. An infamous chart battle in 1995 saw Oasis's Roll With It go up against Blur's Country House in a race for the number one spot - a contest Blur eventually won. The competition was so high-profile it even made headline news, much to the bemusement of a somewhat younger-looking John Humphrys. This video can not be played In 1995 Oasis and Blur's battle for the number one spot was headline news But there was another Oasis feud still to come - this time an internal one. In 2009, the year Noel quit the band, he told Q his brother Liam was ""rude, arrogant, intimidating, and lazy"", adding: ""He's the angriest man you'll ever meet. He's like a man with a fork in a world of soup."" Last year, Liam said Noel was absent from the premiere of a documentary film about the band because he was probably in one of his ""really big houses, eating tofu and having a face peel"". Their brotherly battle rumbled on last year when LiamcriticisedNoel for not appearing atOne Love Manchester- a concert to benefit the victims of the suicide bombing in the city. But Noel defended himself by saying he was never asked to play at the show, adding that he'd donated the royalties from Don't Look Back In Anger to the Red Cross's Manchester Emergency Fund. Taylor Swift's beef with Kanye West dates back to 2009 - and specifically, that year's MTV Video Music Awards. Kanye wasn't too impressed with Taylor winning video of the year for You Belong With Me. He thought it should've been Beyonce's Single Ladies instead. And, as we know, Kanye is not the type to bottle up his feelings. The rapper took to the stage during Taylor's acceptance speech, grabbed the microphone, and said: ""Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'mma let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time!"" Kim Kardashian West has defended her husband during the feud with Taylor The pair later made up, but a few years down the line, West claimed in his single Famous that the run-in had helped Swift's career. Taylor claimed she had never given West's lyrics her blessing before the song was released, but then the rapper's wife Kim Kardashiangot involved, posting a Snapchat which appeared to show Taylor doing just that. Swift, however, countered on Twitter that she hadn't specifically approved the lyric about him having made her famous. At the 2016 Grammys, Swift said: ""I want to say to all the young women out there - there are going to be people along the way who are going to try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame."" But, she advised her fans: ""Just focus on the work and you don't let those people sidetrack you."" Taylor also made some digs at Kanye in her single Look What You Made Me Do. ""I don't like yourtilted stage,external, the role you made me play,"" she sang. After leaving One Direction in 2015, Zayn Malik began working on some new material with Naughty Boy - the producer famous for his work with Emeli Sande and Sam Smith. But it's fair to say that he and Zayn didn't quite hit it off in the same way. ""Naughty Boy you fat joke stop pretending we're friends no one knows you,"" tweeted Zayn after their recording sessions turned sour. Mr Boy later told The Guardian the 22-year old was ""throwing his toys out of the pram"" and said they had fallen out over ""external influences"". The number of artists which Azealia Banks (above left) has fallen out with is so huge that it could probably make a listicle in its own right. But somebody who experienced a particularly high level of vitriol from her was Fancy singer Iggy Azalea. For two artists who became popular around the same time and were only a couple of letters off sharing a name, perhaps comparisons and rivalries were inevitable. It all kicked off when XXL magazine put Iggy on the cover of their annual freshman issue, which looks at the hottest newcomers in music every year. Banks was not a massive fan of this editorial decision. She said the magazine was ""wrong"" to include Iggy and went on to accuse her nemesis of appropriating black culture. Iggy Azalea responded by saying: ""You can't block my blessings, today I'm celebrating, get on with it or kick rocks."" The battle rumbled on for years, with Iggy claiming in 2014 that her huge chart success was the only reason Banks was still getting any publicity. There was no shortage of rap feuds in the early 2000s. Nas and Jay Z. DMX and Ja Rule. 50 Cent and All Other Rappers. But one of the most high-profile involved the biggest name in music at the time and the slightly less famous Benzino - a rapper and co-owner of hip-hop magazine The Source. Benzino put out a track dissing Eminem called Pull Your Skirt Up, which described Eminem as a ""2003 Vanilla Ice"" and compared him to a woman. Eminem retaliated with his own diss track, Nail in the Coffin, in which he said: ""Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap."" If a new female rapper arrives on the music scene and Lil' Kim (above left) doesn't start a fight with her - did she ever even exist? Kim has history with Eve, Foxy Brown, Remy Ma and many more... but those were small fry compared to when Nicki Minaj appeared in the late noughties. Nicki's debut album Pink Friday was a massive success when it was released in 2010, but Lil' Kim opted not to send flowers. In a diss track she put out online called Black Friday, Kim described Nicki as a ""Lil' Kim wannabe"" who was ""trying to clone my style"". Minaj, naturally, responded with a diss track of her own, called Stupid Hoe. Which drew attention to the fact that her records were ""shipping platinum"" while Kim remained ""busted"" and ""crusty"". Things have now, of course, come full circle, with Nicki Minaj now the one feeling threatened by a newcomer and entering a public battle with the aforementioned Cardi B. Probably best to finish on one that has a happy ending. RiRi and CiCi, as they should never have been nicknamed, both launched their careers in 2005 - with Ciara topping the charts with Goodies and Rihanna hitting number two with Pon De Replay. They were the young bright hopes of R&B and even went on tour together. But a few years later things turned sour. ""I ran into her recently at a party and she wasn't the nicest,"" explained Ciara in 2011. ""It wasn't the most pleasant run-in."" There then followed the most glorious of Twitter exchanges. Rihanna:""My bad Ci, did I forget to tip you?"" Ciara:""Trust me Rihanna you don't want to see me on or off the stage."" Rihanna:""You gangsta huh?... Good luck with booking that stage you speak of."" Ouch. But it didn't take long for Rihanna to backtrack, writing: ""Ciara baby, I love you girl! You hurt my feelings real bad on TV, that's why I retaliated this way. So sorry!"" Ciara graciously responded: 'Rhi, u know its always been love since day one! You threw me off in that party!

"This video can not be played Jo Cox's parents: 'We have to stay positive' On 16 June 2016, Labour MP Jo Cox was shot and stabbed in her constituency. Now, as the anniversary of her death approaches, her parents and sister say they are still learning to cope with the loss. As Jean Leadbeater, Jo's mother, waits to welcome us at her front door, the first thing she does is to pull everyone in for a hug. Jo's father, Gordon, is just behind her with a big smile on his face. They bustle around, getting the kettle on, as their daughter Kim makes the introductions. Within minutes, everyone is huddled around Kim's phone as she shows a video of her and Jo doing karaoke together. It was filmed at her birthday, just six weeks before her sister was murdered. It shows the two sisters in the middle of a party, but they're lost in the moment and may as well be alone in the room. This video can not be played Jo Cox sings karaoke with her sister Kim It's a poignant clip, and you might expect Jo's family to be in tears watching it. But actually, there are peals of laughter as the two women do their best impression of Elaine Paige and Barbara Dickson. And really, that sums this family up. They've gone through one of the toughest things imaginable and have emerged with their warmth and humour intact. But their grief is only just below the surface. Jo Cox was MP for Batley and Spen in Yorkshire Jean remembers the moment when she got the call telling her that her daughter been attacked: ""The phone rang and it was her aide. ""He said, 'Jo's been shot, I think.' That was it."" The couple didn't know if she was alive or dead as they raced to get to her. ""We jumped in the car, and we couldn't get near,"" she tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""So we set off running. I don't know how we ran. I don't know how we managed to get there."" Gordon picks up the story: ""If someone says, 'Jo's been shot,' that's bad. But people are shot and recover. So we didn't know."" But he describes a police inspector breaking the news: ""He doesn't have to tell you, you can see by his expression."" Kim listens to her parents silently, but the pain is etched across her face. Kim says her love for Jo's children is now ""100 times deeper"" She moves the conversation on, talking about how the family are now trying to ""create a new level of normality"". They don't focus on Jo's death, or the man who killed her. Jean admits the family ""will always be broken, because there's a piece missing"". ""I think to the outside world, we do appear strong, but there's a lot of days when it's bad. It's bad."" Floral tributes and candles were left at a vigil for Jo Cox in Parliament Square Gordon adds: ""It's not, after one year it gets better. It doesn't. It won't go away. But we have to be positive."" They now prefer to focus on Jo's children. Cuillin and Lejla were aged five and three when their mother died. ""Going forward, build on the children,"" Gordon says. ""Jo's children have got so much of her in them. That's a great legacy. We love that."" Sun and Mirror in joint editorial Election 'would have excited Jo' Man jailed for MP's murder Jean and Gordon's house, however, still retains many memories of Jo. When Jo decided to run for Parliament - and at the time was based in London - her parents decided to extend their home. They built a loft conversion on their bungalow for Jo to work from. Gordon admits he couldn't go up to the room for the three months after she died. But now, when their grandchildren come to stay, they all sleep in the loft together. Kim is a devoted auntie - and says her love for the children is ""100 times deeper now"". She admits that Jo's death has not fully hit her yet. ""I've got those facts, but I don't think I've got them on a deep emotional level yet, and that worries me. ""I'm not in denial. I think there must be a difference between denial and disbelief. I cannot believe that it's happened."" Kim led a tribute to her sister in the days following her death Kim has spent this year trying to build a legacy for her sister and best friend. Days after her sister's death, she gave a speech thanking people for their kindness. That was just the start. She has worked on causes that were close to Jo's heart, such as tackling loneliness and getting communities to integrate better. So this weekend, exactly a year after her sister's death, she will be at a series of events for the Great Get Together. She's asking people to organise street parties, barbecues and bake-offs as a reason to spend time with their neighbours. Because, as she puts it, ""me and Jo loved us food"". She says she is looking forward to it, but also feels ""some trepidation, because it will be a difficult weekend in some ways"". ""But it will also be a wonderful celebration - the best way to remember Jo, as she was all about people.""

"It was Napoleon Bonaparte who once dismissed Britain as a nation of shop keepers. He could more accurately have described us as a nation of shoppers. Consumer spending is the driver of the UK's economic growth, accounting for about 60% of all our economic activity. The quickest route to a downturn in that growth figure is consumers who rein in spending. Today's sharp rise in prices (inflation is now at its highest rate for four years) increases the pressure on the just-about-managing classes. And savers, once again, are feeling the strain in an era of ultra-low interest rates. The fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit referendum is the main inflation driver (but not the only one) as it increases the prices of the 40% of food and fuel we import. And all the basics businesses buy abroad to make the things we purchase or provide us with services. Of course, it is not all one way traffic. Sterling's decline is good for exporters and for those global corporations based in the UK which earn a substantial proportion of their revenues in dollars and pay increased dividends to shareholders that include our pension funds. Some inflation can also be good for an economy as businesses tend to invest more if they assume that prices - and revenues - will rise in the future. But the clear and present danger from this inflation spike is for consumers. Which is, pretty much, all of us. Inflation is now at 2.9%, already above where the Bank of England believed it would peak by the end of this year. Income growth is at 2.1%. The incomes squeeze which returned last month has just become tighter. There is some evidence it is having an effect, although consumers have so far been remarkably resilient in the face of rising prices. The latest Visa data on credit and debit card activity earlier this week suggested the first fall in consumer spending in four years. The retail sales figures published on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics will be closely watched. Last month's saw the biggest quarterly fall in seven years, although the figures can be volatile. Behind all this data are the real stories of people who are worse off. Average wage growth masks wide variations, of course. Those in the public sector have seen their pay either frozen - or rises capped at 1% - since 2010. And those people who receive in-work benefits to top up their income have not seen those payments rise. It is into this toxic mix that the question of austerity is thrown - public sector pay and benefits freezes are controlled by the government. Yes, Theresa May can argue that government debts are still rising and that those debts will have to be paid off by future generations. The need for ""sound money"" still holds sway among many. But, if people feel worse off they tend to look to politicians for solutions. And if there aren't any, they tend to punish incumbents. Since the Second World War there have only been three elections where real incomes have been falling - 1945, 2010 and 2017. None of them ended well for the governing party going into the election - even if they had just won a world war. Nick Timothy, Theresa May's former chief of staff who resigned at the weekend, said voters ""were tired of austerity"". Today's inflation figure will only make that exhaustion - and pressure on the government to change tack - more acute.

"The trial and execution grabbed headlines from both sides of a partisan press Two hundred years ago the Pentrich Uprising - the last attempt at armed revolution in England - saw government agents and a rigged trial used to demonise radicals, but also helped change how Britain was run. The three ""traitors"" were to be shown mercy - their bodies would not be quartered after hanging and beheading. But as the crowds watched them die outside Derby prison, the storm of protest about their cause, crimes and fate had already begun. The year of 1817 was a particularly bad time to be poor. The spectre of the French Revolution and its Reign of Terror haunted the British authorities The economy was in a slump, laws kept the landowners rich and the previous ""year without summer"" had left workers' families hungry and diseased. Political reform and the rights of common people were fiercely debated but Lord Liverpool's Tory government - under the dissolute Prince Regent, George - met calls for change with prison, execution or transportation to the colonies. Dr Cath Feely, from the University of Derby, said: ""These are people who had no control over their lives, either nationally or locally, politically or financially. Many buildings in Pentrich were demolished after the Uprising but St Matthews church escaped ""They faced a double whammy that the old aristocracy owned their homes, while the new industrial class owned their livelihoods. ""And with no welfare safety net, a bad harvest was a matter of life and death."" A network of informers left over from the Napoleonic wars now worked against political groups - some peaceful, some not - creating an atmosphere of insecurity and paranoia. Ned Ludd and the Peterloo Massacre provoked horror from both public and politicians Britain simmered with discontent in the early years of the 19th Century and demands for greater rights led to disputes, destruction and death. Hampden Clubs, named after a leader in the English Civil War, began in 1812 and attracted radical debate but were seen by the authorities as a cover for revolution. Disorder and protests like theSpa Fields riots,externalof 1816 and theBlanketeers,externalof 1817 led to the suspension of basic civil rights, such asHabeas Corpus,external. The most high profile group was theLuddites,external, named after the mythical Ned Ludd, who from 1811 to 1816 smashed the cloth-making machinery they felt was being used to drive down craftsmen's wages. The establishment was shaken - at one point more troops were deployed to deal with Luddites than Wellington had to fight Napoleon. Repression turned to murder in 1819 when cavalry rode down a peaceful reform meeting in Manchester, killing 18, in what became known as thePeterloo Massacre,external. A plan to murder the prime minister and his cabinet in 1820, theCato Street Conspiracy,external, led to the execution of five men. One of these informers, William J Richards - known as Oliver - became the catalyst for events. Pentrich historian,externalSylvia Mason said: ""Oliver was pulled out of debtors' prison on the proviso he would spy for the government. ""He was paid on results, so he created those results."" A cartoon had Oliver (centre, orange coat) given honours for his work - to the dismay of John Bull In early 1817 in Derbyshire he met political firebrands Thomas Bacon and Jeremiah Brandreth. Despite objections, Oliver persuaded them ""half the country"" was ready to rise. Brandreth held meetings in a Pentrich inn, calling for a march on Nottingham, insisting they would be paid and fed. All the whileOliver kept the authorities informed,external. Ms Mason said: ""The government as good as organised it - they named the day in documents and showed they were planning it from 1815. ""They were afraid a real uprising was coming so they allowed the Pentrich men to march so they could be arrested as used as scapegoats."" On 9 June, up to 400 rebels armed with farming tools and old hunting guns set off for nearby Ripley. The rebels were blocked at Butterley Works and its hexagonal gatehouse survives on the derelict site The weather was foul and Brandreth led them in songs to raise their spirits; ""The time is come you plainly see, the government opposed must be."" Dr Feely said: ""Their demands were vague; a cancellation of the national debt, some calls for a provisional government. ""But most were focused on fairer wages and protection for their livelihoods."" Demands for food and drink led to fights and at one house a servant was shot and killed, apparently by accident. The 15th Light Dragoons, veterans of the Napoleonic wars, were stationed in the East Midlands They slogged on through the day and overnight but the death, the weather, the lukewarm public reaction and the failure to seize new weapons in Ripley saw numbers dwindle. As the remaining men approached Eastwood on the outskirts of Nottingham on the morning of 10 June, two magistrates, accompanied by soldiers, blocked the way. Without a shot being fired, the marchers fled. Despite this, some newspapers reported hundreds of well armed men on the rampage. Retribution was well planned. Dozens were imprisoned, the ringleaders found over the coming months. The block on which the men were beheaded is preserved in Derby's Pickford House museum The trial that followed was, according to many, deeply flawed. The main jury was made up of landowners and factory bosses, who would feel most threatened by the marchers. Oliver, already unmasked and widely criticised, was kept hidden away. Bacon's guilty plea - in return for no death penalty - meant no trial, which further hid the agent's role. Brandreth, with lieutenants William Turner and Isaac Ludlam, were sentenced to their grisly fates. Six thousand people, guarded by troops with drawn swords, watched. Turner's last words were: ""This is all old Oliver and the government."" After being hanged until they were dead, the men were beheaded with an axe, thus achieving the highly dubious distinction of being the last to suffer this punishment in England. Jeremiah Brandreth's swarthy looks and lack of contrition made him the focus of attention Fourteen others were deported to Australia and six jailed in England but dozens were released on bail. Dr Feely said: ""The authorities knew it was coming and saw it as an opportunity to make an example of such people - hence the harsh sentences. ""But the executions, and the scandal of Oliver's role, provoked huge debate and were used by the opposition Whig party to call for change. ""Pentrich highlighted the repressive nature of government and the need for reformers to work together."" Oliver left for South Africa, never to return. A Reform Act, which abolished corrupt constituencies, gave MPs to industrial cities and expanded who could vote, was passed in 1832. Two years later all the Pentrich marchers were pardoned. Ms Mason said: ""This is one of the stepping stones to us getting votes, both for men and women, for equal right and trade unions. ""This helped get rights for the working class, for the most oppressed.""

"The Conservative Party is in talks with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) about a deal to gain its support on certain votes in Parliament. Parts of the discussions are expected to involve funding for Northern Ireland. How much government money already goes there? HM Treasury,externalbreaks down public spending between Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Only about 88% of government spending may be divided in this way, the remaining 12% is on things like defence, which are counted in the statistics as benefiting everyone in the UK equally. Northern Ireland has more of the identifiable spending per head than Scotland and Wales, receiving 21% more than the UK as a whole. Next in line comes Scotland, which is 16% above the average and Wales at 10% above. England spends 3% per head below the overall UK figure. The figures include spending by devolved administrations as well as UK government departments. There are some differences between what counts as public spending - for example, water supply counts as being in the public sector in Scotland and Northern Ireland but in the private sector in England and Wales. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) hasrecently published experimental statistics,externalon the distribution of public spending throughout the UK, which also found that Northern Ireland had the highest per person funding. The UK is a net contributor, but if you look at how EU structural and investment funds aredistributed among the nations,,externalWales comes out on top by a long way, with 142 euros (Â£126) per person per year. Northern Ireland receives 57 euros (Â£50) per person, which is 58% above the UK average of 36 euros (Â£32). While England gets the most funding overall with 1.5bn euros (Â£1.3bn) a year, it gets the lowest amount per person at 28 euros (Â£25).

"Once again the polls, taken as a whole, were not a good guide to the election result. Over the course of the campaign the gap between the main two parties narrowed but, with one exception, the final polls all suggested a clearer Conservative lead than the actual outcome. Having said that, it wasn't an unmitigated disaster. Every poll throughout the campaign put the Conservatives ahead - and that was indeed the result. The final polls were fairly accurate about the Conservative and Lib Dem shares. It was Labour where they were uniformly wrong. They also overestimated UKIP and the SNP. Survation were closest to the actual result. Kantar Public's numbers were also reasonably good. YouGov's final poll, like most of the others, seriously underestimated Labour. Prior to that, they had been suggesting a closer race. They also had a separate seat projection model which had been indicating a hung parliament. That had been met with a lot of scepticism but, with hindsight, was pretty accurate. In the final weeks of the campaign, the polls were often criticised for being ""all over the place"". It's true that they were pointing to very different outcomes. BBC Election Live - rolling text and video updates Quick guide to what's going on Kuenssberg: PM survives first bout of battle for control That variation clearly made it difficult to interpret what they were saying. It's surely better, though, that they had different numbers than that they were all wrong in exactly the same way. If you're looking for consistent accuracy then opinion polls are probably not for you. Pollsters are also sometimes accused of herding - deliberately manipulating their figures so they all say the same thing. That accusation can't be levelled at this election. In 2015 the polls went wrong because their samples were not representative of the electorate - they contained too many Labour voters. They also failed to estimate the difference in turnout rates between different age groups - they overestimated turnout among young voters. The pollsters who were furthest from the actual result this time were those, like ICM and ComRes, who had taken the strongest measures to try to rectify the problem from 2015. Survation made no significant changes to their methodology and came out on top. It looks as though the errors this time were caused, at least in part, by fighting the last war. We'll never know the exact figures for turnout among young voters - it's a secret ballot remember - but YouGov's post-election estimate puts it at 57% for 18-19 year olds and 59% for 20-24 year olds. That's lower than for older voters but considerably higher than estimates for young voters in 2015. We can also see that the places where the number of voters increased the most were generally those with young populations. The assumption made by some pollsters that young turnout would continue to under-perform was probably wrong.

"This video can not be played 'Jihadi Jack' travelled from Oxford to Syria A 21-year-old man from Oxford, who travelled to the Islamic State-controlled area of Syria in 2014, has told the BBC he is now being held by Kurdish forces fighting the group. Jack Letts, dubbed ""Jihadi Jack"", is suspected of going to Syria to fight for so-called Islamic State. But he claims he is opposed to IS and has left that area. Mr Letts spoke to BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford via text and voice messages. Speaking about leaving IS-controlled territory, Mr Letts said: ""I found a smuggler and walked behind him through minefields."" He said he and the smuggler ""eventually made it near a Kurdish point where we were shot at twice and slept in a field"". He said he is now in solitary confinement in a jail in Kurdish-held north-east Syria. Mr Letts converted to Islam while at Cherwell comprehensive school in Oxford. He travelled to Jordan, aged 18, in 2014, having dropped out of his A-levels. By the autumn of that year he was in IS-controlled territory in Syria. His family deny he went there to fight and instead say he was motivated by humanitarian reasons. He married in Iraq and now has a child. He told the BBC he had been injured in an explosion and had gone to Raqqa, the de facto capital of IS in Syria, to recuperate. He claimed he became disillusioned with the group about a year ago after it killed its former supporters. ""I hate them more than the Americans hate them,"" he said. ""I realised they were not upon the truth so they put me in prison three times and threatened to kill me."" He claimed he had escaped from low-security detention and had been in hiding when he managed to find a people smuggler to take him out. His parents have pleadednot guilty to charges of funding terrorismafter being accused of sending cash to their son. John Letts and Sally Lane told the BBC that, having not heard from their son for several weeks, they suddenly received a message saying he was in a safe zone. ""It was the news we've been waiting for for three years - ever since he went out there - and now we just want to get him home,"" said Ms Lane. They believe their son is not being treated badly but are concerned about his mental health. Neither they or the BBC have heard from him since 1 June. Mr Letts' parents are calling on the British authorities to do ""whatever they can"" to help him. The government had told them that they could only help if he left IS-controlled territory but now he is out ""no-one wants to take responsibility"", said Ms Lane. Sally Lane and John Letts want the UK government to help their son get out of Syria Mr Letts, an organic farmer, acknowledges that his son ""will have to account for his actions"" once he returns to Britain, but the family is not convinced ""he has done anything at all"", from what he has told them. ""If he has had anything to with IS I want nothing to do with him,"" said Mr Letts. ""I think there has been so much misinformation, one little piece of information came out and it was manipulated, twisted, as far as I can see,"" said Ms Lane. TheUK government advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq,externaland anumber of peoplewho returned from these areas have been prosecuted. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""As all UK consular services are suspended in Syria and greatly limited in Iraq, it is extremely difficult to confirm the whereabouts and status of British nationals in these areas."" Asked by the BBC why the UK government should help him, Jack said: ""I don't want anyone to help me. ""I'll just chill here in solitary confinement 'til someone decides it's easier to kill me.""

"Theresa May announces judge-led public inquiry into Grenfell Tower tragedy MPs now quizzing minister about response to the tragedy Queen's Speech to take place on Wednesday 21 June Tim Farron is to step down as Lib Dem leader MPs being sworn in to the House of Commons Deal between Tories and DUP delayed because of the tragedy Emma Griffiths Theresa May reshuffles her cabinet after the departures of Priti Patel and Sir Michael Fallon. What is the difference between a free trade area, a single market and a customs union? Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. Empty properties owned by the rich should be used for the homeless of Grenfell Tower, Labour's leader says. The prime minister has released a statement after meeting Northern Ireland's main parties saying agreement can be reached to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont ""if there is good will on all sides"". ""But time is running short and the parties must come together by the 29 June for the return of a strong voice at Stormont and for a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" She said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire would keep talking to the parties ""and if no resolution is reached then we will need to consider what steps we need to take, to ensure Northern Ireland has the political stability it needs"". Devolved government in Northern Ireland broke down in January. Former Labour deputy leader tweets ...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Grenfell Tower disaster was an emergency of such gravity that it had already become a significant issue for the government, at a very volatile time. The priority was to focus on getting help to where it was needed - with the announcement that a scheme to provide extra cash for the council - before getting on with a full public inquiry, which would get going ""pretty soon"". But the handling of such an awful situation was very risky for politicians and uncomfortable truths could emerge from the public inquiry. ""Potentially, some people expect, it may well show that not just this government but previous governments have simply not done enough to make sure this kind of housing is safe,"" she said.     The Grenfell Tower block disaster has again been dominating the news agenda. Here's a round-up of the latest developments on this and other political stories today: The Lib Dems have warned the Conservatives they ""cannot go from weak and wobbly to business as usual"" after the government announced formal Brexit negotiations will begin on Monday. Lib Dem MP Alistair
Carmichael said: If the government cannot even secure a deal with the DUP, how on earth can they get a deal with the EU? Theresa May must immediately create a cross-party joint cabinet committee to negotiate Brexit. It is the only way to unite the country and strengthen our bargaining power with the EU.â  BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams says his party will oppose any pact between the UK government and the DUP ""that undermines the Good Friday Agreement"". He said all parties in Northern Ireland ""need to be consulted on all of this"". ""A little side bargain to keep Theresa May in power - a temporary little arrangement - won't have any integrity and certainly isn't as important as the needs of the people who live in Ireland and particularly in the north of Ireland,"" he said. Simon Coveney is the new Irish minister for foreign affairs, with special responsibility for Brexit. Mark DevenportBBC News NI Political Editor The DUP Deputy Leader Nigel
Dodds says the setting of a date for the Queen's Speech is separate and not
relevant to his party's discussions over a deal with the Conservatives. Questioned about whether a deal
would be announced before the Queen's speech next Wednesday, Mr Dodds said
there's no deadline for the discussions. Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP
wants to strengthen the UK, deliver Brexit in a proper and sensible manner for
Northern Ireland and spread prosperity around the UK. Asked if the Treasury was ""nitpicking"" over the
financial details, Mr Dodds said he'd seen the reports in the newspapers but
wouldn't comment on speculation. More on the Brexit talks. Formal negotiationswill begin on Monday, the UK and EU say. The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists. The UK is due to leave by the end of March 2019. Labour MP Harriet Harman has been speaking to the BBC after the Westminster Hall session earlier. The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people. She said tower blocks needed to be fitted with sprinklers and questions needed to be asked about whether refurbishing blocks could compromise fire safety - and whether the official ""stay put"" advice for people in burning buildings should be changed. Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay. It's wrong if there is a delay because people are living in thousands of tower blocks all around the country and they need to know the lessons are going to be learned quickly.""  She also said it was up to opposition parties to make sure the government ""doesn't slip off the hook"" in terms of providing resources to make sure buildings are safe. BBC political editor tweets...

"Enthusiastic Remainers have been quick to jump on the election result as their latest opportunity to mould the UK's departure from the EU. The various lobby groups, including former ministers still close to some in government, have been whirring with chatter and tactical planning about how to get their voices heard. There are ideas about commissions or ""neddies"" - groups of advisers from business and all political parties that met in years gone by. Even senior Tories like the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, one of their few success stories at the moment, told us yesterday: ""It can't just be a Tory Brexit."" On first hearing, that is a staggering thing to hear from Tory lips. But before Remainers get swept up in their moment, and their ambitions swell, it's worth pondering what possibly might be on the table - and what might not - given the usual caveats about the unpredictability of what might come next. First off, even Brexit-supporting ministers involved in the process acknowledge that a minority government has to behave differently. Expect therefore a change in tone, a more overtly consensual approach; the government is, for example, more likely to agree opposition attempts to amend its EU legislation without a fight. One cabinet minister told me the government will take a less ideological approach. Some members of cabinet will push for a less rigid stance, urging Theresa May to soften or scrub out her red lines, as the negotiations get under way. Gove says Brexit 'consensus' needed Brexit - what are the options? Guide: Free trade area, single market and customs union But on the fundamental choices? Two well-placed ministers tell me it's hard to see, ""hard to go back on"" the decision that we are leaving the single market. It is likely the government will make more of trying to maximise our access to it. This could mean it will become an equal concern to immigration rather than being a clear rhetorical second. But inasmuch as it is at all possible to take direct readings from the electoral message (and I'm not sure it is given how varied the results were), more than 80% of the public voted for the two main parties, who both promised to leave the single market and end free movement. Woe betide any politician in this climate who is suddenly going to tell the electorate they didn't mean it on immigration. There are hopes in the Remain camp too about the influence of the DUP; their participation in government does not mean suddenly that the government's Brexit plan changes dramatically. While the DUP have their own particular view on Brexit with concern about customs arrangements, they are not ""soft"" Brexiteers who will try to water down the whole thing. They were involved as a party in the Vote Leave campaign and while they will push their strong view on the border and customs arrangement, they are not suddenly going to be arguing for only a tiny loosening of the links. It is worth remembering too that even with the DUP and this week's promises of support, having been cut down to size, Theresa May is even more vulnerable to her powerful Eurosceptic backbenchers than before the election. The arithmetic means she has to listen to other parties more, but she also has less ballast to fend off her own MPs. One former minister told me ""it'd only take me and a couple of my mates to defeat her"". Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance Katya Adler: What does result mean for Brexit? Brexit and austerity hit Tories - Barwell It is easy to argue today for a grand-sounding Brexit Commission to bring all parties in. It could be a political tool for Theresa May to form a mechanism for appearing to be listening to all. The idea is not quite being denied or really encouraged in government. And insiders are well aware of how such ideas can prove pointless. There is already, for example, the committee that's meant to discuss the Brexit situation for the four nations. Few people who have been close to that process argue it's achieved much at all. And years of arguing for an NHS commission haven't got far at all. The government, although it was considered by David Cameron, did not in the end, trust Labour enough to take up the call. Theresa May doesn't trust easily. It wouldn't really be in keeping with her style to dramatically reach out to the other parties in a formal way. In truth it is also not that clear the Labour leadership would really want that kind of role. But the reality of the parliamentary numbers means she is forced to take other opinions into consideration, or her government falls. There will no doubt be arguments about how it's done, whether a new process is introduced or not. It is just as likely the government and opposition whips are about to get to know each other much much better. But ""cross-party working"" - otherwise known as clipping your wings - however it's done, will be a feature of life under Mrs May. Remember she is not just more vulnerable to the opposition, but on her own side too.

"Charlie Gard's rare disease has left him unable to cry The parents of a terminally-ill baby have been given more time to put forward a legal case that he should be allowed to go to the US for treatment. Life-support for Charlie Gard must continue until midnight on Monday, the European Court of Human Rights ruled. The 10-month old has a rare genetic condition and brain damage, and doctors want to stop his life support. The Strasbourg court made the interim ruling pending a full legal application by the family's lawyers. His parents launched their latest challenge after losing a UK Supreme Court appeal. Charlie has been in intensive care since October last year. He has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a condition which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. His doctors have said Charlie cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow. Specialists said therapy proposed by a doctor in the US was experimental and would not help. A High Court judge in April ruled against a trip to America and in favour of Great Ormond Street doctors. Mr Justice Francis concluded that life support treatment should end and said Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. Connie Yates and Chris Gard have raised more than Â£1.3m for treatment in the US Three Court of Appeal judges upheld that ruling in May and three Supreme Court justices on Thursday dismissed a further challenge by the couple. On Monday, parents Chris Gard and Connie Yates, from Bedfont, west London, shared a photo of Charlie with his eyes open.

"This video can not be played There was a heavy police presence at UnterfÃ¶hring S-Bahn station in Munich A 26-year-old policewoman is fighting for her life after being shot in the head when a man grabbed a police gun at a suburban station in Munich. She shot back, wounding the gunman lightly. He is now in custody. Police said it was not a terrorist incident. Two bystanders were seriously hurt; one shot in the arm and one in the leg. A police team responded to reports of a brawl on a busy train and the man tried to push a policeman in front of an approaching train. In the ensuing struggle, he managed to get hold of a police gun and fired at least five shots, wounding the female officer and two bystanders. Despite her severe injuries, she managed to shoot him back. He fled the scene but was captured shortly afterwards. Police said one of the things they would attempt to find out through questioning was how he managed to bypass the security features on the gun. It happened at UnterfÃ¶hring S-Bahn station in the north of the city. The two bystanders are being treated in hospital for injuries that are not life-threatening. Police said the attacker was a 37-year-old German man, born in Bavaria, with no registered address. The state prosecutor said his previous criminal record consisted only of possession of a small amount of cannabis, but that he would now be charged with attempted murder. Police were quick to the scene He was ""motivated by personal reasons"" and acted alone, police spokesman Marcus da Gloria Martins said. Police said there was no further danger to the public. The S-Bahn line passing through UnterfÃ¶hring is one of the main routes to Munich airport. In May 2016 a man killed a commuter and injured three others in aknife attack at Grafing railway stationnear Munich. The man had run amok and was later found to be mentally ill.

"Former chancellor George Osborne has urged the government not to change its economic strategy after being left without a Commons majority. Mr Osborne'snewspaper editorial said,externala so-called ""end to austerity"" would lead to a ""loss of economic credibility"". Earlier Michael Gove, the new environment secretary, said ministers had to listen to public concern about how services are funded. The Tories need Democratic Unionist Party support to stay in power. BBC Election Live - rolling text and video updates Quick guide to what's going on Gove says Brexit 'consensus' needed The DUP is committed to lobbying for extra cash for public services in Northern Ireland and promised in its manifesto to ""resist any assault"" on universal benefits and to maintain the ""triple lock"" on pensions which Theresa May planned to scale back before the election. It also opposes the so-called bedroom tax and wants to abolish air passenger duty and cut VAT for tourism businesses. The Tories lost their majority after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who based his campaign on ending austerity, defied predictions and gained 30 seats. Former MP Gavin Barwell, who lost his marginal seat, told Panorama Labour had ""tapped into"" concerns about the impact of years of public sector pay freezes. Mr Barwell has since been appointed as Mrs May's chief of staff. This video can not be played Gavin Barwell on the reasons for his defeat Mr Osborne, who implemented deep spending cuts during his six years in the Treasury, abandoned his bid to restore government finances to a surplus by 2020 shortly before leaving office. His deficit reduction targets have been relaxed by his successor Philip Hammond. An editorial in the London Evening Standard, which he edits, said: ""Talk of 'an end to austerity' is code for 'we're going to allow the deficit to rise, and we don't care'. ""That would risk repeating the mistakes of the past that led Britain to the point where there was, in the words of that Treasury letter, 'no money left'."" It added: ""The government already has enough on its plate. A loss of economic credibility would make those problems a whole lot worse."" Mr Osborne, who was sacked as chancellor by Mrs May when she became PM, has repeatedly criticised Mrs May since the election result. Asked on the Today programme whether the government could change course, Mr Gove said ministers had to ""reflect on what the election result told us about the way that people want to see the economy managed in the future"". He said there was a need to ensure public spending was kept at a sustainable level but stressed that ""we also need to take account of legitimate public concerns about ensuring that we properly fund public services in the future"". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, Tory MP Dominic Grieve said austerity had been a necessity after the 2008 financial crash, but warned against it becoming ""a state of semi-permanence"". He said the government should not be ""chucking billions of pounds at public services"" and said ""turning the tap on"" on public spending could undermine wealth creation. But he added: ""The question is have the limits of reasonableness been reached with the electorate.""

"The European Union has revealed a draft law to give it the power to move the lucrative euro clearing business out of London and keep it in the EU after Britain leaves the Union in 2019. London currently processes three-quarters of the trade in this financial sector, providing thousands of jobs. But European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis said Brexit needed ""certain adjustments to our rules"". The law will decide if London will have the right to host the work post-Brexit. London is currently the world leader for the clearing of all types of currency-denominated derivatives including the euro. What on earth is euro clearing? Simon Jack: UK complacency over Europe raid Clearing is the process by which a third party organisation acts as the middleman for both buyer and seller of financial contracts tied to the underlying value of a share, index, currency or bond. Trillions of euros are handled through clearing houses every year, mostly through London. In a statement, Mr Dombrovskis said: ""As we face the departure of the largest EU financial centre, we need to make certain adjustments to our rules to ensure that our efforts remain on track."" The financial industry has warned that forced ""relocation"" of the work would split markets, increase trading costs, weaken the euro and threaten the jobs associated with the clearing houses in London. The proposal would split clearing houses into two tiers, determined by whether their operations are considered to be ""systemically important"". If they are not thought to be important, then they will carry on working under the structure of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation. More important ""tier two"" institutions will have to meet extra requirements set by EU central banks, could face ""on-site inspections"" and will have to give ""all relevant information"" to the European Securities and Markets Authority. Those requirements may not be enough for the clearing houses thought to be the most important, which would force their operations back inside the EU. A move like that could affect the clearing house at the London Stock Exchange. The proposals will now go before the European Parliament and the European Union Council. The policy chairman at the City of London Corporation Catherine McGuinness said ""fragmentation"" of foreign exchange and interest rate trading could see firms' costs increasing by ""as much as 20%"". She said the Corporation was also concerned that it could ""increase systemic risk"". ""The UK is the only place that can guarantee financial stability with the lowest possible cost implications,"" she added. Meanwhile, the UK Treasury said: ""How UK firms access EU markets, and vice versa, is a matter for the forthcoming exit negotiations. ""In the meantime we stand ready to engage constructively on this legislation."" What on earth is euro clearing?

"US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday is the biggest thing to hit Washington since, uh, last week. OK, so the sequel tothe James Comey hearingdoesn't have the same build-up as the original, but that doesn't mean that there won't be fireworks - or that the proceedings can't cause new headaches for the Trump administration. In a way, the attorney general's hearing is likely to be a mirror image of Mr Comey's, with Republicans lobbing friendly questions while Democrats sharpen their knives. Here's a look at five pressing questions that Mr Sessions could face. During his confirmation hearings in January, Mr Sessions answered this question with a negative - then had to plead a faulty memory when it was revealed that this was not, shall we say, an accurate account. Russian Ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak Then-Senator Sessions had indeed had two meetings with Mr Kislyak. He visited with the ambassador - who is considered by some to be the top Russian spymaster in the US - around the time of the Republican convention, and he later hosted him in his Senate office. The subsequent disclosure of these meetings led directly to Mr Sessions' March announcementthat he would recuse himself from the Justice Department's investigationinto possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Who is Jeff Sessions? Comey's most revealing moments Michael Flynn: The man at the centre of Trump's Russia crisis How the White House's story on Comey collapsed Now, according to reports,there may have been a third meeting between the two men,external, perhaps before or after then-candidate Trump gave a high-profile foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel on 27 April, 2016. This may have been the ""facts"" that Mr Comey was hinting at during last week's testimony when asked about Mr Sessions. ""He was very close to and inevitably going to recuse himself for a variety of reasons,"" the former FBI director said. ""We also were aware of facts that I can't discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic."" It was one of the more dramatic passages in Mr Comey's written statement last week - his revelation of a meeting in the White House on 14 February where Mr Trump told him he hoped he could let Flynn go. This video can not be played Comey's most revealing moments ""The President signalled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone,"" Mr Comey wrote. ""I stayed in my chair. As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the Attorney General lingered by my chair, but the president thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me."" During his testimony Mr Comey described how he remembered Mr Sessions responding to the request. ""His body language gave me the sense, like, 'What am I going to do?'"" he said. Will Mr Sessions corroborate this account? Does he know anything more about what took place? If so, it could help bolster the contention that the president understood the pressure he planned to put on the then-director in private was improper, at best. Mr Comey wrote in his statement that after the awkward meeting with the president, in which he said that the former national security advisor Michael Flynn was a ""good guy"" but never told the president he would back off the investigation, the director reached out to Mr Sessions to express his concern. ""I took the opportunity to implore the attorney general to prevent any future direct communication between the president and me,"" Mr Comey recalled. ""I told the AG (attorney general) that what had just happened - him being asked to leave while the FBI director, who reports to the AG, remained behind - was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply."" This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe Mr Sessions will have another chance to reply on Tuesday - or challenge the veracity of the former director's testimony - and a great many more people than Mr Comey will be listening. When Mr Comey's firing was announced by the White House, the action was initially explained as the end result of a review process initiated within the Justice Department. This video can not be played Trump says he made the decision to fire Comey - that's not what the White House originally said. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote a memo detailing the then-director's mishandling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server while she was secretary of state. Mr Sessions then forwarded the memo to the president, with his recommendation that Mr Comey be terminated. Mr Trump then accepted conclusion. All that, of course, was blown out of the water when Mr Trump told a television interviewer that he had always planned to fire Mr Comey and that the ongoing Russia investigation was in his mind when he made the decision. Given that Mr Sessions had officially recused himself from his department's Russia probe, the attorney general's involvement in a firing that now appears to have been motivated, at least in part, by Mr Comey's direction of the Russia probe has raised some eyebrows. ""Attorney General Sessions should not have had any involvement in this decision at all,"" Democratic Senator Al Franken of Minnesota said. ""He recused himself. And yet he inserted himself in this firing."" A Justice Department spokesman has pushed back against these allegations in an email statement to the press. ""The recommendation to remove Director Comey was a personnel decision based on concerns about the effectiveness of his leadership as set forth in the Attorney General's letter,"" Sarah Isgur Flores writes. ""The recommendation had nothing to do with the substance of any investigation."" Mr Sessions has the opportunity to add some clarity to the process behind Mr Comey's firing - or seek the protection of executive privilege, claiming that his private conversations with the president are legally shielded from outside scrutiny. Ever since the Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Comey ""better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!"" everyone in the Trump administration, from the president on down, has been asked if they have any knowledge of whether such recordings exist. This video can not be played Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year The president himself has been cryptic, saying last week that he would make an announcement in a ""very short period of time"". ""Oh, you're going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer,"" he added. ""Don't worry."" When asked on Monday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the president had been clear in his statement and he had nothing to add. Mr Sessions probably will be equally unhelpful, but that doesn't mean he won't be asked. And how he responds, even in a denial, could be plenty interesting.

"This video can not be played US student Otto Warmbier said he was ""a poor scapegoat"" before he was jailed in 2016 US student Otto Warmbier has been freed from jail in North Korea, but his parents say he has been in a coma for a year. The 22-year-old was flown to the US and landed in Ohio late on Tuesday. The Warmbier family told US media they had found out only last week that their son has been in a coma since shortly after his trial in March 2016. Mr Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. On arrival in Ohio, he was being taken by ambulance to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, US media reported. Who is Otto Warmbier? Otto Warmbier is an economics student from the University of Virginia, originally from Cincinnati, Ohio. He was in North Korea as a tourist with Young Pioneer Tours when he was arrested on 2 January 2016. He appeared emotional at a news conference a month later, in which he tearfully confessed to trying to take the sign as a ""trophy"" for a US church, adding: ""The aim of my task was to harm the motivation and work ethic of the Korean people."" Foreign detainees in North Korea have previously recanted confessions, saying they were made under pressure. Otto Warmbier's parents feared for his safety as tensions rose between the US and North Korea Aftera short trial on 16 March, Mr Warmbier was given a 15-year prison sentence for crimes against the state. His parents Fred and Cindytold CNN in early May,externalthat they had had no contact with their son for more than a year. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr and Mrs Warmbier said: ""Sadly, he is in a coma and we have been told he has been in that condition since March 2016. We learned of this only one week ago."" They werequoted by the Washington Post,externalas saying they had been told Otto had contracted botulism, a rare illness that causes paralysis, soon after his trial in March 2016. He was given a sleeping pill and had been in a coma ever since, the newspaper said. The US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made no mention of Mr Warmbier's conditionin a statement,,externalsaying only that he was on his way home to be reunited with his family and would not make any further comment, out of respect for the privacy of the family. There are reported to be three other US citizens in custody in North Korea. They are: Kim Dong-chul, a 62-year-old naturalised US citizen born in South Korea, who wassentenced to 10 years hard labourin April 2016 for spying Korean-American professor Kim Sang-duk (or Tony Kim) who was detained in April 2017. The reasons for his arrest are not yet clear Kim Hak-song, like Kim Sang-duk, worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) and wasdetained in May 2017on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" against the state The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining its citizens to use them as pawns in negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme. Kim Dong-chul appeared on North Korea television a month after Otto Warmbier, also giving a tearful confession The arrests have come at a time of heightened tension between North Korea and the US and its regional neighbours. In other news on Tuesday, South Korea said it had found a North Korean drone that had crashed after taking photos of the US-funded Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad),which aims to protect the South from the North's missiles. South Korea's military also reported that a North Korean soldier had defected across the heavily-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a rare occurrence. Mr Warmbier's release comes hours after US basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea. Mr Rodman is a friend of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and has made several visits to the country in recent years. Dennis Rodman was mobbed by the press at Beijing airport en route to Pyongyang There was some speculation that he might plead the case for the American detainees, buten route to North Koreahe told reporters ""my purpose is to actually see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea"". He also said ""I'm just trying to open the door"", and added that he was ""pretty much sure that [US President Trump] is happy with the fact that I am over here trying to accomplish something that we both need"". Mr Trump said in 2013 of Mr Rodman's then visit to North Korea: ""You look at the world, the world is blowing up around us. Maybe Dennis is a lot better than what we have.""

"Charlie Gard's rare disease has left him unable to cry The parents of a terminally-ill baby have been given more time to put forward a legal case that he should be allowed to go to the US for treatment. Life-support for Charlie Gard must continue until midnight on Monday, the European Court of Human Rights ruled. The 10-month old has a rare genetic condition and brain damage, and doctors want to stop his life support. The Strasbourg court made the interim ruling pending a full legal application by the family's lawyers. His parents launched their latest challenge after losing a UK Supreme Court appeal. Charlie has been in intensive care since October last year. He has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a condition which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. His doctors have said Charlie cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow. Specialists said therapy proposed by a doctor in the US was experimental and would not help. A High Court judge in April ruled against a trip to America and in favour of Great Ormond Street doctors. Mr Justice Francis concluded that life support treatment should end and said Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. Connie Yates and Chris Gard have raised more than Â£1.3m for treatment in the US Three Court of Appeal judges upheld that ruling in May and three Supreme Court justices on Thursday dismissed a further challenge by the couple. On Monday, parents Chris Gard and Connie Yates, from Bedfont, west London, shared a photo of Charlie with his eyes open.

"Sense's creator said he does not yet have the answers to all of his customers' questions A sleep-tracking tech start-up founded by a Briton, which was one of Kickstarter's biggest success stories, has collapsed. Hello raised more than $2.4m (Â£1.9m) for its Sense bedroom monitor via the crowdfunding site in 2014, and wenton to attract a further,external$40.5m. Private backers included Singapore's sovereign wealth fund Temasek and Facebook Messenger chief David Marcus. Hello confirmed it would ""soon be shutting down"",via Medium's news site,external. ""The past few months have been incredibly tough, especially on the team of Hello. For that I'm incredibly sorry,"" wrote its chief executive, James Proud. Mr Proud was aged 22 when Sense launched in 2014 ""Hello has been my whole life for five years, and I couldn't have asked for a better group of people to have travelled with."" The product had been on sale for $149. Customers have been told that the company is ""unsure"" whether the online service that supports the hardware will continue to operate - it would need to be acquired by a third-party. But they can export their existing data. Owners have also been advised to request refunds from shops they bought the devices from. However, if they purchased the kit directly from Hello itself, they have been told there will be no way to get their money back. Accordingto the news site Axios,external, Hello had held ""fire-sale talks"" with the fitness tracker specialist Fitbit, but failed to reach a deal. A source close to Hello said that the firm - along with some other hardware developers - had found it more difficult to raise funds in recent months. Sense comprised: an orb that monitored the owner's bedroom a clip that attached to their pillow a mobile phone app The equipment produced a unique score for the previous night's sleep and aimed to wake the owner up at the best point in their sleep cycle. It had gained voice controls in November, in its last major update. The Sense sleep monitor raised nearly as much on Kickstarter as the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset Mr Proud - who was born in London - gave up plans to go to university to create the gadget and moved to California after receiving a grant from Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who co-created PayPal and now acts as an adviser to President Trump. The Briton had originally planned to create a wearable sleep-tracking gadget. But he switched focus to create a table-top device after deciding that this would make customers more likely to keep using it. ""We spend a third of our day [asleep],"" he told the BBC in 2014, ""It's the most critical part of the day."" He managed to attract money from other big name backers, including ex-Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo, Facebook's virtual reality vice-president Hugo Barra and Spotify's head of special projects, Shakil Khan. But Sense struggled against competition from bigger brands, including Withing's Aura sleep-tracking alarm clock and Fitbit's sleep-tracking wristwear. In addition, Apple acquired another rival, Beddit. ""Kickstarter can give you a good basis to get your product off the ground and an awful lot of PR, but translating that into a successful commercial product is difficult,"" said Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight tech consultancy. ""Going to the next level, finding more funding and getting backing - or a takeover offer - from a big company is often the lifeline that these companies need to keep going."" The failure has not deterred another British entrepreneur currently using Kickstarter to raise funds for a new sleep-tracking device. Circadia has developed both a table-top sleep tracker and a separate lamp Fares Siddiqui has alreadysecured more than $100,000 for Circadia,external, and hopes to distinguish his product by selling an add-on Smart Therapy Lamp designed to ""tune"" users' body clocks. ""The market is too saturated now with products that just do tracking, and people want to be able to do something about how they sleep,"" he told the BBC.

"Cristiano Ronaldo playing for Real Madrid during the Champions League final Spanish prosecutors have accused the Real Madrid footballer Cristiano Ronaldo of defrauding the authorities of millions of euros in tax. The prosecutor's office in Madrid says it has filed a lawsuit against the Portuguese player. He is accused of evading tax of 14.7m euros (Â£13m; $16m) from 2011 to 2014. In a statement, representatives of the world's highest paid footballer said there had never been concealment, or the slightest intention to conceal. ""It is clear that the football player did not try to evade taxes,"" Ronaldo's Gestifute management company said. It said that the footballer had not hidden any income from the tax authorities or defrauded Spain. Real Madrid laterreleased a statement,externalsaying it had ""full confidence"" in its player, who had always complied with his obligations and would prove his total innocence. Ronaldo had previously said he was not worried about tax investigations as he had nothing to hide. On this occasion he is accused of knowingly using a ""business structure"" to hide income made from his image rights. In December, leaked documents suggested that Ronaldo had avoided tax on income allegedly held in offshore accounts - allegations he also denied. When asked about that investigation at the time, he told a journalist from Portuguese public broadcaster RTP that ""he who owes nothing has nothing to fear."" Ronaldo is the world's highest-paid sportsperson for the second successive year, according to Forbes' annual list of the world's wealthiest people. He earned $93m (Â£72m) from salary, bonuses and endorsements last year.

"Two leading cabinet ministers have said that the UK will not remain in the single market or customs union during the transitional period planned for immediately after leaving the European Union. The UK government is now set to spell out its aims for new customs arrangements. But what is the difference between a free trade area, single market and a customs union? You can be in the EU's Single Market, but not the EU, this is what Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein do. The European Union's single market is perhaps the most ambitious type of trade co-operation. That's because as well as eliminating tariffs, quotas or taxes on trade, it also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. That is why there has been no limit on the number of French people who can come to the UK, or the number of British people who can live in Spain - but there are limits on Turks or Ukrainians, for example. Also, a single market strives to remove so-called ""non-tariff barriers"" - different rules on packaging, safety and standards and many others are abolished and the same rules and regulations apply across the area. There are EU-wide regulations covering a whole host of industries and products on everything from food standards and the use of chemicals to working hours and health and safety. It is an attempt to create a level playing field and a single market; this does not happen in a free trade zone. A customs union means the Ireland/Northern Ireland border would remain open and easy to cross For goods, the single market was largely completed in 1992, but the market for services remains a work in progress a quarter of a century later. The EU has promised to introduce it many times, but several countries have dragged their feet and it is much more complicated than creating a single market for say, cars or computers. Even so, the City of London dominates financial services in the EU not least because it can do business in every member country. The EU is therefore not just a free trade area - it is a single market. But to stay in the single market, countries have to allow the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. That last one means immigration is difficult if not impossible to control - although the UK might get a special deal to allow some limits. Membership of the single market also normally involves making annual payments towards the EU's budget and accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which would cross quite a few red lines for many Brexiteers. Turkey is part of a customs union with the EU but not in the single market. The deal does not cover food or agriculture, services or government procurement. The EU is not only a single market - it is also a customs union. The countries club together and agree to apply the same tariffs to goods from outside the union. Once goods have cleared customs in one country, they can be shipped to others in the union without further tariffs being imposed. If the UK left the Customs Union but stayed in the Single market, our exporters would  have to contend with what are called 'rules of origin'. These rules are designed to demonstrate that goods that legally originated in the UK - and did not contain more than the maximum permitted level of parts and components from elsewhere - qualify for duty-free entry into the EU. Fish factor That could be complicated for many companies that import components from around the world to put into finished products made in the UK. Some industries, such as fisheries, could be exempted from a free trade area depending on negotiations Also services are a huge part of the British economy, 78%, and are not totally covered by a customs union because they tend to face ""non tariff"" barriers. Still the UK could opt to leave the single market but stay in the customs union, but that does mean it couldn't negotiate free trade deals with other countries, the EU does that. It might also mean paying money to the EU and accepting ECJ judgements when they relate to trade and it is unlikely to cover farm produce or fish since the UK would not be in the Common Agricultural Policy or Common Fisheries Policy. A customs union does however have one big advantage, it means the Ireland/Northern Ireland border would remain open and easy to cross. If we left both the single market and the customs union we could negotiate a free  trade deal with the EU. A free trade area is one where there are no tariffs or taxes or quotas on goods and/or services from one country entering another. The negotiations to establish them can take years and there are normally exceptions. So agriculture and fisheries might be exempted, certain industries protected and some goods may not be covered. Services like banking and education also pose a problem in many free trade deals, as the barrier to trading services are not normally tariffs, but so called non-tariff barriers like different rules, standards and qualifications. So the negotiations can be very long and complicated and the result can still leave many barriers to trade. The UK is Ireland's biggest trading partner There is a free trade zone in Europe and we helped to create it: EFTA, the European Free Trade Association. It counts Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as members, but they now have a very close relationship with the EU; all but Switzerland are part of the single market. The EU also has free trade arrangements with many other countries around the world; so it is not against negotiating one with the UK in principle, but compared with staying in the single market or the customs union this would be the ""hardest"" form of Brexit. It would also almost certainly mean border controls including between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

"Police said they were called to the school by the boy A teenage boy has been arrested after a shotgun and ammunition were seized at a Warwickshire secondary school. The boy called police to Higham Lane School on Shanklin Drive, Nuneaton, at 09:15 BST on Tuesday. He was arrested on suspicion of being in possession of a firearm. One family of a pupil at the school said they had been ""petrified"". Officers stayed for the rest of the day to reassure pupils, Warwickshire Police said.

"This video can not be played There was a heavy police presence at UnterfÃ¶hring S-Bahn station in Munich A 26-year-old policewoman is fighting for her life after being shot in the head when a man grabbed a police gun at a suburban station in Munich. She shot back, wounding the gunman lightly. He is now in custody. Police said it was not a terrorist incident. Two bystanders were seriously hurt; one shot in the arm and one in the leg. A police team responded to reports of a brawl on a busy train and the man tried to push a policeman in front of an approaching train. In the ensuing struggle, he managed to get hold of a police gun and fired at least five shots, wounding the female officer and two bystanders. Despite her severe injuries, she managed to shoot him back. He fled the scene but was captured shortly afterwards. Police said one of the things they would attempt to find out through questioning was how he managed to bypass the security features on the gun. It happened at UnterfÃ¶hring S-Bahn station in the north of the city. The two bystanders are being treated in hospital for injuries that are not life-threatening. Police said the attacker was a 37-year-old German man, born in Bavaria, with no registered address. The state prosecutor said his previous criminal record consisted only of possession of a small amount of cannabis, but that he would now be charged with attempted murder. Police were quick to the scene He was ""motivated by personal reasons"" and acted alone, police spokesman Marcus da Gloria Martins said. Police said there was no further danger to the public. The S-Bahn line passing through UnterfÃ¶hring is one of the main routes to Munich airport.

"Angela Wrightson suffered more than 70 separate slash injuries and 54 blunt-force injuries Two girls who murdered a vulnerable woman led ""chaotic lives"" and were known to social services for drinking, running away and taking drugs, a report has concluded. Angela Wrightson, 39, wassubjected to a seven-hour attackin her Hartlepool home by the pair, then aged 13 and 14. Serious case reviews revealed multiple failures by officials but concluded the murder could not have been prevented. But they found the girls' parents were unwilling to accept parenting help. Ms Wrightson was beaten with a shovel, a TV, a coffee table and a stick studded with screws during the attack in 2014. Latest updates on this story Both girls, who were not named in court because of their age. werejailed for a minimum of 15 years in April last year. Three separate reports tell of ""overly optimistic"" care services, a failure to address poor parenting and an ""insufficient understanding"" of neglect. The two girls returned to Ms Wrightson's home in the early hours of 9 December, where they would continue the attack The reports found the younger of the two girls, referred to in the report as ""Yasmine"", was subjected to physical and emotional abuse by her parents. But they concluded officials were too ready to accept her mother's claims she was disruptive because she had been ""spoilt"". by Bethan Bell, BBC News The reports stop short of allocating blame - but there is no doubt parental neglect emerges as a root cause of what happened that terrible night. Angela Wrightson, ""Olivia"" and ""Yasmine"" all had difficult backgrounds. Ms Wrightson's chronic alcoholism was said to have stemmed from an unhappy and traumatic childhood spent in different care homes. The times she had felt the happiest and safest were those times when she was in prison. She was vulnerable and lonely. Olivia had a fractured, abusive and unstable upbringing. One of six sisters with different fathers, drug and alcohol abuse and physical violence were common in both her mother's and father's homes. She once returned to a care home with a black eye caused by her mother. The report highlighted a time when aged 12, Olivia had been in a serious car accident. She had to spend two weeks in hospital.  Her father, on the one occasion he visited, was ""unsupportive and complaining of the trouble she had caused him"". Her mother did not visit at all. Yasmine's parents abrogated all responsibility for her. The review described their parenting as ""hostile, physically abusive and blaming"". Both had alcohol problems and a history of domestic violence. They showed no insight into how their behaviour could affect their daughter. At a meeting with social services, her mother said: ""Yasmine has hurt me so much, it will be hard to forgive her."" At the time, Yasmine was 12. It is perhaps not surprising that both girls sought comfort in aggression, roaming the streets and drinking. Both Olivia's parents refused to take part in her Serious Case Review. Ms Wrightson's mother refused to engage in the Safeguarding Adult Review. The friendship that ended in murder A chaotic life and brutal death Can children be natural born killers? The girls dropped a TV on Angela Wrightson's head Report writers said the older girl, referred to in the report as ""Olivia"", had a chaotic home life and was placed into care after her mother claimed she was ""going to parties, possibly having sexual intercourse and hitting"" younger siblings. The younger girl also confessed to a care worker that she had spent a weekend drinking and smoking cannabis with friends, and had spent a night with a boy, but denied any sexual activity. Two months before the murder, the older girl was arrested for assaulting three members of staff and causing damage to the premises. The reports into both teenagers found their parents were quick to criticise their daughters' behaviour, but unwilling to accept help to improve their parenting. About the younger girl's parents, the report stated: ""They blamed Yasmine for their inability to be warm and caring to her."" Of the older girl, it said: ""When the reviewer visited Olivia in prison, she expressed her feelings that she had always been held responsible for the family problems, both by her parents and, she felt, by professionals."" Ms Wrightson, a known alcoholic, bought cider shortly before being battered to death Ms Wrightson, who was known locally as ""Alco Ange"", had also received a high level of intervention from social services. The report found she had received help for alcohol addiction, but that it ceased in 2011. Between January 2012 and her death, Ms Wrightson made 219 calls to the police with another 253 made by people about her. The 39-year-old's body was discovered by her landlord at the property in Stephen Street There were also reports of her being ""bothered"" by young people whom she was too afraid to take formal action against due to a previous ""serious"" altercation with a teenager. ""There was growing evidence in 2014 that (Ms Wrightson) was being targeted by young people and adults,"" the report said. It concluded there was a lack of awareness among various agencies about how she should be treated and best helped. Because officials did not fully speak to each other, the ""fullest picture of [Ms Wrightson's] experience and risk"" was not complete. Her family has said they want to see her situation treated with the same seriousness as domestic abuse. The report said: ""[The family] say the number of vulnerable adults whose homes are taken over and who suffer regular abuse are unknown, yet there is no law making this type of home invasion illegal."" Niece Rachel Tressider said they hoped to launch ""Angie's Law"" to protect vulnerable people against harassment, bullying, torment and extortion. She said: ""This is what she went through. In the report it said she was 'home jacked' by two females who used her property... without her permission. ""It's an horrendous thing, a very serious thing, [it's] not recognised and it needs to be, and that's where Angie's Law would come in."" The older girl was encouraged to use drawing as a way to channel her anger. This picture was found in her room after her arrest The report into Ms Wrightson made five findings calling for better communication between agencies, increased awareness of mental health issues and improved connection between children's and adult's services. The reviews about the girls made six, including the need for improved understanding of the effect of neglect on adolescents and removing a ""tendency to sympathise with parents, leaving emotional abuse unidentified and children vulnerable to continued abuse"". Dave Pickard, the chairman of Hartlepool Safeguarding Children Board, said there was ""a very difficult balance"" between keeping children with their families and putting them into care. He said: ""Both families received a great deal of support and guidance from a consistent, caring and hard-working group of professionals. ""Neither girl had any history of violent offences, although they were, at times, angry, abusive, hostile to those around them. ""There is considerable evidence [they] experienced abuse and neglect which had had an impact on their wellbeing and behaviour. ""Although we have learnt lessons about how we understand adolescent neglect more broadly and the likely trauma it creates, we cannot predict how this will manifest itself on a daily basis or how it might interact negatively with other factors. ""These issues are beyond professional control.""

"This video can not be played Ms Foster said she would not 'negotiate over the airwaves' The Democratic Unionist Party leader has said she hopes to seal a deal on supporting Theresa May's minority government ""sooner rather than later"". After meeting the prime minister in Downing Street, Arlene Foster said discussions were ""going well"" and she hoped for a ""successful conclusion"". The BBC understands a final meeting to approve the deal is set for Wednesday. But ex-Conservative PM Sir John Major said he was ""dubious"" about the idea and its impact on the peace process. The Conservatives are having to rely on the support of 10 DUP MPs after they fell eight seats short of winning an overall majority at the general election. But Sir John told BBC Radio 4's World at One that if the party ""locked"" itself into a deal with one of the main parties in Northern Ireland, there was a danger the government would no longer be seen as an ""impartial honest broker"" in restoring the power-sharing arrangements and upholding NI institutions. BBC Election Live - rolling text and video updates Quick guide to what's going on Peace in Northern Ireland should ""not be regarded as a given"", said Sir John - whose government laid the foundations for the peace process in the 1990s -  and nothing should be done to ""exaggerate the differences"" between the unionist and nationalist communities. This video can not be played I am ""concerned"" about a deal with the DUP, says former prime minister Sir John Major He urged Theresa May to consider governing on her own, saying this would not ""carry the baggage"" for the Conservatives that an arrangement with the DUP would. Sir John suggested the DUP would be asking for money and that would be seen as the ""government paying cash for votes in Parliament"", and would be received badly in other parts of the UK. The agreement with the DUP is expected to be very different to the coalition deal agreed between the Conservatives and Lib Dems in 2010, with DUP politicians not getting cabinet jobs and their support for the majority of new legislation to be determined on a vote-by-vote basis. Asked about Sir John's comments during a trip to Paris, Mrs May said she was ""absolutely steadfast"" in her support for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement - which created the Northern Ireland Assembly - and efforts to revive the power-sharing executive. Mrs May, who has been holding talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on counter-terrorism and Brexit, said the ""productive"" talks with the DUP were about ""giving stability to the UK government that is necessary at this critical time"" ahead of the start of the Brexit process. Bercow: I'm a Speaker 'for testing times' May to meet Macron for anti-terror talks The clock's ticking, EU warns UK Reality Check: Has election changed EU views of Brexit? Conservative sources said ""constructive"" progress had been made in the talks and both sides were ""working carefully through the paperwork"" to complete the deal. Mrs Foster told the BBC areas being discussed including Brexit, counter-terrorism and ""doing what's right for Northern Ireland in respect of economic matters"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the DUP was likely to demand money for investment in Northern Ireland and an end to austerity. This video can not be played ""At least someone got a landslide"" - the PM's comment was met with laughter Sinn Fein, whose seven MPs will not take their seats in Westminster, said any deal must be approved by the Northern Ireland executive when it is back up and running. ""Any agreement reached with the DUP - financial or otherwise - cannot be to the detriment of anyone else in our society,"" said Belfast West MP Paul Maskey. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? Who is Arlene Foster? What won't be in the Queen's Speech? Earlier in the Commons, as MPs gathered for the first time since the election, Jeremy Corbyn congratulated Mrs May on ""returning as PM"" and said he ""looked forward to this Parliament, however short it may be"". The Labour leader joked that he welcomed the prospect of a Queen's Speech once this ""coalition of chaos has been negotiated"", but said if this did not happen, he was ""ready to offer strong and stable leadership in the national interest"". Mrs May has chaired the first meeting of the cabinet since the election and has been finalising her reshuffle, with changes including Steve Baker, a leading backbench Brexiteer, becoming a minister in the Department for Exiting The EU. The move was welcomed by Conservative commentators, but the Lib Dems said far from ""softening her stance"" on Brexit after the inconclusive election result, the PM had put a ""fox in charge of guarding the hen house"".

"As Theresa May negotiates with the Democratic Unionist Party after losing her Commons majority in last week's general election, has the view of Brexit changed in key EU capitals? The official French line, as articulated by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, is that the UK election will make little difference to the Brexit talks. The tone may change, he said, but otherwise we will be proceeding as before. Inevitably though, there is speculation about what Theresa May's rebuff by the electorate will mean. How will it change the negotiating stance of the UK team in Brussels? Has the prime minister decided to ease back on her ""hard Brexit"" preference, to take account of the vote? Or will political weakness now leave her even more prey to Tory hardliners? For the conservative newspaper Le Figaro: ""The elections have left the UK without either a consensus on the objectives of Brexit, or a political mandate to bring it about."" The juxtaposition of the UK and French legislative elections also leaves - for the French - a rare feeling of glee. That's because the conclusion from the results is inescapable: while the UK seems increasingly mired in division and political chaos, France under Emmanuel Macron and his likely massive majority has never looked so full of potential. How President Macron chooses to play this in his talks later on Tuesday with Theresa May remains to be seen. He is a charming Anglophile who approves of free markets and understands the City. So he will not bite. On the other hand, he is also emerging as the champion of a newly invigorated EU. And for many who support him in that endeavour, the removal of the UK from the European scene is no longer to be regarded as a disaster, but an opportunity. He himself has spoken of Brexit as a crime - but now that it is happening his policy is no concessions. ""It is Britain who will lose the most,"" he said before he became president. President Macron wants to see the UK suffer - not for the sake of punishment, but for the sake of the EU. He wants to make it clear that leaving the EU comes at a cost, because the EU needs to be preserved and reinforced as a political project. So there can be no special arrangements for London. He will say this clearly and forcefully, and - unlike Theresa May - with the conviction of a man with a mandate. This morning, as a politically hamstrung Theresa May dealt with the fallout from her disastrous election, Angela Merkel (comfortably cushioned by solid approval ratings) congratulated Emmanuel Macron on his success at the polls this weekend. And a few hours later, as British press and politicians squabbled and speculated about what kind of Brexit might now follow, the German government quietly reconfirmed its intention to poach the London-based European Banking Authority and European medicine regulator in the wake of Britain's departure. As Mrs May tries to rebuild cabinet and career, her European neighbours have construction projects of their own. The Germans and the French are planning an EU defence fund, closer co-operation - a new future for Europe without Britain. Of all of the EU member states, Germany was arguably the most saddened by the loss of its political and economic ally when the UK voted to leave. The government looked on again in horror as Theresa May gambled and lost. But German pragmatism prevails. Angela Merkel has made it known she expects Britain to honour its promise to begin exit negotiations a week today. Theresa May has said she'll stick to the timetable. There's a degree of concern here. Many doubt she'll remain in post long enough to see the divorce through. Those with more confidence fear there'll be little room for compromise on the part of a weakened PM. Most expect delays at the least. ""It's the worst possible outcome,"" lamented one German MEP. But what's cheered Europhile Germany up is the fairly widespread interpretation of the election result as a wholesale rejection of the hard Brexit and anti-EU rhetoric of Theresa May. Perhaps, some speculate, Britain will strike a more conciliatory tone, seek a softer Brexit, opt for a closer relationship. And it raised the prospect of what the German tabloid Bild giddily referred to as a possible ""Exit from Brexit"". A Breversal is something most Germans like to entertain - in theory. But, in reality, few expect it. The German government's Brexit working group has been plugging away for months at the laborious practicalities of disentanglement. A rejuvenated Franco-German axis is planning for the future. The UK's decision - though unwelcome - has been made. The work's begun. A somewhat exasperated Berlin wants Britain to get on with it. The UK election result hasn't really changed attitudes towards Brexit in Warsaw. Perhaps impatience is growing because the government here wants to have clarity and know with whom they are dealing. There's an expectation that the negotiations may have to be delayed. The priorities for the Polish government remain securing the rights of Polish citizens already living in the UK and resolving the financial settlement. The first issue is very important because, according to the UK Office for National Statistics, 916,000 Poles live in Britain, making them the largest non-British nationality in the UK. The second issue matters because Poland is the biggest net recipient of funds under the current 2014-2020 EU budget. The UK is one of the biggest net contributors to the budget, and, if it leaves the EU before 2020, some here fear the flow of money to Poland could be reduced. Before the Brexit referendum, Poland's governing Law and Justice Party named Britain as its most important strategic ally in Europe. Law and Justice and the Conservatives are political allies in the European Parliament and they shared a view that the EU should be a free trading bloc consisting of strong nation states. Warsaw would prefer it if Brexit didn't happen and it wants to maintain a close relationship with London once the process is completed. ""If the result of this [UK election] is the possibility of a more soft exit and a compromise Brexit model, then I would be happy with that,"" Poland's Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said. ""If, as a result of these elections, a government emerges with a more common-sense and conciliatory approach to the Brexit negotiations, then, who knows, perhaps the British public will decide it's worth staying in Europe,"" he added. This week Ireland will get a new prime minister,Leo Varadkar. He will be the youngest ever at 38, and is also a committed Europhile. He flew to Paris to show his support for Emmanuel Macron after the first round of voting in the French presidential election. Since the final outcome of the UK's general election became clear, Mr Varadkar has been very consistent in his public comments. Mr Varadkar has come to embody the liberalisation of a country He believes that a softer Brexit is now more likely, and he also thinks the results provide opportunities for the Irish to get further recognition for their concerns about Brexit. Dublin does not want to see anything that endangers the Northern Ireland peace process, or anything that might lead to a hard border on the island - the only land frontier between the UK and the EU post-Brexit. The Irish government also has concerns about the impact the UK leaving the EU might have on the billions of pounds in trade between the two states. Although there is much dismay in other parts of the UK about the putative arrangement between the Conservative Party and the Northern Ireland-based Democratic Unionist Party in the next Parliament, the Irish government takes some comfort from the fact that the DUP - despite being the only major Northern Ireland party to support Brexit - also wants a soft Brexit. Like most other EU27 countries, Ireland initially believed that a Theresa May-led government with a huge majority would be the best result of the UK election. But there is now a growing realisation that the hung parliament and Conservative-DUP arrangement may better serve Irish Brexit concerns after all. Sweden never wanted to see the UK leaving the EU, but ever since Britons voted narrowly for Brexit, it's been pushing for a speedy divorce to help ease the pain of losing its closest EU ally and a key trading partner. Now, the Nordic country is facing up to the possibility of a more prolonged and complicated separation. ""Messy"" is the word that's been repeatedly selected to describe the British election result in recent days, both by the centre-left coalition and those on the centre-right. Both are united in backing the European project. Appearing on the nation's most high-profile TV debate show, Agenda, on Sunday, the Swedish Minister for European Affairs and Trade Ann Linde admitted she was already worried that the EU's Brexit negotiations could end up stalling as a result of the vote, with Theresa May lacking the ""strong support"" from the British parliament that she would have gained by achieving a parliamentary majority. Some media outlets have speculated that a weak Conservative-led coalition in the UK might end up making concessions that result in a ""softer"" Brexit, guaranteeing continued freedom of movement for Swedes and Brits switching between the two countries. But other vocal commentators are less hopeful. The chief economist at the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Andreas Hatzigeorgiou, is among those arguing that May will end up cowing to the influence of hard Brexiteers within her new government. He told the BBC he also believes that the EU may ""take advantage"" of her weaker mandate by offering a poor trade deal designed to discourage other member states from jumping ship. Watching closely from the sidelines is the Sweden Democrat party (SD), which is pushing for a fresh referendum on Sweden's own membership of the European Union. The anti-immigration group scored 12.9% of the vote in the last general election, but has since seen its support shoot up to 18%, a year ahead of the Scandinavian country's next general election. However, the same nationwide poll found that the proportion of Swedes who are in favour of EU membership has actually increased since Britons voted for Brexit, while UKIP's poor showing at the ballot box is being seen as an encouraging sign by those seeking to limit SD's influence in the Swedish parliament.

"US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday is the biggest thing to hit Washington since, uh, last week. OK, so the sequel tothe James Comey hearingdoesn't have the same build-up as the original, but that doesn't mean that there won't be fireworks - or that the proceedings can't cause new headaches for the Trump administration. In a way, the attorney general's hearing is likely to be a mirror image of Mr Comey's, with Republicans lobbing friendly questions while Democrats sharpen their knives. Here's a look at five pressing questions that Mr Sessions could face. During his confirmation hearings in January, Mr Sessions answered this question with a negative - then had to plead a faulty memory when it was revealed that this was not, shall we say, an accurate account. Russian Ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak Then-Senator Sessions had indeed had two meetings with Mr Kislyak. He visited with the ambassador - who is considered by some to be the top Russian spymaster in the US - around the time of the Republican convention, and he later hosted him in his Senate office. The subsequent disclosure of these meetings led directly to Mr Sessions' March announcementthat he would recuse himself from the Justice Department's investigationinto possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Who is Jeff Sessions? Comey's most revealing moments Michael Flynn: The man at the centre of Trump's Russia crisis How the White House's story on Comey collapsed Now, according to reports,there may have been a third meeting between the two men,external, perhaps before or after then-candidate Trump gave a high-profile foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel on 27 April, 2016. This may have been the ""facts"" that Mr Comey was hinting at during last week's testimony when asked about Mr Sessions. ""He was very close to and inevitably going to recuse himself for a variety of reasons,"" the former FBI director said. ""We also were aware of facts that I can't discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic."" It was one of the more dramatic passages in Mr Comey's written statement last week - his revelation of a meeting in the White House on 14 February where Mr Trump told him he hoped he could let Flynn go. This video can not be played Comey's most revealing moments ""The President signalled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone,"" Mr Comey wrote. ""I stayed in my chair. As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the Attorney General lingered by my chair, but the president thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me."" During his testimony Mr Comey described how he remembered Mr Sessions responding to the request. ""His body language gave me the sense, like, 'What am I going to do?'"" he said. Will Mr Sessions corroborate this account? Does he know anything more about what took place? If so, it could help bolster the contention that the president understood the pressure he planned to put on the then-director in private was improper, at best. Mr Comey wrote in his statement that after the awkward meeting with the president, in which he said that the former national security advisor Michael Flynn was a ""good guy"" but never told the president he would back off the investigation, the director reached out to Mr Sessions to express his concern. ""I took the opportunity to implore the attorney general to prevent any future direct communication between the president and me,"" Mr Comey recalled. ""I told the AG (attorney general) that what had just happened - him being asked to leave while the FBI director, who reports to the AG, remained behind - was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply."" This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe Mr Sessions will have another chance to reply on Tuesday - or challenge the veracity of the former director's testimony - and a great many more people than Mr Comey will be listening. When Mr Comey's firing was announced by the White House, the action was initially explained as the end result of a review process initiated within the Justice Department. This video can not be played Trump says he made the decision to fire Comey - that's not what the White House originally said. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote a memo detailing the then-director's mishandling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server while she was secretary of state. Mr Sessions then forwarded the memo to the president, with his recommendation that Mr Comey be terminated. Mr Trump then accepted conclusion. All that, of course, was blown out of the water when Mr Trump told a television interviewer that he had always planned to fire Mr Comey and that the ongoing Russia investigation was in his mind when he made the decision. Given that Mr Sessions had officially recused himself from his department's Russia probe, the attorney general's involvement in a firing that now appears to have been motivated, at least in part, by Mr Comey's direction of the Russia probe has raised some eyebrows. ""Attorney General Sessions should not have had any involvement in this decision at all,"" Democratic Senator Al Franken of Minnesota said. ""He recused himself. And yet he inserted himself in this firing."" A Justice Department spokesman has pushed back against these allegations in an email statement to the press. ""The recommendation to remove Director Comey was a personnel decision based on concerns about the effectiveness of his leadership as set forth in the Attorney General's letter,"" Sarah Isgur Flores writes. ""The recommendation had nothing to do with the substance of any investigation."" Mr Sessions has the opportunity to add some clarity to the process behind Mr Comey's firing - or seek the protection of executive privilege, claiming that his private conversations with the president are legally shielded from outside scrutiny. Ever since the Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Comey ""better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!"" everyone in the Trump administration, from the president on down, has been asked if they have any knowledge of whether such recordings exist. This video can not be played Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year The president himself has been cryptic, saying last week that he would make an announcement in a ""very short period of time"". ""Oh, you're going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer,"" he added. ""Don't worry."" When asked on Monday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the president had been clear in his statement and he had nothing to add. Mr Sessions probably will be equally unhelpful, but that doesn't mean he won't be asked. And how he responds, even in a denial, could be plenty interesting.

"This video can not be played Amisha Bhardwaj says she wanted to write her own script ""Why should grooms have all the fun?"" That's what Amisha Bhardwaj says when asked about her wedding video, which has gone viral, receivingmore than six million views on YouTube,external. In the video, Ms Bhardwaj is dancing in shorts and her bridal blouse, perfectly lip syncing to Sia's popular song ""Cheap Thrills"". ""I am still surprised that the video went viral because it simply shows a bride having fun on her wedding day. That's not unusual,"" she says. But many people have commented about the choice of her clothes, and the song. ""I think my video broke the stereotype of the shy Indian bride, who is not supposed to dance, and definitely not wear the kind of clothes I am wearing in the video,"" she says. ""The script for the Indian bride has been the same for ages - she is supposed to be shy, not laugh and smile sporadically, and cry while leaving her parents' house. But now the modern Indian bride is writing her own script."" Ms Bhardwaj says brides should be allowed to wear whatever they want on their wedding day Ms Bhardwaj says the video reflected the confident woman she is Making wedding videos in India was, until not too long ago, a stodgy and time-consuming process. Videographers mostly shot entire ceremonies. Now however, catchy videos inspired by Bollywood song and dance are the new trend, and Indian brides are more than willing to play a leading role. ""I didn't plan the video to be different. But when I look back, I think I had the confidence subconsciously to do whatever I wanted to do,"" says Ms Bhardwaj. ""And it comes from who I am - the confident young woman of modern India. I don't understand why people expect brides to be shy when grooms are allowed to have fun - dance and get drunk. Times are changing, and so are Indian brides, people should live with it."" How do you organise an Indian wedding without cash Lavish Indian wedding draws to a close People seem to be accepting this change - a majority of comments on her video are positive. But some have accused her of ""destroying"" Indian culture. ""I didn't engage with trolls because there were enough people on the internet to defend me,"" she says. Supreet Kaur and Pawan Singh, the filmmakers who made the video, agree that the Indian bride has changed. ""When I started making wedding videos 10 years ago, brides mostly asked to look fairer and slimmer. But now most of them want to be experimental,"" Mr Singh says. Pawandeep Singh and Supreet Kaur have been making wedding videos for 10 years Ms Kaur agrees. ""Brides realise that the wedding is the most important event of their life, and they want to be their true self,"" she says. Mr Singh says India has changed in the past 10 years, as more and more women join the workforce. ""Young women are today running businesses and offices, so they don't want to follow stereotypes when it comes to weddings,"" he says. ""Amisha is not the only bride who has done things differently. Just search and you will find many such experimental videos."" One such bride is Ishita Girdhar. She did not cry while leaving her parents' house after the wedding - a practice synonymous with Indian brides. ""A wedding is a happy occasion, so I chose to dance instead and made everybody dance around me,"" she says. Ishita Girdhar says modern Indian women don't need to abide by stereotypes Ms Girdhar says Bollywood films and TV soaps are one of the reasons why people have stereotypes about brides. ""Films always show the bride as shy. So people blindly believe that's the only way brides should behave,"" she says. Mananmita Kumar also chose to make a dance video with her husband during her wedding. ""It's simple - if you want to be shy, be shy. But don't act in a certain way because that's what the stereotypes demand."" But not every bride gets a chance to express herself. Ms Kaur says women in smaller towns and sometimes even in cities still do not have a choice. ""I once had a client who refused to work with me because he didn't trust a woman cameraperson. And on another occasion, a groom cancelled a shoot because he didn't like the idea of his bride agreeing to do a solo video,"" she says. ""Change has come but we are still a long way from a time when every bride is able to be herself on her wedding day,"" she says. Mananmita Kumar supports women who are fighting ""narrow mindsets"" Ms Bhardwaj says it's important to recognise the support women get from their family. ""I was able to make fun videos because my husband didn't have an issue - not that I needed his permission but it's nice to know that your partner is on the same page."" Her husband, Pranav Verma, says he didn't even know when she shot the video. ""I hope this video will give many people, especially grooms, a reason to believe that we must break the myth of the shy Indian bride."" Ms Bhardwaj nods in agreement. ""We have started breaking these stereotypes - one bride at a time.""

"This video can not be played Ms Foster said she would not 'negotiate over the airwaves' The Democratic Unionist Party leader has said she hopes to seal a deal on supporting Theresa May's minority government ""sooner rather than later"". After meeting the prime minister in Downing Street, Arlene Foster said discussions were ""going well"" and she hoped for a ""successful conclusion"". The BBC understands a final meeting to approve the deal is set for Wednesday. But ex-Conservative PM Sir John Major said he was ""dubious"" about the idea and its impact on the peace process. The Conservatives are having to rely on the support of 10 DUP MPs after they fell eight seats short of winning an overall majority at the general election. But Sir John told BBC Radio 4's World at One that if the party ""locked"" itself into a deal with one of the main parties in Northern Ireland, there was a danger the government would no longer be seen as an ""impartial honest broker"" in restoring the power-sharing arrangements and upholding NI institutions. BBC Election Live - rolling text and video updates Quick guide to what's going on Peace in Northern Ireland should ""not be regarded as a given"", said Sir John - whose government laid the foundations for the peace process in the 1990s -  and nothing should be done to ""exaggerate the differences"" between the unionist and nationalist communities. This video can not be played I am ""concerned"" about a deal with the DUP, says former prime minister Sir John Major He urged Theresa May to consider governing on her own, saying this would not ""carry the baggage"" for the Conservatives that an arrangement with the DUP would. Sir John suggested the DUP would be asking for money and that would be seen as the ""government paying cash for votes in Parliament"", and would be received badly in other parts of the UK. The agreement with the DUP is expected to be very different to the coalition deal agreed between the Conservatives and Lib Dems in 2010, with DUP politicians not getting cabinet jobs and their support for the majority of new legislation to be determined on a vote-by-vote basis. Asked about Sir John's comments during a trip to Paris, Mrs May said she was ""absolutely steadfast"" in her support for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement - which created the Northern Ireland Assembly - and efforts to revive the power-sharing executive. Mrs May, who has been holding talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on counter-terrorism and Brexit, said the ""productive"" talks with the DUP were about ""giving stability to the UK government that is necessary at this critical time"" ahead of the start of the Brexit process. Bercow: I'm a Speaker 'for testing times' May to meet Macron for anti-terror talks The clock's ticking, EU warns UK Reality Check: Has election changed EU views of Brexit? Conservative sources said ""constructive"" progress had been made in the talks and both sides were ""working carefully through the paperwork"" to complete the deal. Mrs Foster told the BBC areas being discussed including Brexit, counter-terrorism and ""doing what's right for Northern Ireland in respect of economic matters"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the DUP was likely to demand money for investment in Northern Ireland and an end to austerity. This video can not be played ""At least someone got a landslide"" - the PM's comment was met with laughter Sinn Fein, whose seven MPs will not take their seats in Westminster, said any deal must be approved by the Northern Ireland executive when it is back up and running. ""Any agreement reached with the DUP - financial or otherwise - cannot be to the detriment of anyone else in our society,"" said Belfast West MP Paul Maskey. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? Who is Arlene Foster? What won't be in the Queen's Speech? Earlier in the Commons, as MPs gathered for the first time since the election, Jeremy Corbyn congratulated Mrs May on ""returning as PM"" and said he ""looked forward to this Parliament, however short it may be"". The Labour leader joked that he welcomed the prospect of a Queen's Speech once this ""coalition of chaos has been negotiated"", but said if this did not happen, he was ""ready to offer strong and stable leadership in the national interest"". Mrs May has chaired the first meeting of the cabinet since the election and has been finalising her reshuffle, with changes including Steve Baker, a leading backbench Brexiteer, becoming a minister in the Department for Exiting The EU. The move was welcomed by Conservative commentators, but the Lib Dems said far from ""softening her stance"" on Brexit after the inconclusive election result, the PM had put a ""fox in charge of guarding the hen house"".

"The rising cost of foreign package holidays and imported computer games helped to push the UK inflation rate up to 2.9% last month from 2.7% in April. The latest inflation rate is the highest since June 2013, and above the Bank of England's 2% target. The Office for National Statistics,externalsaid the price of food and clothing also went up slightly but fuel costs fell for a third month in a row. The pick-up in inflation is likely to continue the squeeze on consumers. Kamal Ahmed: Toxic incomes squeeze worsens Emma Simpson: What's going up fastest? The fall in the value of the pound since last year's Brexit referendum has increased the cost of imports, which has been one of the key factors behind the rise in inflation. However, wage increases have not kept up with the rise in prices. The most recent ONS data on wages showed that average weekly earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.1% in the three months to March. Earnings data for the three months to April will be released on Wednesday. Computer games are part of the recreational and cultural goods and services sector, where prices rose overall by 0.9% between April and May compared with a fall of 0.4% a year ago. As computer games are mostly imported they have been affected by the weaker pound, while the drop in sterling has also meant holidays abroad are more expensive. The sugar, jam, confectionery and children's clothing markets were mainly responsible for the increase in food and clothing prices. There were also rises in the price of furniture and household goods, and in the cost of electricity - with further price increases coming into effect in May. Travellers did have some good news, however, with the decrease in fuel costs coupled with a drop in the cost of air and sea travel, which was influenced by Easter falling in April instead of March as in 2016. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: ""We expect inflation to rise further over the course of this year and to reach a peak in the final quarter of 2017. ""This spike in inflation will exert further downward pressure on real household disposable income, at a time when wage growth remains modest and in turn squeeze consumer spending."" Nick Dixon, investment director at life insurance and pensions firm Aegon, said: ""This high rate will particularly affect the purchasing power of retirees locked into a fixed income and the growing number whose wages have failed to keep pace."" When you hear politicians lament the squeeze on living standards caused by higher inflation and sagging pay rises, it's worth remembering another squeeze - one the largest parties are deliberately imposing. The biggest single austerity measure, imposed first by George Osborne, is the freezing of ""working-age"" benefits. If you receive child benefit, tax credits or jobseeker's allowance, your benefits no longer rise with inflation. Last year that made little difference because CPI inflation was zero. But with inflation now at 2.9%, the real value of your benefits is dropping sharply. This is projected to cost benefit recipients (and therefore save the government) Â£3.6bn a year by 2021. In addition, further cuts to universal credit chalked in by Mr Osborne (cutting the amount you can earn before tax credits are withdrawn and withdrawing extra support if you have more than two children) will take another Â£6bn a year off low-income families by 2020. As the low-income think tank the Resolution Foundation points out, Labour may have said it will reduce welfare cuts by Â£2bn a year, but that's too little to reverse the cuts. Both parties are effectively planning to keep the biggest austerity measures and the austerity ""squeeze"" on benefit recipients is only just beginning. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation looked set to peak at about 3.2% in the fourth quarter of the year, ""as retailers continue to pass on higher import prices to consumers"". ""We doubt, however, that a majority of MPC members will feel compelled to raise interest rates this year,"" he added. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), warned that businesses were being hit hard by the rise in inflation. ""Higher inflation is a key business concern as it squeezes margins and weakens their ability to invest, particularly during this time of heightened political uncertainty."" he said. ""The BCC's quarterly economic survey confirms that businesses continue to feel the inflationary pressures, with a significant proportion of firms struggling to absorb the rising cost of raw materials and other overheads. ""If the current political uncertainty persists, this is likely to increase the downward pressure on sterling's value, pushing inflation even higher over the next year."" The ONS's new preferred measure of inflation CPIH - which includes a measure of owner occupiers' housing costs - rose to 2.7% last month, up from 2.6% in April. The Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation increased to 3.7% in June, up from 3.5% the month before. Ahmed: Toxic incomes squeeze worsens Inflation: what's going up fastest?

"This tombstone was discovered in someone's cellar, where it had most likely been since the Jewish community was deported and murdered in World War Two Plans to rehabilitate a pre-war Jewish cemetery in the Czech town of Prostejov have run into fierce local opposition. The foundation behind the plan says it has been torpedoed by deliberate misinformation and anti-Semitism. Tomas Jelinek stands over a broken headstone and scrapes at patches of cement obscuring the name. Sweating heavily in spite of the chilly afternoon, he brushes away the last patches and squints at the inscription. ""Herlitzka,"" he decides. ""Bernhard Herlitzka. Diedâ¦ April 1879. I can't make out the date."" There's not much more to go on. The broken tombstone lies face up in the grass, with perhaps a dozen or so more beside it, some whole, others in fragments. The inscriptions are a mixture of German and Hebrew. ""Beloved daughterâ¦"" begins one. ""Here liesâ¦"" reads another. The rest is lost. Hope for the future in Brno's Jewish cemetery Rescuing Warsaw's overgrown Jewish graves 'Hundreds' of US Jewish graves attacked Uncovering a story of ill-fated romance and tragic death ""We can find the story of a person,"" says Tomas Jelinek, formerly head of Prague's Jewish community. ""We have the files of the Chevra Kadisha - the Jewish burial society, where we can find the position of the graves, the text that was on the gravestone and so on."" ""We usually try to contact the relatives. We sometimes find direct heirs,"" he adds. ""They're surprised, touched. Some of them are really excited."" Tomas Jelinek is dedicated to restoring the headstones, and ensuring the town remembers its Jewish past So far Mr Jelinek has recovered 34 headstones in and around Prostejov. He has just loaded this one and a dozen more into a trailer at a nearby village, hence the sweating. ""The whole cellar was made from them. They weren't hard to find,"" the villager tells me. He says he'd rather not give his name. ""I'm just returning what should never have been taken."" Every few months, says Mr Jelinek, someone from Prostejov will call him to say they've found a stone with Hebrew writing propping up a chicken coop or lying at the bottom of the garden. One family discovered their entire back yard was paved with marble tombstones. Unfortunately, they have been reluctant to part with them. ""Prostejov had a very bad history in the relationship to the Jews. It was famous for its anti-Semitism in the 19th Century,"" he tells me. ""And it's still in the population. You can hear it on the street, and you can also see that they just reinvent things which people thought would disappear for ever after the Second World War."" Prostejov was once an important Jewish centre, but little remains today For centuries Prostejov was an important centre of Jewish life in Moravia, producing a number of influential rabbis. In 1942, that history came to an abrupt end, when the town's Jews were deported by the Nazis. The following year, Prostejov's ethnic German mayor bought the town's old Jewish cemetery from the Reich authorities. It contained the graves of 1,924 people; the last burial had been in 1908. The tombstones were marked with crosses; high quality marble was sold; lesser quality softer stone was handed out free to locals. After the war, the site stayed empty for years. People remember playing there as children. They told their parents they were going to play ""na zidaku"" - down at the Jews' place. Some remember unearthing bones. Today, it is a small park, bordered by houses and a school. But 74 years after its desecration, plans to rehabilitate it have caused uproar. ""I think the mayor pretty much summed it up when she said the rights of the living must take precedence over the rights of the dead,"" deputy mayor Zdenek Fiser told me at Prostejov's splendid town hall. He was referring to one of many stormy public meetings held in the town on a proposal put forward by the US foundation Mr Jelinek now represents - Kolel Damesek Eliezer. The foundation wants to demarcate the old cemetery with a knee-high hedge and place some of the recovered tombstones there. But after a petition signed by 3,000 locals the town council quickly withdrew its support. A visualisation was attached to the petition, falsely showing the park surrounded by a brick wall. Some of the red crosses that were painted on the headstones in 1943 are still visible ""The thing is, there are only a few descendants of people of Jewish origin left here in Prostejov,"" Mr Fiser told me, explaining the overwhelming opposition to the plan, which would involve rerouting several paths leading to the school. ""Most of the people who signed the petition live opposite the park or are parents of kids who go to the school. So most people who signed the petition against it actually live there."" He also dismisses Tomas Jelinek's claims that Prostejov was a hotbed of anti-Semitism. ""You're asking me about anti-Semitic articles in the local press, but we didn't write those articles, did we? As you well know, journalists need controversy, a 'cause celebre', to make their articles interesting,"" Mr Fiser explained. ""If they'd just written about plans to turn a local park into a place of remembrance, no-one would be interested. But put 'anti-Semitism' in the headline, and all of a sudden everyone's up in arms."" For now, Bernhard Herlitzka's tombstone is being stored with the rest at Prostejov's New Jewish Cemetery, a short drive out of town. It is a provisional arrangement, until the foundation and the town council can agree what to do with the old one. Judging by the atmosphere in Prostejov, it could be some time. There's a post-script to my visit. I'm given a guided tour by a local historian who's researched Prostejov's Jewish community. She takes me down a little alley between a cluster of buildings. ""That was the main synagogue. That was the reform one. And that was the yeshiva,"" she says. The synagogues are now churches; one Catholic, one Protestant. The yeshiva is now where you go to pay your parking fines. Finally, we end up at the Old Jewish Cemetery - the park that the Jewish community still regards as a burial ground. Shouting teenagers rush past us in groups. Mothers push prams. A small black monument faces the school. An act of vandalism or just the weather? She takes me a few metres' further to a second monument, a plexiglass replica of the tombstone of Prostejov's most famous rabbi, Zvi Horowitz. ""Oh,"" she exclaims. The plexiglass has been snapped in two. Half of it is lying in the grass. I make sympathetic noises to hide her evident embarrassment. It has clearly just happened. I take a photo and show it to deputy mayor Mr Fiser. I ask him who he thinks could have been responsible. ""I don't know,"" he replies, peering at my phone. ""Perhaps it was the wind?""

"This video can not be played Ms Foster said she would not 'negotiate over the airwaves' The Democratic Unionist Party leader has said she hopes to seal a deal on supporting Theresa May's minority government ""sooner rather than later"". After meeting the prime minister in Downing Street, Arlene Foster said discussions were ""going well"" and she hoped for a ""successful conclusion"". The BBC understands a final meeting to approve the deal is set for Wednesday. But ex-Conservative PM Sir John Major said he was ""dubious"" about the idea and its impact on the peace process. The Conservatives are having to rely on the support of 10 DUP MPs after they fell eight seats short of winning an overall majority at the general election. But Sir John told BBC Radio 4's World at One that if the party ""locked"" itself into a deal with one of the main parties in Northern Ireland, there was a danger the government would no longer be seen as an ""impartial honest broker"" in restoring the power-sharing arrangements and upholding NI institutions. BBC Election Live - rolling text and video updates Quick guide to what's going on Peace in Northern Ireland should ""not be regarded as a given"", said Sir John - whose government laid the foundations for the peace process in the 1990s -  and nothing should be done to ""exaggerate the differences"" between the unionist and nationalist communities. This video can not be played I am ""concerned"" about a deal with the DUP, says former prime minister Sir John Major He urged Theresa May to consider governing on her own, saying this would not ""carry the baggage"" for the Conservatives that an arrangement with the DUP would. Sir John suggested the DUP would be asking for money and that would be seen as the ""government paying cash for votes in Parliament"", and would be received badly in other parts of the UK. The agreement with the DUP is expected to be very different to the coalition deal agreed between the Conservatives and Lib Dems in 2010, with DUP politicians not getting cabinet jobs and their support for the majority of new legislation to be determined on a vote-by-vote basis. Asked about Sir John's comments during a trip to Paris, Mrs May said she was ""absolutely steadfast"" in her support for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement - which created the Northern Ireland Assembly - and efforts to revive the power-sharing executive. Mrs May, who has been holding talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on counter-terrorism and Brexit, said the ""productive"" talks with the DUP were about ""giving stability to the UK government that is necessary at this critical time"" ahead of the start of the Brexit process. Bercow: I'm a Speaker 'for testing times' May to meet Macron for anti-terror talks The clock's ticking, EU warns UK Reality Check: Has election changed EU views of Brexit? Conservative sources said ""constructive"" progress had been made in the talks and both sides were ""working carefully through the paperwork"" to complete the deal. Mrs Foster told the BBC areas being discussed including Brexit, counter-terrorism and ""doing what's right for Northern Ireland in respect of economic matters"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the DUP was likely to demand money for investment in Northern Ireland and an end to austerity. This video can not be played ""At least someone got a landslide"" - the PM's comment was met with laughter Sinn Fein, whose seven MPs will not take their seats in Westminster, said any deal must be approved by the Northern Ireland executive when it is back up and running. ""Any agreement reached with the DUP - financial or otherwise - cannot be to the detriment of anyone else in our society,"" said Belfast West MP Paul Maskey. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? Who is Arlene Foster? What won't be in the Queen's Speech? Earlier in the Commons, as MPs gathered for the first time since the election, Jeremy Corbyn congratulated Mrs May on ""returning as PM"" and said he ""looked forward to this Parliament, however short it may be"". The Labour leader joked that he welcomed the prospect of a Queen's Speech once this ""coalition of chaos has been negotiated"", but said if this did not happen, he was ""ready to offer strong and stable leadership in the national interest"". Mrs May has chaired the first meeting of the cabinet since the election and has been finalising her reshuffle, with changes including Steve Baker, a leading backbench Brexiteer, becoming a minister in the Department for Exiting The EU. The move was welcomed by Conservative commentators, but the Lib Dems said far from ""softening her stance"" on Brexit after the inconclusive election result, the PM had put a ""fox in charge of guarding the hen house"". This video can not be played Who are the DUP? This video can not be played Pollsters have had a pretty rough time of late, we asked one what's gone wrong Senior EU figures, meanwhile, have expressed their growing impatience with the UK and warned the clock is ticking for the negotiations, which have only 20 months to run. In a joint press conference with Mr Macron, Mrs May said Brexit talks would get under way next week as planned. Mr Macron told reporters that while respecting the decision of the British people to leave the EU, the door ""would always remain open"" if they changed their mind.

"The Conservative Party is in talks with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) about a deal to gain its support on certain votes in Parliament. Parts of the discussions are expected to involve funding for Northern Ireland. How much government money already goes there? HM Treasury,externalbreaks down public spending between Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Only about 88% of government spending may be divided in this way, the remaining 12% is on things like defence, which are counted in the statistics as benefiting everyone in the UK equally. Northern Ireland has more of the identifiable spending per head than Scotland and Wales, receiving 21% more than the UK as a whole. Next in line comes Scotland, which is 16% above the average and Wales at 10% above. England spends 3% per head below the overall UK figure. The figures include spending by devolved administrations as well as UK government departments. There are some differences between what counts as public spending - for example, water supply counts as being in the public sector in Scotland and Northern Ireland but in the private sector in England and Wales. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) hasrecently published experimental statistics,externalon the distribution of public spending throughout the UK, which also found that Northern Ireland had the highest per person funding. The UK is a net contributor, but if you look at how EU structural and investment funds aredistributed among the nations,,externalWales comes out on top by a long way, with 142 euros (Â£126) per person per year. Northern Ireland receives 57 euros (Â£50) per person, which is 58% above the UK average of 36 euros (Â£32).

"The use of child labour at cobalt mines has attracted criticism from human rights groups A number of metals are crucial components in a range of technologies, from smartphone batteries to electric cars. So could a market shortage and spiralling prices put the brakes on the global tech industry? Cobalt has been used for thousands of years to give a deep blue-ish hue to pottery, paint and jewellery. But more recently, it has become a crucial metal used in the batteries powering millions of tech gadgets, including the electric cars made by Tesla and others. About half of all cobalt demand comes from the expansion of electric vehicle production and development worldwide. The problem is, we can't get enough of it. No wonder its price has doubled in the last year alone. ""We are definitely entering a period of deficit and that will start this year,"" says Lara Smith, managing director of Core Consultants, a commodities researcher. ""In 2016, the supply of cobalt was about 104,000 tonnes and demand was about 103,500. The hybrid and electric vehicles are in a nascent growth phase, so as we continue along this track we expect there to be a greater and greater deficit."" Will the growth of electric vehicles be slowed by a shortage of cobalt? Only 2% of cobalt is mined directly - 98% of it is produced as a by-product of nickel and copper mining. Unlike other battery metals like lithium, cobalt is quite rare and its quality can vary geographically. About two thirds of the supply comes from Africa's Congo region. It's little wonder then that First Cobalt Corporation in Toronto recently invested in seven large areas of land in the Central African ""copperbelt"" with the intention of finding more copper and cobalt reserves in the ground. ""Electric vehicle market penetration around the world is projected to grow 26% this year alone,"" chief executive Trent Mell tells the BBC. ""We are predicting a growth rate in cobalt demand of 5% per year for the next five years. On the supply side the pipeline of new production is pretty scarce. ""To bring up a mine to full production can take up to 10 years."" First Cobalt Corporation boss Trent Mell surveys potential cobalt mine land in central Africa Efforts to mine cobalt in North America are under way, but any increase in US and Canadian production is expected to be small compared with future anticipated demand globally. And the Congo mining region has also been under scrutiny as it deals with accusations of child labour and other human rights abuses, summarised in anAmnesty International report last year,external. In other words, ramping up supply could take quite some time. And this shortage in the supply of ""technology metals"" is not limited to cobalt. Many modern electronics rely on them - neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium to name but a few - which make them faster, lighter, stronger, and more energy efficient. If the metals our gadgets need become hard to get hold of, you could wait years for that upgrade These rare earth metals along with minor metals such as lithium and tantalum are now just as important as the traditional base metals and precious metals. ""The colour red on a MacBook Pro screen is made from europium; the colour green is because of a metal called terbium; touch screen technology relies on indium,"" explains David Abraham, author of a book called The Elements of Power. ""A lot of these metals have only been discovered in the past 100 years. We've had a long time to play with copper and iron. But we are just beginning to understand the power of these newer materials."" Are Google, Amazon and others getting too big? How Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think WannaCry: What can you do to protect your business? Click here for more Technology of Business features,external Unlike cobalt, most other technology metals are not rare. It's getting them out of the ground and in to manufacturing locations that's tricky. Again, most are by-products of other base metal mining activity and involve additional complex chemical extraction processes. China dominates the mining and production of many technology metals, due in part to weak environmental codes. It produces 100% of the world's dysprosium for example. While there is lots of talk among other nations - notably Australia - about starting their own mines and processing centres, there is little real appetite for it, believes Mr Abraham. Rare earths: Neither rare, nor earths The Elements A lot of countries don't want to open new mining and processing facilities because they are deemed ""dirty"" and environmentally unpopular, he says. The alarm bells for tech companies sounded in 2010-11 when the prices of several rare and minor metals sky-rocketed. ""There was a major price spike in some of these materials,"" says Gareth Hatch, co-founder of consultancy group Technology Metals Research. ""Some went up anywhere from 300% to 1,000% in price for a variety of reasons, and that alerted everyone to the fact that we are dependent on these materials and they are all coming from China - and that could be a problem."" Apple's Liam robot disassembles the iPhone to recover metals such as cobalt, lithium and gold Although prices of most elements have normalised again, the fact that China has so much influence over supplies is a cause of increasing concern. Political and economic differences between China and the West are a constant conversation topic in the US and elsewhere. Find yourself on China's ""less than co-operative"" list and you could potentially see your essential supply of tech metals dry up overnight. One way of breaking China's stranglehold is to recycle the materials. Apple is a leader in this field, marshalling a line of robots called Liam to disassemble used iPhones in a few seconds, enabling recovery and reuse of many of the materials used, such as cobalt, indium and gold. But it's hard for the technology companies to predict what will happen in a decade from now. If supplies of crucial elements dwindle, prices of new gadgets are likely to rise if supply cannot match demand. Perhaps then, we may have to learn to live with with our existing gadgets for longer.

"The US has urged Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to act against terrorism The dispute that has seen Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies isolate Qatar stems from allegations that the tiny gas-rich nation is sponsoring extremist groups which are destabilising the Middle East. This is not the first time Qatar's neighbours have expressed their displeasure over its individualist foreign policy - diplomatic relations were severed for nine months in 2014. Tensions have arisen from Qatar's support for the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood; its close relationship with groups such as theTalibanand certain al-Qaeda affiliates; and its relationship with Iran, which has most recently led to allegations from Saudi Arabia that the state-funded broadcaster Al Jazeera issupporting Houthi rebels,externalin Yemen fighting government forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Doha hasstrongly denied,externalRiyadh's accusations, and said it has taken more robust counter-terrorism measures than some of its neighbours. The de facto embargo imposed on Qatar has prompted fears about shortages of basic goods Yet this latest row is shining a particular light on the role Qatar plays with its immense wealth. In April, it reportedlypaid a ransom,externalof as much as $1bn (Â£790m) to a former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria and to Iranian security officials as part of a deal that resulted in the release of 26 royal family members reportedly kidnapped by Iranian-backed Iraqi Shia militiamen and of dozens of Shia fighters captured by jihadists in Syria. Thus it is Qatar's alleged continued funding of radical ideology and extremism that is seemingly the cause of concern this time. Since 9/11, the United States-led global effort to disrupt terrorist financing has been relentless. Domestic laws and United Nations Security Council Resolutions have been passed; entities and individuals have been subject to national and UN sanctions; and suspected conduits for terrorist funding, such as remittance companies and charities, have been shut down. But despite all this, the commitment of some key nations, including Qatar, has been repeatedly questioned. Qatar's then-Emir, Sheikh Hamad, visited the Hamas-dominated Gaza Strip in 2012 In 2014, then-US Treasury Under-Secretary for Terrorism and Financial IntelligenceDavid Cohen noted,external: ""Qatar, a long-time US ally, has for many years openly financed Hamas, a group that continues to undermine regional stability. Press reports indicate that the Qatari government is also supporting extremist groups operating in Syria."" He also drew attention to the ""permissive"" environment in Qatar that allowed fundraisers to solicit donations for extremist groups such as al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State. All you need to know about Qatar What's behind the row? The view from Doha Can Al Jazeera survive Qatar crisis? In 2016, Mr Cohen's replacement at the US treasury department,Adam Szubin, noted,externalthat despite showing willingness to take enforcement action against terrorist financiers, Qatar had ""a way to go"" and lacked ""the necessary political will and capacity to effectively enforce their counter-terrorism finance laws against all terrorist financing threats"". In response to these failings, the US has sanctioned several Qatari citizens for financing terrorism. Yet despite leading the opposition to Qatar's financial activities - and no doubt emboldened by the recent visit to Riyadh by US President Donald Trump - Saudi Arabia has not escaped similar criticism. US President Donald Trump met Saudi Arabia's King Salman in Riyadh last month Fifteen of the 19 aircraft hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi citizens;diplomatic cables from 2009 published by Wikileaks,externalreflect regular US frustration at the difficulty of persuading the Saudi government to treat terrorist financing donors as a strategic priority; and the country has used its considerable hydrocarbon wealth to propagate its fundamentalist Wahhabi strain of Islam via schools and mosques around the world which have been accused by some of being a source of extremism. Although a small number of individuals and entities in Saudi Arabia are alleged to have financed terrorism, the country is seemingly on much more supportive ground than Qatar, andis recognised,externalfor its efforts. Indeed, during President Trump's visit, the US and Saudi governmentsannounced,externalthe inauguration of a jointly-led regional Terrorist Financing Targeting Centre to counter new and evolving threats from terrorist financing, perhaps reflecting the extent to which Saudi Arabia has, in Washington's view, moved from being a terrorist financing problem to a key part of the solution in the Gulf region. Yet this apparent commitment by Saudi Arabia to tackle terrorist financing may not be enough. Qatar has rejected Saudi and UAE claims that charities in the country backed terrorism Although the direct financing of terrorist groups has unsurprisingly been the primary focus of policymakers and security authorities, more recently attention has expanded to include those who fund organisations and individuals who promote radical or extremist ideologies. Speaking in December 2015 during a House of Commons debate on extending UK bombing of so-called Islamic State from Iraq into Syria, then-Prime Minister David Cameron committed to ""establish acomprehensive review,externalto root out any remaining funding of extremism within the UK... [examining] the nature, scale and origin of the funding of Islamist extremist activity in the UK, including any overseas sources"". Recent media reports suggest that, whilst completed, this review is unlikely to be made public. Which brings us back to the current state of Gulf affairs. The suggestions are that, as before, this crisis will quickly pass. But the increased focus this spat has brought to the financing of terrorism and extremist ideology will endure and, however unreasonable it believes this to be, Doha can expect to remain the centre of intense suspicion.

"In the words of one minister, Theresa May""absolutely nailed the sorry"",external, according to the Sun. ""Theresa Back From The Dead"" is a headline in the paper, which suggests predictions of the prime minister's political demise are premature. Several Conservative MPs tell the tabloid it would be wrong to ""change horses"" before the Brexit negotiations are concluded Another of those present at her meeting with Tory backbenchers yesterdaytells the Times,externalthe prime minister had been ""genuine and contrite"" about her flawed election campaign - giving a more human performance. ""There was none of the Maybot"",external, a senior MP told the Guardian, adding that talk of a leadership challenge had been silenced - at least for now. The Guardian says Mrs May bought herself time with ""an upfront mea culpa"" when she met the backbenchers to apologise for the loss of their majority in the Commons. The Daily Express agrees Mrs May managed to settle Tory nerves. But the Daily Mirror is unimpressed. Under a strap-line reading""Tory Government Chaos"",external, the paper mocks up an image of Mrs May to make her look like Princess Leia from the Star Wars films. The paper's headline reads: ""May The Farce Be With You."" While questions about the Conservative leadership may have been temporarily put to bed, there's agreement that another battle is looming. ""Ruth to Scotch a Hard Brexit"",externalruns a headline in the Sun, which reports that the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, is urging colleagues to look again at their strategy for leaving the EU. The Express,externalsays hardline Brexiteers in the cabinet ""are digging in"" for a fight, while the i newspaper talks of a flare-up in the Tory civil war on Europe. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, Michael Gove - who played a key role in the Leave campaign - says it's vital the government achieves a deal with the EU that can command the ""widest possible support"". The paper also claims senior cabinet ministers are having ""secret talks"" with Labour MPs to secure cross-party backing for a soft Brexit. There's speculation about the price the DUP could exact for agreeing to prop up a Conservative minority government. The Timespredicts they will seek measures to isolate Sinn Fein,external. It says a demand to ban all political donations from outside the UK could hit support for Sinn Fein from Irish-American groups. But DUP sources tell the Guardian they want to avoid issues that could alienate nationalists in Northern Ireland - and sectarian matters, such as Orange parades, will be largely off the agenda. Labour's stance on Europe doesn't evade scrutiny. According to the Telegraph,external, the party's plans for Brexit ""descended into chaos"" when Jeremy Corbyn was directly contradicted by members of his shadow cabinet over his wish to leave the single market. Quoting Brexit Secretary David Davis, the paper suggests Labour's position on Europe allowed it to appeal both to UKIP supporters and to Remain voters. ""Which is Labour's Brexit? Hard? Soft? Anyone Know?""asks the Sun,external. ""The party says all things to all men, hoping voters are too dim to notice"". There is widespread coverage of the hundreds of arrests made by Russian police at a protest called by the opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, in Moscow. The Guardian says,externalthe demonstration came as Russia enters an election cycle, with a vote - expected to give President Vladimir Putin six more years - due next March. The Times says,externalthe protests spread well beyond Moscow, with thousands also turning out in far-flung cities in Siberia.

"The rising cost of foreign package holidays and imported computer games helped to push the UK inflation rate up to 2.9% last month from 2.7% in April. The latest inflation rate is the highest since June 2013, and above the Bank of England's 2% target. The Office for National Statistics,externalsaid the price of food and clothing also went up slightly but fuel costs fell for a third month in a row. The pick-up in inflation is likely to continue the squeeze on consumers. Kamal Ahmed: Toxic incomes squeeze worsens Emma Simpson: What's going up fastest? The fall in the value of the pound since last year's Brexit referendum has increased the cost of imports, which has been one of the key factors behind the rise in inflation. However, wage increases have not kept up with the rise in prices. The most recent ONS data on wages showed that average weekly earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.1% in the three months to March. Earnings data for the three months to April will be released on Wednesday. Computer games are part of the recreational and cultural goods and services sector, where prices rose overall by 0.9% between April and May compared with a fall of 0.4% a year ago. As computer games are mostly imported they have been affected by the weaker pound, while the drop in sterling has also meant holidays abroad are more expensive. The sugar, jam, confectionery and children's clothing markets were mainly responsible for the increase in food and clothing prices. There were also rises in the price of furniture and household goods, and in the cost of electricity - with further price increases coming into effect in May. Travellers did have some good news, however, with the decrease in fuel costs coupled with a drop in the cost of air and sea travel, which was influenced by Easter falling in April instead of March as in 2016. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: ""We expect inflation to rise further over the course of this year and to reach a peak in the final quarter of 2017. ""This spike in inflation will exert further downward pressure on real household disposable income, at a time when wage growth remains modest and in turn squeeze consumer spending."" Nick Dixon, investment director at life insurance and pensions firm Aegon, said: ""This high rate will particularly affect the purchasing power of retirees locked into a fixed income and the growing number whose wages have failed to keep pace."" When you hear politicians lament the squeeze on living standards caused by higher inflation and sagging pay rises, it's worth remembering another squeeze - one the largest parties are deliberately imposing. The biggest single austerity measure, imposed first by George Osborne, is the freezing of ""working-age"" benefits. If you receive child benefit, tax credits or jobseeker's allowance, your benefits no longer rise with inflation. Last year that made little difference because CPI inflation was zero. But with inflation now at 2.9%, the real value of your benefits is dropping sharply. This is projected to cost benefit recipients (and therefore save the government) Â£3.6bn a year by 2021. In addition, further cuts to universal credit chalked in by Mr Osborne (cutting the amount you can earn before tax credits are withdrawn and withdrawing extra support if you have more than two children) will take another Â£6bn a year off low-income families by 2020. As the low-income think tank the Resolution Foundation points out, Labour may have said it will reduce welfare cuts by Â£2bn a year, but that's too little to reverse the cuts. Both parties are effectively planning to keep the biggest austerity measures and the austerity ""squeeze"" on benefit recipients is only just beginning. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation looked set to peak at about 3.2% in the fourth quarter of the year, ""as retailers continue to pass on higher import prices to consumers"". ""We doubt, however, that a majority of MPC members will feel compelled to raise interest rates this year,"" he added. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), warned that businesses were being hit hard by the rise in inflation. ""Higher inflation is a key business concern as it squeezes margins and weakens their ability to invest, particularly during this time of heightened political uncertainty."" he said. ""The BCC's quarterly economic survey confirms that businesses continue to feel the inflationary pressures, with a significant proportion of firms struggling to absorb the rising cost of raw materials and other overheads. ""If the current political uncertainty persists, this is likely to increase the downward pressure on sterling's value, pushing inflation even higher over the next year."" The ONS's new preferred measure of inflation CPIH - which includes a measure of owner occupiers' housing costs - rose to 2.7% last month, up from 2.6% in April. The Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation increased to 3.7% in June, up from 3.5% the month before. Ahmed: Toxic incomes squeeze worsens Inflation: what's going up fastest?

"The Senate testimony of ex-FBI boss James Comey dominated the headlines last week, but the latest announcements from Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation could be a more ominous indication of trouble on the horizon for the Trump administration. Mr Mueller, who was tasked by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein with overseeing the Justice Department's inquiry into possible ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russian operatives, is staffing up his office - and bringing in some prosecutorial heavy-hitters. The hires could be an indication of the direction of the probe and the seriousness with which Mr Mueller is taking the enterprise. Consider Michael Dreeben. On Friday afternoon theNational Law Journal,externalreported that the deputy solicitor general, a criminal-law expert who has argued more than 100 cases before the US Supreme Court, would be joining the special counsel team on a part-time basis. ""Mueller's selection of Dreeben suggests that the special counsel is looking very carefully into whether criminal laws were broken by the Trump campaign and the president's associates,""writes,externalCristian Farias of the Huffington Post. The Trump-Russia scandal: How did we get here? Russia probe 'bigger than Watergate' Five takeaways from James Comey's testimony Lawfare blog's Paul Rosenzweigcalled,externalnews of the hiring ""the worst thing that happened to Donald Trump this week"". ""He is quite possibly the best criminal appellate lawyer in America,"" he continued. Then there's Andrew Weissmann, head of the fraud section of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, who joined the team in late May. He is perhaps best known for his investigation into Volkswagen scheme to bypass emissions requirements on some of its autos. From 2002 to 2005 Weissmann oversaw the Enron energy company inquiry that ended in the prosecution and imprisonment of its top executive, Kenneth Lay. If Mr Mueller's investigation touches on the president's business interests, including allegations of Russian financial entanglements, Weissmann would be the kind of experienced legal hand best suited for the job. Those with a sense of history might have noted that Mr Mueller also tapped James Quarles, a private lawyer who was part of the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in the 1970s and is well aware of the challenges of investigations that tread close to the presidency. Newt Gingrich has apparently changed his mind about Robert Mueller's investigation Jeannie Rhee, a former deputy attorney general, and Aaron Zebley, Mr Mueller's chief of staff when he was FBI director, help round out the special counsel team that has taken up residence in a Justice Department office building in downtown Washington. The moves haven't gone unnoticed by Mr Trump's supporters. On Monday morning former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who has fashioned himself as an expert on all things Trump, tweeted a shot across the independent counsel's bow. ""Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair,""he wrote,external. ""Look who he is hiring."" He then suggested readers check out the Federal Election Committee records of some of Mr Mueller's staff, which reveals four of them - Dreeben, Rhee, Weissmann and Quarles - had given money to past Democratic presidential nominees. The counter to that argument is that Mr Mueller himself was appointed to Justice Department posts, including FBI director, by Republican presidents. This video can not be played Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year Mr Gingrich's criticism could be a harbinger of a drive by Trump surrogates to undermine Mr Mueller's authority and, perhaps, lay the groundwork to question his ultimate prosecutorial decisions or seek his removal. It marks a rather stark change of views for the former House speaker, who just a month agotweeted,externalthat Mr Mueller was a ""superb choice"" as special counsel. One of Mr Trump's personal lawyers, Jay Sekulow, demurred when asked on Sunday if the president could fire Mr Mueller. ""The president is going to seek the advice of his counsel and inside the government as well as outside,""he said,external. ""And I'm not going to speculate on what he will or will not do."" And the speculation built further on Monday evening, when a close friend of the president, Christopher Ruddy, told PBS Newshour he was ""considering perhaps"" firing Mr Mueller. Donald Trump has called the ongoing investigation a ""witch hunt"", a ""hoax"" and an excuse by Democrats for why they lost the presidential race. Mr Mueller's moves, however, indicate he does not share Mr Trump's view. He's assembling a team built for the long haul, with the talent and experience to take cases to trial and, if necessary, send people to prison. So far, Mr Trump has only directed his criticism at former FBI Director James Comey. It may only be a matter of time before some of that attention is directed at Mr Mueller, however.

"This video can not be played Jo Cox's parents: 'We have to stay positive' On 16 June 2016, Labour MP Jo Cox was shot and stabbed in her constituency. Now, as the anniversary of her death approaches, her parents and sister say they are still learning to cope with the loss. As Jean Leadbeater, Jo's mother, waits to welcome us at her front door, the first thing she does is to pull everyone in for a hug. Jo's father, Gordon, is just behind her with a big smile on his face. They bustle around, getting the kettle on, as their daughter Kim makes the introductions. Within minutes, everyone is huddled around Kim's phone as she shows a video of her and Jo doing karaoke together. It was filmed at her birthday, just six weeks before her sister was murdered. It shows the two sisters in the middle of a party, but they're lost in the moment and may as well be alone in the room. This video can not be played Jo Cox sings karaoke with her sister Kim It's a poignant clip, and you might expect Jo's family to be in tears watching it. But actually, there are peals of laughter as the two women do their best impression of Elaine Paige and Barbara Dickson. And really, that sums this family up. They've gone through one of the toughest things imaginable and have emerged with their warmth and humour intact. But their grief is only just below the surface. Jo Cox was MP for Batley and Spen in Yorkshire Jean remembers the moment when she got the call telling her that her daughter been attacked: ""The phone rang and it was her aide. ""He said, 'Jo's been shot, I think.' That was it."" The couple didn't know if she was alive or dead as they raced to get to her. ""We jumped in the car, and we couldn't get near,"" she tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""So we set off running. I don't know how we ran. I don't know how we managed to get there."" Gordon picks up the story: ""If someone says, 'Jo's been shot,' that's bad. But people are shot and recover. So we didn't know."" But he describes a police inspector breaking the news: ""He doesn't have to tell you, you can see by his expression."" Kim listens to her parents silently, but the pain is etched across her face. Kim says her love for Jo's children is now ""100 times deeper"" She moves the conversation on, talking about how the family are now trying to ""create a new level of normality"". They don't focus on Jo's death, or the man who killed her. Jean admits the family ""will always be broken, because there's a piece missing"". ""I think to the outside world, we do appear strong, but there's a lot of days when it's bad. It's bad."" Floral tributes and candles were left at a vigil for Jo Cox in Parliament Square Gordon adds: ""It's not, after one year it gets better. It doesn't. It won't go away. But we have to be positive."" They now prefer to focus on Jo's children. Cuillin and Lejla were aged five and three when their mother died. ""Going forward, build on the children,"" Gordon says. ""Jo's children have got so much of her in them. That's a great legacy. We love that."" Sun and Mirror in joint editorial Election 'would have excited Jo' Man jailed for MP's murder Jean and Gordon's house, however, still retains many memories of Jo. When Jo decided to run for Parliament - and at the time was based in London - her parents decided to extend their home. They built a loft conversion on their bungalow for Jo to work from. Gordon admits he couldn't go up to the room for the three months after she died. But now, when their grandchildren come to stay, they all sleep in the loft together. Kim is a devoted auntie - and says her love for the children is ""100 times deeper now"". She admits that Jo's death has not fully hit her yet. ""I've got those facts, but I don't think I've got them on a deep emotional level yet, and that worries me. ""I'm not in denial. I think there must be a difference between denial and disbelief. I cannot believe that it's happened."" Kim led a tribute to her sister in the days following her death Kim has spent this year trying to build a legacy for her sister and best friend. Days after her sister's death, she gave a speech thanking people for their kindness. That was just the start. She has worked on causes that were close to Jo's heart, such as tackling loneliness and getting communities to integrate better. So this weekend, exactly a year after her sister's death, she will be at a series of events for the Great Get Together. She's asking people to organise street parties, barbecues and bake-offs as a reason to spend time with their neighbours. Because, as she puts it, ""me and Jo loved us food"". She says she is looking forward to it, but also feels ""some trepidation, because it will be a difficult weekend in some ways"". ""But it will also be a wonderful celebration - the best way to remember Jo, as she was all about people.""

"Kellyanne Conway was overheard at a party criticising colleagues, and her comments were posted on Twitter. Her snarkiness revealed a lot about Conway - and about the White House too. Conway, a top adviser to Trump, stood at the top of the steps of a mansion on Embassy Row. The air smelled of eucalyptus, a scent wafting from incense burners in the garden. At the party, she was trash-talking her co-workers. She was especially entertaining - and savage - about Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff. She imitated his voice, showing the way he warned others about the dangers of leaking information to the media. Clearly Priebus was in trouble, and possibly others too. She also spoke lightly - and in a slightly dismissive way - about Marc Short, the president's legislative affairs director, and other senior members of the administration. One of the guests at the party took notes andposted her comments,external, along with a bunch of photos, on Twitter. Conway fired back. She said on Monday she didn't do anything wrong at the party. ""I won't divulge confidential information,"" sheexplained on Fox News,external. Rightly or wrongly, on that evening she offered a glimpse into the inner workings of the White House, underscoring the administration's discord. What she said that night - and the freewheeling way she expressed herself - was a reflection of the faction-riddled, chaotic White House. Sometimes the White House, along with its key aides, seems to spin out of control and then set itself straight again. The @Kellyanneleaks account shared comments she made at an embassy party That's how it seemed when Conway went on a rant about Priebus. Here are things that the moment at the party revealed and why people should pay attention. While she was mocking Priebus, she didn't notice that someone was taking pictures. When she's on a tear, she's unstoppable. I've seen her doing a live shot outside of the West Wing - in the midst of a steady drumbeat from the White House Honor Guard (they were practising for the arrival of King Abdullah II of Jordan) and a robin that dive-bombed inches from her head, angling for a nest on a pole behind her. Conway pictures cause storm on Twitter Conway criticised for Ivanka plug While doing a live shot at the White House, Conway stayed cool despite chaos around her Conway remained composed during the shot, showing the kind of stamina that's needed to survive in the administration. For this reason, she's a steady guide to internal White House operations. Conway notices the way that Priebus and others speak (she's a good mimic). In addition she coins phrases such as ""alternative facts,external"", a term that showed how she and her colleagues see the world. She and her colleagues look at things differently than journalists in the mainstream media do, a rift that has only deepened over time. When you listen to her, you get a sense of how people in the administration think - and gain knowledge about their world. She used to complain about working for Trump, at leastaccording to the Morning Joe co-hosts,external, and was dismissive about the undertaking. However she felt about Trump in the past, she's loyal to him now. Like many of her colleagues, she was not a lifelong devotee of the president. But she's taken on her job with enthusiasm. When she was talking about Priebus, she nevertheless conveyed a deep commitment to the president. The day after she ripped into Priebus, she went to the Rose Garden for a news conference with Trump and President Klaus Iohannis of Romania. Hair flying in the wind, she headed for a chair in the front row. As she got closer, she realised the seat was reserved for someone else. She straightened herself up and headed for the second row. (Another aide, someone who was watching Conway from across the lawn, snickered.) The future of Priebus has been the subject of speculation A moment later Priebus took the front-row seat. For all Conway had said about him, he was nevertheless closer to the president than she was - at least that day. Now,according to Politico,external, Trump says he wants a shake-up at the White House, and Priebus could be out by 4 July. It's the Trump Show, though, and things will change again soon. That's why it's good to pay attention to what Conway and the other aides say and how they say it. Their words, even those thrown out during a party, matter.

Meanwhile, Mr Gingrich,also on Twitter,external, said: ""Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair. Look who he is hiring."" Mr Trump does not have the authority to dismiss Mr Mueller, and he would have to ask Mr Rosenstein, who appointed the special counsel, to do so. This would evoke memories of the ""Saturday Night Massacre"" of 1973, when President Richard Nixon sought to dismiss a special prosecutor. Mr Comey's firing led to accusations that Mr Trump might have tried to obstruct investigations But a long-time friend of Mr Trump said the president was considering sacking Mr Mueller. Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of conservative group Newsmax Media, Mr Ruddy was at the White House on Monday, but US media reported that he did not meet Mr Trump while there. In an interviewwith PBS Newshour,external, he said: ""I think he is considering, perhaps, terminating the special counsel."" ""I think he's weighing that option,"" he added, saying there were concerns about conflicts of interest, including Mr Mueller's interview to replace Mr Comey at the FBI and his law firm, which represents members of Trump family. But he said: ""I personally think it would be a very significant mistake."" Hours after the interview, White House spokesman Sean Spicer did not deny the claim, but said: ""Mr Ruddy never spoke to the president regarding this issue.

"This video can not be played There was a heavy police presence at UnterfÃ¶hring S-Bahn station in Munich A 26-year-old policewoman is fighting for her life after being shot in the head when a man grabbed a police gun at a suburban station in Munich. She shot back, wounding the gunman lightly. He is now in custody. Police said it was not a terrorist incident. Two bystanders were seriously hurt; one shot in the arm and one in the leg. A police team responded to reports of a brawl on a busy train and the man tried to push a policeman in front of an approaching train. In the ensuing struggle, he managed to get hold of a police gun and fired at least five shots, wounding the female officer and two bystanders. Despite her severe injuries, she managed to shoot him back. He fled the scene but was captured shortly afterwards. Police said one of the things they would attempt to find out through questioning was how he managed to bypass the security features on the gun. It happened at UnterfÃ¶hring S-Bahn station in the north of the city. The two bystanders are being treated in hospital for injuries that are not life-threatening. Police said the attacker was a 37-year-old German man, born in Bavaria, with no registered address. The state prosecutor said his previous criminal record consisted only of possession of a small amount of cannabis, but that he would now be charged with attempted murder. Police were quick to the scene He was ""motivated by personal reasons"" and acted alone, police spokesman Marcus da Gloria Martins said. Police said there was no further danger to the public. The S-Bahn line passing through UnterfÃ¶hring is one of the main routes to Munich airport. In May 2016 a man killed a commuter and injured three others in aknife attack at Grafing railway stationnear Munich. The man had run amok and was later found to be mentally ill.

"UK holidaymakers could still be caught out by high mobile phone bills despite a ban on roaming charges in the EU, the consumer group Which? has warned. Roaming charges, which are added by mobile operators for calls, texts and internet browsing when phone users are abroad, will be abolished from 15 June. It means UK travellers can use their regular allowance anywhere in the EU. But Which? warned exceeding allowances would still be chargeable while roaming territories varied between companies. It said different providers included different countries in their roaming territories, such as the Channel Islands and Switzerland. Exceeding agreed minutes, texts and data would still be charged in the EU as it would in the UK, with providers charging different rates, it added. Which? guide to EU roaming and international call charges,external ""Many will reap the benefits of these changes and will no longer be put off from making calls abroad,"" said Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services. ""However, it is important that you take a close look at what is or isn't included in your current mobile deal. Not knowing what's included could lead to some surprising charges on your next bill."" The Roam Like Home legislation is aimed, in part, at preventing consumers being caught out by huge bills when downloading films or other data during their European holidays. There have been a number of cases when mobile users have been landed with bills for hundreds of euros or pounds.

"This video can not be played Jo Cox's parents: 'We have to stay positive' On 16 June 2016, Labour MP Jo Cox was shot and stabbed in her constituency. Now, as the anniversary of her death approaches, her parents and sister say they are still learning to cope with the loss. As Jean Leadbeater, Jo's mother, waits to welcome us at her front door, the first thing she does is to pull everyone in for a hug. Jo's father, Gordon, is just behind her with a big smile on his face. They bustle around, getting the kettle on, as their daughter Kim makes the introductions. Within minutes, everyone is huddled around Kim's phone as she shows a video of her and Jo doing karaoke together. It was filmed at her birthday, just six weeks before her sister was murdered. It shows the two sisters in the middle of a party, but they're lost in the moment and may as well be alone in the room. This video can not be played Jo Cox sings karaoke with her sister Kim It's a poignant clip, and you might expect Jo's family to be in tears watching it. But actually, there are peals of laughter as the two women do their best impression of Elaine Paige and Barbara Dickson. And really, that sums this family up. They've gone through one of the toughest things imaginable and have emerged with their warmth and humour intact. But their grief is only just below the surface. Jo Cox was MP for Batley and Spen in Yorkshire Jean remembers the moment when she got the call telling her that her daughter been attacked: ""The phone rang and it was her aide. ""He said, 'Jo's been shot, I think.' That was it."" The couple didn't know if she was alive or dead as they raced to get to her. ""We jumped in the car, and we couldn't get near,"" she tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""So we set off running. I don't know how we ran. I don't know how we managed to get there."" Gordon picks up the story: ""If someone says, 'Jo's been shot,' that's bad. But people are shot and recover. So we didn't know."" But he describes a police inspector breaking the news: ""He doesn't have to tell you, you can see by his expression."" Kim listens to her parents silently, but the pain is etched across her face. Kim says her love for Jo's children is now ""100 times deeper"" She moves the conversation on, talking about how the family are now trying to ""create a new level of normality"". They don't focus on Jo's death, or the man who killed her. Jean admits the family ""will always be broken, because there's a piece missing"". ""I think to the outside world, we do appear strong, but there's a lot of days when it's bad. It's bad."" Floral tributes and candles were left at a vigil for Jo Cox in Parliament Square Gordon adds: ""It's not, after one year it gets better. It doesn't. It won't go away. But we have to be positive."" They now prefer to focus on Jo's children. Cuillin and Lejla were aged five and three when their mother died. ""Going forward, build on the children,"" Gordon says. ""Jo's children have got so much of her in them. That's a great legacy. We love that."" Sun and Mirror in joint editorial Election 'would have excited Jo' Man jailed for MP's murder Jean and Gordon's house, however, still retains many memories of Jo. When Jo decided to run for Parliament - and at the time was based in London - her parents decided to extend their home. They built a loft conversion on their bungalow for Jo to work from. Gordon admits he couldn't go up to the room for the three months after she died. But now, when their grandchildren come to stay, they all sleep in the loft together. Kim is a devoted auntie - and says her love for the children is ""100 times deeper now"". She admits that Jo's death has not fully hit her yet. ""I've got those facts, but I don't think I've got them on a deep emotional level yet, and that worries me. ""I'm not in denial. I think there must be a difference between denial and disbelief. I cannot believe that it's happened."" Kim led a tribute to her sister in the days following her death Kim has spent this year trying to build a legacy for her sister and best friend. Days after her sister's death, she gave a speech thanking people for their kindness. That was just the start. She has worked on causes that were close to Jo's heart, such as tackling loneliness and getting communities to integrate better. So this weekend, exactly a year after her sister's death, she will be at a series of events for the Great Get Together. She's asking people to organise street parties, barbecues and bake-offs as a reason to spend time with their neighbours. Because, as she puts it, ""me and Jo loved us food"". She says she is looking forward to it, but also feels ""some trepidation, because it will be a difficult weekend in some ways"". ""But it will also be a wonderful celebration - the best way to remember Jo, as she was all about people.""

"The Queen's Speech is written by ministers and read out by the monarch The Queen's Speech is that striking moment of parliamentary pageantry when the government sets out its legislative plans. But some proposals - based on the winning party's manifesto after an election - could be in doubt with Prime Minister Theresa May's Commons majority wiped out. One cabinet minister says elements of the Conservative manifesto will have to be ""pruned away"". Even the speech itself could bedelayed to allow for any changes as the ink takes days to dry on the goatskin parchment paper,externalfrom which the Queen reads. The Queen's Speech presents an outline of the government's planned legislation for the next Parliamentary session The party will now need the support of 10 MPs from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to get bills passed. BBC Election Live - rolling text and video updates A guide to what's happening Mark Mardell: May a 'prisoner' of No 10 What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Why does the UK print its laws on goat-skin? What was in the Tory manifesto? Tory MPs still aggrieved over perceived mistakes during the election campaign have called for certain manifesto measures to be dropped. However, they still want to be able to govern and as one backbencher told me: ""We don't want to cause Theresa May any more problems than she has already caused herself"". So which parts of the manifesto might face ministers' shears? Theresa May lost her party's Commons majority at the election There seems little chance that specific pledges on social care will make it anywhere near the Queen's Speech in the precise form they appeared in the manifesto. The plans - dubbed a ""dementia tax"" by critics - were for elderly people requiring care in their own homes to meet the cost - but they would be allowed to keep Â£100,000. Theresa May said there would be an absolute limit on the amount people would have to pay but denied claims of a U-turn despite the manifesto not mentioning a cap. The former chancellor George Osborne described ""dismay"" among Tory MPs that they were not consulted on the plans. He said the promises on social care were among those which made the manifesto go down as ""one of the most disastrous political documents in British history."" The plans could be replaced by a promise to launch a consultation on the future funding of social care. That may include a policy proposal document - or White Paper - outlining various alternatives, according to the former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin, who has had a hand in writing previous party manifestos and Queen's Speeches. He called for a ""a mature debate outside the heat of a general election campaign"" where MPs can look ""calmly and carefully"" at the options. The Tories said they wanted to reverse the ban on grammar schools Reversing the ban on selective education in England was one of Theresa May's signature policy proposals - backed by her joint chief of staff Nick Timothy. It features prominently in the Conservative manifesto, which claimed grammar schools almost completely eliminated the ""attainment gap between rich and poor pupils"". But a number of Conservative MPs have been uneasy about the plans - with one telling me they are ""now on the cards for not going forward"". It is among the policy areas that will come down to a calculation about simple parliamentary arithmetic says Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. He said the Queen's Speech will inevitably ""scrap anything that looks like it won't get absolute support"". Mr Timothy, who was sacked by the prime minister after the election, said he took responsibility for overseeing the policy programme during the campaign. Pensions Some Conservative MPs were concerned about pension plans The Conservative manifesto proposed ditching the ""triple lock"", in which pensions are raised in line with the highest of average earnings, prices or 2.5%. From 2020, the plan was to cut the 2.5% element, to leave a ""double lock"". Some Tory MPs were concerned about way the plans were perceived by their elderly voter base, but others believe the double lock is still fair. The delivery of pensions is one of a large number of areas of social policy that is devolved in Northern Ireland. However this is where things get hard to predict, as there is a complicated parliamentary procedure to determine whether MPs from non-English seats can vote on such matters relating to England - and so Tory ministers might still want to take account of the DUP's views. The DUP's 2017 manifesto for its Westminster seats in Northern Ireland said it ""always advocated for the interests of older people"". The Tory proposal is ""not in line"" with DUP policy, according to Nelson McCausland, the party's former member for North Belfast in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The DUP manifesto pledged to ""support the maintenance of the pensions 'triple lock'."" The Conservative manifesto announced plans to means-test winter fuel payments for pensioners in England and Wales. It was another controversial pledge likely to meet resistance from some Conservative MPs - but again this is complicated by the fact that the benefits payment is a devolved issue. The Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson has said Scottish pensioners should continue to get the payments because the country is colder. The SNP-led Scottish government had already said it would not introduce a means test in Scotland. The DUP manifesto says the party is ""proud"" of the universal benefits introduced in Northern Ireland, saying it would ""resist any assault"" on winter fuel payments there. Brexit minister David Davis led the process of the UK leaving the EU A huge part of the government's legislative plan isthe so-called Great Repeal Billwhich aims to ensure European law will no longer apply in the UK. The bill will ensure all existing EU legislation will be copied across into domestic UK law to ensure a smooth transition on the day after Brexit. It is likely to be ""one of the largest legislative projects ever undertaken in the UK"", according to the House of Commons library. Legally, this ""has to happen"" says Professor Bale. ""That will have to go in (the Queen's Speech) - I think everybody agrees that's absolutely necessary,"" he says. But with no formal majority, there is renewed potential for tension within the party over Brexit plans - particularly over the precise arrangements for leaving the single market and the customs union. There is now an important new constituent part of the Tory parliamentary party in Westminster - 13 Scottish Conservative MPs. The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has called for an ""open Brexit"" that keeps the ""largest amount of access"" to the single market. Professor Bale believes the stripping down of other parts of the Queen's Speech ""might not be a bad thing"" because Brexit will be the dominant legislative issue.
