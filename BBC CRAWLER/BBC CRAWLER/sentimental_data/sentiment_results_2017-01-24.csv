"Most of the papers lead on the fall-out from the government's Brexit court defeat The Brexit Supreme Court ruling makes the lead for nearly all the papers, but one of the most eye-catching headlines can be found in the inside pages of the Daily Mail. ""Champions of the People"",it proclaims,external, praising the three justices who found themselves in the minority as they sided with the government in the case. The Mail attracted controversy in November when it branded three High Court judges ""enemies of the people"" for ruling Parliament had to be consulted over Brexit. The Mail thinks it is not good for democracy that this decision has been now backed by the Supreme Court, arguing this, in effect, turns the EU referendum into a ""mere opinion poll"". TheGuardian,externalis pleased with the Supreme Court judgement, saying it upheld a major constitutional principle in the face of what it describes as ""shameful attacks"" by the Brexit press. It think the government should now publish a formal White Paper on its goals for Brexit. But theFinancial Times,externalwarns MPs against trying to micro-manage the negotiations. TheDaily Telegraph,externalsays Parliament has a duty to act responsibly and not seek a re-run of the referendum campaign. ""What's not to like when British judges in Britain's Supreme Court rule that British law makes the British Parliament sovereign,"" is theDaily Mirror,externaltake on Tuesday's Brexit ruling. But it is not an opinion that is shared by all the leader writers. The Times warns the Lordsagainst trying to frustrate Brexit,external. It would do so at its peril, says the paper, adding: ""Showdowns between the two houses rarely end well for the Lords and the country does not need yet another constitutional headache."" TheDaily Telegraph,externalsays that ministers are privately warning the government is prepared to flood the Lords with hundreds of Conservative peers if it obstructs the process of leaving the EU. TheDaily Mail,externalbelieves new recruits are being discouraged from joining the Army because of historical inquiries into soldiers who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. It says the Army remains 4% below its required strength, the nearly 7,000 cadets who signed up in the past year being about 3,000 short of the target. A group campaigning to end the investigations tells the Mail that the figures are no surprise, asking why anyone would want to join the forces when they could be hounded for years. TheFinancial Times,externalthinks the world ought to start taking seriously US President Donald Trump's threat to impose trade tariffs in order to protect American goods. In an editorial it argues that many still assume he is bluffing in order to win better deals. But, it says, the first few days of his presidency have shown that he is not posturing and he thinks protectionism will make America richer. The FT wonders how far he will get before he and his country both discover just how wrong he is. The reported Trident missile failure may have made the headlines in recent days, but theTimes,externalreminds us that problems involving nuclear submarines are not new. It reports on a CIA document which has revealed that a Soviet submarine and an American one, which was carrying a 160 nuclear warheads, crashed into each other in 1974 near Holy Loch, about 30 miles from Glasgow. One expert says the crash was so serious there was a danger that the crews could have tried to defend themselves - believing they were under attack - leading to the possibility of war. The growing number of homes with wood-burning stoves is partly being blamed forworsening air pollution levels in London,external, according to the Daily Telegraph. Air quality readings in some parts of the capital were worse this week than in Beijing. The weather and traffic pollution have led to the alert but, according to experts at King's College, wood fires were also responsible with more than a million homes now having the stoves. David Cameron explains in the Times why he is becoming the president of Alzheimer's Research UK On its front page, theDaily Mirror,externalagain has photos of drivers clutching their mobiles while out on the road. Four months after the paper began its campaign to change public attitudes, it asks, ""When will we ever learn?"" A traffic officer tells the paper he has heard every excuse in the book from the drivers he has pulled over. He says one builder tried to throw his phone out the window when he was caught, while another woman insisted she did not own one, until it went off under the seat where she had hidden it. The Mirror says cars and vans are deadly weapons in the hands of what it calls ""mobile phone morons"" and calls for more of them to be banned. Inthe Times,external, David Cameron explains why he is becoming the president of Alzheimer's Research UK. He says there needs to be a deeper understanding of the disease so that dementia is not accepted as inevitable in later life. The paper says the article represents his ""first important political intervention since leaving Downing Street"". It thinks Mr Cameron is concerned that Theresa May could downgrade funding for dementia research which for him was a ""personal priority.""

"This video can not be played New F1 boss Chase Carey on big talking points Formula 1's new racing boss Ross Brawn says he wants to develop a purer, simpler sport in which more teams and drivers can win. The ex-Mercedes team boss, who has been appointed managing director of racing by F1's new owner, was critical of some rule changes of recent years. Brawn said he wanted to ""narrow the gap between the top and bottom"" of the field and give F1 a broader appeal. ""I have ideas we should study and perhaps use in 2018 or 19,"" he said. Brawn pointed to the example of football's Premier League, where Leicester City were able to transform themselves from relegation candidates to champions in the space of 12 months and on a limited budget. The 62-year-old said: ""We all know the analogy of Leicester City - that would be the ideal in F1, when a good team on a great year with a great driver could really mount a challenge. But at the moment that's not really possible."" Brawn has been acting as a consultant to new owner Liberty Media during the takeover process Brawn is a member of a new senior management team appointedfollowing the removal of Bernie Ecclestone from his position as chief executive. American media executive Chase Carey, who was appointed president when new ownerLiberty Media began its takeover in September, has now also taken on Ecclestone's former title. Brawn is heading up the sporting and technical side of Liberty's business and former ESPN sales and marketing chief Sean Bratches is to run the commercial side. Carey has outlined plans to better promote the sport,by making more of grands prix as events in their host country and with a much wider use of digital media. Brawn's job is to hone the on-track show to make it more appealing after criticism it has become predictable and has lost some of its edge in recent years. He was critical of decisions made by Ecclestone, such as the adoption of a double-points finale in 2014 and a short-lived attempt to change the format of qualifying at the start of last season. He told BBC Sport: ""These have been short-term, knee-jerk reactions and that is exactly what we mustn't do. This video can not be played F1 needs a fresh start - Carey ""We need to stabilise the small teams and get them on a better financial footing. ""We need to reduce the scope of the technology because there is too big a gap between the bigger and smaller teams."" He also hinted he wanted to remove the controversial drag reduction system, an overtaking aid that drivers can use at the press of a button to give them a boost in straight-line speed. ""We need to make sure there is no artificial solutions,"" Brawn said. ""The drag reduction system; everyone knows it's artificial. We need to find purer solutions. ""We need to think through the solutions. I have ideas - I can't share them all with you because I want to share them with the teams first - but I have ideas of things we should start to study and perhaps use in '18 or '19."" Brawn said the high-technology aspect of F1 was a crucial part of its appeal but added: ""You must balance the technology with the sporting side."" He indicated he would be open to trying to change the turbo hybrid engines introduced in 2014, which have seen revolutionary steps forward in terms of fuel efficiency but which have been criticised for being too expensive and sounding dull. Mechanics work on a Scuderia Toro Rosso car during the 2016 F1 season ""That is something we need to discuss with the teams,"" Brawn said. ""They have made a huge investment in these engines so you can't just discard them and say: 'We are going to change the engines.' ""But how do we get from where we are today to where we want to be in two or three years' time with a great racing engine that everyone admires and enjoys?"" Part of the reason for the lack of competitiveness is the huge spread of budgets between the front and back of the grid. Brawn said: ""The level of resource the top teams are using has made an enormous gap. My nirvana would be you get slightly odd circumstances and suddenly a team from the back wins. But at the moment you have two or three teams who can win and we need to spread that."" He said a budget cap was a ""delicate"" issue, but added: ""It has never really been tried, it was never fully adopted by Formula 1, and I think we should at least discuss it again and see if there's potential."" But he said there were other ways of closing up the field. ""We have to see if we can develop the rules to reward innovation less,"" Brawn said. ""Because as it is now innovation is heavily rewarded and if you can afford it, the slope is still quite steep - more money, faster cars. If we can flatten that off with the regulations that would go in the right direction."" He also said he would like to try to establish a 'draft' system for promoting drivers from junior categories so the drivers who make it into F1 were there ""purely on merit"". Historically, some drivers at the back of the grid have paid for their seats in F1. ""What I'd love to see is a proper progression of talent into F1 where you could even introduce a draft system where the guys who win the GP2 or Formula 2 are available for the lower teams to use in their first year or two in Formula 1.""

"Nicole Cooke won the Olympic road race in Beijing in 2008 Ex-Olympic champion Nicole Cooke says she is ""sceptical"" of Team Sky's drug-free credentials and Sir Bradley Wiggins' therapeutic use exemptions. Wiggins was granted three TUEs to take anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone before the 2011 and 2012 Tour de France and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. ""Taking TUEs just before major events raises questions for me,"" Cooke said. Cooke also told MPs British Cycling is run ""by men for men"" and its attempts to stop doping are ""ineffective"". Wiggins' TUEs were approved by British authorities and cycling's world governing body the UCI, and there is no suggestion either the 36-year-old or his former employers Team Sky have broken any rules. Cooke, 33, made the claims in evidence submitted to a Culture, Media and Sport select committee on Tuesday. The committee is examining doping in sport and Tuesday's session was held to discuss issues raised ata previous hearing involving British Cycling and Team Sky in December. In a wide-ranging testimony, Cooke provided examples of sexism she had encountered in her 13-year career, stating British Cycling shows ""discrimination and favouritism"" because it is ""answerable to itself"". The Welsh former world and Commonwealth cycling champion added that the fight against doping is ""the wrong people fighting the wrong war, in the wrong way, with the wrong tools"". ""While there is still a way to go, British Cycling is absolutely committed to resolving the historic gender imbalance in our sport,"" said the governing body in a statement. British Cycling is the subject of an investigation by UK Anti-Doping into allegations of wrongdoing in the sport and is also awaiting the findings of an independent review into an alleged bullying culture. Five-time Olympic champion Wiggins was granted a TUE to treat asthma and allergies, which was revealed when hacking groupFancy Bears released athletes' medical filesstolen from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Cooke compared her use of the steroid triamcinolone with that of Wiggins, stating she was granted a TUE for injections of the drug to treat a career-threatening knee injury as an alternative to surgery. She said she did not race again until ""long after the performance-enhancing effects had worn off"", and she added that Wiggins appeared to use the ""same steroid before his main goals of the season"". Cooke added she found the chronology of Wiggins' TUEs ""disturbing"" and that it made her ""sceptical"" of what Team Sky have done. The team was launched in 2010 with a zero-tolerance approach towards doping in cycling. This video can not be played Watch: Brailsford's tense grilling on Team Sky An inquiry by Ukad was launched following aDaily Mail allegation,externalthat a medical package was delivered to Wiggins on the final day of the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine. Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford told MPs in December that the package contained legal decongestant Fluimucil, but MP Damian Collins, chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, says British Cycling have beenunable to provide paperworkto prove the contents of the medical package. ""I find the stance of being the cleanest team, yet Dave Brailsford not being able to say what a rider took, definitely makes it hard to back up that claim,"" Cooke added. She alsoraised concernsas to why Simon Cope, who was British Cycling women's coach at the time, was chosen to courier the package to Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman in France. ""I do find it very surprising that Simon Cope transported something internationally without knowing what was in it,"" Cooke told MPs. She also alleged that Cope, a former team-mate of Wiggins at the Linda McCartney professional team, ""spent some weeks riding a moped in front of Wiggins as part of a training regimen"" as an example of how resources were ""stripped out of the women's program to augment the men's program"". When asked by MPs if sexism was culturally embedded in British Cycling, Cooke said: ""Yes I do"". She claimed that during her career, the governing body showed only ""transient"" support for female road riders. As part of her written evidence and appearance via video-link from Paris, Cooke cited numerous examples of ""discrimination and favouritism"" shown by British Cycling. She said the prize for the women's 2006 British Championships was a ""tiny fraction"" of the men's race, despite Cooke having just won the Grande Boucle Feminine Internationale - the women's equivalent of the Tour de France. The 2008 road race world champion added she had to take her own skin suit to the event in Italy after British Cycling had forgotten to organise one, having to then sew a Team Sky logo onto it at the behest of Brailsford. ""The facts are they did nothing for the women,"" said Cooke. An independent review into the culture of British Cycling began after its former technical director Shane Sutton was accused of using offensive and discriminatory language towards cyclist Jess Varnish. Despite beingcleared of eight of the nine charges against him,the Australian was found guilty of using sexist language in October but denies any wrongdoing and said  he would appeal the ruling. In her written evidence, Cooke said she had ""no faith in the actions in support of investigations conducted by Ukad or the testing they conduct, both completed at significant expense to the public purse"". In response, Ukad said: ""There should be no doubt about the determination of this organisation to protect clean sport; our staff passionately believe in protecting everyone's right to clean, fair and honest competition. Regarding Cooke's accusations of sexism, British Cycling said in a statement: ""There is always more that can be done and we strive to make continual improvements to ensure that cycling is reaching out to women and girls of all ages and abilities."" Meanwhile, UK Sport has launched an independent review to investigate some of the issues raised by Cooke. ""UK Sport takes its responsibilities as an investor of public funds and a champion of equality in sport very seriously,"" said a spokesman.

"US President Donald Trump signing the abortion-related order in the Oval Office A group of men standing around a desk: it is not the typical image that goes viral online. The photograph in question was taken on US President Donald Trump's first day in the Oval Office on Monday, whenhe signed a ban on federal money going to international groupsthat perform or provide information on abortions. ""Men making decisions about women's bodies"" was a much-repeated phrase on Twitter, as it was shared hundreds of thousands of times, including by author JK Rowling. The concern over lack of women at the table comes as Mr Trump's cabinet attractsattention for the high proportion of white, male nominations.,external And while some people welcomed the move on abortion, others on social media expressed alarm and confusion over what its impact could be. Viral images and headlines do not always tell the whole story. So here is an at-a-glance look at what President Trump's executive order means. Not in itself. This particular executive order is relevant outside of US borders. The policy requires non-governmental organisations receiving federal funding to agree to ""neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations"". This particularly worries women's rights campaigners in developing countries, where funds or facilities are already limited. Anti-abortion activists at a rally outside the Supreme Court in Washington last year Although this policy does not directly affect services in the US, Mr Trump has said he supports an abortion ban at home. His signing of this order as one of his first executive actions indicates he still sees the issue as a priority. Republicans and Democrats have been involved in a political tug-of-war over the issue for decades. Republican President Ronald Reagan first created the Mexico City Policy in 1984, stopping funding for international groups which perform or provide information on abortions. But Democrats later rescinded it under the Clinton administration. An abortion-rights campaigner in Chicago, protesting after President Trump's election win It was reinstated when President George W Bush took over in 2001 and overturned again by President Barack Obama in 2009. And now it is back. The order's official name is the Mexico City Policy because President Reagan first implemented it at a United Nations population conference in Mexico City. Critics of the policy say organisations working around the world feel censored by it because they cannot offer women full advice on family planning. If they flout the rules, they lose funding which, in some cases, could threaten certain projects or the whole organisation. However, pro-life groups have welcomed the new administration's swift move. ""President Trump's immediate action to promote respect for all human life, including vulnerable unborn children abroad, as well as conscience rights, sends a strong signal about his administration's pro-life priorities,"" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of US pro-life organisation Susan Anthony List. No. Like many governmental decisions, the rules on abortion are often determined by male officials. Many on social media were quick to point out that the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling - seen as a landmark case for abortion rights in the US - was delivered by an all-male Supreme Court. The Roe v Wade decision says abortion is legal until a foetus is viable, typically between 22 and 24 weeks. The new US president has previously changed his mind on the issue. He has gone from being pro-choice in 1999 to being against abortion today, although he says he would allow exceptions such as in the case of rape or incest. On the presidential campaign trail, he said he believed ""some form of punishment"" should be in place for women who have abortions, if the practice is banned. This video can not be played Donald Trump shifts again on abortion But, after strong criticism, he released a statement saying that only the doctor or practitioner should be punished, not the woman. In an interview withCBS News, Mr Trump said: ""The laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way."" He refused to say whether he believed abortion was murder, but he later conceded that he could not disagree with the statement. Donald Trump shifts again on abortion.

One of the first ways a new president is able to exercise political power is through unilateral executive orders. While legislative efforts take time, a swipe of the pen from the White House can often enact broad changes in government policy and practice. President Donald Trump has wasted little time in taking advantage of this privilege. Given his predecessor's reliance on executive orders to circumvent Congress in the later days of his presidency, he has a broad range of areas in which to flex his muscle. What are executive orders? Here's a look at some of what Mr Trump has done so far: Mr Trump signed the order at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) undoing a key part of the Obama administration's efforts to tackle global warming. The order reverses the Clean Power Plan, which had required states to regulate power plants, but had been on hold while being challenged in court. Before signing the order, a White House official told the press that Mr Trump does believe in human-caused climate change, but that the order was necessary to ensure American energy independence and jobs. Environmental groups warn that undoing those regulations will have serious consequences at home and abroad. ""I think it is a climate destruction plan in place of a climate action plan,"" the Natural Resources Defense Council's David Doniger told the BBC, adding that they will fight the president in court. Immediate impact: A coalition of 17 states filed a legal challenge against the Trump administration's decision to roll back climate change regulations. The challenge, led by New York state, argued that the administration has a legal obligation to regulate emissions of the gases believed to cause global climate change. Mars Inc, Staples and The Gap are among US corporations who are also challenging Mr Trump's reversal on climate change policy. After an angry weekend in Florida in which he accused former-president Barack Obama of wiretapping his phones at Trump Tower, Mr Trump returned to the White House to sign a revised version of his controversial travel ban. The executive order titled ""protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States"" was signed out of the view of the White House press corps on 6 March. The order's new language is intended to skirt the legal pitfalls that caused his first travel ban to be halted by the court system. The updated ban: Temporarily halts entry to citizens for 90-days of six Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen) Removes Iraq from the previous list, due to increased vetting of its own citizens Delays implementation until 16 March Allows current visa holders to travel to the US Does not affect permanent visa holders (Green Card holders) Suspends the refugee programme for 120 days Treats Syrians like any other refugee or immigrant Removes the religious clause favouring religious minorities - namely Christians Immediate impact: Soon after the order was signed, it was once again blocked by a federal judge, this time in Hawaii. Trump signs new travel-ban directive Surrounded by farmers and Republican lawmakers, Mr Trump signed an order on 28 February directing the EPA and the Army Corp of Engineers to reconsider a rule issued by President Obama. The 2015 regulation - known as the Waters of the United States rule - gave authority to the federal government over small waterways, including wetlands, headwaters and small ponds. The rule required Clean Water Act permits for any developer that wished to alter or damage these relatively small water resources, which the president described as ""puddles"" in his signing remarks. Opponents of Mr Obama's rule, including industry leaders, condemned it as a massive power grab by Washington. Scott Pruitt, Mr Trump's pick to lead the EPA, will now begin the task of rewriting the rule, and a new draft is not expected for several years. Immediate impact: The EPA has been ordered to rewrite, or even repeal the rule, but first it must be reviewed. Water protection laws were passed by Congress long before Mr Obama's rule was announced, so it cannot simply be undone with the stroke of a pen. Instead the EPA must re-evaluate how to interpret the 1972 Clean Water Act. A bill the president signed on 16 February put an end to an Obama-era regulation that aimed at protecting waterways from coal mining waste. Senator Mitch McConnell had called the rule an ""attack on coal miners"". The US Interior Department, which reportedly spent years drawing up the regulation before it was issued in December, had said it would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests. An attempt to cut down on the burden of small businesses. Described as a ""two-out, one-in"" approach, the order asked government departments that request a new regulation to specify two other regulations they will drop. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will manage the regulations and is expected to be led by the Republican Mick Mulvaney. Some categories of regulation will be exempt from the ""two-out, one-in"" clause - such as those dealing with the military and national security and ""any other category of regulations exempted by the Director"". Immediate impact:Wait and see. Trump moves to cut business regulation Probably his most controversial action, so far, taken to keep the country safe from terrorists, the president said. It included: suspension of refugee programme for 120 days, and cap on 2017 numbers indefinite ban on Syrian refugees ban on anyone arriving from seven Muslim-majority countries, with certain exceptions cap of 50,000 refugees The effect was felt at airports in the US and around the world as people were stopped boarding US-bound flights or held when they landed in the US. Immediate impact:Enacted pretty much straight away. But there are battles ahead. Federal judges brought a halt to deportations, and legal rulings appear to have put an end to the travel ban - much to the president's displeasure. Trump border policy: Who's affected? A fence is already in place along much of the US-Mexico border On Mr Trump's first day as a presidential candidate in June 2015, he made securing the border with Mexico a priority. He pledged repeatedly at rallies to ""build the wall"" along the southern border, saying it would be ""big, beautiful, and powerful"". Now he has signed a pair of executive orders designed to fulfil that campaign promise. One order declares that the US will create ""a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier"". The second order pledges to hire 10,000 more immigration officers, and to revoke federal grant money from so-called ""sanctuary cities"" which refuse to deport undocumented immigrants. It remains to be seen how Mr Trump will pay for the wall, although he has repeatedly insisted that it will be fully paid for by the Mexican government, despite their leaders saying otherwise. Immediate impact:The Department of Homeland Security has a ""small"" amount of money available (about $100m) to use immediately, but that won't get them very far. Construction of the wall will cost billions of dollars - money that Congress will need to approve. Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Republican-led Congress will need to come up with $12-$15bn more, and the funding fight - and any construction - will come up against issues with harsh terrain, private land owners and opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans. The department will also need additional funds from Congress to hire more immigration officers, but the order will direct the head of the agency to start changing deportation priorities. Cities targeted by the threat to remove federal grants will likely build legal challenges, but without a court injunction, the money can be removed. The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, along with Arizona Democrat Raul Graijalva, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. They argue the Department of Homeland Security is required to draft a new environmental review of the impacts of the wall and other border enforcement activities as it could damage public lands. How exactly will Trump 'build the wall'? With the stroke of a pen... On his second full working day, the president signed two orders to advance construction of two controversial pipelines - the Keystone XL and Dakota Access. Mr Trump told reporters the terms of both deals would be renegotiated, and using American steel was a requirement. Keystone, a 1,179-mile (1,897km) pipeline running from Canada to US refineries in the Gulf Coast, was halted by President Barack Obama in 2015 due to concerns over the message it would send about climate change. The second pipeline was halted last year as the Army looked at other routes, amid huge protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe at a North Dakota site. Immediate impact:Mr Trump has granted a permit to TransCanada, the Keystone XL builder, to move forward with the controversial pipeline. As a result, TransCanada will drop an arbitration claim for $15bn in damages it filed under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Trump made no mention of an American steel requirement. Construction will not start until the company obtains a permit from Nebraska's Public Service Commission. The Dakota Access pipeline has since been filled with oil and the company is in the process of preparing to begin moving oil. Keystone XL pipeline: Why is it so disputed? Dakota Pipeline: What's behind the controversy? In one of his first actions as president, Mr Trump issued a multi-paragraph directive to the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies involved in managing the nation's healthcare system. The order states that agencies must ""waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay"" any portions of the Affordable Care Act that creates financial burden on states, individuals or healthcare providers. Although the order technically does not authorise any powers the executive agencies do not already have, it's viewed as a clear signal that the Trump administration will be rolling back Obama-era healthcare regulations wherever possible. Immediate impact: Republicans failed to secure an overhaul of the US healthcare system due to a lack of support for the legislation. That means Mr Trump's executive order is one of the only remaining efforts to undermine Obamacare. Can Obamacare be repealed? Abortion activists were among the many protesters that came out against Trump's presidency one day after his inauguration What's called the Mexico City policy, first implemented in 1984 under Republican President Ronald Reagan, prevents foreign non-governmental organisations that receive any US cash from ""providing counselling or referrals for abortion or advocating for access to abortion services in their country"", even if they do so with other funding. The ban, derided as a ""global gag rule"" by its critics, has been the subject of a political tug-of-war ever since its inception, with every Democratic president rescinding the measure, and every Republican bringing it back. Anti-abortion activists expected Mr Trump to act quickly on this - and he didn't disappoint them. Immediate impact:The policy will come into force as soon as the Secretaries of State and Heath write an implementation plan and apply to both renewals and new grants. The US State Department has notified the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that US funding for United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) would be withdrawn, arguing that it supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation. The agency has denied this, pointing to examples of its life-saving work in more than 150 countries and territories. This policy will be much broader than the last time the rule was in place - the Guttmacher Institute, Kaiser Family Foundation and Population Action International believe the order, as written, will apply to all global health funding by the US, instead of only reproductive health or family planning. Trump's order on abortion policy: What does it mean? The TPP pact would have affected 40% of global trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, once viewed as the crown jewel of Barack Obama's international trade policy, was a regular punching bag for Mr Trump on the campaign trail (although he at timesseemed uncertain,externalabout what nations were actually involved). The deal was never approved by Congress so it had yet to go into effect in the US. Therefore the formal ""withdrawal"" is more akin to a decision on the part of the US to end ongoing international negotiations and let the deal wither and die. Immediate impact: Takes effect immediately. In the meantime, some experts are worried China will seek to replace itself in the deal or add TPP nations to its own free trade negotiations, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), excluding the US.

"This video can not be played New F1 boss Chase Carey on big talking points Bernie Ecclestone has been removed as Formula 1's boss because the sport ""needs a fresh start"", says new chairman Chase Carey. Carey has been put in charge by Liberty Media, the US group whichcompleted its $8bn (Â£6.4bn) takeoverof the sport. The American told BBC Sport he had ""tremendous respect"" for Ecclestone, but F1 ""needs to be run differently than for the last four or five years"". ""Bernie is a one-man team. It was not right in today's world,"" he said. ""The decision-making is not as effective as it needs to be. Clearly it has to be improved."" Ecclestone has been removed as chief executive but offered a new advisory role as chairman emeritus. Carey said Liberty had major plans to grow F1 around the world. He said: F1 is a ""unique, iconic, global event that is a spectacle second to none"" The sport has not grown in recent years as much as it needed to and Liberty could exploit new technologies to do that Liberty would protect historic races and sees Europe as the ""foundation"" of the sport It would expand, particularly with a view to new events in the US Liberty wanted to make much more of the promotion of F1 itself, its participants and individual events Therewill be a British Grand Prixdespite speculation Silverstone could be dropped by 2019 This video can not be played Ecclestone still has a lot to offer - Horner Carey was installed in September and said he had decided over the past four months that Ecclestone, 86, was no longer the right person to run F1. ""We needed a sport that while respecting what made it great has a sense of energy and innovation,"" Carey said. ""In many ways, in a simplistic sense, the sport said 'no' too much and we have to start saying 'yes' - not gimmick it up but find ways to do new and exciting things to have the sport continue to grow and interest and excite people."" He said Ecclestone had not been happy about the change but had accepted his new role. ""I would expect this is difficult for Bernie,"" Carey said. ""He has run this sport for his entire adult life and I respect completely that this is a difficult change. ""We have tried to deal with him with the respect he's due, which is why we offered him the chairman emeritus title. ""I have been sincere in saying I value his help and advice as we go forward. ""He calls himself a dictator. He has run it as a one-man dictator for a long time. I think the sport needs a fresh perspective. But he has a lot to continue to offer and he will always be part of the F1 family."" Liberty has brought in former Mercedes F1 team boss Ross Brawn and ex-ESPN sales executive Sean Bratches to run the sporting and commercial sides of F1 under him. Why F1's titanic leader was loved & loathed We will have a British Grand Prix - Carey Listen: Chequered Flag podcast Carey added the governance of F1 needed an overhaul. ""I don't know whether the decision-making is not what it should be because there is too much history amongst the players,"" he said. ""One of the benefits we bring is a fresh start. We don't have an agenda other than to make the sport great for its fans and that gives us an opportunity to look at how do we create more of a partnership  - everybody has a shared vision of where do we want to go and we can align that vision and have everybody trying to move in the same direction."" Carey said he felt F1 was not making the most of its appeal to fans around the world. ""Bernie deserves enormous credit for the sport he built,"" Carey said. ""It just got sold for $8bn so the proof is in the numbers. ""But the reality is to be competitive in today's world you need to continue to find ways to connect and excite fans and we need to use all the digital platforms available, have a marketing capability to tell the stories of the rivalries of the stars. ""They are larger-than-life personalities and you have to take advantage of all the rules to make that story everything it can be, have to make events larger than ever, music and entertainment with sport at the centre of it. ""I have talked about 21 Super Bowls and that is really what we should have. And then work with our partners - teams, sponsors, promoters, regulator - to ensure the race itself is everything it can be."" Liberty is to give F1 teams the opportunity to buy equity in the sport. They have rejected an initial offer but talks are ongoing. ""We would like to be more aligned with the teams and those discussions are ongoing,"" Carey said. ""We initially made a proposal that had too short a timeframe and we have found a way to have discussion that can have an appropriate level of exchange. ""Out of discussions of equity will be discussions of where do we want the sport to be. There is a great deal of interest in the equity but first and foremost it is about trying to create more of an alignment with the teams about the future of the business."" He added Liberty would look at the prize-money structure, which many inside the sport believe is too skewed in favour of the leading teams. ""We'd like owning a team to be good business, running a track to be good business and F1 is a good business, and together we are all figuring out how to share in making the whole business stronger,"" Carey said. ""But dealing with revenue is complicated."" Many European races are struggling to cope with the high race fees Ecclestone demanded, but Carey said he hoped to find a way to make them more successful financially. ""I don't think we will make them more affordable,"" he said. ""We will make them more successful. We want to be more of a partner. To be in the US we are not going to own tracks but we will be more of a partner in trying to figure it out. ""We think these events should be bigger and more profitable than they are and we think, properly run, these events should continue to grow and be even more successful."" Carey said the leading drivers were ""great personalities"" and he wanted to ""provide enough opportunities for fans to connect with those personalities"". And he added safety was ""critical"". ""Go and watch one of these cars drive down a track,"" he said. ""Anyone who tells me that is not dangerous by definition and awe-inspiring hasn't been to one of these races. ""What they do is truly unique. We have a responsibility to make it as safe as we can without undermining the sport.""

"This video can not be played Explosives set off by US tree surgeon Jon Sterkel to celebrate his wife's pregnancy. A US man who celebrated news that his wife was expecting a baby boy by setting off an explosion in Nebraska is facing police action which could result in a year in jail and a fine. Tree surgeon Jon Sterkel told the BBC he used an explosive rifle target which sent blue smoke billowing into the air. The blast was reportedly so loud that it was heard nearly 5km (3 miles) away. Mr Sterkel has apologised after causing a police alert. He said that he was not aware his actions were illegal. ""The explosives I bought are readily available in most department stores, and even most law enforcers I have spoken to are not aware that they are illegal,"" he told the BBC. He said that he had detonated exploding targets before on his remote farmland west of Scottsbluff, Nebraska, without upsetting anyone. How are new babies celebrated around the world? He said that Saturday's explosion contained blue smoke - caused by chalk powder - to tell the outside world that his wife Ashley is expecting a baby boy. Mr Sterkel and his wife Ashley are expecting a baby boy Mr Sterkel, 26, can be heard proclaiming ""it's a boy!"" on the video of the explosion which has been widely featured on numerous US websites. But the blast was so loud that police in nearby Scottsbluff were alerted, with some residents concerned that a major disaster had taken place. Mr Sterkel said that he immediately called the local sheriff to explain what had happened in addition to  apologising for his actions. ""I would like to say sorry for all of the confusion,"" he said. ""I am a man of character and will willingly go to court if the district attorney chooses to prosecute me. ""This was just our way of announcing what gender our baby was."" Mr Sterkel faces charges for detonating the explosive without a valid permit. There was no damage or injury but he could be punished with a prison sentence and a fine of $1,000 (Â£800). Police told the Omaha World Herald,externalthat although exploding targets, which are detonated when shot with a high powered rifle, have recently become popular, people who use them need to follow the correct procedures. Mr Sterkel told the BBC that he does not plan any more spectacular blasts once the baby, his first child, is born around 16 June. And the baby's name?

"Ecclestone won two world titles with Brabham Bernie Ecclestone stands a little under 5ft 3in tall but for 40 years has wielded a giant influence in Formula 1 with canniness, wit and not a little menace. At times, Ecclestone has had close to absolute power. So the end of his reign following thetakeover of the sportby US giant Liberty Media represents a seismic change. Ecclestone, now 86, is a tactician of remarkable skill, and a deal-maker extraordinaire who used chutzpah and brinksmanship to turn F1 into one of the world's biggest sports, form relationships with world leaders such as Russian president Vladimir Putin and make himself and many of F1's participants multi-millionaires. In a remarkable four decades, Ecclestone revolutionised the sport: He bought the Brabham team and won two world titles, including a historic first with a turbo engine in 1983. Turned F1 into the biggest annual sporting event in the world, outstripped only by the Olympics and the World Cup. Controversially took the commercial rights away from the teams and made himself a billionaire. Fought off a criminal prosecution for blackmail that arose from a complicated series of sales of those rights. Carved a notorious reputation for making controversial statements, including saying Adolf Hitler was ""able to get things done"" and likening women to ""domestic appliances"". But what made him mind-bendingly - some would say obscenely - rich is what brought him down in the end. Selling on the commercial rights to F1 is the source of Ecclestone's vast wealth. But it was never about the money, per se - it was about the deal. And now the deal has done him in. Restructuring the finances of the sport in the first years of this decade, Ecclestone also reorganised its decision-making process. This video can not be played Ecclestone still has a lot to offer - Horner He did it to increase his power, but the structure he set up inadvertently neutered him and gave the big teams - particularly Mercedes and Ferrari - power to block him. This has led to log-jam. The latest company to buy the sport - USA's Liberty Media - has looked at this, at a skewed prize-money structure, at a policy that is threatening to price out much-loved historic races in favour of characterless new ones in countries withquestionable regimes,at a refusal to engage with digital media, and several other issues, and decided to ease him out. Ecclestone is held in genuinely high regard within F1 for everything he has achieved but, outside a handful of acolytes, few will be genuinely sorry to see him go. There has been a feeling for some years that he is a man out of time, that the sport needed to move on. In truth, this has contributed to the stalemate in F1 - people were simply waiting him out. Many believe his departure will be good for the sport. However, it will certainly make F1 less colourful, and it is hard to imagine seeing the like of him again. Ecclestone's involvement in F1 started in the late 1950s. After a brief driving career in lower categories, he emerged as a manager for the British F1 driver Stuart Lewis-Evans but then disappeared from racing when Lewis-Evans was killed in a fiery crash at the 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix. He appeared again in the late 1960s, again as a manager, this time to the Austrian Jochen Rindt. He was already very rich. Ecclestone (second from right) with James Hunt, Niki Lauda and Ronnie Peterson before the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix What had the fortune come from? ""Property,"" Ecclestone says. All manner of rumours have abounded, including that he was involved in organising the Great Train Robbery, when Â£2.6m was stolen from a Royal Mail train in Buckinghamshire in 1963. ""Nah,"" Ecclestone once said. ""There wasn't enough money on that train. I could have done something better than that."" Rindt became F1's first and so far only posthumous world champion after he was killed at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix. But this time Ecclestone did not retreat. Within a couple of years, he bought Brabham from its founder, the three-time world champion Sir Jack Brabham, and began establishing his power base. Back then, circuit deals and television rights were operated on a somewhat haphazard, piecemeal basis. Ecclestone offered to look after them on the teams' behalf and wasted little time in building his influence. He persuaded television companies to buy F1 as a package, rather than pay for individual races. That guaranteed vastly increased exposure, and the sport's popularity grew increasingly quickly. The F1 supremo's willingness to deal with controversial global leaders, such as Russian president Vladimir Putin, often raised eyebrows The vast growth of F1 from what it was then to what it is today arguably started in earnest after the 1976 season, when a championship battle between the playboy Englishman James Hunt and the ascetic Austrian Niki Lauda caught the public's imagination. By the 1980s, F1 was becoming a global sport, more and more races were being shown live, and a generation of charismatic stars enhanced its appeal - Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell, Nelson Piquet and, most of all, Ayrton Senna. Ironically, Senna's death in 1994 only increased its reach and shortly after that the sport started on the route that has led to Ecclestone's departure. Controversially, in the mid-1990s, Ecclestone struck a deal with his long-time friend and ally Max Mosley, who was then the president of governing body the FIA. It saw his own company become the rights holder of F1, taking over from the teams' collective body that Ecclestone previously ran. This led to a furious row with some of the teams - particularly McLaren, Williams and Tyrrell - who claimed what Ecclestone was doing was illegal and that he was effectively robbing them. But the complainants were eventually bought off. Ecclestone then set about monetising his new asset. Ecclestone acquired the commercial rights to F1 in 2000, when close ally Max Mosley was in charge of the FIA In 2000, Mosley granted Ecclestone the commercial rights to F1 until the end of 2110 for a one-off fee of $360m. Even then, many were shocked by the relatively paltry amount of money that changed hands to secure such a lucrative and lengthy deal. This led to a dizzying series of sales as the rights transferred through various institutions. A German cable TV company bought them, and then collapsed, which led to its creditors - banks - taking its assets. In 2006, the German bank BayernLB sold its 47.2% stake in F1 to an investment company called CVC Capital Partners. CVC ran the sport for 10 years, employing Ecclestone as chief executive and empowering him to carry on as before, before selling to Liberty last September, in the deal completed on Monday. But the sale from BayernLB to CVC is what ultimately led to the court cases on bribery charges that Ecclestone fought and survived a couple of years ago - and which he ended by paying the German courts $100m to end the case, without a presumption of guilt or innocence. It did not escape notice that a man charged with bribery had paid - perfectly legally under German law -to end a criminal trial. Despite his diminutive stature, Ecclestone is a forbidding character. Stories abound in F1 of real and threatened menace. A conversation with him is akin to juggling sand - he ducks and dodges and avoids questions with obfuscation, distraction and quick wit, a dizzying mix of truths, half-truths and fallacies. He is approachable but apart, engaging but unknowable. After a verbal sparring match, he will sometimes reach up and chillingly pat you on the cheek, not unlike a mafia don in the movies. With David Coulthard, Michael Schumacher, Mika Hakkinen and Rubens Barrichello in Hungary, 2000 For years, the more unsavoury aspects of Ecclestone's stewardship were glossed over or laughed off - largely because he was making those he was working for so much money. But in recent years, the tone in F1 has changed as more and more people began to feel he was past his sell-by date. He was a reluctant embracer of the internet age, and rejected entreaties to try to use it to extend F1's reach. His argument was that he saw no way to make money out of it; others argued that his modus operandi of pursuing only the deal, the bottom line, and disregarding its potential longer-term effects was doing more harm than good. His simple model - sell television rights and races to the highest bidder no matter who it was; squeeze the highest price possible out of continuing partners - created an annual global revenue in the region of $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn). Yet he became increasingly haphazard and intransigent in his decision-making, coming up with unpopular ideassuch as a double-points finale in 2014or the fiasco overthe change to the qualifying formatat the start of 2016 - to try to spice up the sport. He was responding to declining audiences, but seemed to ignore the fact they were dropping largely because of his switch away from free-to-air towards pay television in key markets, and the questionable effect on the racing of gimmicks such as the DRS overtaking aid and tyres on which drivers could not push flat out. The declining audiences have led to a crisis of confidence within the sport, the response to which is a new set of rules for 2017 that mean faster, more dramatic-looking cars. But already there are concerns that these may not have the desired effect. But while the problems are real, the fact remains that F1 has just changed hands in a deal that values it at $8bn (Â£6.4bn). And that is almost entirely down to Ecclestone and what he has built with his remarkable personality, vision and drive. Controversial he certainly was; past his best he may have been. But for all his faults, Bernie Ecclestone is a unique and titanic figure who turned what was essentially a niche activity into a glittering global enterprise that to many represents an intoxicating mix of glamour, danger and raw, unmatched drama. Gone from power he may be, but he will never be forgotten.

"This video can not be played New F1 boss Chase Carey on big talking points Bernie Ecclestone has been removed as Formula 1's boss because the sport ""needs a fresh start"", says new chairman Chase Carey. Carey has been put in charge by Liberty Media, the US group whichcompleted its $8bn (Â£6.4bn) takeoverof the sport. The American told BBC Sport he had ""tremendous respect"" for Ecclestone, but F1 ""needs to be run differently than for the last four or five years"". ""Bernie is a one-man team. It was not right in today's world,"" he said. ""The decision-making is not as effective as it needs to be. Clearly it has to be improved."" Ecclestone has been removed as chief executive but offered a new advisory role as chairman emeritus. Carey said Liberty had major plans to grow F1 around the world. He said: F1 is a ""unique, iconic, global event that is a spectacle second to none"" The sport has not grown in recent years as much as it needed to and Liberty could exploit new technologies to do that Liberty would protect historic races and sees Europe as the ""foundation"" of the sport It would expand, particularly with a view to new events in the US Liberty wanted to make much more of the promotion of F1 itself, its participants and individual events Therewill be a British Grand Prixdespite speculation Silverstone could be dropped by 2019 This video can not be played Ecclestone still has a lot to offer - Horner Carey was installed in September and said he had decided over the past four months that Ecclestone, 86, was no longer the right person to run F1. ""We needed a sport that while respecting what made it great has a sense of energy and innovation,"" Carey said. ""In many ways, in a simplistic sense, the sport said 'no' too much and we have to start saying 'yes' - not gimmick it up but find ways to do new and exciting things to have the sport continue to grow and interest and excite people."" He said Ecclestone had not been happy about the change but had accepted his new role. ""I would expect this is difficult for Bernie,"" Carey said. ""He has run this sport for his entire adult life and I respect completely that this is a difficult change. ""We have tried to deal with him with the respect he's due, which is why we offered him the chairman emeritus title. ""I have been sincere in saying I value his help and advice as we go forward. ""He calls himself a dictator. He has run it as a one-man dictator for a long time. I think the sport needs a fresh perspective. But he has a lot to continue to offer and he will always be part of the F1 family."" Liberty has brought in former Mercedes F1 team boss Ross Brawn and ex-ESPN sales executive Sean Bratches to run the sporting and commercial sides of F1 under him. Why F1's titanic leader was loved & loathed We will have a British Grand Prix - Carey Listen: Chequered Flag podcast Carey added the governance of F1 needed an overhaul. ""I don't know whether the decision-making is not what it should be because there is too much history amongst the players,"" he said. ""One of the benefits we bring is a fresh start. We don't have an agenda other than to make the sport great for its fans and that gives us an opportunity to look at how do we create more of a partnership  - everybody has a shared vision of where do we want to go and we can align that vision and have everybody trying to move in the same direction."" Carey said he felt F1 was not making the most of its appeal to fans around the world. ""Bernie deserves enormous credit for the sport he built,"" Carey said. ""It just got sold for $8bn so the proof is in the numbers. ""But the reality is to be competitive in today's world you need to continue to find ways to connect and excite fans and we need to use all the digital platforms available, have a marketing capability to tell the stories of the rivalries of the stars. ""They are larger-than-life personalities and you have to take advantage of all the rules to make that story everything it can be, have to make events larger than ever, music and entertainment with sport at the centre of it. ""I have talked about 21 Super Bowls and that is really what we should have. And then work with our partners - teams, sponsors, promoters, regulator - to ensure the race itself is everything it can be."" Liberty is to give F1 teams the opportunity to buy equity in the sport. They have rejected an initial offer but talks are ongoing. ""We would like to be more aligned with the teams and those discussions are ongoing,"" Carey said. ""We initially made a proposal that had too short a timeframe and we have found a way to have discussion that can have an appropriate level of exchange. ""Out of discussions of equity will be discussions of where do we want the sport to be. There is a great deal of interest in the equity but first and foremost it is about trying to create more of an alignment with the teams about the future of the business."" He added Liberty would look at the prize-money structure, which many inside the sport believe is too skewed in favour of the leading teams. ""We'd like owning a team to be good business, running a track to be good business and F1 is a good business, and together we are all figuring out how to share in making the whole business stronger,"" Carey said. ""But dealing with revenue is complicated."" Many European races are struggling to cope with the high race fees Ecclestone demanded, but Carey said he hoped to find a way to make them more successful financially. ""I don't think we will make them more affordable,"" he said. ""We will make them more successful. We want to be more of a partner. To be in the US we are not going to own tracks but we will be more of a partner in trying to figure it out. ""We think these events should be bigger and more profitable than they are and we think, properly run, these events should continue to grow and be even more successful."" Carey said the leading drivers were ""great personalities"" and he wanted to ""provide enough opportunities for fans to connect with those personalities"". And he added safety was ""critical"". ""Go and watch one of these cars drive down a track,"" he said. ""Anyone who tells me that is not dangerous by definition and awe-inspiring hasn't been to one of these races. ""What they do is truly unique. We have a responsibility to make it as safe as we can without undermining the sport.""

"This video can not be played Williams match a great opportunity - Konta Australian Open 2017 Venue:Melbourne Park, MelbourneDates:16-29 Jan Coverage:Daily live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live; live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website; TV highlights on BBC Two and online. As a hugely successful former coach to Grand Slam winners Kim Clijsters and Victoria Azarenka, Wim Fissette was not short of job offers for the 2017 season. But after British number one Johanna Konta made her interest clear, the softly spoken 36-year-old Belgian spotted a wonderful opportunity. ""From the outside, she looked like a very ambitious, hard-working player with a very strong body,"" Fissette recalled on the eve of Konta's Australian Open quarter-final against Serena Williams (02:00 GMT, Wednesday). Latest scores, results and order of play Konta 'prepared' for first Serena meeting Konta can upset Williams - Navratilova Fisette and Konta started working together a couple of weeks after her rewarding partnership with Esteban Carril reached the end of the road. The two had been unable to agree financial terms for the new year, but after a promising week with Fissette at the Mouratoglou Academy in Nice, Konta had a plan in place for the next stage of her career. The omens are extremely encouraging. After losing in the semi-finals in Shenzhen in the first week of the year, Konta beat Agnieszka Radwanska for the first time in her career towin the prestigious WTA title in Sydney.She won 10 sets in a row in the process, and has now extended her unbroken run to 18 after four comprehensive victories in Melbourne. ""The more I know about her, the more I like her as a player,"" Fissette told BBC Sport. ""She's physically very strong, she's got a big serve - for sure top three in women's tennis - and she's got big groundstrokes. I think there's not a weakness in her game, but I do believe she can be better in every aspect."" Konta goes into the quarter-finals on a nine-match winning run What is so impressive is that 2016 should be such a hard act to follow. Konta won her first WTA title in Stanford, and finished as the runner-up in Beijing (one of the four most important tournaments on the women's tour) having started the year with thatsemi-final appearance at the Australian Open. Players often struggle to reproduce the form of a breakthrough season, but Konta is bucking the trend. ""We've seen this time and time again on both tours,"" says Courtney Nguyen, a senior writer for the WTA Tour. ""You get a big result, you have a breakout season, and the following season you end up suffering a bit of a sophomore slump. ""It can be very difficult playing with that pressure of knowing what can be expected of you. What's so refreshing with Jo is that's just not how she sees the world. She takes it all in her stride."" It is also remarkable how Konta appears to have dealt so well with the end of her partnership with Carril, as well asthe untimely death of her mental coach.Juan Coto was a vital component of her team and it was his counsel which helped kick-start her rapid rise through the rankings. Konta prefers not to reflect publicly on that difficult period, or how she has adjusted so successfully since, which is perhaps a strategy of which Coto would have approved. The 25-year-old is now very much in demand with the international - as well as the British - media. She conducted six meaty television interviews - including with Australia's Channel 7 and the US-orientated Tennis Channel - afterher fourth-round victory over Ekaterina Makarova. She is increasingly confident in her conversations, happy to discuss changing her two-month-old nephew's nappy, and slowly but surely prepared to give a little more insight into her approach. But will all this be enough to bring her victory over Serena Williams the first time they ever share a court together? Some opponents seem to have lost such a match in their mind before a ball is struck, but Konta is different and will genuinely, and quite rightly, believe she can win. No other current player can quite compare to the 22-time Grand Slam champion, but Konta was not at all overawed by Serena's sister Venus in their three meetings. Two of them she won: in the opening round of last year's Australian Open, and then in the final in Stanford last July. And Fissette's very first impressions of Konta are also worth recalling. ""The first time she played a player I was coaching - that was Victoria Azarenka in China - I was very impressed with the attitude she had,"" he says. ""She showed respect to the player but she was there to win the match. She came on the court with the belief that she could beat a top player like her and I still see that. ""I believe there will be a day when she will win a Grand Slam.""

"This video can not be played Does using art to sell hotels make good business sense? If you visit the Emperor Qianmen hotel, near the Forbidden City in Beijing, be sure to bring an umbrella - otherwise you may get drenched. That's because it sometimes rains inside the lobby. This is not due to a leaking roof. The ""rain"" comes from an installation by the Canadian artist Dan Euser, whose other pieces at the Emperor include an astonishingly realistic ""waterfall"" in the hotel's spa. The Emperor is a ""water hotel"", explains the Chinese artist Bingyi, another member of the team behind the establishment's design. It is built on the site of an old bath house, and it was this, Bingyi adds, that gave the hotel's architect, Adam Sokol, the idea for an aquatic theme for the project. At the Emperor Hotel in Beijing an art installation creates rain inside the lobby Art can be found almost everywhere at the Emperor. Bingyi's work on display includes Cave in Heaven, a vast ink and paper mural covering 400 square metres, over the entire walls of a large space. Bingyi believes that China today is a fruitful place for collaborations between artists and hotels, like the one at the Emperor. ""Cultural significance is very important to Chinese. ""We take the greatest pride in our cultural heritageâ¦ we write calligraphy, we write poetry, we have this kind of particular passion to turn every little craft into this magnificent habit of living, and we're just obsessed with it,"" she says. The lobby of luxury hotel Nuo displays huge vases made from Chinese porcelain The Emperor is far from the only hotel in Beijing to place an emphasis on the role of art. Enter the lobby of the Nuo, a new luxury hotel, and you could be forgiven for thinking you had stepped into a museum. Throughout the vast space a series of giant vases are arrayed, each one more than two metres tall. They were made in Jingdezhen, home of fine Chinese porcelain for thousands of years. The blue and white vases echo the Ming Dynasty theme that pervades much of the hotel's design. But they are only the beginning, says Adrian Rudin, the hotel's general manager: ""Wherever you go, from the lobby lounge to the bar, there are different art pieces, some sculptures, some paintings, from different young and upcoming artists."" He estimates the value of artworks at the hotel at around $50m [Â£40m; 46m euros]."" Beijing hotel managers say that art is one way for luxury lodgings to set themselves apart from rivals Why so much - or indeed, any - art? ""It is a selling point in terms of consumers who are interested in fine art and culture,"" says Mr Rudin.  But, he adds, there are other reasons too. The hotel is the starting point of a new venture with the aim of creating an ""international luxury Chinese brand"" Mr Rudin explains. In this context, he believes that art has a key role to play in helping the new enterprise to find a distinctive voice. Other luxury groups also see merit in this kind of approach. The Rosewood Hotel says its aim is to create a space that feels like a ""luxury private home"" One of the troubles of the modern international hotel scene, says Marc Brugger, is that it is an ""ocean of sameness"". Mr Brugger is managing director of the Rosewood hotel, another recently-launched luxury property in Beijing. He believes that art can play a valuable role for luxury lodgings seeking to find new ways to set themselves apart. However, for this to be successful, time and careful thought are required. When the hotel was being conceived, Mr Brugger recalls, the idea of creating somewhere that felt like a ""luxury private home"" emerged. In such an establishment, art would have its natural place. This meant departing from the usual hotel design process. Chinese artist Bingyi's work for the Emperor Hotel includes Cave in Heaven, a vast ink and paper mural covering 400 square metres According to Mr Brugger, what often happens is that plans will be drawn up and some blank spaces will be left for ""art"" to be added later. ""That method is much faster"" he says, than the ""holistic"" approach taken in designing the Rosewood, where most of the art was specially commissioned and integrated into the design. The design team searched for up-and-coming artists who could create work that would fit well into the scheme, rather than existing pieces from established names which might overpower or destabilise the overall look. It took a long time to find the right artists, says Mr Brugger, but he feels that the results were well worth it. Do collaborations between artists and hotels like these make good commercial and creative sense? Up to a point, say experts. ""There is a rationale for doing this, in a crowded hotel market"" says Peter York, who has been an adviser to many large luxury enterprises.  Companies need to find ways ""to stand out from the ordinariness of luxury now, because luxury has become very ordinary"". But he says there can be risks, both for the hotels, and more particularly for the artists: ""It's a sensitive balance between what you do to make a lot of money, and to pump your brand, and the verdict of history - and you don't want the verdict of history to come in too fast"", he warns. Still, Chinese hotel operators, and the artists they work with, remain optimistic about the future and the benefits that can flow from working together. ""We're really re-imagining what is luxury"" says Bingyi. ""We just all need to be reminded every single day how beautiful things can be.""

"The 2017 Oscar nominations are out,with La La Land the frontrunner. Here's a round-up of the surprises and talking points from this year's list. That's if you use the Oscar nominations as a guide - the magical musical is just one of three films to ever get 14 (with Titanic and All About Eve). By that theory, it is also the greatest musical ever, given that it has surpassed the 13 nominations given to Mary Poppins in 1965 and Chicago in 2003. We'll see if La La Land can rival the biggest ever winners - Titanic, Ben-Hur and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, which all scooped 11 golden statuettes. The most successful musical in Academy Awards history was West Side Story, which won 10. But not a terrible year - Andrew Garfield, Naomie Harris and Dev Patel are flying the flag in the acting categories. But that's down on the six British acting nominees we saw last year. Hugh Grant would have been a popular choice for his first Oscar nomination for Florence Foster Jenkins, and there was no room for Emily Blunt (The Girl on the Train), Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Nocturnal Animals) or Felicity Jones (A Monster Calls). The leading British film of the year,if the Bafta nominations are anything to go by, was Ken Loach's hard-hitting drama I, Daniel Blake. Oscar seems to like British films when they are sweeping historical epics or when they feature royalty or Dame Judi Dench. Perhaps I, Daniel Blake was just too gritty. Overrated? Meryl Streep was far from a dead cert to be nominated, but has crept into the best actress battle, earning a 20th Oscar nomination. She has gained Oscar momentum since the Golden Globes, when she made a speech attacking US President Donald Trump -before he fired backthat she was ""overrated"". That made her even more of a heroine in Hollywood, if such a thing is possible. And it's fair to suggest a link between the speech and the Oscar nomination. She's an outsider to win - but could Hollywood offer her the chance to make a similar speech on the biggest stage of all? The biggest surprise in the acting categories was Amy Adams missing the cut for best actress for Arrival, which got eight other nominations. But perhaps it's a blessing in disguise. Amy has been nominated five times before - and never won. And if she had been nominated this year, she probably wouldn't have won (again), and would have become joint record holder for actresses who have lost the the most Oscars. This year, best actress is the most competitive category - there was also much love but no room for Annette Bening (20th Century Women) or Taraji P Henson (Hidden Figures). Mel Gibsonbecame persona non gratain Hollywood after tapes emerged of him verbally abusing his girlfriend in 2010, and after he made anti-Semitic comments to a police officer in 2006. Now, it seems, all is forgiven. His war movie Hacksaw Ridge has six nominations, including one for Mel for best director - his first nomination since 1996. He has been given a best director nomination above Denzel Washington, who made Fences (although Denzel has been nominated for best actor for the same film). Unlike Mel Gibson, Tom Hanks has not embarked on any racist or sexist rants. In fact he is surely the nicest, least offensive, most respected man in Hollywood. Yet he must have done something to offend the Academy. He was an Oscars favourite once - nominated five times between 1989-2001 and winning twice (for Forrest Gump and Philadelphia). But since then, nothing. And the Academy has ignored him again - giving him nothing for his role in Sully as real-life all-American hero Captain Chesley Sullenberger, who landed a plane in the Hudson River in New York in 2009. After two years with no non-white acting nominees, there areseven this year out of 20 slots, including Ruth Negga and Denzel Washington (above). So we won't see similar protests to last year. Is this a sign that the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' attempts to reform its membership have been successful? Or were more good films with diverse casts released last year than in the previous two? And will this really be a turning point? Read more: How diverse are this year's Oscars? Moonlight's Barry Jenkins (above) has become only the fourth black nominee for best director in Oscars history. If he triumphs, he'll be the first black winner. But there were no women nominated again - in fact, only four female directors have been nominated in 89 years of the Oscars. Let's say that again - four in 89 years. There has only ever been one female winner - Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010. There has been some sense of diversity in the best director category in recent years - albeit a slightly odd one. Basically, you're OK as long as you're a foreign-born man. No American-born directors have won since Bigelow. There was a groundswell of support for Deadpool to become the first superhero movie to be nominated for best picture. It was nominated for Golden Globes and Producers Guild of America Awards, among others, and proved that a grown-up superhero flick could be a critical and commercial success. But it didn't happen. British actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson (above right) won the Golden Globe for best supporting actor for playing a very nasty man in Nocturnal Animals. But now he has become the first Golden Globe best supporting actor to fail to be nominated for the same prize at the Oscars since 1975. Instead, the person who has snuck into that Oscars category in his place is Michael Shannon (above left) - who played the sheriff responsible for tracking down Taylor-Johnson's villain in Nocturnal Animals. This year's Oscar winners will be named on 26 February. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"The biggest prize at the Oscars on Sunday is saved for last - the Academy Award for best picture. This year, nine films are nominated. If you've not had a chance (or the desire) to see them all, here's a guide to what you need to know - which means thatthis contains spoilers. Make sure you read this before going anywhere near a water cooler on Monday morning. Find out more about this year's Oscars nominations.,external ""What do you mean, I'm not nominated for best actress?"" Who's in it and who directed it?Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker and some aliens that look like giant squid are the main stars. Denis Villeneuve is the director. What's it about?Aliens. NO WAIT COME BACK. Amy Adams plays Louise Banks, a linguistics expert who is called in by the US Army to translate what aliens who have landed at random spots around the world are trying to say. Oh, one small thing, she can also see into the future. And has to deal with the fact that she knows her future daughter is going to die of cancer. So yeah, it's pretty intense. What did the critics say?""An intelligent, eloquent and stirring sci-fi that grips from start to finish, Arrival is up there with the year's best movies.""[Total Film],external How likely is it to win?It's picked up a string of trophies during awards season already, but it would it's unlikely to take home the main prize at the Oscars. Talking point:Even though it's up for best picture, Amy Adamsfailed to secure a nomination in the best actress category- she was nominated at the Golden Globes and Baftas, though. A rare happy moment in Fences Who's in it and who directed it?Viola Davis and Denzel Washington play husband and wife Troy and Rose Maxson. Washington also directed the film, based on the August Wilson play Fences. What's it about?This family drama set in 1950s America is centred around the domineering Troy Maxson, who rules his home with an iron fist and has a volatile relationship with his son Cory. That's not to say he doesn't have a loving relationship with Rose, but it's fair to say her patience is tested by his behaviour later in the film (spoiler: he cheats). What did the critics say?""It's all too seldom that a feature film combines brilliant acting with a spellbinding flow of language.""[The Wall Street Journal],external How likely is it to win?While Washington and Davis are great, the film isn't exactly... cinematic. This one is an outsider. Talking point:It's not the first time Washington and Davis have played these roles - they were the Maxsons on Broadway in 2010, winning Tony Awards for their performances. Who's in it and who directed it?Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer are in the cast of this Mel Gibson war epic. What's it about?The true story of a guy called Desmond Doss, a World War Two medic who joined the army but refused to even touch a gun - due both to his Christian faith and the fact he has a violent father. He struggles to be accepted in the army at first but goes on to single-handedly save the lives of 75 men. Warning: it's quite (okay, extremely) gory. What did the critics say?""Thanks to some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed, Gibson once again shows his staggering gifts as a film-maker, able to juxtapose savagery with aching tenderness.""[Rolling Stone],external How likely is it to win?It's currently the seventh favourite out of the nine - so not very. Talking point:The film has been seen as something of a comeback for Mel Gibson. His nomination of best director is a sign of him being welcomed back into Hollywood after his career hit rock bottom. Who's in it and who directed it?Jeff Bridges, Ben Foster and Chris Pine star; David Mackenzie directed. What's it about?An ex-con (Foster) and his brother (Pine) resort to robbing banks in an attempt save their family's Texan ranch after the death of their mother. Bridges plays the ranger on their case. It's been described as a modern Western, but it could also be described as a cops and robbers drama with slices of sharp comedy, or a study of two brothers battling against the system. What did the critics say?:""Hell or High Water is a thrillingly good movie - a crackerjack drama of crime, fear and brotherly love set in a sun-roasted, deceptively sleepy West Texas that feels completely exotic for being so authentic."" [Variety,external] How likely is it to win?It's gritty, heartfelt and beautifully written, but it's fair to say this is the rank outsider. And you could be forgiven for it having gone under your radar - it was released in the UK last September, and in August in the US. Talking point:The producers had to deal withsweltering conditions and rattlesnakes,externalduring filming, describing the conditions as ""insufferable"". What's that saying about suffering for your art..? Who's in it and who directed it?Taraji P Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae play the three leads. Theodore Melfi directs. What's it about?Three female mathematicians take jobs at Nasa during the 1960s space race,  challenging racial and sexist prejudice along the way. Katherine Johnson is made to drink from a ""coloured"" coffee urn and go on 40-minute breaks to get to the ""coloured"" toilets on the other side of the NASA campus, despite being one of the brightest brains of the whole project. What did the critics say?""Hidden Figures, both a dazzling piece of entertainment and a window into history, bucks the trend of the boring-math-guy movie.""[Time],external How likely is it to win?Could be a surprise winner - and it would definitely be a popular one. The film has doneincredibly well at the box office,external. Talking point:Free screenings of the film have been put on in the US for young girls who are likely to be inspired by it. Who's in it and who directed it?Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are the all-singing, all-dancing stars in Damien Chazelle's film. What's it about?For those who've been buried under a rock (or just refuse to be swept along by the hype)... the musical traces the stories of aspiring actress Mia and pianist Sebastian, who dreams of opening his own jazz club. What did the critics say?""Audacious, retro, funny and heartfelt, La La Land is the latest great musical for people who don't like musicals - and will slap a mile-wide smile across the most miserable of faces.""[Empire],external How likely is it to win?Very. Like, very very. Bookies say it is the overwhelming favourite - and it doesn't hurt that it's a film all about Hollywood itself. Talking point:Some have deigned to suggest that La La Land isoverhyped and overrated- but that hasn't stopped its juggernaut-like journey through awards season. Who's in it and who directed it?Sunny Pawar is Saroo as a young boy, with Dev Patel playing him as an adult. There's also Rooney Mara and Nicole Kidman. The film is directed by Garth Davis. What's it about?This is the staggering true story of a young Indian boy who is adopted after losing his family at a young age. But he manages to find them again, decades later. With a bit of help from Google Earth. What did the critics say?""The beauty of Lion is that it explores and allows for the unique possibilities and power of multiple homes, multiple families and multiple selves.""[The Chicago Tribune],external How likely is it to win?Dev is certainly in the frame for best supporting actor, but it's not that likely to translate to best picture success. Talking point:It's been making people cry. A lot. And not just audiences - both Dev andNicole Kidmansay the script made them weep. So if you go to see it, take tissues. Who's in it and who directed it?Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams star, with Kenneth Lonergan the director. What's it about?Caretaker Lee Chandler, played by Affleck, has to look after his teenage nephew after his brother (the boy's father) dies. And he does this while still grieving for his own young children, who died in a house fire. It's safe to say this film is short on laughs. What did the critics say?""Manchester by the Sea is heartbreaking yet somehow heartening, a film that just wallops you with its honesty, its authenticity and its access to despair.""[Los Angeles Times],external How likely is it to win?The Academy tends to like gritty, serious films which could explain why it's currently fourth favourite. Talking point:The original idea was thought up by Matt Damon and John Krasinski, from the US version of The Office. Damon was actually meant to star as Lee originally, but had other filming commitments. Who's in it and who directed it?Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris and Janelle Monae star in Barry Jenkins's film. What's it about?Moonlight tells the story of a young man named Chiron through three stages of his life, as he battles life in extreme poverty with an abusive drug addict mother, all the while trying to come to terms with his sexuality. He has one gay experience in his teenage years but struggles to accept his sexuality in a neighbourhood that is largely hostile towards it. What did the critics say?""It's a thrilling, deeply necessary work that opens up a much-needed and rarely approached on-screen conversation about the nature of gay masculinity.""[The Guardian],external How likely is it to win?It's currently second favourite and has been picking up awards left, right and centre -so watch this space. Talking point:Naomie Harris is nominated for best supporting actress - yet she managed to squeeze all of her filming into just three days.

"Dev Patel is nominated for Lion and Viola Davis is nominated for Fences After the #OscarsSoWhite controversies of the last two years, 2017 promises to be a more diverse affair. In the acting categories there are a total of seven nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds. Denzel Washingtonis nominated as best actor for Fences andRuth Neggaas best actress for Loving. Moonlight'sMahershala Aliand Lion'sDev Patelare up for best supporting actor. The supporting actress category includesViola Davisfor Fences,Naomie Harrisfor Moonlight andOctavia Spencerfor Hidden Figures. Moonlight has eight Oscar nominations Three of the nine films up for best picture -Fences,Hidden FiguresandMoonlight- feature predominantly black casts. In Fences, based on August Wilson's play, Washington plays a sanitation worker and former professional baseball player struggling to provide for his family against a backdrop of strained race relations in 1950s Pittsburgh. Hidden Figures is the behind-the-scenes story of three African-American women who helped launch Nasa's first successful space missions in the 1960s. Moonlight is about a gay African-American man grappling with his sexuality in an impoverished neighbourhood of Miami. In the directing category, Moonlight'sBarry Jenkinsis only the fourth black best director nominee in Oscar history. This video can not be played This year, non-white actors have received seven Oscar nominations The first was John Singleton, nominated in 1992 for Boyz n the Hood. He was followed by Lee Daniels, for Precious in 2010, and 12 Years a Slave's Steve McQueen in 2014. McQueen's film won best picture but he lost the best director prize to Gravity's Alfonso Cuaron. In the documentary feature category, Ava DuVernay's13this up againstI Am Not Your Negrofrom Raoul Peck and Ezra Edelman'sOJ: Made In America. (With a running time of seven hours and 47 minutes, OJ is the longest film ever nominated for an Academy Award.) The two-year diversity drought in the acting categories inspiredthe #OscarsSoWhite backlashon social media. Of course, most of this year's nominated films were already in production well before that furore erupted. Moonlight's Jenkins has told the BBC his filmwas not a response to the #OscarsSoWhite criticism, having conceived the project ""at least three-and-a-half years ago"". But the outcry did lead the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, to take steps to make its membership more diverse. Ruth Negga in Loving Has that made a difference this year? Hollywood Reporter's Oscars guru Scott Feinberg thinks not. ""The Academy may claim that this is the result of it flooding its organization with an unprecedented number of diverse new members this year, but I maintain that these nominees, up against the same competition, would have been nominated in either of the last two years,""he writes in his Oscars analysis,external. In June 2016, the Academyinvited almost 700 new members to join, with a focus on women and ethnic minorities. One of those new members is British film director Amma Asante, whose film about an interracial marriage A United Kingdom opened the London Film Festival. Shetold me last yearthat the organisers of the Oscars needed to keep up the momentum on its actions to improve diversity. ""I don't know the change happens overnight,"" she said.

"Find out about the best actor nominees for the 89th Academy Awards, which will take place on 26 February 2017. CASEY AFFLECK Age:41 Nominated for:Manchester by the Sea The character:Lee Chandler, an odd job man near Boston, who has a painful past and who suddenly finds himself with extra responsibilities. Oscar record:A best supporting actor nomination for The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford in 2008. The critics said:""Barricaded inside the shell that's become of him, Lee peers at the world through guarded eyes, only just summoning the basic drive to get up every morning, shuffle out, and carry on his tasks. He's played by Casey Affleck, in a clenched and riveting performance which fulfils all the promise he's ever shown, and then some."" [Daily Telegraph,external] ANDREW GARFIELD Age:33 Nominated for:Hacksaw Ridge The character:Desmond Doss, a World War Two medic who became the first conscientious objector to win the prestigious US Medal of Honor. Oscar record:None. The critics said:""He's found a great fit for his talents in Hacksaw Ridge, which asks him to be a sweet Virginia boy courting a sweet nurse... and then a shell-shocked but determined man of valour in a lunar hellscape. Gosh, do we root for this kid."" [Vanity Fair,external] RYAN GOSLING Age:36 Nominated for:La La Land The character:Sebastian Wilder, a jazz pianist chasing his dreams in Hollywood. Oscar record:Best actor nomination for Half Nelson in 2007. The critics said:""Mr Gosling's performance is understated, with a tinge of touching earnestness, but it's also witty and commandingly smart. What's more, he does Seb's fluent piano playing without benefit of doubles on screen or on the sound track, an achievement I found astonishing."" [The Wall Street Journal,external] VIGGO MORTENSEN Age:58 Nominated for:Captain Fantastic The character:Ben Cash, a hippy father who has raised his children in a remote home, far from the pressures of modern life. Oscar record:One previous nomination for best actor, for Eastern Promises (2008). The critics said:""The movie really belongs to Mortensen, who allows Ben to be exasperating, arrogant and impatient but also warm, loving and caring. He's a tough but adoring father, a grieving widower and an angry defender of his wife's final wishes, and Mortensen plays all these notes and more with subtlety and grace."" [The Wrap,external] DENZEL WASHINGTON Age:62 Nominated for:Fences The character:Troy Maxson, a Pittsburgh sanitation worker and former professional baseball player. Oscar record:Two Oscar wins - best supporting actor for Glory (1990) and best actor for Training Day (2002). He also has a best supporting actor nomination for Cry Freedom (1988) and three best actor nominations for Malcolm X (1993), The Hurricane (2000) and Flight (2012). The critics said:""While Denzel Washington's direction might leave a little to be desired, his acting has never been more relentless and fierce.""

"Mandy Stevens LinkedIn image. ""Perhaps not the most flattering photo of me, but I'm sharing this awful picture and my story to help increase understanding of the impact of mental illness and to celebrate my recovery."" ""As I have worked in mental health services for 29 years, one would think I would be immune to mental illness."" In aLinkedIn post,externalthat has been shared more than 5,000 times, Mandy Stevens shared a photo of herself, red-eyed with matted hair, in the midst of a depressive episode that resulted in her being hospitalised. She wrote the post on the day she was discharged from a 12 week stay on the inpatient ward at the City and Hackney Centre for Mental Health in London. One thing that struck many people who read Stevens' post on the online professional network was her unique vantage point - she has been both an employee and patient of the UK's National Health Service mental health programme. Stevens began her career in the NHS as a mental health nurse. After 15 years she became a hospital manager, and then a director. Although she has suffered episodes of ""mild to moderate"" depression, she managed it through counselling and very few of her family and friends knew about it. ""There is a huge amount of stigma around mental illness,"" Stevens told BBC Trending, ""and for the past 29 years I have worked in Mental Health Services and seen the negative effect this stigma has on people who use our services. From personal embarrassment, family embarrassment, not accepting diagnoses or treatment, not wanting to attend mental health community services in case they are recognised. There is also stigma amongst family, friends and colleagues, including whispered rumours and avoidance."" Then in November, things changed, and her depression became serious enough to warrant hospitalisation. ""When I was very, very depressed, anxious and suicidal I was so ill I was almost monosyllabic, I could hardy walk properly, I couldn't shower or dress properly. Eating and all the things that we take for granted were a huge struggle. I spent most of every day in bed, crying and wanting to be dead. I was absolutely terrible. So frightening and awful."" ""The absolutely wonderful nurses on Gardner ward at City & Hackney Centre for Mental Health were amazing,"" Stevens says. ""They would come and see me very regularly throughout the day, spend time with me, encourage and support me, listen to me crying and talking and throwing up a huge amount of emotion. The staff nurses and the healthcare assistants were wonderful, accessible and compassionate 24/7. I am so proud of my profession."" Whilst in hospital and after she was over the worst Stevens says she felt a bit like an ""undercover cop"" as she observed how the ward was run. ""Without exception the staff treated all of the patients with dignity and respect."" When asked what she thinks of the state of the NHS right now, Stevens says, ""Very difficult for me to answer this question nowâ¦ I can only talk about my particular experience as a patient in an 'Outstanding Trust' - which has been a great experience."" ""I am, of course, aware that not everyone is as lucky as me to receive this type of care. Unfortunately, mental health services are always seen as the 'Cinderella services' with lower levels of funding and cuts."" Analysis by the King's Fund think tanksays 40% of the 58 mental health trusts in the UK saw budgets cut in 2015-16. It found six of them had seen budgets cut three years in a row. An NHS spokeswoman told the BBC that mental health services were ""wider"" than trusts, and care was funded in other ways. Steven adds that help is there. ""There is a huge range of accessible services across the country. Your GP is usually the best place to start as they can signpost you to local services and, if necessary, they can refer you to formal mental health services, but there are also a wide variety of other services around run by volunteers,"" she says. ""My first message is to reach out to people. Speak to your close family and friends about your mental health, and start opening conversations about it. Don't say 'I'm okay' when you're not okay"" Blog byMegha Mohan,external Next story: Trolls try to trigger seizures - is it assault?

ISABELLE HUPPERT Age:63 Nominated for:Elle The character:Michele Leblanc, the head of a video game company, who is raped in her home. Oscar record:None. The critics said:""Huppert gives a performance of imperious fury, holding the audience at bay, almost goading us to disown her. Audaciously, Elle presents her not so much as a victim but as the casualty of a world she is very much a part of; maybe (still more troublingly) an accessory to."" [The Guardian,external] RUTH NEGGA Age:35 Nominated for:Loving The character:Mildred Loving, whose interracial marriage to Richard Loving (Joel Edgerton), led to the couple's arrest and banishment from the US state of Virginia in the 1950s.

The stabbing simplicity of Negga's acting is breathtaking."" [Rolling Stone,external] NATALIE PORTMAN Age:35 Nominated for:Jackie The character:Jackie Kennedy, whose husband President John F Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.

"Nicole Cooke won the Olympic road race in Beijing in 2008 Ex-Olympic champion Nicole Cooke says she is ""sceptical"" of Team Sky's drug-free credentials and Sir Bradley Wiggins' therapeutic use exemptions. Wiggins was granted three TUEs to take anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone before the 2011 and 2012 Tour de France and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. ""Taking TUEs just before major events raises questions for me,"" Cooke said. Cooke also told MPs British Cycling is run ""by men for men"" and its attempts to stop doping are ""ineffective"". Wiggins' TUEs were approved by British authorities and cycling's world governing body the UCI, and there is no suggestion either the 36-year-old or his former employers Team Sky have broken any rules. Cooke, 33, made the claims in evidence submitted to a Culture, Media and Sport select committee on Tuesday. The committee is examining doping in sport and Tuesday's session was held to discuss issues raised ata previous hearing involving British Cycling and Team Sky in December. In a wide-ranging testimony, Cooke provided examples of sexism she had encountered in her 13-year career, stating British Cycling shows ""discrimination and favouritism"" because it is ""answerable to itself"". The Welsh former world and Commonwealth cycling champion added that the fight against doping is ""the wrong people fighting the wrong war, in the wrong way, with the wrong tools"". ""While there is still a way to go, British Cycling is absolutely committed to resolving the historic gender imbalance in our sport,"" said the governing body in a statement. British Cycling is the subject of an investigation by UK Anti-Doping into allegations of wrongdoing in the sport and is also awaiting the findings of an independent review into an alleged bullying culture. Five-time Olympic champion Wiggins was granted a TUE to treat asthma and allergies, which was revealed when hacking groupFancy Bears released athletes' medical filesstolen from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Cooke compared her use of the steroid triamcinolone with that of Wiggins, stating she was granted a TUE for injections of the drug to treat a career-threatening knee injury as an alternative to surgery. She said she did not race again until ""long after the performance-enhancing effects had worn off"", and she added that Wiggins appeared to use the ""same steroid before his main goals of the season"". Cooke added she found the chronology of Wiggins' TUEs ""disturbing"" and that it made her ""sceptical"" of what Team Sky have done. The team was launched in 2010 with a zero-tolerance approach towards doping in cycling. This video can not be played Watch: Brailsford's tense grilling on Team Sky An inquiry by Ukad was launched following aDaily Mail allegation,externalthat a medical package was delivered to Wiggins on the final day of the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine. Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford told MPs in December that the package contained legal decongestant Fluimucil, but MP Damian Collins, chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, says British Cycling have beenunable to provide paperworkto prove the contents of the medical package. ""I find the stance of being the cleanest team, yet Dave Brailsford not being able to say what a rider took, definitely makes it hard to back up that claim,"" Cooke added. She alsoraised concernsas to why Simon Cope, who was British Cycling women's coach at the time, was chosen to courier the package to Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman in France. ""I do find it very surprising that Simon Cope transported something internationally without knowing what was in it,"" Cooke told MPs. She also alleged that Cope, a former team-mate of Wiggins at the Linda McCartney professional team, ""spent some weeks riding a moped in front of Wiggins as part of a training regimen"" as an example of how resources were ""stripped out of the women's program to augment the men's program"". When asked by MPs if sexism was culturally embedded in British Cycling, Cooke said: ""Yes I do"". She claimed that during her career, the governing body showed only ""transient"" support for female road riders. As part of her written evidence and appearance via video-link from Paris, Cooke cited numerous examples of ""discrimination and favouritism"" shown by British Cycling. She said the prize for the women's 2006 British Championships was a ""tiny fraction"" of the men's race, despite Cooke having just won the Grande Boucle Feminine Internationale - the women's equivalent of the Tour de France. The 2008 road race world champion added she had to take her own skin suit to the event in Italy after British Cycling had forgotten to organise one, having to then sew a Team Sky logo onto it at the behest of Brailsford. ""The facts are they did nothing for the women,"" said Cooke. An independent review into the culture of British Cycling began after its former technical director Shane Sutton was accused of using offensive and discriminatory language towards cyclist Jess Varnish. Despite beingcleared of eight of the nine charges against him,the Australian was found guilty of using sexist language in October but denies any wrongdoing and said  he would appeal the ruling. In her written evidence, Cooke said she had ""no faith in the actions in support of investigations conducted by Ukad or the testing they conduct, both completed at significant expense to the public purse"". In response, Ukad said: ""There should be no doubt about the determination of this organisation to protect clean sport; our staff passionately believe in protecting everyone's right to clean, fair and honest competition. Regarding Cooke's accusations of sexism, British Cycling said in a statement: ""There is always more that can be done and we strive to make continual improvements to ensure that cycling is reaching out to women and girls of all ages and abilities."" Meanwhile, UK Sport has launched an independent review to investigate some of the issues raised by Cooke. ""UK Sport takes its responsibilities as an investor of public funds and a champion of equality in sport very seriously,"" said a spokesman. ""On matters raised relating to the governance of the national governing body, UK Sport and Sport England have recently published a new code for sports governance which raises the bar for the requirements around governance that all sports bodies who receive public funding will need to address and comply to.""

"Adam Elliott had photographs taken to show his height in relation to the size of his car A tall man has been convicted of driving while standing up after admitting dangerous driving. Adam Elliott was accused of showing off to other motorists with his head poking out of the roof of a convertible Ford Ka. The 26-year-old from Newcastle, who is 6ft 7in (2m) tall, pleaded guilty at Newcastle Crown Court but later blamed his height. Speaking after the hearing, he said: ""I was not stood up, I am just tall."" Judge Robert Adams said it was ""pretty obvious"" Elliott had been ""showing off, demonstrating your height to people in an open top small car"". ""It was a dangerous thing to do,"" he said. Adam Elliott pleaded guilty to dangerous driving but later insisted he was just tall and not standing up in the car Mr Elliott, a car dealer, was seen in Gateshead and on the Tyne Bridge driving the car with the top down in January last year. He had been delivering the vehicle to a customer, he said. ""I pleaded guilty to this because I was advised to, but I still insist I was not standing up,"" he said. ""It's just because of my height. ""I'm an excellent driver but I was advised to plead guilty to get it over with."" The court heard Elliott had 12 previous convictions for driving while disqualified. He was given an interim driving ban of 12 months and will be sentenced next month.

"The claim:The government is announcing a cash boost for the North of England. Reality Check verdict:The money has already been announced twice. Prime Minister Theresa May is to continue former chancellor George Osborne's plans to create a Northern Powerhouse. On Monday, she held a cabinet meeting in Daresbury in Cheshire, where she unveiled her new, more interventionist industrial strategy. Details on where exactly the Northern Powerhouse cash will be spent are new, but the Â£556m total is not. Last March, George Osborne said a total of Â£1.8bn would be awarded in a round of ""growth deal"" funding to Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) across England. LEPs combine businesses, councils and other bodies to decide regional spending priorities, on things like city centre regeneration projects and innovation funds for businesses. It is part of a wider scheme aimed at boosting the post-Brexit UK economy and creating jobs, with a particular focus on investment in science, research and innovation. Mr Osborne's replacement, Philip Hammond, announced in November that Â£556m of this pot would go to the North of England. It was announced again in the Autumn Statement later that month. As well as the North's share, Mr Hammond allocated Â£492m to London and the South East, Â£392m to the Midlands, and smaller amounts to other regions. Northern leaders say their cities are stuck with weak economies because of underinvestment, while the South East takes the lion's share of public cash. The government says the Northern Powerhouse will go some way to rectifying the imbalance. In this case the North of England is getting 13% more than London and the South East. But other areas of government spending favour London over the North. The capital will receive six times more money on transport spending per person over the next five years, according toresearch by the Institute for Public Policy Research.,external Read more from Reality Check May unveils 'action' for industry Industrial strategy offers extra push Strategy 'will spread jobs across UK' Video, 00:00:43Strategy 'will spread jobs across UK' Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee three LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Inside neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

"This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg sets out three key points from the ruling ""Phew"", a government minister exhaled after this morning's court ruling. Certainly, the prime minister did not want to find herself in the position of having to ask MPs for permission to start our divorce from the European Union. Today's verdict from the justices doesn't take away from the reality that having to go to Parliament before triggering Article 50 is a political inconvenience Theresa May very much wanted to avoid. Nor does it change the sentiment among opposition MPs, some of whom are determined to try to amend whatever legislation the government puts forward to include guarantees of this or that, to try to force a vote on staying in the single market, or to push for final binding votes on the process when negotiations are complete. However, the sighs of relief are real in Whitehall this morning for two reasons. Nicola Sturgeon wanted the Scottish government to be consulted before Article 50 was triggered The justices held back from insisting that the devolved administrations would have a vote or a say on the process. That was, as described by a member of Team May, the ""nightmare scenario"". The Scottish National Party has said it would not try to veto Brexit, but there is no question that having a vote on Article 50 in the Holyrood Parliament could have been politically troublesome for the government. After the judgement it seems like an unexploded bomb. And second, the Supreme Court also held back from telling the government explicitly what it has to do next. The judgement is clear that it was not for the courts but for politicians to decide how to proceed next. That means, possibly as early as tomorrow, ministers will put forward what is expected to be an extremely short piece of legislation in the hope of getting MPs to approve it, perhaps within a fortnight. This video can not be played Attorney General Jeremy Wright: ""The government will comply with the judgement of the court"" Nightmare number two for the government would have been explicit instructions from the court about the kind of legislation they had to introduce. That wouldn't just have made ministers' lives very difficult when they want, above all else, to produce something that gives their opponents minimal room for manoeuvre. But it would have raised spiky questions about the power of the courts versus our politicians and parliaments - a fight few had the appetite to have.

"Vince Cable says the low status of vocational qualifications has deep roots ""Britain has done appallingly badly at vocational education for many years,"" says Sir Vince Cable, former business secretary, as Theresa May's industrial strategy promises to regenerate technical training and tackle the skills shortage. But why has this always been such a struggle? You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, A-levels and GCSEs. ""It's a deeply cultural thing,"" says Sir Vince, who held office during the Coalition government. ""It got built into the British mindset... if you're clever, you go to university, and if you're not so clever you go off and do a trade of some sort,"" he says. ""It's still the case that if you're academically inclined and you don't know what to do, you go to university. ""The others are told, 'Why not do an apprenticeship?' without being given much of a steer as to how to do it. ""And that's completely wrong, for many people it would be better if they went down that route from day one."" Sir Vince, who once taught Open University economics courses, is now getting back to his own educational roots. He is leading an online course on economics and politics, with the University of Nottingham, which will be available free on the Futurelearn online university network set up by the Open University. Vince Cable says the Chinese are now the free trade defenders, while the US puts up walls There will be no shortage of contemporary upheavals for these online students to talk about. Sir Vince talks of a ""bizarre Alice in Wonderland world"" in which the Chinese Communists are now the advocates of free trade while the United States, under President Donald Trump, is raising the banner of protectionism. ""You've got a hard-line Communist out there defending the liberal international economic order,"" he says. He describes himself as a ""big fan of the Chinese"", adding: ""like George Osborne"". Sir Vince had a close-up view of economic decision-making by politicians. He ranks Gordon Brown above David Cameron or Tony Blair on their grasp of economics - and says that all politicians can be guilty of looking for economic theories that confirm their political inclinations. George Osborne's approach to cutting the deficit, in the wake of the financial crash of 2008, was shaped by the rules set by US economist Kenneth Rogoff, says Sir Vince. And he says that the current rise of nationalism, populism and the push for protectionism are the direct fallout from the economic hangover from the recession. ""The real energy behind this new populism does come from 2008,"" he says. ""Real wages have declined, particularly in deprived parts of the country, public spending has been cut because of the deficit."" He says this has delivered a shock to a political system built on a post-War assumption of rising living standards. Sir Vince's new teaching project forms part of the wave of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. Moocs are also characterised by being free - and his period in office as business secretary saw him taking the controversial decision to raise university tuition fees in England to Â£9,000 per year. Tuition fees have hung like a dark cloud over the Liberal Democrats ever since - but he remains a stout defender of the fee increase. Vince Cable, who put up tuition fees, says the alternative was to cut further education ""It was the right thing to do, but very, very politically painful,"" he says. The alternative was to cut the further education budget. ""I wasn't willing to go along with that."" The fees are in effect a graduate tax, rather than a fee, he says, and the Liberal Democrats' big mistake was signing a pledge not to increase fees. He says he was ""vehemently opposed"" to this promise before the 2010 election. ""I could see that if ever we got into government, it would be a disaster.

"Find out more about the nominees for the 89th Academy Awards, which will take place on 26 February 2017. ISABELLE HUPPERT Age:63 Nominated for:Elle The character:Michele Leblanc, the head of a video game company, who is raped in her home. Oscar record:None. The critics said:""Huppert gives a performance of imperious fury, holding the audience at bay, almost goading us to disown her. Audaciously, Elle presents her not so much as a victim but as the casualty of a world she is very much a part of; maybe (still more troublingly) an accessory to."" [The Guardian,external] RUTH NEGGA Age:35 Nominated for:Loving The character:Mildred Loving, whose interracial marriage to Richard Loving (Joel Edgerton), led to the couple's arrest and banishment from the US state of Virginia in the 1950s. Oscar record:None The critics said:""When her expressive eyes, usually downcast, rise up to confront a world that needs changing, it's impossible not to be moved. The stabbing simplicity of Negga's acting is breathtaking."" [Rolling Stone,external] NATALIE PORTMAN Age:35 Nominated for:Jackie The character:Jackie Kennedy, whose husband President John F Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Oscar record:Portman won best actress for Black Swan in 2011 and was nominated for best supporting actress for Closer in 2005. The critics said:""Portman's intricate performance... may just trump her Oscar-winning turn in Black Swan as the most high-wire feat she's ever pulled off."" [Variety,external] EMMA STONE Age:28 Nominated for:La La Land The character:Mia Dolan, an aspiring actress working in a Los Angeles coffee shop. Oscar record:Nominated for best supporting actress for Birdman in 2015. The critics said:""This is a career-best moment for Stone, who is grounded and spunky as the scrappy aspiring actress, then graceful and poised as Mia continues her journey."" [Cinema Blend,external] MERYL STREEP Age:67 Nominated for:Florence Foster Jenkins The character:Streep plays Florence Foster Jenkins, a New York heiress who dreamed of becoming an opera singer, despite having an awful singing voice. Oscar record:Streep has 19 previous Oscar nominations and has won three times - twice as best actress, for The Iron Lady (2012) and Sophie's Choice (1983), and once as best supporting actress, in Kramer vs Kramer (1980).

"The biggest prize at the Oscars on Sunday is saved for last - the Academy Award for best picture. This year, nine films are nominated. If you've not had a chance (or the desire) to see them all, here's a guide to what you need to know - which means thatthis contains spoilers. Make sure you read this before going anywhere near a water cooler on Monday morning. Find out more about this year's Oscars nominations.,external ""What do you mean, I'm not nominated for best actress?"" Who's in it and who directed it?Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker and some aliens that look like giant squid are the main stars. Denis Villeneuve is the director. What's it about?Aliens. NO WAIT COME BACK. Amy Adams plays Louise Banks, a linguistics expert who is called in by the US Army to translate what aliens who have landed at random spots around the world are trying to say. Oh, one small thing, she can also see into the future. And has to deal with the fact that she knows her future daughter is going to die of cancer. So yeah, it's pretty intense. What did the critics say?""An intelligent, eloquent and stirring sci-fi that grips from start to finish, Arrival is up there with the year's best movies.""[Total Film],external How likely is it to win?It's picked up a string of trophies during awards season already, but it would it's unlikely to take home the main prize at the Oscars. Talking point:Even though it's up for best picture, Amy Adamsfailed to secure a nomination in the best actress category- she was nominated at the Golden Globes and Baftas, though. A rare happy moment in Fences Who's in it and who directed it?Viola Davis and Denzel Washington play husband and wife Troy and Rose Maxson. Washington also directed the film, based on the August Wilson play Fences. What's it about?This family drama set in 1950s America is centred around the domineering Troy Maxson, who rules his home with an iron fist and has a volatile relationship with his son Cory. That's not to say he doesn't have a loving relationship with Rose, but it's fair to say her patience is tested by his behaviour later in the film (spoiler: he cheats). What did the critics say?""It's all too seldom that a feature film combines brilliant acting with a spellbinding flow of language.""[The Wall Street Journal],external How likely is it to win?While Washington and Davis are great, the film isn't exactly... cinematic. This one is an outsider. Talking point:It's not the first time Washington and Davis have played these roles - they were the Maxsons on Broadway in 2010, winning Tony Awards for their performances. Who's in it and who directed it?Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer are in the cast of this Mel Gibson war epic. What's it about?The true story of a guy called Desmond Doss, a World War Two medic who joined the army but refused to even touch a gun - due both to his Christian faith and the fact he has a violent father. He struggles to be accepted in the army at first but goes on to single-handedly save the lives of 75 men. Warning: it's quite (okay, extremely) gory. What did the critics say?""Thanks to some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed, Gibson once again shows his staggering gifts as a film-maker, able to juxtapose savagery with aching tenderness.""[Rolling Stone],external How likely is it to win?It's currently the seventh favourite out of the nine - so not very. Talking point:The film has been seen as something of a comeback for Mel Gibson. His nomination of best director is a sign of him being welcomed back into Hollywood after his career hit rock bottom. Who's in it and who directed it?Jeff Bridges, Ben Foster and Chris Pine star; David Mackenzie directed. What's it about?An ex-con (Foster) and his brother (Pine) resort to robbing banks in an attempt save their family's Texan ranch after the death of their mother. Bridges plays the ranger on their case. It's been described as a modern Western, but it could also be described as a cops and robbers drama with slices of sharp comedy, or a study of two brothers battling against the system. What did the critics say?:""Hell or High Water is a thrillingly good movie - a crackerjack drama of crime, fear and brotherly love set in a sun-roasted, deceptively sleepy West Texas that feels completely exotic for being so authentic."" [Variety,external] How likely is it to win?It's gritty, heartfelt and beautifully written, but it's fair to say this is the rank outsider. And you could be forgiven for it having gone under your radar - it was released in the UK last September, and in August in the US. Talking point:The producers had to deal withsweltering conditions and rattlesnakes,externalduring filming, describing the conditions as ""insufferable"". What's that saying about suffering for your art..? Who's in it and who directed it?Taraji P Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae play the three leads. Theodore Melfi directs. What's it about?Three female mathematicians take jobs at Nasa during the 1960s space race,  challenging racial and sexist prejudice along the way. Katherine Johnson is made to drink from a ""coloured"" coffee urn and go on 40-minute breaks to get to the ""coloured"" toilets on the other side of the NASA campus, despite being one of the brightest brains of the whole project. What did the critics say?""Hidden Figures, both a dazzling piece of entertainment and a window into history, bucks the trend of the boring-math-guy movie.""[Time],external How likely is it to win?Could be a surprise winner - and it would definitely be a popular one. The film has doneincredibly well at the box office,external. Talking point:Free screenings of the film have been put on in the US for young girls who are likely to be inspired by it. Who's in it and who directed it?Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are the all-singing, all-dancing stars in Damien Chazelle's film. What's it about?For those who've been buried under a rock (or just refuse to be swept along by the hype)... the musical traces the stories of aspiring actress Mia and pianist Sebastian, who dreams of opening his own jazz club. What did the critics say?""Audacious, retro, funny and heartfelt, La La Land is the latest great musical for people who don't like musicals - and will slap a mile-wide smile across the most miserable of faces.""[Empire],external How likely is it to win?Very. Like, very very. Bookies say it is the overwhelming favourite - and it doesn't hurt that it's a film all about Hollywood itself. Talking point:Some have deigned to suggest that La La Land isoverhyped and overrated- but that hasn't stopped its juggernaut-like journey through awards season. Who's in it and who directed it?Sunny Pawar is Saroo as a young boy, with Dev Patel playing him as an adult. There's also Rooney Mara and Nicole Kidman. The film is directed by Garth Davis. What's it about?This is the staggering true story of a young Indian boy who is adopted after losing his family at a young age. But he manages to find them again, decades later. With a bit of help from Google Earth. What did the critics say?""The beauty of Lion is that it explores and allows for the unique possibilities and power of multiple homes, multiple families and multiple selves.""[The Chicago Tribune],external How likely is it to win?Dev is certainly in the frame for best supporting actor, but it's not that likely to translate to best picture success. Talking point:It's been making people cry. A lot. And not just audiences - both Dev andNicole Kidmansay the script made them weep. So if you go to see it, take tissues. Who's in it and who directed it?Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams star, with Kenneth Lonergan the director. What's it about?Caretaker Lee Chandler, played by Affleck, has to look after his teenage nephew after his brother (the boy's father) dies. And he does this while still grieving for his own young children, who died in a house fire. It's safe to say this film is short on laughs. What did the critics say?""Manchester by the Sea is heartbreaking yet somehow heartening, a film that just wallops you with its honesty, its authenticity and its access to despair.""[Los Angeles Times],external How likely is it to win?The Academy tends to like gritty, serious films which could explain why it's currently fourth favourite. Talking point:The original idea was thought up by Matt Damon and John Krasinski, from the US version of The Office. Damon was actually meant to star as Lee originally, but had other filming commitments. Who's in it and who directed it?Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris and Janelle Monae star in Barry Jenkins's film. What's it about?Moonlight tells the story of a young man named Chiron through three stages of his life, as he battles life in extreme poverty with an abusive drug addict mother, all the while trying to come to terms with his sexuality. He has one gay experience in his teenage years but struggles to accept his sexuality in a neighbourhood that is largely hostile towards it. What did the critics say?""It's a thrilling, deeply necessary work that opens up a much-needed and rarely approached on-screen conversation about the nature of gay masculinity.""[The Guardian],external How likely is it to win?It's currently second favourite and has been picking up awards left, right and centre -so watch this space. Talking point:Naomie Harris is nominated for best supporting actress - yet she managed to squeeze all of her filming into just three days.

"Find out about the best actor nominees for the 89th Academy Awards, which will take place on 26 February 2017. CASEY AFFLECK Age:41 Nominated for:Manchester by the Sea The character:Lee Chandler, an odd job man near Boston, who has a painful past and who suddenly finds himself with extra responsibilities. Oscar record:A best supporting actor nomination for The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford in 2008. The critics said:""Barricaded inside the shell that's become of him, Lee peers at the world through guarded eyes, only just summoning the basic drive to get up every morning, shuffle out, and carry on his tasks. He's played by Casey Affleck, in a clenched and riveting performance which fulfils all the promise he's ever shown, and then some."" [Daily Telegraph,external] ANDREW GARFIELD Age:33 Nominated for:Hacksaw Ridge The character:Desmond Doss, a World War Two medic who became the first conscientious objector to win the prestigious US Medal of Honor. Oscar record:None. The critics said:""He's found a great fit for his talents in Hacksaw Ridge, which asks him to be a sweet Virginia boy courting a sweet nurse... and then a shell-shocked but determined man of valour in a lunar hellscape. Gosh, do we root for this kid."" [Vanity Fair,external] RYAN GOSLING Age:36 Nominated for:La La Land The character:Sebastian Wilder, a jazz pianist chasing his dreams in Hollywood. Oscar record:Best actor nomination for Half Nelson in 2007. The critics said:""Mr Gosling's performance is understated, with a tinge of touching earnestness, but it's also witty and commandingly smart. What's more, he does Seb's fluent piano playing without benefit of doubles on screen or on the sound track, an achievement I found astonishing."" [The Wall Street Journal,external] VIGGO MORTENSEN Age:58 Nominated for:Captain Fantastic The character:Ben Cash, a hippy father who has raised his children in a remote home, far from the pressures of modern life. Oscar record:One previous nomination for best actor, for Eastern Promises (2008). The critics said:""The movie really belongs to Mortensen, who allows Ben to be exasperating, arrogant and impatient but also warm, loving and caring. He's a tough but adoring father, a grieving widower and an angry defender of his wife's final wishes, and Mortensen plays all these notes and more with subtlety and grace."" [The Wrap,external] DENZEL WASHINGTON Age:62 Nominated for:Fences The character:Troy Maxson, a Pittsburgh sanitation worker and former professional baseball player. Oscar record:Two Oscar wins - best supporting actor for Glory (1990) and best actor for Training Day (2002). He also has a best supporting actor nomination for Cry Freedom (1988) and three best actor nominations for Malcolm X (1993), The Hurricane (2000) and Flight (2012). The critics said:""While Denzel Washington's direction might leave a little to be desired, his acting has never been more relentless and fierce.""

"The papers look at whether Prime Minister Theresa May will have to give MPs a vote before triggering Article 50 The Trident missile row is the lead for the Times, the Guardian and the Mirror. According tothe Times,external, the Obama administration asked Britain to keep details of the botched test secret. It quotes a British military source as saying the British submarine successfully carried and launched the missile, but the bit that went wrong was the US proprietary technology. Prime Minister Theresa May and the Defence Secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, come in for heavy criticism in some quarters for their refusal to answer questions about the alleged failure of the Trident missile test. TheMirror,externalaccuses them of treating the public like children - and urges them to be open and straight with the British people. TheGuardian,externalsays the test raises critical questions about the safety and effectiveness of Britain's nuclear weapons system - and should not be concealed from MPs. For theTimes,external, the merits of Trident should be shouted from the rooftops - but that is no reason to hide failings. They should be examined seriously and openly, with a view to putting them right, it adds. The papers look ahead to Tuesday morning's Supreme Court ruling on whether the prime minister will have to give MPs a vote before triggering Article 50. TheTimes,externalsays most experts think it is unlikely the judges will overrule the decision of the lower High Court - and the government is preparing for defeat. According to theGuardian,external, government lawyers have warned Theresa May that drawing up a very short piece of legislation in response to the ruling may not be adequate. It says the legal advice is that failure to provide enough detail could open the government to further legal appeals in the future. TheExpress,externalsays the Supreme Court is expected to agree with the High Court judgement that a vote in Parliament on triggering Article 50 will be necessary. If that is so - theSun says,external- then campaigners will have made their point, parliamentary sovereignty will have been upheld and the government must immediately bring forward a Brexit Bill. Parliament must then do its duty and enact the will of the biggest mandate in our history, the paper adds. It warns that MPs and peers will be ""playing with fire"" if they draft amendments pushing for what it calls some phoney compromise. The Mail, too, urges Parliament not to""sabotage"" a Brexit Bill,externalwith any wrecking amendments. It says any MP or peer who backed them would be treating the electorate with contempt, and the referendum result with disdain - and defying the will of the people. The Mail reports that ambulance trusts across England are so desperate to recruit paramedics that they are offeringgenerous packages to fill gaping vacancy lists,external, including sign-on bonuses of up to Â£10,000 and relocation expenses. Figures obtained by the paper show that regional ambulance services are short of 745 paramedics. It says morale is so low that more paramedics are leaving than the number signing up. The government has increased training places, but that is unlikely to have an effect for many years, the paper adds. The Sun reports that staff at the Baftas are concerned the Duchess of Cambridge could outshine A-list actresses TheSun,externalleads with a report that the Baftas are involved in an awkward behind-the-scenes stand-off with their president, Prince William, over whether he will attend the awards with his wife. It says the prince had intended to go to the ceremony next month, after missing it for the last two years. Two separate Bafta sources have told the paper that senior staff at the organisation fear that the Duchess of Cambridge could steal the spotlight from A-list actresses if she comes too - and have suggested it would be preferable for him to turn up alone. An official Bafta statement published by the paper says the organisation would be delighted to welcome both of them any year they are able to attend. Finally, a British company has developed a smartphone app that helps commuters overcome an awkward social situation: you want to offer your seat on a crowded bus or train to a woman you think is pregnant - but are not sure and do not want to give offence. TheTimes,externalreports that it alerts passengers within 15ft if a pregnant woman would like a seat - effectively a ""smart"" version of a ""baby on board"" badge. The app comes in two parts: mothers-to-be download a ""request seat"" app to send the alerts, while anyone else can download the second app to receive the alerts. According to the paper, once a passenger has received a notification - causing their phone to ping or vibrate - both parties must rely on eye contact to spot each other and the seat can then be offered.

"The Supreme Court has ruled that the government must consult Parliament before triggering Article 50 - the clause in the EU Treaty that will formally start the Brexit process. Furthermore, it has ruled that nothing less than an act of Parliament will do. That means that MPs and members of the House of Lords will get to vote on whether it happens. They will also get the chance to try to amend the bill as it passes through the various legislative stages. In principle, this could delay the process. However, in practice it is thought unlikely that Theresa May's end of March deadline will be missed. The government wanted to trigger Article 50 using the Royal Prerogative, which is a set of powers that used to be held by the monarch but now reside with government ministers. That would have meant it could have done so at a time of its choosing and without consulting Parliament at all. The decision that it must specifically pass a bill is significant. Some other procedures would have meant fewer stages in Parliament and no chance to make amendments. A full bill means that both houses of Parliament must agree and amendments are possible. To become an act of Parliament a bill must pass several stages in both the Commons and the Lords. That often takes months of debate, but it doesn't necessarily have to. Emergency legislation can be passed within a single day if everyone agrees it is urgent. The bill to trigger Article 50 won't be that quick, but it needn't take too long. For one thing, it is likely to be a very short bill with only one or two clauses. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that his MPs should not seek to block Article 50. Ken Clarke is expected to be the only Conservative who will vote against it. So the numbers look to be in place to ensure a smooth passage for the bill in the House of Commons. But more MPs may back attempts to amend the bill, for example, by adding conditions about the sort of Brexit the government should negotiate. In principle, the House of Lords could be different. The government does not have a majority and many peers remain strongly opposed to Brexit. However, there is recognition that Parliament voted overwhelmingly to hold a referendum and that the referendum delivered a clear, albeit close, result. Members of the House of Lords, who are not elected, realise that any attempt to frustrate Brexit could be regarded as undemocratic.

"This is a critical moment for journalism, particularly in the United States. More than 40 years ago, the unmasking of the Watergate break-in inspired journalists around the world. Reporters appeared as tireless investigators holding the most powerful to account. Now, a new president declares the fourth estate ""dishonest human beings"". A global survey published last week found only 43% of people trusted the traditional media. Journalists find themselves on the defensive having to demonstrate their integrity to a sceptical public. Donald Trump believes he is in a ""running war"" with parts of the media. This video can not be played Where do Donald Trump supporters get their news from? This struggle over who defines the facts will be a central feature of his administration. Social media enables leaders to bypass traditional media and to talk to the public directly. Donald Trump, with his 34,000 tweets, understands the reach and the power this gives him. He can sit in the White House and, with a single tweet, define the news agenda of the day or distract attention away from uncomfortable news. Some of the traditional media now accept they were instrumental in the rise of Donald Trump. He was good for ratings. He was the ""candidate that kept on giving"", as you would regularly hear in Washington. Controversy surrounded the size of the crowd at Donald Trump's inauguration But President Trump's rise to power was partly built on attacking the media. At rally after rally, I watched Donald Trump point at the press pen and denounce journalists as ""terrible"" people, the ""worst"". It was a deliberate tactic. He wanted to define much of the media as part of the establishment elite who had ignored the plight of ordinary Americans. He sowed the seed that journalists and their stories about him could not be trusted. Painting journalists as untrustworthy gave him cover when he was accused of lying and exaggeration. Trump claims media 'dishonest' over crowd photos Trump's 'alternative facts': Why the row about inauguration 'lies'? Sean Spicer: Who is President Trump's spin doctor? Eight ways the Trump presidency will make history And so we inhabit the ""post-truth world"". Democracy can't function without facts that are widely accepted. It doesn't mean that facts shouldn't be disputed or their meaning argued over, but societies need a bedrock of information to inform their decisions. If conspiracies and exaggerations are accepted as alternative realities, then it is much more difficult for a leader to be judged in the court of public opinion. When, a few days ago, the senior White House aide Kellyanne Conway was asked why the president's press secretary had lied about the crowd size at the inauguration, she defended him by saying he was offering ""alternative facts"". Kellyanne Conway used the term ""alternative facts"" to defend the White House press secretary Her interviewer, Chuck Todd, of NBC, retorted that ""alternative facts aren't facts, they're falsehoods"". It was an early round in the battle for the truth. I recall an exchange I had at a Trump event where it was explained to me that the fact that a lot of people believed something gave it an element of truth. Most Americans still get their news from TV, but more than 30% get it from the internet and particularly from Facebook. There is now a lot of research on the role of social media in spreading false information. In Europe, too, the reputation of the media is under fire. Journalists have been damaged by hacking, by intrusion and the suspicion that they don't tell the whole story. In Germany, parts of the mainstream media were accused of covering up reports ofassaults on women in Cologne on New Year's Day 2016because many of the allegations related to men believed to be migrants. In theEdelman Trust barometer,external- published last week - trust in the media had fallen to an all-time low in 17 of the 28 countries polled. So what is to be done? White House press secretary Sean Spicer says the administration will ""hold the press accountable"" In the United States, news organisations are grappling with difficult questions. When should a tweet from President Trump be allowed to dominate the news agenda? Will the cable networks have the courage to ignore a tweet? Will the networks pursue potentially damaging stories even if it risks losing access or an interview? One TV executive said the biggest challenge was to avoid being seen as part of the ""running war"" that President Trump describes. Some organisations in the US, the UK and Germany -including the BBC- are embracing ""reality checks"" as part of their coverage, but they are time consuming and difficult. Governments, too, are looking into how to boost trust in statistics and official information. It might mean the creation of more agencies that are truly independent of government and politicians. The new White House press secretary has said: ""We are going to hold the press accountable."" It signals a battle over who defines the truth and who defines the facts. American journalism will face one of its severest tests.

"Benoit Hamon has been short on detail with his plan for basic income in France He's been called the ""French Bernie Sanders"". After his decisive win in the first round of France's Socialist party primary, left-wing rebel, Benoit Hamon is suddenly the centre of attention. But what do his rapid rise and eye-catching policies say about the future of the French left? With his designer stubble and cheeky grin, the 49-year-old Socialist party rebel has been grabbing more than his share of the limelight over the past few weeks. The most left-leaning of the seven initial candidates in the Socialist race, his programme has been built around the radical proposal of a universal monthly payment for all French citizens, regardless of income. He also wants to legalise cannabis, to tax the wealth created by robots and to ditch the labour law passed last year that made it easier to hire and fire. The income plan he has outlined would be put into effect in three stages. First, the current minimum welfare payment for France's poorest would be increased by 10% to â¬600 (Â£515; $640) a month The payments would then be extended to all those from 18-25 years old Finally the programme would be rolled out to all French citizens sometime after 2022, with the monthly payment increased to â¬750 a month Benoit Hamon promises to ""make France's heart beat"" Critics have pilloried the plan as unworkable, estimating its cost at between â¬300-â¬400bn. It's true that Mr Hamon has been short on detail when it comes to how his vision for France would be funded. But that doesn't seem to have affected his popularity among left-wing voters. More on this story France's Socialists battle for party's future France's plan to ban out-of-hours emails Will Finland's basic income trial help the jobless? By finishing several points ahead of former Prime Minister Manuel Valls during the first round of voting on Sunday, Mr Hamon has drawn attention to some important questions for France's ruling left-wing party: most obviously, the deep split between the Socialist party's left-wing supporters and the more liberal, centrist line taken by the current Socialist government. Manuel Valls was the prime minister who pushed through some of that government's most unpopular labour reforms and security measures. That left a rift with the party that may force him out of the presidential race in the run-off on Sunday. Benoit Hamon is going into round two in a strong position, having secured the support of fellow left-winger Arnaud Montebourg, who came third in the first round. Benoit Hamon (L) resigned as a minister with Arnaud Montebourg in 2014 after they called for an end to austerity If Mr Hamon wins, it will reorient the Socialist party away from the centre of French politics, and back to its traditional left-wing positions. That may not help him much during the presidential race. Whoever wins the Socialist nomination is tipped to come fifth, according to the opinion polls. But it could have two important consequences for France. A nomination for Mr Hamon is likely to funnel centrist votes towards liberal former banker Emmanuel Macron, whose growing popularity is starting to worry the far-right National Front (FN), which is now banking on a place in the second round of the presidential poll. France's leading presidential candidates Francois Fillon, Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron are leading the field in the presidential race Francois Fillon - centre-right favourite What makes Marine Le Pen far right? Emmanuel Macron - France's ambitious 'man on the move' And, even as the populist campaigns gather speed in France, the appearance of Benoit Hamon at the head of the Socialist campaign could also signal a return to the politics of a previous era. For years France's established parties have drifted to the centre ground and voter apathy has grown. But now voters already have the prospect of an old-school Catholic conservative heading the main right-wing Republican party. And if Benoit Hamon wins the Socialist nomination on Sunday, the main left-wing party will once again embrace its traditional positions on workers' rights, redistribution, civil liberties and the environment.

"This video can not be played Does using art to sell hotels make good business sense? If you visit the Emperor Qianmen hotel, near the Forbidden City in Beijing, be sure to bring an umbrella - otherwise you may get drenched. That's because it sometimes rains inside the lobby. This is not due to a leaking roof. The ""rain"" comes from an installation by the Canadian artist Dan Euser, whose other pieces at the Emperor include an astonishingly realistic ""waterfall"" in the hotel's spa. The Emperor is a ""water hotel"", explains the Chinese artist Bingyi, another member of the team behind the establishment's design. It is built on the site of an old bath house, and it was this, Bingyi adds, that gave the hotel's architect, Adam Sokol, the idea for an aquatic theme for the project. At the Emperor Hotel in Beijing an art installation creates rain inside the lobby Art can be found almost everywhere at the Emperor. Bingyi's work on display includes Cave in Heaven, a vast ink and paper mural covering 400 square metres, over the entire walls of a large space. Bingyi believes that China today is a fruitful place for collaborations between artists and hotels, like the one at the Emperor. ""Cultural significance is very important to Chinese. ""We take the greatest pride in our cultural heritageâ¦ we write calligraphy, we write poetry, we have this kind of particular passion to turn every little craft into this magnificent habit of living, and we're just obsessed with it,"" she says. The lobby of luxury hotel Nuo displays huge vases made from Chinese porcelain The Emperor is far from the only hotel in Beijing to place an emphasis on the role of art. Enter the lobby of the Nuo, a new luxury hotel, and you could be forgiven for thinking you had stepped into a museum. Throughout the vast space a series of giant vases are arrayed, each one more than two metres tall. They were made in Jingdezhen, home of fine Chinese porcelain for thousands of years. The blue and white vases echo the Ming Dynasty theme that pervades much of the hotel's design. But they are only the beginning, says Adrian Rudin, the hotel's general manager: ""Wherever you go, from the lobby lounge to the bar, there are different art pieces, some sculptures, some paintings, from different young and upcoming artists."" He estimates the value of artworks at the hotel at around $50m [Â£40m; 46m euros]."" Beijing hotel managers say that art is one way for luxury lodgings to set themselves apart from rivals Why so much - or indeed, any - art? ""It is a selling point in terms of consumers who are interested in fine art and culture,"" says Mr Rudin.  But, he adds, there are other reasons too. The hotel is the starting point of a new venture with the aim of creating an ""international luxury Chinese brand"" Mr Rudin explains. In this context, he believes that art has a key role to play in helping the new enterprise to find a distinctive voice. Other luxury groups also see merit in this kind of approach. The Rosewood Hotel says its aim is to create a space that feels like a ""luxury private home"" One of the troubles of the modern international hotel scene, says Marc Brugger, is that it is an ""ocean of sameness"". Mr Brugger is managing director of the Rosewood hotel, another recently-launched luxury property in Beijing. He believes that art can play a valuable role for luxury lodgings seeking to find new ways to set themselves apart. However, for this to be successful, time and careful thought are required. When the hotel was being conceived, Mr Brugger recalls, the idea of creating somewhere that felt like a ""luxury private home"" emerged. In such an establishment, art would have its natural place. This meant departing from the usual hotel design process. Chinese artist Bingyi's work for the Emperor Hotel includes Cave in Heaven, a vast ink and paper mural covering 400 square metres According to Mr Brugger, what often happens is that plans will be drawn up and some blank spaces will be left for ""art"" to be added later. ""That method is much faster"" he says, than the ""holistic"" approach taken in designing the Rosewood, where most of the art was specially commissioned and integrated into the design. The design team searched for up-and-coming artists who could create work that would fit well into the scheme, rather than existing pieces from established names which might overpower or destabilise the overall look. It took a long time to find the right artists, says Mr Brugger, but he feels that the results were well worth it. Do collaborations between artists and hotels like these make good commercial and creative sense? Up to a point, say experts. ""There is a rationale for doing this, in a crowded hotel market"" says Peter York, who has been an adviser to many large luxury enterprises.  Companies need to find ways ""to stand out from the ordinariness of luxury now, because luxury has become very ordinary"". But he says there can be risks, both for the hotels, and more particularly for the artists: ""It's a sensitive balance between what you do to make a lot of money, and to pump your brand, and the verdict of history - and you don't want the verdict of history to come in too fast"", he warns. Still, Chinese hotel operators, and the artists they work with, remain optimistic about the future and the benefits that can flow from working together. ""We're really re-imagining what is luxury"" says Bingyi. ""We just all need to be reminded every single day how beautiful things can be.""

"Johann Ofner worked as a stuntman In an infamous filming accident in 1993, actor Brandon Lee died after being shot in the abdomen on the set of The Crow. Lee, 28, was struck by a bullet fragment while filming a scene. He succumbed to his injuries hours later. It emerged the revolver, loaded with a blank cartridge, had most likely retained the fragment from earlier filming. More than two decades on, another fatal set shooting in Australia has stirred memories of the Lee incident - although its exact circumstances remain unclear. Stuntman Johann Ofner, also 28, wasshot on Mondaywhile filming a video for hip hop act Bliss N Eso in central Brisbane. Film crew members and paramedics administered CPR, but Mr Ofner died at the scene. Queensland Police have not said what type of weapon or ammunition was involved, but Detective Inspector Tom Armitt said several firearms were found at the scene. Police outside the Brisbane bar where Mr Ofner died ""We're making further inquiries regarding the supplier of the firearms used [and] the manufacturer of the simulated ammunition,"" he said on Monday. ""So all those sorts of investigations will be undertaken in order to present the brief to the coroner."" On Tuesday afternoon, police said they were still interviewing witnesses and gathering both CCTV and film crew footage. ""A ballistics test is also being conducted as is as a post-mortem examination, however these results may take some time to be returned to police,"" they said in a statement. Police were also working with Queensland Workplace Health and Safety, and the coroner's office. Bliss N Eso on Tuesday,externalsaid they were ""devastated"" about the death of Mr Ofner, a father of one. In a separate statement, the band's management said there was a shotgun, two handguns and an imitation firearm at the scene. ""Johann was tragically fatally injured when a prop gun was discharged as part of filming a scene in Bliss n Eso's video clip,"" the statement said. ""The gun was loaded with blanks, not live ammunition. Mr Ofner posted this video on his Instagram account ""The exact cause of Johann's fatal injury is still to be confirmed, but as the gun was loaded with blanks, not live ammunition, the cause was not a bullet or live round."" The band said a production company had employed the stunt group responsible for hiring both Mr Ofner and a licensed armourer. The armourer was on scene at the time and the filming had ""all of the appropriate permits"", the statement said. Shortly before his death, Mr Ofner posted on Instagram a video from the set that showed props including guns, money and casino chips. Over footage of the weapons, he wrote ""faulty props"", but did not elaborate further. A blank is a type of cartridge that contains gunpowder and wadding or paper, but no bullet. However, experts warn blanks can be highly dangerous, especially for anyone near a gun's muzzle. Local media outlets, citing sources, have reported Mr Ofner was shot at close range. ""Unfortunately a lot of people think blanks are safe. They aren't. They're an explosive charge, they're highly focused... and they have a huge amount of energy,"" theatrical armourer John Bowring told the BBC. Bliss N Eso have won several Aria awards, the Australian equivalent of the Grammys ""The supersonic gas that comes out of the muzzle, if the bullet is not there, has more energy than the fired bullet. So the gas could literally rip a hole through your body."" Fellow armourer Brendan Byrne also said blanks had the potential to be deadly. ""On a film set, you never want to directly point the gun at an actor, which a lot of people tend to do because that's the best angle,"" he told the BBC. ""But you [should] point it off centre and adjust your camera angle."" Mr Byrne said licensed armourers were trained to handle weapons safely. This included their cleaning, storage and transportation. But the relevant industry union in Australia, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, has said it will closely monitor the investigation by authorities. ""There have been no instances of fatalities to our knowledge in the recent past, and that is because we have very rigorous standards in relation to safety,"" spokeswoman Zoe Angus told theAustralian Broadcasting Corp,external. Ms Angus told the broadcaster she did not know if those standards were followed. ""This is a wake-up call for those safety guidelines to be reviewed and extended into - for example - online productions, music videos, the whole other raft of screen production sector,"" she said.

"Marco has this image of his mother, who has been missing since 2000 For one young Swiss man looking for his birth family, official channels had turned up nothing. So Marco Hauenstein, 19, turned to Facebook to try to find out more - not anticipating how widely his post would be shared. Marco did not have an easy start in life, as the very few facts he knows about his birth mother indicate. Gina Barbara Hauenstein was a drug addict, and during the 1990s spent time, Marco believes, in Zurich's then notorious Platzspitz open drugs scene, where addicts bought heroin in a city centre park, and injected it openly. When Marco was born in 1997, he was already addicted too, and had to spend the first months of his life in hospital withdrawing and recovering. Although his mother visited him from time to time, he never lived with her. About his father, he knows nothing: on his birth certificate, the space for the father's name has been left blank. In 2000, Gina Hauenstein disappeared. Despite a police search both within Switzerland and across Europe, no trace of her has ever been found, and she remains listed as a missing person. Gina Hauenstein: Missing since 2000 Marco meanwhile lived with a foster family. He describes his childhood as happy, but he admits questions about his birth family were ""always on my mind"". When he turned 16, Marco left his foster family. There had been disagreements, not unusual between parents and teenagers, but Marco says his relationship with his foster family is good, and has improved since he began to live independently. At the same time, he started to look for his birth family, and in particular for his mother. ""I really wanted to know, for myself, who was my family, who I belonged to,"" he explained. ""So, when I was 16, I started to call town record offices, and I contacted the police. But without success."" Marco Hauenstein's search has drawn in many social media users, including journalists Talking to Marco, it is not entirely clear why this more traditional search for family members was unsuccessful. Switzerland is a small country, Marco was never adopted, he knew his birth name, his mother's name and, it seems, the town she came from, where her parents (his grandparents) still apparently lived. Perhaps the idea of a Facebook appeal seemed the most logical, or the fastest, way to reach out. And posting messages on social media might understandably be easier for a teenager than cold-calling official figures in local government or the police. But the simple message which appeared on Facebook just three weeks ago has had consequences Marco - who uses the name Marco Julius Schelling on Facebook - did not expect. His message was shared and re-shared across Switzerland and Germany many thousands of times, and soon the media took an interest in his story too. Excerpt from Marco's Facebook appeal: Dear friends, acquaintances & fellow human beings My name is Marco Hauenstein, and I was born on 17.06.1997 in the Aargau/Zurich region. After going through drug withdrawal as a newborn for 3-6 months I grew up with the Jung family, and later with the Schelling family. After searching for many years without success, I'm turning to you. I'm looking for my birth parents / grandparents! When I meet him in Zurich, he seems rather overwhelmed by the attention. He is accompanied by a camera crew from a local television station, and during our conversation he fields calls from a German channel, and a Swiss newspaper. At the same time new responses to his Facebook appeal are appearing on his phone every couple of minutes. ""I've had thousands and thousands of messages,"" he says. ""I really didn't expect this."" Marco Hauenstein as a baby, with his birth mother But his Facebook search has had some initial success. An aunt, a half-sister of his mother, has reached out to him, he says, and he has talked to her by phone. ""It was very emotional, we didn't talk much, it was just, 'Hello, so good to talk to you after all these years'.""  The plan is ""that we will meet tomorrowâ¦ I think we will meet tomorrow"". Marco has also received information relating to his grandmother, an uncle, and even, he says, some hints about the identity of his father. But he seems reluctant to share too much detail. When our interview finishes, he is met by yet another television crew. Messages for Marco keep pouring in The next day, I get a message from Marco. The planned meeting with his aunt has not taken place, he says, because ""I could not reach her"". It is clear the social media attention, and then the interest shown by the mainstream media, have caused problems. Adopted or foster children hoping to meet their birth families, or birth parents looking for their children, are generally advised to proceed using an intermediary, to communicate in confidence, and to arrange a face-to-face meeting only when all sides are really ready for it. The advent of sites like Facebook has changed that. Social services report growing numbers of cases in which adopted or fostered children, or parents who have given their children up or had them taken into care, have been tracked down and contacted out of the blue. The brutal reality is that these contacts are not always welcome: not everyone wants a reunion. Tracing relatives is difficult for Marco despite the power of social media But for Marco, the hopes for a happy ending seem at least partially fulfilled. One day after the failed meeting with his aunt, another short post appears on his Facebook page: ""On Friday I was able to meet my grandmother and my uncle,"" he writes. ""It was a very moving moment, at last I have got a part of my family back!"" His aunt, he continues, ""needs more time"" before agreeing to meet him. Time will tell if the reunion brings Marco the sense of completeness he feels he needs. His mother remains the key person he wants to find. But there has been no trace of her for 17 years. No one, not the police, the local authorities, nor Marco's new-found relatives, has any clue where she might be. Marco is not deterred. His search, via Facebook, continues.

" Child abduction is very rare - and when other children are responsible it can be particularly hard to comprehend. So when police in Newcastle upon Tyne were told that a missing toddler was last seen talking to two teenage girls, one notorious case from the 1990s immediately came to mind. As the kidnappers crossed the city, police used hundreds of CCTV cameras in a desperate hunt for the missing girl. This is the inside story of what happened. 16:55 - 13 April 2016Northumbria Police Southern Control The 101 non-emergency call, taken by handler Kate McCafferty, seemed routine. “Hello, I'm one of the managers at Primark in Northumberland Street in the middle of Newcastle,” the caller began. “We've got a lost child in store, three years old, but it's over 20 minutes now, and we've had the staff scouring the place and we just can't find her.” The caller, Thomas Clay, was calm but a little concerned. Staff at the busy store are used to dealing with lost children. It can happen several times a day, and the children always turn up within a few minutes, hiding under the clothes displays or wandering around the store. McCafferty was typing away as Clay spoke, creating the police log. “The little girl's mother says the last time she saw her she was standing with two schoolgirls that the mother estimates to be approximately 13 years old. But we haven't seen the schoolgirls either.” “Were these girls talking to her?” asked McCafferty. “She was playing with them, the lady says.” “Right...” said McCafferty. It was two minutes 23 seconds into the phone call. On the recording of the call, all that can be heard is 15 seconds of typing as McCafferty updates her log. But, as she later explains, that mention of the two teenagers sparked an immediate change in the police response. It was the point at which she decided the call was a “grade one response” - the highest priority for the police. Across the city of Newcastle upon Tyne, a huge emergency response was about to get under way for Northumbria Police. 55 minutes earlierNorthumberland Street, Newcastle upon Tyne It had been an ordinary day for Deborah and her daughter Rose [not their real names], who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Deborah, a college student, had been in the centre of Newcastle to see her supervisor about an assignment. She had taken her daughter with her and, by late afternoon, Rose was starting to feel hungry. They visited a cafe on Northumberland Street to grab a bite to eat. Rose, who was two years and nine months old, was still feeling a little fractious. So, at about 16:00, Deborah led her across the road to Primark, a major fashion discount chain, to buy her some clothes. Deborah had hoped it would cheer Rose up. But as she browsed the rails in the second-floor children's clothing section, Rose was pulling against the restraints of her pushchair. So Deborah let her out. “I just went to get a few clothes for her,” she says. “[Rose] was running to-and-fro and playing. I could hear her laughing hysterically and calling out to me.” Deborah was more relaxed now that her daughter was able to let off some steam. At last she could give some thought as to what she might buy. But almost half an hour after entering the store, Deborah was stopped cold by the eerie absence of her daughter's voice. Suddenly I couldn't hear her. I couldn't hear her voice. I couldn't hear her laugh. I couldn't hear her calling out to me. I just started panicking.” Suddenly I couldn't hear her. I couldn't hear her voice. I couldn't hear her laugh. I couldn't hear her calling out to me. I just started panicking.” “And then I remembered those two girls who were paying serious attention to her. My mind went straight back to them.” The girls had seemed like any other shoppers in Primark, sifting through the clothes rails. They were aged about 13, the mother thought, and wearing their school uniforms. It was the after-school rush and the store was busy. “They stopped by to say how cute she was,” recalls Deborah. “I said 'thank you'. [Rose] was running around, playing with them. But I really didn't give it a second thought.” The girls had offered Rose a sweet and although Deborah had at first refused, she relented after her daughter became upset. “So I said, 'OK, just give her one'.” Now, with Rose nowhere in sight, Deborah was starting to panic. She wondered if she had followed the teenagers somewhere else in the store. Deborah sought help from a staff member, and swiftly other staff joined the search. They tried to reassure her that it was not unusual for children to go missing, and that they always turned up. But with the minutes ticking by, Deborah was feeling increasingly anxious. “After five or 10 minutes, I just knew she wasn't in the store. If she was, she would have been crying loudly 'I want my mum'. If the girls were with her they would have brought her back then.” Literally my world stopped. I could not think straight. I could not stop feeling bad. I could not stop feeling guilty.” Literally my world stopped. I could not think straight. I could not stop feeling bad. I could not stop feeling guilty.” “I was beating myself up. How? How could it have happened? How could my child disappear right under my nose? How? And I have no idea of how she left. Who did she leave with? “It's the worst feeling anyone can go through. It's every parent's worst nightmare.” PC Mick Miller, one of several officers who had been dispatched to Primark in response to the 101 call, had made his way to the shop's CCTV room.  PC Mick Miller  He immediately set about locating video of the missing girl. His priority was to work out whether Rose had left the store, so he focused on the surveillance feed covering the main entrance and exit. It took about 15 minutes to find the evidence he had been looking for. “I remember the exact time on the tape,” he says, referring to the 16:29 time stamp of Rose leaving the store. It was the moment everything about the search changed. Police were now sure they were no longer dealing with a missing child - they had a child abduction on their hands. This was now a critical incident. Miller called in the disturbing evidence on his radio, detailing what the teenage girls had been wearing and the fact that one of them was “holding hands with the missing girl”. This image, which police have not released to the public, of a trusting toddler unwittingly being led away from the safety of parental care, has a chilling resonance. It is chilling for several reasons - including how commonplace it must have looked to any passers-by. Two older girls leading a toddler. How could anyone have known that the girl was being abducted? And then there's the uncanny similarity between this image and that of another child abduction - a notorious crime that is seared into the consciousness of the country. It is a grainy image from 1993 that shows a toddler named James Bulger being led away to his death by two young boys.  CCTV image of James Bulger's abduction - 23 Feb 1993(image: PA)  Just as the Bulger image shows young James being spirited away while clasping the hand of one of his killers, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, so the Primark image shows one of the schoolgirls holding Rose's hand. Both images appear to show older children acting in a caring and protective way to a vulnerable youngster. But their intentions couldn't have been be more different. It was the Bulger image that had sprung into Kate McCafferty's head when she had taken the 101 call from the Primark store assistant. Viewing the footage in the store, PC Mick Miller's mind also jumped back 23 years. “I'm 44 years old. I'm old enough to remember the Jamie Bulger case,” he says, before summoning his thoughts about the day of the Primark abduction. I remember making the radio transmission, and there was a split second of silence when everyone digested what had just been said. Everyone's worst fears had been realised.” I remember making the radio transmission, and there was a split second of silence when everyone digested what had just been said. Everyone's worst fears had been realised.” Miller had no time to lose. He immediately snapped a picture of the CCTV image with his phablet and sent it to the control room, for wider circulation around the force.  Northumbria Police office with a ""phablet""  The image sent a shockwave through the police control room where Insp Steve Byrne, in operational charge of city centre policing that afternoon, was based. Immediately, he knew he had to deploy every available police resource. “They'd left the store. They'd been in close proximity to the mother. For me that's certainly something much more sinister,” Byrne explains, describing the thoughts that had raced through his head that day. “The girls would have passed a number of staff members. If they'd had genuine concern for the child they could have alerted the staff.”  Insp Steve Byrne  Within minutes - at just before 17:20 - there was an eyewitness sighting from a member of the public. Rose had been spotted earlier with the teenage girls, further along Northumberland Street. But time was slipping away. It was now more than 45 minutes since the girls had left Primark. PC Mick Miller CCTV image of James Bulger's abduction - 23 Feb 1993(image: PA) PC Mick Miller with a ""phablet"" Insp Steve Byrne All police officers are trained in the principles of the “golden hour”. In any major criminal investigation officers think of the first hour as being a critical window in which to secure evidence, crime scenes, locate witnesses, find missing people and track down suspects while they are still relatively close by. As time goes on it gets harder to do these things. In an abduction case, the golden hour is even more critical - with every passing minute the risk to the abductee increases.  CCTV camera feeds  For Byrne, who was now in charge of the search, the clock was ticking loudly. “First and foremost in the golden hour it's the recovery of the child - the preservation of life. That's what it's all about. But secondly it's about bringing offenders to justice.” With the schoolgirl abductors three quarters of an hour in front, police had some serious catching up to do.  Insp Steve Byrne  Byrne's strategy was to “flood the city centre with officers”. The aim was to put a cordon around the area, which hopefully would contain Rose and the two teenage girls. And while Deborah was deeply distressed by her daughter's disappearance - one witness later described seeing her banging her head against a wall - police needed information from her. She was able to describe the two teenagers and confirm sightings on CCTV. And, by luck, she had taken photos of Rose while travelling into the city on the bus earlier that afternoon. There was now a detailed record of her appearance and what she had been wearing. The police were pulling out all the stops, yet Deborah still felt helpless. As a parent, you just feel the police are not doing enough. You just feel you want to get out there to look for her yourself.” As a parent, you just feel the police are not doing enough. You just feel you want to get out there to look for her yourself.” A cordon was put in place around the northern end of Northumberland Street. Officers swamped the precinct around Primark, questioning members of the public and searching other shops and the bus station a few hundred metres away. But while Byrne had effectively secured the area, he was painfully aware of a vulnerability in the police seal - a Metro station. Haymarket station is only a couple of minutes' walk from Primark. With the Tyneside Metro providing rapid access to the Northumberland coast and to the airport, the teenagers could, by now, have travelled far beyond the city centre. Byrne could see a tiny search area rapidly growing to one that was more than 200 sq miles. And no-one has the resources to cordon off an entire city. “We were playing catch up,” says Byrne. “[Forty-five minutes] is an extremely long time and at that point we were extremely concerned for the welfare of that young child.” But had anyone been closely observing the girls' behaviour that day, they would have realised Rose's teenage abductors hadn't acted on a whim. They had been building up to this kidnapping for hours at least - honing their tactics and even trying, though failing, to spirit away another young girl. CCTV camera feeds Insp Steve Byrne Platform at Haymarket station Later, when the police pieced together what had happened that day, they were able to reconstruct almost every move the teenagers had made, using thousands of hours of CCTV from across the city. McDonald's on Northumberland Street The girls, who were aged 13 and 14, are sisters - but they cannot be identified because of a court order. Although they were wearing school uniform, they had not been to school that day, 13 April 2016. They had truanted and surveillance cameras recorded them boarding a Metro train at 08:22, heading for the city centre. They had spent almost all day at Primark, popping in and out on occasion to shops such as Boots and McDonald's. In Boots they had stolen dummies - a significant act, say police, because it suggests that the abduction was carefully planned. But more worryingly, CCTV recordings in Primark show that they had attempted to abduct another two-year-old out shopping with her mother, about three hours earlier. What happened turned out to be rather like a dress rehearsal. Both teenagers had played with the little girl, and complimented the mother on her daughter, saying that she was beautiful. Later her mother glanced up from the clothes she had been looking at and realised her daughter was missing. CCTV shows the 13-year-old leading this little girl away by the hand, while the older teenager deliberately misdirects the mother, claiming her daughter had gone in a different direction. As it happened, the mother ignored the false advice and eventually found her daughter - who by this time was with both girls near the lifts leading down to the ground floor. The mother assumed the girls had found her child wandering, thanked them, and later left the store. Det Sgt Stu Liddell The teenagers had clearly showed a degree of persistence and planning, says Det Sgt Stu Liddell, although their tactics were naive. “It was a very juvenile plan, in that they did not have a focus on CCTV and 'how could we get caught here'? But I have no doubt that their purpose, from getting on the train, to travelling into the city centre, was to take a child.” Once they had led Rose out of the store, their persistence didn't let up. As they ushered her through the rush hour crowds on Northumberland Street, they were challenged by passers-by, who asked them if the little girl with them was lost. Some members of the public had clearly reacted to seeing Rose, who is black, in the company of two teenage white girls. In each case the teenagers deceived well-meaning strangers into thinking everything was OK. But all this was learned in the aftermath of the event, with the benefit of hindsight. In the melee which followed Rose's disappearance, the rapid use of CCTV had not only proved that she had indeed been abducted, it was to be the vital tool for tracking the kidnappers, and predicting where they would go next. 17:20 Newcastle Civic Centre Tracking the girls on CCTV After radioing in the sighting of the suspects by a council worker, PC Marie Chapman, along with two other officers, made a bee-line for Newcastle City Council's CCTV nerve centre. Their urgent task was to use video footage to find out where the teenagers had been going with the child. It's a darkened room with a wall of monitor screens showing images from hundreds of cameras placed around the city centre and on the Metro train system. Racks of computer servers make a constant whir as they record the multiple video feeds. Tracking the girls on CCTV PC Marie Chapman Chapman, who later recalled a palpable sense of tension and urgency in the room, and the other officers, enlisted the help of a CCTV operator. Their aim was to track Rose and her abductors' getaway route by piecing together snippets of video from the hundreds of feeds, and all in double-quick time. “He had three of us shouting, we need to check this - we need to check that. Hold on a minute. Can you go back? That's them. Right we've got them, so we need to concentrate on this particular area. Tracking the girls on CCTV “Obviously the main thing is to try to get the child back as quickly as possible. As officers, we're still human beings, and we panic, and we're trying to get it done as quickly as possible. The radio is going, and everyone is shouting up, and everyone wants the information straight away. “It was panic stations, if I'm honest,” Chapman recalls. More than an hour after the girls left Primark, police radio recordings captured the moment officers spotted the teenagers on CCTV. Police officers at Haymarket station The CCTV images showed them walking into Haymarket Station, with the toddler, at 16:34. Further film showed them travelling down the escalator, on the platform, and getting on a train. After apparently dragging the little girl, the CCTV showed one of them picking her up and carrying her down the escalator, to wait for a northbound train. The city centre cordon had been breached at its weakest point. Senior officers started dispatching police to every Metro station on the northbound line. But the CCTV evidence confirmed that with every passing minute, the teenagers were getting further and further away. Later, passengers who had seen the teenagers on the train, described them giving the little girl sweets and Coca Cola, and telling her “don't worry, we'll get you to your mummy”. But what the girls were really doing was putting as much distance between Rose and her mother as they could. Insp Steve Byrne, who was still steering the operation, describes hearing at the time a report about Rose being dragged and carried, and how this set alarm bells ringing even louder for his officers: It was extremely worrying. I was standing in the office with two other sergeants. Looking at their faces you could see the horror.” It was extremely worrying. I was standing in the office with two other sergeants. Looking at their faces you could see the horror.” Finally, one of the sergeants gave voice to the dread that everyone had, until then, been keeping to themselves - James Bulger. “As soon as I heard that the child was being carried in a direction away from the store, away from her mother, [Bulger is] what sprung to mind, yes,” says Byrne. “For a uniformed inspector, or for another officer on duty at that time, I think most of us felt that way. It's an incident that you don't think you'll ever encounter, and hope you won't ever. But there we were, faced with just that.” 17:20 Newcastle Civic Centre After radioing in the sighting of the suspects by a council worker, PC Marie Chapman, along with two other officers, made a bee-line for Newcastle City Council's CCTV nerve centre.

PC Graham Dodds was working a late shift in the North Tyneside area of Northumbria Police - known to officers as Delta 3. He was a few miles north-east of the city centre, and so was not involved in the rapidly escalating response to the kidnapping. Instead of going straight out on patrol, he had begun his shift at his desk, dealing with paperwork. At 17:35 - 66 minutes after the abduction - he was handed a missing person report. It was a routine one about two teenage girls who had been reported missing from school earlier in the day. “I was literally just reading it. I was at the stage where I'd just read the description of the girls, read the circumstances - that they had left home, hadn't turned in at school, had been reported as missing - and I was just busy working my way through it to build a big picture.” Sitting on the desk was his radio. Experienced officers like Dodds are used to multitasking, dealing with the job in hand while keeping half an ear out for the two-way radio. The radio was buzzing with updates on the child missing from Primark. “As soon as [I heard] the description of the two girls who were with the young girl - approximately 13 years old, wearing school uniforms - straight away I thought, hang on, this sounds like my two girls,” says Dodds. It was just too much of a coincidence, to hear about these two young schoolgirls. Not to sound too cliched about it, but I just had this sixth sense that it's got to be them.” It was just too much of a coincidence, to hear about these two young schoolgirls. Not to sound too cliched about it, but I just had this sixth sense that it's got to be them.” Dodds phoned the control room - he couldn't get through on the saturated radio channel - and told them about his suspicion that the two teenagers were the same missing schoolgirls. Seventy-eight minutes after the abduction from Primark, an operator relayed Dodds' crucial piece of intelligence over the police radio. Officers were immediately dispatched to the teenage girls' home. Now police had potential names for the two teenage kidnap suspects. Further inquiries would be needed to confirm it, but at last they had a vital lead. Dodds was liaising with another officer who'd been sent to the teenage sisters' home. Their mother confirmed that they'd not been home since leaving that morning, and that they matched the description of the two wanted girls. “It's gone from having two unknown females, to now having two names to them,” says Dodds. “Now you're able to look into the background of them. To use the information you have in front of you to try to find out where they're going to hopefully go.” Dodds went on to the force computer system to see what intelligence they had on the girls. They'd not been in trouble with the police before, so there was little information recorded. But within a few minutes of combing through records he found one intriguing note on the system, entered by a social worker. It referred to an earlier example of truanting from school and set out how the sisters liked to hang around in a particular park in a leafy suburb north of Newcastle city centre. “I was thinking, I'm 99.9% sure that it's the two girls,” says Dodds. Now able to get back on the police radio, he passed on the details of his hunch. Officers were dispatched to Gosforth Central Park. Every minute of Rose's absence was another minute the abductors had to put distance between themselves and the search. If police couldn't close that widening gap it would become ever harder to rescue the child and catch the suspects. Insp Steve Byrne admits it felt events might had been in danger of overtaking them. He made a phone call to his boss. “I remember the very words I used. I said we're very close to the end of the golden hour, and in fact we're over the 60 minutes from the time the child went missing. “Past experience tells me - once you get past that time, things get a lot more difficult.” PC Graham Dodds Aerial view of Gosforth Aerial view of Gosforth Aerial view of Gosforth - showing the girls' possible route Aerial view of Gosforth - showing the girls' possible route Yet, just when it seemed the odds of finding the girls were lengthening, there was a lucky break.

I said we're very close to the end of the golden hour, and in fact we're over the 60 minutes from the time the child went missing. “Past experience tells me - once you get past that time, things get a lot more difficult.” In retrospect, the time advantage the suspects had achieved over the police was chilling. A full 12 minutes before even that first 101 call from the Primark manager, the teenage girls and their victim were stepping off the Metro at South Gosforth station - more than two miles away. They walked, via side streets, to a shopping centre next to the park. It was 17:00 - just five minutes after police had received the initial alert. In the city centre, officers were dashing to Primark. Soon they would be locking down the city centre and beginning their hunt for the teenage abductors. Their targets though were now in an area with comparatively little CCTV. Rose must have calmed down somewhat by this point because witnesses described the girls swinging her between them in a playful way, and asking her if she wanted to go to the park. They tried to get into a children's soft play centre, but it was shut to the public. At 17:10 - abduction plus 41 minutes - the teenagers wandered into the South Gosforth Sainsbury's and stole a baby bottle and some milk, presumably to keep little Rose happy and quiet. Then they headed to Gosforth Central Park. While frantic investigations were under way in the city centre, the abductors stayed in the park. Bizarrely - considering the seriousness of their offence - they passed time with the toddler by playing on the swings and trying to keep her entertained. They showed no sign of having a particular plan in mind. By 17:50 the girls were getting ready to leave the park. A couple of streets away, Police Community Support Officer Shaun Cowan was making a routine visit to a local resident when he heard the call on his radio about the possible location of the teenagers. It was just around the corner. While the most senior officers on Northumbria Police were frantically trying to trace Rose and the girls who took her, it fell to a young officer on the lowest rung of the police ladder, to try to bring the emergency to a close. Cowan arrived at the park an hour-and-a-half after the abduction. “I was thinking straight away if I had a young child with me I'd probably be in the play-park, with the swings and slides and such like, but they weren't there. “But past the play-park, and through the trees, I could see the two girls and the missing child, walking across a green area.” They were heading for the exit. With about 100m between Cowan and the girls, he was worried they might slip away. He used his radio to report the sighting. “As I did that, the girls looked in my direction, saw me, and I got the impression they were going to run towards the exit at that point.” So I just ran directly towards them, shouting, 'Stop! Stop where you are!'” So I just ran directly towards them, shouting, 'Stop! Stop where you are!'” The girls froze in their tracks, just short of the park exit. Cowan believes had he arrived 30 seconds later, they would have been gone - a perfect example of why the golden hour response time was so crucial. As he approached, he was weighing up exactly what to do.“Do you grab a hold of the two offenders? Do you grab a hold of the missing child?” Without being asked, the teenagers tried to explain away their situation. But it was a highly confused account. “They said this little girl followed them from the city centre on the Metro system. I asked them if they knew who the girl was. They replied 'no'. I asked if they knew who the parent of the child was and again they said 'no'. “But then they said they were going to return the child back to the parent, and I said, 'well how are you going to do that if you don't know who the child is and who the parent is?'” He took the sisters' arms, while Rose stood alongside them, looking calm and relatively unharmed, and waited for back-up from other officers. Insp Steve Byrne clearly recalls the delight among his officers, who had been co-ordinating the operation. His instructions to Cowan were direct and straightforward: The child goes nowhere, and neither do the girls. They're to be detained and arrested for child abduction.” The child goes nowhere, and neither do the girls. They're to be detained and arrested for child abduction.” Looking back at that swift end to the drama, his mood is sanguine. “Did we get a lucky break? Yeah, but you make your own luck. And I think that was achieved through good policing.” Standing in the park as he held the teenage sisters, Cowan waited a matter of “seconds” before back-up arrived. “They were arrested in the park straight away. The little girl seemed fine. Unharmed. She wasn't upset. She didn't seem distressed or anything at all.” Back at Primark, Rose's mother Deborah was in a side room when she heard a commotion next door. “You'd think the police would be all professional and macho, but I heard a cheer in the other room before someone came in with a big smile on his face and said, oh she's been found!” I think everyone there could identify with me. By this point it was like she was 'our child', not 'your child'. It was amazing.” I think everyone there could identify with me. By this point it was like she was 'our child', not 'your child'. It was amazing.” Rose had not only been found alive but also apparently unharmed and oblivious of the huge hunt to find her. It was a matter of minutes before she was delivered back into her mother's arms. “It was just like I'd given birth to her again. Holding my child again, seeing she's good, she's OK. All she could say was that she went to the park. I knew she was a bit shaken. She was quite clingy. But she was OK. She was OK.” But the feeling of relief would not eclipse the deep unease that had set in during the desperate and frantic hunt for Rose, and had only grown the more police found out about the sisters' actions and motives. Their clear-headed planning. Their tactics for befriending young children and the eerie echoes of the James Bulger abduction. Their ploy for wrong-footing the mother of the first child they had tried to abduct. And the speed at which they had whisked Rose away from the city centre. After the crime, came the questions. As Deborah clung to her newly returned daughter, she noticed another example of the abductors' twisted behaviour. “[Rose] looked very different. Her hair bobbles had been pulled out, and her hairstyle changed.” Her hair had been pulled back into a single bun. Previously it was in braids. “It was then it dawned on me how serious the whole thing was. Even until then I was just attributing it to teenagers being naughty. But this shook me. It was a moment which had me re-evaluating the whole thing and thinking, what were they up to? “Even when I try to do her hair very gently, it's a struggle. I don't think she would have enjoyed it in any way. “I was really, really worried at that stage,” remembers Deborah with a shudder. Child abduction is rare in the UK. Child abduction by other children is so rare that figures are not recorded. It is no surprise that so many of the police officers involved in Rose's disappearance immediately thought of the James Bulger case. Despite the passage of almost 24 years, it remains a notorious case, and its seriousness has fortunately never been repeated. A study of UK Police statistics by PACT (Parents and Abducted Children Together) found that in 2011/12 there were 592 recorded cases of child abduction. But Pact estimated that only 50 children a year are abducted by strangers - and the vast majority of these abductions are stopped within moments, often by members of the public who happen to be there. Investigators from Northumbria Police have spent a great deal of time trying to find out the motive of Rose's abductors. They were not helped by the fact the girls refused to answer questions during police interviews, and would only supply written statements which were easily disproved. It was “quite a chaotic home”, says Det Ch Insp Shelley Hudson, who prepared the case for prosecution. “They only seemed to have each other as friends. They spent a lot of time together, which is quite unusual because most children that age have quite a large circle of friends.” Det Ch Insp Shelley Hudson Investigators looked at all the computers and phones in the home. They interviewed family, friends and teachers. “But we still don't know why,” says Hudson. Those searches did, however, throw up some deeply troubling results. A Samsung tablet given to the 13-year-old girl as a Christmas present in 2015 betrayed an alarming history of internet searches. Sites visited included those with graphic sexual content relating to rape and kidnap. “It wasn't the sort of normal sexual contact that you'd expect a teenager to be looking at,” says Hudson. When the case came to court a graphic list of subjects the girls searched for was described. It included forced sex and slavery, girls collected, trained and tormented for auction, and children being abducted, dragged into a van and raped. Detectives were extremely alarmed by the evidence. “A hypothesis could be that they were actively going out to kidnap a child with the intention of sexually abusing that child,” says Hudson. “That's certainly one line of inquiry we followed.” Investigators had to account for the fact other people in the house could have been using the tablet. They focused on the exact times the pornographic sites were visited, which itself revealed an extraordinary pattern of behaviour. Not only did this pattern make it unlikely someone else had been using the tablet, it also suggested a worrying mindset. One moment a girl would be using the tablet computer to research a topic for her school homework. The next search, moments later, was about rape and kidnap, followed immediately by another search concerning the school project. “It really is very unusual, very bizarre,” says Hudson, “but then to kidnap a child is as bizarre. Whatever was going on was incredibly worrying.” The findings were enough to charge the girls not only with kidnap, but also with intent to commit a serious sexual assault. However, after review by the Crown Prosecution Service, the evidence for the latter was not considered strong enough to secure a conviction. Police were sure Rose had not been sexually assaulted. The teenage girls pleaded guilty to kidnap, and the sexual offence was withdrawn. They were each sentenced to three-and-a-half years detention in July 2016. The judge, Mr Justice Globe, said he was convinced that they had intended to seriously harm the little girl. “It is not possible to state with any certainty who was going to cause the harm or exactly what that harm would have been except to come to the conclusion that it would have mirrored some aspect of the physical or sexual violence and/or exploitation that was found on the tablet,” he said. “In my judgement it was the true reason why she was taken.” The police investigation had only uncovered one other hint to the girls' motives - some, limited, evidence that the 13-year-old had been in contact with a man, using an online chatroom. It seems the girl had alerted a teacher at her school to the fact a man had asked her to send photos to him. The teacher took some screen grabs of the chat session, and it is clear that the conversation was of a sexual nature. But then the trail ran cold. There was no evidence the man was involved in encouraging the kidnapping. The school is said to have alerted the girl's mother, and the tablet computer, along with the teenagers' phones, were confiscated. The chatroom exchange was at least two months before the abduction in April and by the time the police seized the tablet, the app it had been on had been deleted and all records of the chat wiped. The teenagers refused to explain any of their online activities to the police, but claimed to others that the man in the chatroom was called Nazzer, and that he had put them up to the abduction. Police were not convinced. They examined thousands of hours of CCTV, but saw no evidence of anyone suspicious being present during the kidnapping. The sisters' only explanation for their actions came in the form of a written statement, which repeats claims the little girl followed them and that they intended to return her to her mother - says Det Sgt Stu Liddell: We are not dealing with two angelic young schoolgirls. They were devious, manipulative and proficient in lies.” We are not dealing with two angelic young schoolgirls. They were devious, manipulative and proficient in lies.” Looking back on the traumatic afternoon several months later, Rose's mother says she forgives the teenage girls and feels pity for them. “I think everybody asks themselves that question why? Their parents must ask why? Their classmates must ask why? The judge asked why? But unfortunately that is one answer which has not been given.” The High Street Abduction: Download or listen to Andrew Bomford’s reports for BBC Radio 4’s PM programme.

"Ecclestone won two world titles with Brabham Bernie Ecclestone stands a little under 5ft 3in tall but for 40 years has wielded a giant influence in Formula 1 with canniness, wit and not a little menace. At times, Ecclestone has had close to absolute power. So the end of his reign following thetakeover of the sportby US giant Liberty Media represents a seismic change. Ecclestone, now 86, is a tactician of remarkable skill, and a deal-maker extraordinaire who used chutzpah and brinksmanship to turn F1 into one of the world's biggest sports, form relationships with world leaders such as Russian president Vladimir Putin and make himself and many of F1's participants multi-millionaires. In a remarkable four decades, Ecclestone revolutionised the sport: He bought the Brabham team and won two world titles, including a historic first with a turbo engine in 1983. Turned F1 into the biggest annual sporting event in the world, outstripped only by the Olympics and the World Cup. Controversially took the commercial rights away from the teams and made himself a billionaire. Fought off a criminal prosecution for blackmail that arose from a complicated series of sales of those rights. Carved a notorious reputation for making controversial statements, including saying Adolf Hitler was ""able to get things done"" and likening women to ""domestic appliances"". But what made him mind-bendingly - some would say obscenely - rich is what brought him down in the end. Selling on the commercial rights to F1 is the source of Ecclestone's vast wealth. But it was never about the money, per se - it was about the deal. And now the deal has done him in. Restructuring the finances of the sport in the first years of this decade, Ecclestone also reorganised its decision-making process. This video can not be played Ecclestone still has a lot to offer - Horner He did it to increase his power, but the structure he set up inadvertently neutered him and gave the big teams - particularly Mercedes and Ferrari - power to block him. This has led to log-jam. The latest company to buy the sport - USA's Liberty Media - has looked at this, at a skewed prize-money structure, at a policy that is threatening to price out much-loved historic races in favour of characterless new ones in countries withquestionable regimes,at a refusal to engage with digital media, and several other issues, and decided to ease him out. Ecclestone is held in genuinely high regard within F1 for everything he has achieved but, outside a handful of acolytes, few will be genuinely sorry to see him go. There has been a feeling for some years that he is a man out of time, that the sport needed to move on. In truth, this has contributed to the stalemate in F1 - people were simply waiting him out. Many believe his departure will be good for the sport. However, it will certainly make F1 less colourful, and it is hard to imagine seeing the like of him again. Ecclestone's involvement in F1 started in the late 1950s. After a brief driving career in lower categories, he emerged as a manager for the British F1 driver Stuart Lewis-Evans but then disappeared from racing when Lewis-Evans was killed in a fiery crash at the 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix. He appeared again in the late 1960s, again as a manager, this time to the Austrian Jochen Rindt. He was already very rich. Ecclestone (second from right) with James Hunt, Niki Lauda and Ronnie Peterson before the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix What had the fortune come from? ""Property,"" Ecclestone says. All manner of rumours have abounded, including that he was involved in organising the Great Train Robbery, when Â£2.6m was stolen from a Royal Mail train in Buckinghamshire in 1963. ""Nah,"" Ecclestone once said. ""There wasn't enough money on that train. I could have done something better than that."" Rindt became F1's first and so far only posthumous world champion after he was killed at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix. But this time Ecclestone did not retreat. Within a couple of years, he bought Brabham from its founder, the three-time world champion Sir Jack Brabham, and began establishing his power base. Back then, circuit deals and television rights were operated on a somewhat haphazard, piecemeal basis. Ecclestone offered to look after them on the teams' behalf and wasted little time in building his influence. He persuaded television companies to buy F1 as a package, rather than pay for individual races. That guaranteed vastly increased exposure, and the sport's popularity grew increasingly quickly. The F1 supremo's willingness to deal with controversial global leaders, such as Russian president Vladimir Putin, often raised eyebrows The vast growth of F1 from what it was then to what it is today arguably started in earnest after the 1976 season, when a championship battle between the playboy Englishman James Hunt and the ascetic Austrian Niki Lauda caught the public's imagination. By the 1980s, F1 was becoming a global sport, more and more races were being shown live, and a generation of charismatic stars enhanced its appeal - Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell, Nelson Piquet and, most of all, Ayrton Senna. Ironically, Senna's death in 1994 only increased its reach and shortly after that the sport started on the route that has led to Ecclestone's departure. Controversially, in the mid-1990s, Ecclestone struck a deal with his long-time friend and ally Max Mosley, who was then the president of governing body the FIA. It saw his own company become the rights holder of F1, taking over from the teams' collective body that Ecclestone previously ran. This led to a furious row with some of the teams - particularly McLaren, Williams and Tyrrell - who claimed what Ecclestone was doing was illegal and that he was effectively robbing them. But the complainants were eventually bought off. Ecclestone then set about monetising his new asset. Ecclestone acquired the commercial rights to F1 in 2000, when close ally Max Mosley was in charge of the FIA In 2000, Mosley granted Ecclestone the commercial rights to F1 until the end of 2110 for a one-off fee of $360m. Even then, many were shocked by the relatively paltry amount of money that changed hands to secure such a lucrative and lengthy deal. This led to a dizzying series of sales as the rights transferred through various institutions. A German cable TV company bought them, and then collapsed, which led to its creditors - banks - taking its assets. In 2006, the German bank BayernLB sold its 47.2% stake in F1 to an investment company called CVC Capital Partners. CVC ran the sport for 10 years, employing Ecclestone as chief executive and empowering him to carry on as before, before selling to Liberty last September, in the deal completed on Monday. But the sale from BayernLB to CVC is what ultimately led to the court cases on bribery charges that Ecclestone fought and survived a couple of years ago - and which he ended by paying the German courts $100m to end the case, without a presumption of guilt or innocence. It did not escape notice that a man charged with bribery had paid - perfectly legally under German law -to end a criminal trial. Despite his diminutive stature, Ecclestone is a forbidding character. Stories abound in F1 of real and threatened menace. A conversation with him is akin to juggling sand - he ducks and dodges and avoids questions with obfuscation, distraction and quick wit, a dizzying mix of truths, half-truths and fallacies. He is approachable but apart, engaging but unknowable. After a verbal sparring match, he will sometimes reach up and chillingly pat you on the cheek, not unlike a mafia don in the movies. With David Coulthard, Michael Schumacher, Mika Hakkinen and Rubens Barrichello in Hungary, 2000 For years, the more unsavoury aspects of Ecclestone's stewardship were glossed over or laughed off - largely because he was making those he was working for so much money. But in recent years, the tone in F1 has changed as more and more people began to feel he was past his sell-by date. He was a reluctant embracer of the internet age, and rejected entreaties to try to use it to extend F1's reach. His argument was that he saw no way to make money out of it; others argued that his modus operandi of pursuing only the deal, the bottom line, and disregarding its potential longer-term effects was doing more harm than good. His simple model - sell television rights and races to the highest bidder no matter who it was; squeeze the highest price possible out of continuing partners - created an annual global revenue in the region of $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn). Yet he became increasingly haphazard and intransigent in his decision-making, coming up with unpopular ideassuch as a double-points finale in 2014or the fiasco overthe change to the qualifying formatat the start of 2016 - to try to spice up the sport. He was responding to declining audiences, but seemed to ignore the fact they were dropping largely because of his switch away from free-to-air towards pay television in key markets, and the questionable effect on the racing of gimmicks such as the DRS overtaking aid and tyres on which drivers could not push flat out. The declining audiences have led to a crisis of confidence within the sport, the response to which is a new set of rules for 2017 that mean faster, more dramatic-looking cars. But already there are concerns that these may not have the desired effect. But while the problems are real, the fact remains that F1 has just changed hands in a deal that values it at $8bn (Â£6.4bn). And that is almost entirely down to Ecclestone and what he has built with his remarkable personality, vision and drive. Controversial he certainly was; past his best he may have been. But for all his faults, Bernie Ecclestone is a unique and titanic figure who turned what was essentially a niche activity into a glittering global enterprise that to many represents an intoxicating mix of glamour, danger and raw, unmatched drama. Gone from power he may be, but he will never be forgotten.

" 18 January 2017 Architecturally, the Capitol Records Tower is a myth about a dream. It is, if you read the foreword to a new book celebrating Capitol’s 75th anniversary, a structure which symbolises the optimism of California in the mid-20th century. The singer Beck, a native of the Golden State, suggests that this “circular oddity in a landscape of square” represents “a place between art and commerce, jazz and rock’n’roll; between a golden age, urban decay, and rebirth.” Turning poetic, Beck then calls the tower “a stack of vinyl on the Hollywood skyline. A rocket-age Hadron collider spiralling out of showbiz ground zero.” That’s a lot of explosive imagery for a 13 storey office block. But, looking through the photographs of Capitol’s golden age, you can see why this Pisa-like structure, half a block from Hollywood and Vine, has come to symbolise that short, beautiful period where the words “music” and “business” were able to co-exist in the same sentence. The building itself is often said to resemble a stack of records. That, though, is an accidental byproduct of the architect’s desire to create an ultra-modern structure. The circular exterior was said to be a matter of efficiency. But the design, by young architect, Louis Naidorf, was space age, standing 150 feet high, with a 90 foot spire on the roof, with a red light beaming out the word “Hollywood” in Morse Code. The interior was state of the art, when the art was making and marketing hit records in which restrained good taste could be measured by the quality of the sound reproduction. Capitol issued acompany promo filmin 1958, narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford, which eulogised the movable sound panels in the building’s three recording studios, with wood on one side and fibreglass on the other, while also noting that the floors were a blend of concrete and cork to deaden the possibility of interference. Then there was the view. “If it weren’t for the smog,” says Tennessee Ernie, “well, you could see all the way to the ocean.” The epitome of the Capitol sound is Nat King Cole’sMona Lisa, an after-work cocktail of the sweet crooning which dominated the pre-rock’n’roll period. Kay Starr was a big success, as were Les Paul and Mary Ford. Les Paul was also responsible for the quality of the sound of the Capitol studios. He oversaw the development of eight concrete echo chambers 30 feet underground, each with their own sound characteristics, allowing engineers to add reverb, lending the studios the aural qualities of a cathedral. Capitol also reframed the career of Frank Sinatra - who oversaw the first recording session in the Tower - reinventing him as a saloon bar balladeer adrift on his own misfortune. Capitol was startled by rock’n’roll, and relied for income on its country division, which laid the foundations for the twanging Bakersfield sound with the classic recordings of Buck Owens and Merle Haggard. There was plenty of reverb on Gene Vincent’s greatest hits, and the label found a new use for orchestral sophistication on records by Glen Campbell and Bobbie Gentry. In 1962, Capitol signed The Beach Boys, who were considered at first to be a novelty act, though Brian Wilson had grander ideas. (Wilson’s masterpiece, Pet Sounds, was recorded mostly at United Western Recorders on Sunset Boulevard, not the Capitol Building). As part of EMI, Capitol was gifted The Beatles, and while the label was initially unsure about the group’s commercial prospects in the US, American audiences were less reticent. The Capitol story has continued, and subsequent decades have their moments. The 1970s produced Steve Miller and Bob Seger. The label’s response to punk was to sign Mink DeVille. The empty flash of the early 1980s was represented by Duran Duran. There were hits from MC Hammer and the Beastie Boys, Bonnie Raitt and Garth Brooks, Radiohead and Coldplay, and more recently Katy Perry and Sam Smith, who have ensured that the label has more to look forward to than repackaging its past.
