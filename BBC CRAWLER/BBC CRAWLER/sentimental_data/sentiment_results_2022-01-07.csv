"This video can not be played Wales' first minister said England was a âglobal outlierâ when it came to coronavirus Mark Drakeford has accused Boris Johnson of failing to take the necessary action to protect people in England from Covid. ""The one country that stands up as not taking action to protect its population is England,"" said the first minister. The comments come as Mr Drakeford announced Covid restrictions would not be relaxed in Wales. He added that England was the ""outlier"" in the UK when it came to Covid. The UK government has been asked to comment. Earlier this week, the prime minister said he hoped England could""ride out"" the Omicron wave without further restrictions. What are Wales' Covid rules? Scientists wanted pre-Christmas lockdown Pubs and restaurants suffer 'festive flop' However, defending keeping tighter restrictions in Wales, Mr Drakeford criticised Mr Johnson's approach, saying: ""Wales is taking action as is Scotland, as is Northern Ireland and are countries right across Europe and right across the globe. ""In England, we have a government that is politically paralysed with a prime minister is unable to secure an agreement through his cabinet to take the actions that his advisors have been telling him ought to be taken."" Mr Drakeford said the peak of the Omicron wave was likely to be ""about 10 to 14 days away"", and insisted those calling for Covid restrictions to be eased were ""factually wrong"". The comments came after a senior epidemiologist, who has advised the Welsh and UK governments, called forrestrictions to be droppedto pre-Omicron levels. However, the first minister said the idea that Omicron is an illness we can afford to ""take lightly"" does not ""bear any connection to the actual position we are facing"". The first minister warned ""the storm of Omicron"" had arrived as Wales sees ""astronomically high"" positivity rates. ""We have a tough few weeks ahead and we are not in a position to withdraw any of the protections,"" he added. Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""This is a first minister who isn't prepared to have an independent public inquiry into his handling of the Covid crisis here in Wales. ""And it is a Labour first minister here in Wales who has presided over the highest death rate, unfortunately, of any part of the United Kingdom, so it's a little bit rich of him to be offering criticism of the prime minister."" In Wales nightclubs are closed, with limits on hospitality businesses, sporting events and who people can meet indoors and outdoors. The decision to limit outdoor gatherings, including organised exercise groups, haspreviously been criticisedby the UK health minister, and there have been concerns that hospitality rulescould see people head across the border to England to socialise. Public Health Wales has reported 7,915 new Covid cases and 21 further deaths. The seven day rolling case rate per 100,000 has continued to climb to 2,324, compared to 2,228 reported on Thursday. The testing positivity rate - the percentage of Covid test returning a positive result - has fallen very slightly to 51.2%. There was a daily average of 662 patients with confirmed Covid in hospital beds - a 77% increase on a week ago - although there were two and a half times as many people in hospital at the same point in 2021. However, NHS bosses have said this includes ""a lot"" of ""incidental"" Covid patients, who are in hospital for non-Covid reasons but test positive for Covid. But Mr Drakeford said this ""doesn't make any difference to the hospitals"" as they must still ""treat every one of those patients as a coronavirus patient"". Speaking at Friday's Welsh government Covid press conference the first minister said it would not be right to say the Welsh NHS is ""being overwhelmed"" but it is ""certainly facing very challenging circumstances"". He said Omicron was ""driving more people to fall ill and then to need hospital treatment"" and also making more health staff ill. ""The latest figures suggest staff absences from illness and isolation across the NHS is 8.3% but it is as high as 16.5% in some NHS organisations."" He urged people to limit the number of people they meet, take lateral flow tests before going out, and make getting a booster vaccine a priority. On those eligible for a vaccine that have chosen not to receive one, Mr Drakeford said they are ""expecting someone else to put themselves in harms way to look after them, and it simply isn't fair."" One senior doctor says restrictions are needed as hospitals are at ""bursting point"" Dr Rowena Christmas, head of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, told BBC Radio Wales that while the rules were difficult hospitals were at ""bursting point"". ""The numbers are absolutely huge, so I think we have to continue as we are at least for the time being,"" she said. UK Hospitality Cymru warned this week that without extra money and lighter restrictionsbusinesses would be left in ""peril"", with ministers responding that  a emergency financial support package will be available from 10 January. A government spokesman said they would continue to consider whether additional emergency business support funding was needed. Gary Lulham, boss of Sin City nightclub in Swansea, said while he did not expect any changes the news was ""devastating"" for an industry that was already at a ""critical breaking point"". He added that without significant financial support there would be ""hundreds of thousands"" of people at the end of the month who ""won't be able to pay their rent, or be able to put food on the table for themselves or their kids"". The Welsh Conservatives urged ministers to provide urgent support for businesses, and said restrictions on outdoor sporting events should be relaxed. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Tory leader in the Senedd, called for ""greater flexibility"" on restrictions for hospitality settings. ""I think all people have done is move that socialising indoors into house party environments which are unregulated environments,"" he said. ""I do think there is scope to lift some of the restrictions in that particular area."" He also called for Welsh ministers to scrap ""ridiculous"" fines for workers who go into the workplace when they could work at home. Mr Drakeford had previously defended the fines saying they were in place the last time there was a work from home obligation, that ""no fines were issued at all"" during that period and ""they are designed to protect workers, not to penalise them"".

"Flat owners will not have to pay to remove dangerous cladding from lower-height buildings under new government plans, BBC Newsnight understands. It means leaseholders in buildings of between 11 and 18.5m will no longer be expected to take out personal loans to cover the cost of the work. Instead, the government will try to secure up to Â£4bn from developers towards the costs. It had already promised to pay to remove cladding in taller buildings. If ministers are unable to secure the funding from developers it may come out of the housing department's budget. What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? âLenders wonât touch us - my homeâs worth nothing' Delay removing dangerous cladding âsoul destroyingâ In the wake of the Grenfell fire, which killed 72 people in 2017, flammable cladding and other fire safety defects were discovered in hundreds of blocks of flats across the UK. Removing cladding can cost millions of pounds per block, with the cost often being borne by individual flat owners, under the leasehold system in England and Wales. Hundreds of thousands of people are still living in dangerous blocks more than four years on from Grenfell - while many flat owners have been left with spiralling insurance costs, service charges, and requirements for expensive 24-hour ""waking watch"" patrols in case of fire. In a new package of measures to be announced next week, Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, will tell the Commons that if developers choose not to pay for cladding removals voluntarily the government will threaten them with legal compulsion. The BBC understands Mr Gove will warn them next week that he is putting them ""on notice"". Previously, the government had committed up to Â£5bn for the removal of dangerous cladding for buildings taller than 18.5m. Cladding campaigners have long asked that the government accept both the principle that buildings under 18.5m ought to be covered and that leaseholders should not have to pay. This video can not be played ""I didn't choose any cladding and now I'm going to be skint forever"" Newsnight has seen documents from Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke to Mr Gove where he says: That no new Treasury funding will be available to pay for this extra work That the cost of the extra cladding removal must not exceed Â£4bn That this new provision will cover cladding only, rather than other fire safety defects That if Mr Gove is unsuccessful in persuading or compelling developers to pay for the costs that it must be paid for from existing housing budgets and that ""safety should be prioritised over supply"" Experts question whether Â£4bn will be sufficient to cover cladding in buildings under 18.5m. And cladding is not the only or even main problem in thousands of buildings across the country. Neighbours Darren Matthews and Mandy Sandhu are two of those who could be helped by the changes, as their building is 13.5m tall. Mr Matthews told BBC Breakfast they faced bills of Â£101,500 per apartment and described the move as a ""step forward"", saying he was ""cautiously optimistic"" but that there was ""no absolute clarity about how developers are going to pay"". ""With the best will in the world this issue isn't going to be on a voluntary basis, it has to be enshrined in law with a legal obligation with proper stipulations to the building industry,"" he said. ""Leaseholders are the only innocent parties in this."" Ms Sandhu said she did not eat or sleep because of the stress and said despite the news they still needed clarification of what would be done. ""I won't believe it until I see it"", she added. It is unclear how those leaseholders will pay their bills, and how quickly any money that does come from developers will appear. Developers have largely insisted that their developments were built to regulations and that they are therefore not liable. Without immediate compulsion this process threatens to continue to be drawn out with leaseholders stuck in properties they cannot sell. Stewart Baseley, chairman of the Home Builders Federation - which represents developers, said the largest house builders had already spent or committed to spending Â£1bn to remediate affected buildings and said the most urgent action was for the government to define guidance on what work actually needed to be done to resolve issues for residents. He said while house builders were ""committed to playing their part"" there were other organisations involved in the construction of affected buildings which should also be involved in remediation costs, ""not least material manufacturers who designed, tested and sold materials that developers purchased in good faith that were later proved to not be fit for purpose"". Hundreds of thousands of leaseholders have already received bills for fire remediation works or will in the coming months. It is also not clear whether these measures will be enough to restore market and lender confidence in new-build properties. Campaigner Steve Day told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he and his neighbours were facing a Â£31,000 per flat bill for cladding costs, as well as about Â£5,000 per flat in non-cladding costs and an extra Â£3,000 a year service charge, which he said was huge for south-east London. ""People are facing arrears, and high levels of stress,"" he said. He said he was concerned voluntary contributions will ""just not be deliverable"", and called for a scheme where the government made developers pay if they breached regulations. Following the Grenfell fire flammable cladding and other fire safety defects were discovered in flat blocks across the UK Conservative MP Sir Peter Bottomley, chairman of the all party parliamentary group on leasehold and commonhold reform, said the government needed to tell the insurance companies to ""come to the table"" with Â£8bn - ""then innocent leaseholders will live in homes which are safe and saleable"". Matthew Pennycook, Labour's shadow housing minister,tweeted,externalthe new measures ""appear far less significant than they sound"", with ""nothing on non-cladding defects, no new developer levy and the position on leaseholder liability unchanged"". Many leaseholders have found their properties effectively worthless and unmortgageable. In November, Mr Govequestioned why flat owners should have to pay anything for dangerous cladding to be removedfrom their buildings. He said the government had a responsibility to help leaseholders - who were ""innocent parties"" - with the huge costs. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities declined to comment. Why must flat owners pay cladding bills, asks Gove Who has to pay to remove unsafe cladding? âLenders wonât touch us - my homeâs worth nothing' Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Nathan Saunders shouted ""Allahu akbar"" - which means God is greatest - at a group of teenagers A convicted terror offender has been jailed for 16 months after threatening teenagers with a knife and telling them: ""We cut people's heads off."" Nathan Saunders, 28, shouted ""Allahu akbar"" and made Islamic State salutes at the youths on 15 September 2021. Saunders, of Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent, who wasconvicted of downloading terror documentsin 2017, is believed to have radicalised himself online. He admitted possession of an offensive weapon at Cardiff Crown Court. The court heard Saunders was attacked on Sycamore Avenue in Tredegar by a group of young men who punched him twice and called him a ""terrorist"". After a neighbour intervened he got away, but returned with a bread knife. Cardiff man jailed for downloading IS terror material Terror trial set for call centre worker Witnesses said he began waving it and making slashing gestures towards the group. Some of the young men armed themselves with house bricks and one began filming Saunders while others yelled at him to ""put the knife down"". Judge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke said Saunders had been motivated by ""some kind of revenge"". When he was arrested, he denied having a knife and said he was trying to reason with the youths. Judge Lloyd-Clarke told him he should have reported the initial hostility and violence from the group to police. ""You chose to arm yourself with a large knife and you went out into the street to confront your former assailants when members of the public and young children were present,"" she said. ""Your offending, in my view, is seriously aggravated by your previous conviction. You seemed to be referring to that type of behaviour and interest when in possession of the knife. ""More than once you say 'we chop heads off,' and you point your finger up to the sky and repeatedly say 'Allahu akbar'."" Stephen Donoghue, prosecuting, applied for a criminal behaviour order, allowing police to monitor Saunders closely upon release. He is already subject to a 10-year counter-terrorism order following his 2017 conviction, which related to downloading manuals on making bombs and carrying out ""lone-wolf"" attacks. Mr Donoghue argued it did not go far enough to address concerns about any future offending. Alex Greenwood, defending, said the order should be more specific to not interfere with Saunders' rights to privacy and his religious rights to freedom of expression. A hearing to determine if the order will be granted will be held on 18 February. Terrorist cryptocurrency dark web trader jailed Incels: A new terror threat to the UK?

"The authorities appear to be back in control but the city is reeling from the violence Kazakhstan's biggest city Almaty looks like something from an apocalypse film. Driving around early on Friday morning, the smell of burnt vehicles was still in the air. Few people were about, many too afraid to come out into the streets. The army and police are blocking key sites in the city, which has been the focal point of nationwide protests against the government. When we approached soldiers at the main square they shouted at us and fired warning shots in the air, warning us not to come close. I've been coming to Almaty for years. It's normally a bustling city, with lots of greenery and places to eat out and drink. Now though shops and banks have been looted or destroyed. It will take some time for them to recover. Much of the damage is around the big main square that protesters first went to when the demonstrations began. Media buildings nearby were attacked and the mayor's office burnt down. It is pitch black now, having been engulfed by black smoke. This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov hears gunfire as he visits the scene of clashes in Almaty We saw no signs of protests on Friday, just a small group of people gathering near the destroyed buildings to take photos on their phones. But we could still hear shooting and explosions, which may have been be stun grenades. When I first arrived I thought there was fog then realised it was more likely to be smoke from the grenades and fireworks. Several residents I spoke to were shocked and angry. These protests are unprecedented in Kazakhstan, and many here are surprised that they spread and turned violent so quickly. Some of those I spoke to are glad to see forces arrive from Russia and other neighbouring countries, hopeful they will restore order. One woman told me the government should have been firmer from the start. ""If they had used force in the very beginning, this unrest wouldn't have happened,"" she said. ""Maybe they were worried about condemnation, that they used weapons but you see now what this approach led to."" But amid the anger at the violence, there was sympathy for the protesters too. Many of the demonstrators come from rural areas, where pay is low and life is tough. ""I understand the demands of the protesters,"" said one man, a 22-year-old cook. ""We can see that our salaries are not growing and most of the population is struggling. But this is now looting and hooliganism, ordinary people are suffering now. It must be stopped."" Almaty residents now face food shortages, with the big supermarkets closed. Shops that are open only take cash, but it is difficult to find somewhere to withdraw money. There's no internet and even getting a taxi seems too risky. One of the looted shops in Almaty With the internet hit and phones not working properly, it is hard to find out what's happening outside the city. There are all sorts of rumours being shared that are impossible to check out. Kazakhstan has never seen protests of this scale. There's been unrest before, but largely localised. None of them resulted in the main airport being attacked. Plans to raise fuel prices triggered these demonstrations, but there is also widespread discontent about the government. After the resignation of Kazakhstan's first president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who held office from independence up to 2019, people hoped the new leader Kassym-Jomart Tokayev would bring change. These expectations were thwarted. In particular, the renaming of the capital Astana to Nur-Sultan, in honour of the former leader, was proof for many the old is elite is still in charge. For now, things are calming down and the authorities appear to be in control. But even if these protests have ended for now, the discontent will remain. Perhaps there will be another spark that fuels new ones. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe. Why does it matter?A former Soviet republic which is mainly Muslim with a large Russian minority, it has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots, which have escalated to become broader protests against the government, have resulted in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters.

"Jack Dromey had been an MP since 2010, but was already a leading figure in the trade union movement Veteran Labour politician Jack Dromey has died aged 73, his family has confirmed. The shadow minister, who had held the seat of Birmingham Erdington since 2010, is understood to have passed away in his constituency on Friday morning. He is survived by his wife, fellow Labour MP Harriet Harman, and his three children. His family said he was a ""much loved husband, father and grandfather"" who would be ""greatly missed"". And his son Joe also paid tribute on Twitter, confirming Mr Dromey had died suddenly and adding: ""We loved him so, so much. Rest in peace big man."" Current and former prime ministers were among those paying their respects, with Boris Johnson saying he was ""deeply saddened"" by the news. Tony Blair called Mr Dromey a ""stalwart of the Labour and trade union movement, while Gordon Brown said he had lost ""a friend, colleague and great humanitarian who never stopped fighting for social justice"". The flags of Parliament were lowered to half-mast, with House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle saying MPs were ""all in disbelief that the life-force that was Jack Dromey has died"", adding that it was ""another sad day for the House and a bad start to the year"". 'Highly respected' Born in London in 1948, Mr Dromey made his name in politics through the union movement, as a leading figure in the Transport and General Workers' Union, which later became Unite. He married Ms Harman in 1982, fathering two sons and a daughter, and held senior roles in the Labour Party before winning his seat in Parliament nearly 12 years ago. He was quickly promoted to the front bench, serving under several leaders, most recently as Sir Keir Starmer's shadow immigration minister. He spoke in a Commons debate on Afghan refugees just 24 hours ago, as well as attending a speech by Sir Keir on Tuesday. Jack Dromey married Harriet Harman in 1982 and had three children, including their son Harry Sir Keir said Mr Dromey had ""dedicated his life to standing up for working people through the Labour movement"". The Labour leader added: ""Jack was recognised for his determination to stand up for his constituents and he was highly respected and warmly regarded across Parliament. ""My thoughts and those of the whole Labour movement are with Harriet, their children and all those who knew and loved Jack."" The party's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, also described him as a ""great mentor and supporter to me, but above all a friend for many years"". Jack Dromey and Harriet Harman - pictured here at a Labour conference - worked side-by-side Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, who said he sat next to him in the Commons on Thursday, said Mr Dromey was a ""Labour man to his bones and proud champion for his constituents and for working people."" Another frontbench colleague, shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell, said she was ""floored"" by the news, calling him ""one of the best"", while shadow business secretary John Reynolds called him ""a man of such integrity and kindness"". Conservative politicians also spoke about the loss to Parliament, with Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries calling him ""a kind gentleman"" whose politics ""never stood in the way of his gentle nature, kind words and good manners with his always, always happy smile"". Jack Dromey was a regular speaker in the Commons chamber Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt said, ""Parliament has lost a giant"", while fellow MP Tracey Crouch said she ""felt sick"" hearing the news, adding: ""He was one of the kindest colleagues who didn't define people by party."" Tributes also came from the trade union movement, with the TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady saying it was ""devastating to lose such a champion of working people.""

"Chester FC fans celebrate - but will they be stopped from watching matches at the Deva Stadium? An investigation is looking into whether an English football team broke Covid rules - because their ground is in Wales. In Wales, restrictions mean most matches are being played behind closed doors. However, since rules came into force on 26 December, Chester FC has held two games with each attracting more than 2,000 fans. The Welsh government said the club was in Wales and must follow Welsh rules. Club officials say they have been informed of potential breaches of Welsh Coronavirus Regulations for fixtures held on 28 December 2021 and 2 January 2022. WRU considering hosting games in England Current restrictions to stay in place In a statement the club said they have been told they ""may commit further potential breaches if it continues to play home fixtures with crowds while the current restrictions in Wales remain in place"". ""It was agreed that all parties would seek further legal advice given the complex issues and future implications of any outcome,"" they added. ""Chester Football Club's stadium is in Wales therefore Welsh regulations apply,"" a Welsh government spokesperson said. ""As the enforcing authorities Flintshire County Council and North Wales Police are dealing with the matter."" Chester's Deva Stadium is in Flintshire, with the border between Wales and England running through the car park to the east of the stands. Allow Twitter content?

Wales has been inLevel Two Coronavirus restrictions since 26 December, which means all sporting events effectively have to be played behind closed doors. The number of spectators is limited to 50, in addition to those taking part. Stewarding and policing costs mean thatit can be impractical for clubs to allow a handfulof fans through turnstiles. However, there are no crowd limits in England. Since the rule changes in Wales, Chester FC's home ground has hosted two games in National League North (the sixth tier of English football). The match attendance for Chester FC's home game against AFC Fylde on 28 December was reported to be 2,075 and against Telford on 2 January was 2,116. Chester may be an English club, but their ground is in Wales Chester's 1-1 draw against Telford saw the biggest attendance in the National League North. Despite the geographic conundrum, matchday policing at the Deva Stadium is carried out by Cheshire Constabulary. Chester fans have argued on social media that the border runs through the clubhouse and that the stadium has a Chester postcode. The club's next home game is against Brackley Town on the 15 January. Large crowds that usually attend the festive rugby derbies in Wales were locked out because of the ruling. However, the majority of matches fell victim to Covid, with only the Scarlets versus Ospreys going ahead on New Year's Day. The ruling also affects Wales' top football sides such as Cardiff City, Swansea City, Newport County and Wrexham AFC. Almost 250,000 fans attended Wales' Autumn matches - will they be allowed back for the Six Nations Wales are due to host three games in this year's Six Nations rugby championship - with 72,000 fans expected in Cardiff for the first against Scotland on 12 February. However, the Welsh Rugby Union has said it is exploring the option of moving games over the border to England - where there are no limits on fans. First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmedthere will be no change to the rules for the next weekat least. He said the government would review the situation ""every week"" to see if it is possible to play games ""at home safely"",  adding ""of course that's what we want to do"".

"Police Scotland is deploying more than 500 officers to support local policing divisions due to high Covid-related absence levels across the country. The force said over 300 specialist officers and 258 probationary constables would be drafted in to help their colleagues from Monday. Resources were previously drawn from both groups earlier in the pandemic and during the COP26 summit in Glasgow. In the week ending 29 December, 1,701 officers were off due to Covid issues. This was an increase of 450 (36%) on the previous week. A breakdown of the statistics reveals the majority, 669, were absent due to acute Covid while a further 500 were self-isolating due to a household contact or while awaiting a test result. Police Scotland warns of delays to 101 calls due to Omicron The figures show absence levels have continued to trend above the same periods in 2019 and 2020. But they remain ""significantly below"" the peak in April 2020 - the month after the first Scottish cases were confirmed. Last month, the public were warned to to expect longer waiting times for 101 non-emergency calls due to the surge in virus cases. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs, who leads on professionalism and assurance, said the force was working hard to maximise the availability of officers and staff in frontline duties. He added: ""Omicron is having a significant effect on the country and Police Scotland is included in that. ""The welfare of our officers and staff is paramount and has been throughout the pandemic. ""As a national service, we can quickly flex resources and move people to where they are needed and respond to increased demand and high absence levels."" Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie urged people to ""show a bit of patience"" after they contact police Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie, whose portfolio includes community wellbeing, later told BBC Scotland he hoped the public would not notice a difference in the standard of service provided by the force. But he admitted officers would face some challenges, especially at busy times, and urged people to ""show a bit of patience"". Assistant Chief Constable Ritchie also stressed that emergency and critical incidents would be prioritised. He confirmed that the probationary officers, who have still to complete their training at the Scottish Police College, had all been trained in the basics such as police powers, first aid and officer safety. Assistant Chief Constable Ritchie added: ""We will also make sure that when they are deployed operationally they are deployed with a more senior officer.""

"The authorities appear to be back in control but the city is reeling from the violence Kazakhstan's biggest city Almaty looks like something from an apocalypse film. Driving around early on Friday morning, the smell of burnt vehicles was still in the air. Few people were about, many too afraid to come out into the streets. The army and police are blocking key sites in the city, which has been the focal point of nationwide protests against the government. When we approached soldiers at the main square they shouted at us and fired warning shots in the air, warning us not to come close. I've been coming to Almaty for years. It's normally a bustling city, with lots of greenery and places to eat out and drink. Now though shops and banks have been looted or destroyed. It will take some time for them to recover. Much of the damage is around the big main square that protesters first went to when the demonstrations began. Media buildings nearby were attacked and the mayor's office burnt down. It is pitch black now, having been engulfed by black smoke. This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov hears gunfire as he visits the scene of clashes in Almaty We saw no signs of protests on Friday, just a small group of people gathering near the destroyed buildings to take photos on their phones. But we could still hear shooting and explosions, which may have been be stun grenades. When I first arrived I thought there was fog then realised it was more likely to be smoke from the grenades and fireworks. Several residents I spoke to were shocked and angry. These protests are unprecedented in Kazakhstan, and many here are surprised that they spread and turned violent so quickly. Some of those I spoke to are glad to see forces arrive from Russia and other neighbouring countries, hopeful they will restore order. One woman told me the government should have been firmer from the start. ""If they had used force in the very beginning, this unrest wouldn't have happened,"" she said. ""Maybe they were worried about condemnation, that they used weapons but you see now what this approach led to."" But amid the anger at the violence, there was sympathy for the protesters too. Many of the demonstrators come from rural areas, where pay is low and life is tough. ""I understand the demands of the protesters,"" said one man, a 22-year-old cook. ""We can see that our salaries are not growing and most of the population is struggling. But this is now looting and hooliganism, ordinary people are suffering now. It must be stopped."" Almaty residents now face food shortages, with the big supermarkets closed. Shops that are open only take cash, but it is difficult to find somewhere to withdraw money. There's no internet and even getting a taxi seems too risky. One of the looted shops in Almaty With the internet hit and phones not working properly, it is hard to find out what's happening outside the city. There are all sorts of rumours being shared that are impossible to check out. Kazakhstan has never seen protests of this scale. There's been unrest before, but largely localised. None of them resulted in the main airport being attacked. Plans to raise fuel prices triggered these demonstrations, but there is also widespread discontent about the government. After the resignation of Kazakhstan's first president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who held office from independence up to 2019, people hoped the new leader Kassym-Jomart Tokayev would bring change. These expectations were thwarted. In particular, the renaming of the capital Astana to Nur-Sultan, in honour of the former leader, was proof for many the old is elite is still in charge. For now, things are calming down and the authorities appear to be in control. But even if these protests have ended for now, the discontent will remain. Perhaps there will be another spark that fuels new ones. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe. Why does it matter?A former Soviet republic which is mainly Muslim with a large Russian minority, it has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots, which have escalated to become broader protests against the government, have resulted in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters.

"This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov hears gunfire as he visits the scene of clashes in Almaty Kazakhstan's authoritarian leader says he has ordered security forces to ""fire without warning"", amid a violent crackdown on anti-government protests. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev also said ""20,000 bandits"" had attacked the main city of Almaty, the epicentre of protests sparked by a fuel price hike. He blamed foreign-trained ""terrorists"", without giving evidence. The interior ministry says 26 ""armed criminals"" and 18 security officers have been killed so far in the unrest. In a televised address, Mr Tokayev dismissed calls to hold talks with protesters as ""nonsense"", saying: ""What kind of talks can we hold with criminals and murderers?"" ""We had to deal with armed and well-prepared bandits, local as well as foreign. More precisely, with terrorists. So we have to destroy them, this will be done soon,"" he said. Opposition groups have rejected the authorities' accusations of terrorism. Earlier, the president said constitutional order had been largely restored. A BBC correspondent in Almaty said the situation was much quieter after days of violence, although there had been some sounds of gunfire and explosions. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe. Why does it matter?A former Soviet republic which is mainly Muslim with a large Russian minority, it has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots, which have escalated to become broader protests against the government, have resulted in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters. BACKGROUND:Kazakhstan country profile CONTEXT:Why is there unrest in Kazakhstan? President Tokayev said peacekeeping forces sent from Russia and neighbouring states had arrived on his request and were in the country on a temporary basis to ensure security. The force from the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) reportedly has about 2,500 soldiers. Mr Tokayev gave ""special thanks"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin for sending troops to the former Soviet nation. Internet connection seems to have been restored in some areas, and Kazakh officials and CSTO troops were controlling Almaty's main airport, a day after it was recaptured from protesters. The European Commission, which is the EU executive, offered ""assistance where we can"" to help Kazakhstan resolve the crisis. It also called for an end to the violence, echoing earlier statements from the UN, US, UK and France. The unrest began on Sunday when the cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - which many people in Kazakhstan use to fuel their cars - doubled. The government has said that fuel price caps will be restored for six months. But the announcement has failed to end the protests, which have broadened to include other political grievances. Kazakhstan is often described as authoritarian, and most elections are won by the ruling party with nearly 100% of the vote. There is no effective political opposition.

"Jack Dromey had been an MP since 2010, but was already a leading figure in the trade union movement Veteran Labour politician Jack Dromey has died aged 73, his family has confirmed. The shadow minister, who had held the seat of Birmingham Erdington since 2010, is understood to have passed away in his constituency on Friday morning. He is survived by his wife, fellow Labour MP Harriet Harman, and his three children. His family said he was a ""much loved husband, father and grandfather"" who would be ""greatly missed"". And his son Joe also paid tribute on Twitter, confirming Mr Dromey had died suddenly and adding: ""We loved him so, so much. Rest in peace big man."" Current and former prime ministers were among those paying their respects, with Boris Johnson saying he was ""deeply saddened"" by the news. Tony Blair called Mr Dromey a ""stalwart of the Labour and trade union movement, while Gordon Brown said he had lost ""a friend, colleague and great humanitarian who never stopped fighting for social justice"". The flags of Parliament were lowered to half-mast, with House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle saying MPs were ""all in disbelief that the life-force that was Jack Dromey has died"", adding that it was ""another sad day for the House and a bad start to the year"". 'Highly respected' Born in London in 1948, Mr Dromey made his name in politics through the union movement, as a leading figure in the Transport and General Workers' Union, which later became Unite. He married Ms Harman in 1982, fathering two sons and a daughter, and held senior roles in the Labour Party before winning his seat in Parliament nearly 12 years ago. He was quickly promoted to the front bench, serving under several leaders, most recently as Sir Keir Starmer's shadow immigration minister. He spoke in a Commons debate on Afghan refugees just 24 hours ago, as well as attending a speech by Sir Keir on Tuesday. Jack Dromey married Harriet Harman in 1982 and had three children, including their son Harry Sir Keir said Mr Dromey had ""dedicated his life to standing up for working people through the Labour movement"". The Labour leader added: ""Jack was recognised for his determination to stand up for his constituents and he was highly respected and warmly regarded across Parliament. ""My thoughts and those of the whole Labour movement are with Harriet, their children and all those who knew and loved Jack."" The party's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, also described him as a ""great mentor and supporter to me, but above all a friend for many years"". Jack Dromey and Harriet Harman - pictured here at a Labour conference - worked side-by-side Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, who said he sat next to him in the Commons on Thursday, said Mr Dromey was a ""Labour man to his bones and proud champion for his constituents and for working people."" Another frontbench colleague, shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell, said she was ""floored"" by the news, calling him ""one of the best"", while shadow business secretary John Reynolds called him ""a man of such integrity and kindness"". Conservative politicians also spoke about the loss to Parliament, with Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries calling him ""a kind gentleman"" whose politics ""never stood in the way of his gentle nature, kind words and good manners with his always, always happy smile"". Jack Dromey was a regular speaker in the Commons chamber Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt said, ""Parliament has lost a giant"", while fellow MP Tracey Crouch said she ""felt sick"" hearing the news, adding: ""He was one of the kindest colleagues who didn't define people by party."" Tributes also came from the trade union movement, with the TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady saying it was ""devastating to lose such a champion of working people."" And Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, called Mr Dromey ""our dear friend and comrade"".

"This video can not be played Wales' first minister said England was a âglobal outlierâ when it came to coronavirus Mark Drakeford has accused Boris Johnson of failing to take the necessary action to protect people in England from Covid. ""The one country that stands up as not taking action to protect its population is England,"" said the first minister. The comments come as Mr Drakeford announced Covid restrictions would not be relaxed in Wales. He added that England was the ""outlier"" in the UK when it came to Covid. The UK government has been asked to comment. Earlier this week, the prime minister said he hoped England could""ride out"" the Omicron wave without further restrictions. What are Wales' Covid rules? Scientists wanted pre-Christmas lockdown Pubs and restaurants suffer 'festive flop' However, defending keeping tighter restrictions in Wales, Mr Drakeford criticised Mr Johnson's approach, saying: ""Wales is taking action as is Scotland, as is Northern Ireland and are countries right across Europe and right across the globe. ""In England, we have a government that is politically paralysed with a prime minister is unable to secure an agreement through his cabinet to take the actions that his advisors have been telling him ought to be taken."" Mr Drakeford said the peak of the Omicron wave was likely to be ""about 10 to 14 days away"", and insisted those calling for Covid restrictions to be eased were ""factually wrong"". The comments came after a senior epidemiologist, who has advised the Welsh and UK governments, called forrestrictions to be droppedto pre-Omicron levels. However, the first minister said the idea that Omicron is an illness we can afford to ""take lightly"" does not ""bear any connection to the actual position we are facing"". The first minister warned ""the storm of Omicron"" had arrived as Wales sees ""astronomically high"" positivity rates. ""We have a tough few weeks ahead and we are not in a position to withdraw any of the protections,"" he added. Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""This is a first minister who isn't prepared to have an independent public inquiry into his handling of the Covid crisis here in Wales. ""And it is a Labour first minister here in Wales who has presided over the highest death rate, unfortunately, of any part of the United Kingdom, so it's a little bit rich of him to be offering criticism of the prime minister."" In Wales nightclubs are closed, with limits on hospitality businesses, sporting events and who people can meet indoors and outdoors. The decision to limit outdoor gatherings, including organised exercise groups, haspreviously been criticisedby the UK health minister, and there have been concerns that hospitality rulescould see people head across the border to England to socialise. Public Health Wales has reported 7,915 new Covid cases and 21 further deaths. The seven day rolling case rate per 100,000 has continued to climb to 2,324, compared to 2,228 reported on Thursday. The testing positivity rate - the percentage of Covid test returning a positive result - has fallen very slightly to 51.2%. There was a daily average of 662 patients with confirmed Covid in hospital beds - a 77% increase on a week ago - although there were two and a half times as many people in hospital at the same point in 2021. However, NHS bosses have said this includes ""a lot"" of ""incidental"" Covid patients, who are in hospital for non-Covid reasons but test positive for Covid. But Mr Drakeford said this ""doesn't make any difference to the hospitals"" as they must still ""treat every one of those patients as a coronavirus patient"". Speaking at Friday's Welsh government Covid press conference the first minister said it would not be right to say the Welsh NHS is ""being overwhelmed"" but it is ""certainly facing very challenging circumstances"". He said Omicron was ""driving more people to fall ill and then to need hospital treatment"" and also making more health staff ill. ""The latest figures suggest staff absences from illness and isolation across the NHS is 8.3% but it is as high as 16.5% in some NHS organisations."" He urged people to limit the number of people they meet, take lateral flow tests before going out, and make getting a booster vaccine a priority. On those eligible for a vaccine that have chosen not to receive one, Mr Drakeford said they are ""expecting someone else to put themselves in harms way to look after them, and it simply isn't fair."" One senior doctor says restrictions are needed as hospitals are at ""bursting point"" Dr Rowena Christmas, head of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, told BBC Radio Wales that while the rules were difficult hospitals were at ""bursting point"". ""The numbers are absolutely huge, so I think we have to continue as we are at least for the time being,"" she said. UK Hospitality Cymru warned this week that without extra money and lighter restrictionsbusinesses would be left in ""peril"", with ministers responding that  a emergency financial support package will be available from 10 January. A government spokesman said they would continue to consider whether additional emergency business support funding was needed. Gary Lulham, boss of Sin City nightclub in Swansea, said while he did not expect any changes the news was ""devastating"" for an industry that was already at a ""critical breaking point"". He added that without significant financial support there would be ""hundreds of thousands"" of people at the end of the month who ""won't be able to pay their rent, or be able to put food on the table for themselves or their kids"". The Welsh Conservatives urged ministers to provide urgent support for businesses, and said restrictions on outdoor sporting events should be relaxed. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Tory leader in the Senedd, called for ""greater flexibility"" on restrictions for hospitality settings. ""I think all people have done is move that socialising indoors into house party environments which are unregulated environments,"" he said. ""I do think there is scope to lift some of the restrictions in that particular area."" He also called for Welsh ministers to scrap ""ridiculous"" fines for workers who go into the workplace when they could work at home. Mr Drakeford had previously defended the fines saying they were in place the last time there was a work from home obligation, that ""no fines were issued at all"" during that period and ""they are designed to protect workers, not to penalise them"".

"Covid-related staff absences at hospitals in England have risen sharply since Omicron took hold last month, latest figures show. The number of workers off sick for Covid reasons trebled from the beginning of December. The Royal College of Nursing said growing absences meant the situation was ""simply not safe."" NHS national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said staff were under pressure but were ""stepping up"". Downing Street said Boris Johnson saw no need for further restrictions despite the staff absences, as England's current measures were ""balanced and proportionate"". Earlier this week, the prime minister saidhe hoped England could ""ride out""the Omicron wave without more restrictions. How many cases are there in my area? Military sends 200 personnel to back NHS in London How is the NHS in your area coping this winter? Approximately 4% of hospital staff in England - nearly 36,000 - were off for Covid reasons each day during the week ending 2 January. That was a rise of 41% on the previous week, and treble the 11,957 absences seen at the beginning of the Omicron wave in the week ending 5 December. When other sickness absence is added it brings the total off to 9% - nearly double what would normally be seen at this time of year. However, the national figures - released by NHS England - mask stark regional differences. Some of the hardest-hit hospitals in the country are in northern England, with Mid Yorkshire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust currently seeing about 6% of staff off due to Covid. But in London, where data suggests a slowdown in the Omicron wave after Christmas, staff absences fell slightly. Health Secretary Sajid Javid acknowledged the NHS was facing a ""rocky few weeks ahead"" and called on people to continue to get vaccinated to help the relieve pressure on the health service. During a visit to a hospital in south London, he said the decision from a number of English health trusts to declare critical incidents in recent days was ""understandable"" in the context of mounting pressure on them. Mr Javid added: ""It is all part of trying to work together providing the NHS every support that it needs to get through this difficult time."" Prof David Spiegelhalter, a statistician from the University of Cambridge, said Covid cases in younger people were coming down ""fairly fast"" in the capital. He said hospital admissions in London - which has been at the leading edge of the Omicron wave - seemed to be stable, but elsewhere in the UK admissions were still rising. Prof Spiegelhalter said there was still no sign of a ""serious increase"" in patients in intensive care, those needing ventilation and deaths. ""We would have expected to see that by now in London and elsewhere, so that is the really reassuring thing,"" he told the BBC. ""I think we can guarantee that over this wave... what we're not going to see is a big surge in very severe outcomes."" He said the ""crucial"" thing was the disruption to the NHS and other services. Patricia Marquis, from the Royal College of Nursing said: ""Outside of healthcare, staffing shortages are closing shops and cancelling trains but nurses can't stop helping their patients. ""Instead, they find themselves spread thinner and thinner, but they can't keep spinning plates indefinitely either - this situation is simply not safe."" Latest estimates suggestmore than one in 15 people in the UK would have tested positive for Covidin the last week of 2021.

If you can't see the lookup, click here As of Friday morning, it is understood there were 16 hospital trusts in England that were in critical incident status - about one in eight of the total. A critical incident is declared when a trust is worried it might not be able to provide core priority services, such as emergency care. It means it can get extra help and draft staff in from other duties. On Wednesday night the number exceeded 20, but since then several have declared their critical incident over, NHS sources told the BBC. NHS national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said Omicron meant ""more patients to treat and fewer staff to treat them"". ""While we don't know the full scale of the potential impact this new strain will have, Covid cases in hospitals are the highest they've been since February last year - piling even more pressure on hard working staff. ""Those staff are stepping up as they always do,"" he said. Earlier, the armed forcessent 200 personnel into NHS hospitalsacross London to plug staff shortages. Across the UK, about 1,800 armed forces personnel are supporting the NHS response to the pandemic. But it has not been enough to stop performance deteriorating with latest figures showing long delays for ambulance crews outside hospitals. Ambulances should be able to hand over their patients to A&E staff within 15 minutes of arriving. But in the week to 2 January 23% waited more than 30 minutes. That is a similar level to what was being seen before Christmas, but above the numbers seen before the pandemic began, when 18% of ambulances were facing delays at this point of winter. Meanwhile,travel rules are changing in the UK. Fully-vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK no longer need to take a pre-departure test and do not need to isolate while waiting for their post-arrival PCR result.

"(Left to right) Sage Willoughby, Jake Skuse, Milo Ponsford and Rhian Graham were cleared of criminal damage The Attorney General is ""carefully considering"" whether to refer the Bristol Edward Colston statue case to the Court of Appeal. Four people were cleared of criminal damage at Bristol Crown Court for toppling the monument in June 2020 during a Black Lives Matter protest. Suella Braverman said trial by jury was ""an important guardian of liberty"" but the result was ""causing confusion"". The referral would not affect the acquittal, she added. Colston's statue was thrown into Bristol's harbour The verdict cannot be overturned and the defendants cannot be retried without fresh evidence. Ms Bravermansaid she would decide,externalwhether to use powers that, as Attorney General, allow her to seek a Court of Appeal hearing so senior judges ""have the opportunity to clarify the law for future cases"". Milo Ponsford, 26, Rhian Graham, 30, Jake Skuse, 33, and Sage Willoughby, 22, were charged after the memorial to the slave trader was toppled on 7 June 2020. The statue was thrown into Bristol's harbour shortly after. The defendants are all from Bristol apart from Mr Ponsford, who is from Hampshire, andwere cleared of criminal damage after a trial. The verdict has prompted a debate about the criminal justice system after the defendants opted to stand trial in front of a jury and did not deny involvement in the incident. The defendants claimed in court that the presence of the statue was a hate crime and it was therefore not an offence to remove it. Colston was a member of the Royal African Company, which transported about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas. On his death in 1721, he bequeathed his wealth to charities and his legacy can still be seen on Bristol's streets, memorials and buildings. But the prosecution argued it was ""irrelevant"" who Colston was and the case was one of straightforward criminal damage. The defendants claimed the presence of the statue amounted to a hate crime, and it was therefore no offence to remove it Several MPsexpressed concern after Thursday's verdict,including former communities secretary Robert Jenrick. ""If you've broken the law and committed criminal damage you should be punished,"" he tweeted. ""If the jury is a barrier to ensuring they are punished then that needs to be addressed."" But, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said juries were the ""great sublime protector of liberties"". Raj Chada, who represented Mr Skuse, said the ""defendants should never have been prosecuted"".

"Boris Johnson is facing questions over his backing for a Tory donor's pet project while at the same time asking him for help to pay for a designer revamp of his Downing Street flat. Text messages published on Thursday show the PM asking Lord Brownlow to clear spending on the renovations as the flat was ""a bit of a tip"". He told Lord Brownlow he would take action on his ""great exhibition plan"". The Tory peer then had a meeting with a government minister about this plan. Lord Brownlow is a trustee of London's Albert Hall and he, along with other representatives of the venue, met then culture secretary Oliver Dowden to discuss the possibility of hosting the cultural festival. The meeting took place at the Albert Hall six weeks after the text exchange with the prime minister. No 10 said it was arranged through ""the usual official channels"". What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? PM flat row: Adviser unhappy but not quitting for now What do we know about Boris Johnson's finances? The investigations into Boris Johnson and the government In the end, the exhibition did not happen, but Labour say Lord Brownlow's November 2020 text exchanges with the PM still matter. Speaking to the BBC, Labour's shadow justice secretary Steve Reed said: ""The issue is not whether it [the festival] happened, it is whether rich people can pay to get access to government ministers to try and influence them over how they decide to spend taxpayers' money."" Designer Lulu Lytle was commissioned to help decorate the prime minister's Downing Street flat The texts between Mr Johnson and Lord Brownlow were revealed during a separate investigation by the elections watchdog into the funding of the refurbishment, estimated to have cost Â£112,000. Mr Johnson wasstrongly criticised by his standards adviser Lord Geidtfor not disclosing the messages during an official inquiry into the Downing Street flat renovations. However, Lord Geidt said he would not have changed the verdict of his original investigation last year that Mr Johnson had not breached the ministerial code. Defending the prime minister, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Lord Geidt was ""fiercely independent"" and had found there was there was ""no conflict of interest whatsoever"". But, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner argued that the ministerial code prohibits not just actual but also perceived conflicts of interest. This video can not be played Sajid Javid says the ""important thing"" from Lord Geidt's report is that the ministerial code ""has been met at all times."" ""A reasonable person could surely perceive that his [Lord Brownlow's] financial relationship with the prime minister has provided him with privileged access to government, and that relationship was undeclared at the time,"" she wrote in a letter to Lord Geidt. She said the adviser in his original report had decided the relationship did not constitute a conflict of interest because he believed Lord Brownlow's motivations had been altruistic. Ms Rayner said this was not the test set in either the ministerial code or the rules for MPs, and urged him to either amend his original investigation or amend the existing one. Lord Brownlow supplied the money, both directly and indirectly, for the changes to the flat, but Mr Johnson says he has now covered all the costs out of his own pocket. The Conservative Partywas fined Â£17,800 last monthafter the Electoral Commission found it had failed to accurately declare all of Lord Brownlow's donations towards the renovation. The Downing Street buildings are publicly owned and prime ministers receive an annual grant of Â£30,000 to spend on their living quarters - if they want to spend more than that they have fund it out of their own pocket. The saga of the Downing Street flat refurbishment has left several questions hanging. Why did the key messages between Lord Brownlow and the prime minister take so long to come to light? They were found by the Electoral Commission's investigation, but not inquiries triggered by the government itself. Can or should more be done to record ministers' communications, amid accusations of ""government by WhatsApp""? Critics argue that informal channels, like the messaging service, lack transparency and allow inappropriate access and influence. Who or what can hold the prime minister to account? Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on ministers' interests, could see his powers increased and Boris Johnson himself said he wanted to ""strengthen"" the office. Is another investigation looming? While cleared of breaking ministerial rules, Mr Johnson could face an investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner Kathryn Stone into his conduct as an MP. Reflecting on Lord Geidt's report, Labour peer Peter Mandelson told the BBC's Week in Westminster the adviser had ""loaded the gun... but ultimately chose not to pull the trigger on the prime minister"". ""I think he would have been reluctant to do that even though he had the grounds to do so,"" he said in an interview which can be be heard on Radio 4 at 11:00 GMT on Saturday 8 January. The former deputy prime minister, said Lord Geidt, who he had worked with in the past, was a man of ""integrity"", adding: ""He found himself drawn into a mire of sleaze which I'm sure with hindsight he might have preferred not to have got involved with at all."" An engraving showing the crystal palace where the Great Exhibition was held in 1851 Lord Brownlow proposed the idea of a Great Exhibition festival in partnership with the Royal Albert Hall, a London venue for whom he acts as a Trustee. The plan was inspired by the original Great Exhibition held in London's Hyde Park in 1851, showcasing new technologies from Britain and its empire at the time. The peer discussed the proposal with then Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden but in the the end the government did not pursue the idea. Instead the governmentwill hold a series of events across the UK, entitled ""Unboxed"",externalincluding light installations and a project encouraging people to grow crops.

"This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov hears gunfire as he visits the scene of clashes in Almaty Kazakhstan's authoritarian leader says he has ordered security forces to ""fire without warning"", amid a violent crackdown on anti-government protests. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev also said ""20,000 bandits"" had attacked the main city of Almaty, the epicentre of protests sparked by a fuel price hike. He blamed foreign-trained ""terrorists"", without giving evidence. The interior ministry says 26 ""armed criminals"" and 18 security officers have been killed so far in the unrest. In a televised address, Mr Tokayev dismissed calls to hold talks with protesters as ""nonsense"", saying: ""What kind of talks can we hold with criminals and murderers?"" ""We had to deal with armed and well-prepared bandits, local as well as foreign. More precisely, with terrorists. So we have to destroy them, this will be done soon,"" he said. Opposition groups have rejected the authorities' accusations of terrorism. Earlier, the president said constitutional order had been largely restored. A BBC correspondent in Almaty said the situation was much quieter after days of violence, although there had been some sounds of gunfire and explosions. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe. Why does it matter?A former Soviet republic which is mainly Muslim with a large Russian minority, it has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots, which have escalated to become broader protests against the government, have resulted in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters. BACKGROUND:Kazakhstan country profile CONTEXT:Why is there unrest in Kazakhstan? President Tokayev said peacekeeping forces sent from Russia and neighbouring states had arrived on his request and were in the country on a temporary basis to ensure security. The force from the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) reportedly has about 2,500 soldiers. Mr Tokayev gave ""special thanks"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin for sending troops to the former Soviet nation. Internet connection seems to have been restored in some areas, and Kazakh officials and CSTO troops were controlling Almaty's main airport, a day after it was recaptured from protesters. The European Commission, which is the EU executive, offered ""assistance where we can"" to help Kazakhstan resolve the crisis. It also called for an end to the violence, echoing earlier statements from the UN, US, UK and France. The unrest began on Sunday when the cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - which many people in Kazakhstan use to fuel their cars - doubled. The government has said that fuel price caps will be restored for six months. But the announcement has failed to end the protests, which have broadened to include other political grievances. Kazakhstan is often described as authoritarian, and most elections are won by the ruling party with nearly 100% of the vote. There is no effective political opposition.

"Sainsbury's is set to become the latest UK supermarket to pay shop workers at least Â£10 an hour. It will increase its basic rate from Â£9.50 to Â£10 an hour for staff across its supermarkets and Argos stores from 6 March. Sainsbury's boss Simon Roberts said the pay boost reflected the progress it was making against its savings plan. It follows the likes of Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi who announced similar moves last year. Sainsbury's will also increase its minimum hourly rate from Â£9.75 to Â£10.50 for workers in outer London and from Â£10.10 to Â£11.05 in inner London. By comparison,the UK's minimum wage for workersover 23 - the National Living Wage - is set to rise from its current level of Â£8.91 an hour to Â£9.50 from April. Meanwhile, the real living wage, paid voluntarily by almost 9,000 employers throughout the country,has gone up from Â£9.50 to Â£9.90 an hour. How much is the minimum wage? Lidl to become UK's highest-paying supermarket Where are all the job vacancies? The higher rates paid by Sainsbury's will apply to about 150,000 employees across the company - including shop workers and lorry drivers. The supermarket chain said it was investing Â£100m in total in improving pay and rewards for its frontline staff. ""We are making this significant investment to show our colleagues how much we value the brilliant job they do for our customers every day,"" Mr Roberts said. It will also bump up pay for drivers amid an ongoing recruitment struggle which has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit. National Living Wage for over-23s: From Â£8.91 to Â£9.50 an hour National Minimum Wage for those aged 21-22: From Â£8.36 to Â£9.18 National Minimum Wage for 18 to 20-year-olds: From Â£6.56 to Â£6.83 National Minimum Wage for under-18s: From Â£4.62 to Â£4.81 The Apprentice Rate: From Â£4.30 to Â£4.81 Groceries delivery drivers will now get Â£11.50 per hour, while Argos Fast Track Delivery drivers will receive Â£11 per hour based on a base rate of Â£10 per hour plus an extra Â£1, up from 75p. ""While demand for online deliveries remains high, this enhanced pay will help the retailer recruit and retain the best talent,"" Sainsbury's said. Staff will also receive a 10% discount on their shopping from Sainsbury's, Argos and Habitat, which will be increased to 15% each pay day for five days after. Despite the increase, the higher rate will still fall shy of the Â£10.10 per hour Aldi and Lidl have offered to pay staff from February and March respectively. Lidl has set out new rates where more experienced workers will earn up to Â£11.40 an hour, while Aldi will pay Â£11.55 an hour to employees working within the M25. The latest available data suggests that Tesco currently pay Â£9.55 an hour, while Waitrose and the Co-op pay Â£9.50 and Asda pays Â£9.18.

The force said over 300 specialist officers and 258 probationary constables would be drafted in to help their colleagues from Monday. Resources were previously drawn from both groups earlier in the pandemic and during the COP26 summit in Glasgow. In the week ending 29 December, 1,701 officers were off due to Covid issues. This was an increase of 450 (36%) on the previous week. A breakdown of the statistics reveals the majority, 669, were absent due to acute Covid while a further 500 were self-isolating due to a household contact or while awaiting a test result. Police Scotland warns of delays to 101 calls due to Omicron The figures show absence levels have continued to trend above the same periods in 2019 and 2020. But they remain ""significantly below"" the peak in April 2020 - the month after the first Scottish cases were confirmed. Last month, the public were warned to to expect longer waiting times for 101 non-emergency calls due to the surge in virus cases. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs, who leads on professionalism and assurance, said the force was working hard to maximise the availability of officers and staff in frontline duties. He added: ""Omicron is having a significant effect on the country and Police Scotland is included in that. ""The welfare of our officers and staff is paramount and has been throughout the pandemic. ""As a national service, we can quickly flex resources and move people to where they are needed and respond to increased demand and high absence levels."" Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie urged people to ""show a bit of patience"" after they contact police Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie, whose portfolio includes community wellbeing, later told BBC Scotland he hoped the public would not notice a difference in the standard of service provided by the force. But he admitted officers would face some challenges, especially at busy times, and urged people to ""show a bit of patience"". Assistant Chief Constable Ritchie also stressed that emergency and critical incidents would be prioritised. He confirmed that the probationary officers, who have still to complete their training at the Scottish Police College, had all been trained in the basics such as police powers, first aid and officer safety. Assistant Chief Constable Ritchie added: ""We will also make sure that when they are deployed operationally they are deployed with a more senior officer.""

"Boris Johnson is facing questions over his backing for a Tory donor's pet project while at the same time asking him for help to pay for a designer revamp of his Downing Street flat. Text messages published on Thursday show the PM asking Lord Brownlow to clear spending on the renovations as the flat was ""a bit of a tip"". He told Lord Brownlow he would take action on his ""great exhibition plan"". The Tory peer then had a meeting with a government minister about this plan. Lord Brownlow is a trustee of London's Albert Hall and he, along with other representatives of the venue, met then culture secretary Oliver Dowden to discuss the possibility of hosting the cultural festival. The meeting took place at the Albert Hall six weeks after the text exchange with the prime minister. No 10 said it was arranged through ""the usual official channels"". What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? PM flat row: Adviser unhappy but not quitting for now What do we know about Boris Johnson's finances? The investigations into Boris Johnson and the government In the end, the exhibition did not happen, but Labour say Lord Brownlow's November 2020 text exchanges with the PM still matter. Speaking to the BBC, Labour's shadow justice secretary Steve Reed said: ""The issue is not whether it [the festival] happened, it is whether rich people can pay to get access to government ministers to try and influence them over how they decide to spend taxpayers' money."" Designer Lulu Lytle was commissioned to help decorate the prime minister's Downing Street flat The texts between Mr Johnson and Lord Brownlow were revealed during a separate investigation by the elections watchdog into the funding of the refurbishment, estimated to have cost Â£112,000. Mr Johnson wasstrongly criticised by his standards adviser Lord Geidtfor not disclosing the messages during an official inquiry into the Downing Street flat renovations. However, Lord Geidt said he would not have changed the verdict of his original investigation last year that Mr Johnson had not breached the ministerial code. Defending the prime minister, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Lord Geidt was ""fiercely independent"" and had found there was there was ""no conflict of interest whatsoever"". But, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner argued that the ministerial code prohibits not just actual but also perceived conflicts of interest. This video can not be played Sajid Javid says the ""important thing"" from Lord Geidt's report is that the ministerial code ""has been met at all times."" ""A reasonable person could surely perceive that his [Lord Brownlow's] financial relationship with the prime minister has provided him with privileged access to government, and that relationship was undeclared at the time,"" she wrote in a letter to Lord Geidt. She said the adviser in his original report had decided the relationship did not constitute a conflict of interest because he believed Lord Brownlow's motivations had been altruistic. Ms Rayner said this was not the test set in either the ministerial code or the rules for MPs, and urged him to either amend his original investigation or amend the existing one. Lord Brownlow supplied the money, both directly and indirectly, for the changes to the flat, but Mr Johnson says he has now covered all the costs out of his own pocket. The Conservative Partywas fined Â£17,800 last monthafter the Electoral Commission found it had failed to accurately declare all of Lord Brownlow's donations towards the renovation. The Downing Street buildings are publicly owned and prime ministers receive an annual grant of Â£30,000 to spend on their living quarters - if they want to spend more than that they have fund it out of their own pocket. The saga of the Downing Street flat refurbishment has left several questions hanging. Why did the key messages between Lord Brownlow and the prime minister take so long to come to light? They were found by the Electoral Commission's investigation, but not inquiries triggered by the government itself. Can or should more be done to record ministers' communications, amid accusations of ""government by WhatsApp""? Critics argue that informal channels, like the messaging service, lack transparency and allow inappropriate access and influence. Who or what can hold the prime minister to account? Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on ministers' interests, could see his powers increased and Boris Johnson himself said he wanted to ""strengthen"" the office. Is another investigation looming? While cleared of breaking ministerial rules, Mr Johnson could face an investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner Kathryn Stone into his conduct as an MP. Reflecting on Lord Geidt's report, Labour peer Peter Mandelson told the BBC's Week in Westminster the adviser had ""loaded the gun... but ultimately chose not to pull the trigger on the prime minister"". ""I think he would have been reluctant to do that even though he had the grounds to do so,"" he said in an interview which can be be heard on Radio 4 at 11:00 GMT on Saturday 8 January. The former deputy prime minister, said Lord Geidt, who he had worked with in the past, was a man of ""integrity"", adding: ""He found himself drawn into a mire of sleaze which I'm sure with hindsight he might have preferred not to have got involved with at all."" An engraving showing the crystal palace where the Great Exhibition was held in 1851 Lord Brownlow proposed the idea of a Great Exhibition festival in partnership with the Royal Albert Hall, a London venue for whom he acts as a Trustee. The plan was inspired by the original Great Exhibition held in London's Hyde Park in 1851, showcasing new technologies from Britain and its empire at the time. The peer discussed the proposal with then Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden but in the the end the government did not pursue the idea. Instead the governmentwill hold a series of events across the UK, entitled ""Unboxed"",externalincluding light installations and a project encouraging people to grow crops.

"The Armed Forces have sent 200 personnel into NHS hospitals across London to plug staff shortages. The Ministry of Defence will provide 40 defence medics and 160 general duty personnel for the next three weeks. Hospitals in London have been hit hard by staff absences, with thousands off sick or isolating as the Omicron variant surged through the capital. Earlier this week, the PM saidhe hoped England could ""ride out"" the latest wavewithout further restrictions. Pressure on London hospitals has increased over the past month, with 4,000 patients currently in hospital with Covid compared with 1,100 in early December. The Royal College of Nursing's director for England, Patricia Marquis, said the deployment showed the government could not deny there was a ""staffing crisis"" in the NHS. ""The prime minister and others can no longer be dismissive of questions about the ability of NHS staff to deliver safe care,"" she said. Across the UK, about 1,800 armed forces personnel are supporting the NHS response to the pandemic. How is the NHS in my area coping this winter? Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? How many cases are there where I live? As of Friday morning, 16 hospital trusts in England were experiencing critical incidents - about one in eight of the total. A critical incident is declared when a trust is worried it might not be able to provide core priority services, such as emergency care. It means they can get extra help and draft staff in from other duties. Approximately 4% of staff at acute NHS trusts in England were off because of Covid each day during the week ending 2 January, latest figures show. That equates to 35,596 staff each day on average, up by 41% on the previous week. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive.

This data shows the proportion of ambulance patients who waited 30 minutes or more, in the week shown. It comes from daily situation reports which are published weekly during the winter in England. As this is fast-turnaround data, the NHS says only minimal validation can be carried out but it is considered fit for purpose. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not publish ambulance queue data. Patients at A&E should be seen within four hours of arrival. This data shows the proportion of patients attending A&E who waited longer than four hours to be treated, discharged or admitted. This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed. In Wales, bed wait data is not published, so the figure shown is the occupancy level in general and acute beds. Scotland and Northern Ireland do not publish bed wait or bed occupancy data. Data for England is show by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area.

If you can't see the lookup, click here But the overall figures mask stark regional differences. Some of the hardest-hit hospitals in the country are in the north of England - Sheffield's teaching hospitals were missing 11% of staff due to Covid. But in London, where data suggests a slowdown in the Omicron wave after Christmas, staff absences actually fell very slightly. There are 236 patients on ventilators in the capital - compared with 190 last month - and daily admissions are about four times higher than the beginning of December. Vaccination rates in London are also running behind the UK as a whole, with 69% having had a first dose, 63% a second and 40% a booster jab. Across the UK, 90% have had their first jab, 83% have had a second, and 61% a booster. Health Secretary Sajid Javid urged people to get their vaccinations to help cut the pressure on the NHS, as he welcomed support from the military. He said: ""Once again they are stepping up to assist NHS workers who are working round the clock across the capital, helping the health service through this difficult winter period where the need is greatest."" The NHS is in crisis every winter - so is this any different? The Army has been brought in before to lend a hand in extreme circumstances and has already been used in the pandemic. This tends to be the busiest week for the health service so it's not surprising given the pressure it is under that steps like this are being taken or that we are hearing so much about critical incidents. As of yesterday, one in eight hospital trusts in England had declared a critical incident - an internal warning to the system that they are struggling to provide priority services such as emergency care. We do not have comparable figures for previous years. But to provide some comparison, there are two key figures to keep in mind. Firstly the number of Covid admissions being seen is already double the number normally seen at this time of year for all types of respiratory infection - and it is still rising. Staff absences are also thought to be twice what they would usually be - although the latest figures are not due out until later. Army medics and support staff have been used to support health services throughout the pandemic - they were deployed to work in Northern Ireland's hospitals in September andwere also needed in Londonthis time last year. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the Armed Forces would again be working ""hand-in-hand"" with NHS staff ""to protect the nation from Covid-19"". He added: ""They have shown their worth time and again throughout this pandemic, whether driving ambulances, administering vaccines or supporting patients in hospital and they should be proud of their contribution to this truly national effort."" 400 military troops deployed to hospitals Covid: Military could be used to transport Covid vaccine Covid test centre troops receive Freedom of City There are 40 teams of five, with one medic and four general duties personnel, who have started work this week and will be allocated according to need. Medics will work with patients, whereas the soldiers will be working on maintaining stocks, checking in patients on arrival, and conducting basic checks. Paramedics in the South Central Ambulance Service, which covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, will also be bolstered with 32 military co-responders, who are expected to stay with them until the end of March. Staff testing positive for Covid are off work for much longer than is typical for a sickness absence and about 10% of staff at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust are off sick Jane Clegg, the regional chief nurse for the NHS in London, said: ""We are thankful for the support of the armed forces alongside thousands of NHS staff, as they respond to the increased demands brought by Covid - ensuring continued high quality care and treatment for the many Londoners being looked after by the NHS this winter."" About 1,800 regulars and reservists from the Army, Navy and the RAF are supporting the NHS response to the pandemic in the UK. More than 400 military paramedics are assisting ambulance trusts, with 313 in the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust and 96 in the Scottish Ambulance Service. And more than another 1,000 are working on the vaccine booster programme, with 730 in England, 221 in Scotland and 98 in Wales. Have you been affected by NHS staff absences? Do you work for the NHS?

It sets up an intriguing battle at Emirates Stadium on Sunday, with a spot in the fourth round on the line.

What should Arsenal be most wary of when facing Ruben Amorim's United side? Despite the rotten league form, given you are the holders, can United win this competition again? This video can not be played  Simon StoneChief football news reporter There has been a lot of talk around Manchester United and the January transfer window but other than Joe Hugill being recalled from Wigan, not much action. You suspect it will not stay that way. It was already established United needed to sell players before they could buy. It is also well known that homegrown players are a greater benefit in Profit and Sustainability terms because they create more headroom for spending. Head coach Ruben Amorim used his pre-Arsenal media conference to underline ""we know"" the club's financial position. Amorim knows - as we all do - that he has a squad of players that do not really fit his 3-4-3 system. While he might have said he has not specifically stated publicly that he wants new players, it is safe to assume he does. So, the big question is, can United create to space needed by offloading the likes of Casemiro, Antony and Marcus Rashford this month - or do they have to sell someone there is interest in like Kobbie Mainoo? They were in a similar position in the summer, which is how Scott McTominay ended up at Napoli. Nothing has happened at United so far this month. But it will. Simon StoneChief football news reporter Manchester City are edging closer to the signing of Uzbekistan defender Abdukodir Khusanov. The 20-year-old is rated in the â¬50m bracket by his French club Lens. City have been keen to bring in new players this month. Manager Pep Guardiola refused to speak about talks around any potential signings as he looked ahead to Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie with League Two Salford. However, talks for Khusanov are at an advanced stage and it would be no surprise if a deal was agreed in the coming days. Nat HaywardBBC Sport journalist Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has been speaking to the media before Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie at home to League Two side Salford City (17:45). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Guardiola said Ruben Dias ""feels better but [is] not ready"" and he is unsure when he will return, but Oscar Bobb is back in partial training and the broken bone in his foot has ""healed"". He added: ""Ederson is fine, but John Stones - no."" He did not comment on reported interest in Eintracht Frankfurt and Egypt forward Omar Marmoush: ""I was clear in my answer - I'm not going to talk. He's a player from another club. I'm not saying an answer. I'm not going to answer one question [on transfers]."" Guardiola feels a connection to Saturday's opponents: ""I've lived in Salford for the past eight years so I will be playing against my neighbourhood, my home town. The past six games, six clean sheets and six victories, so I have huge respect for them and what they do - the intensity - and we will take it seriously, like we always have done."" On the Class of 92's involvement at Salford: ""I saw Gary Neville. I don't know all the other players involved but they are smart people, I'm sure of that, and when people from football run clubs they take smart decisions."" On Erling Haaland's fitness struggles: ""This year, I had a feeling he is incredibly focused. When you have a focus and your target is to be fit, always you are fit. Our physio takes care of him really well. He spends a lot of time here - that's why he's ready. With the amount of situations we should use him more than we expect, but he handles it really well.""

"Boris Johnson is facing questions over his backing for a Tory donor's pet project while at the same time asking him for help to pay for a designer revamp of his Downing Street flat. Text messages published on Thursday show the PM asking Lord Brownlow to clear spending on the renovations as the flat was ""a bit of a tip"". He told Lord Brownlow he would take action on his ""great exhibition plan"". The Tory peer then had a meeting with a government minister about this plan. Lord Brownlow is a trustee of London's Albert Hall and he, along with other representatives of the venue, met then culture secretary Oliver Dowden to discuss the possibility of hosting the cultural festival. The meeting took place at the Albert Hall six weeks after the text exchange with the prime minister. No 10 said it was arranged through ""the usual official channels"". What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? PM flat row: Adviser unhappy but not quitting for now What do we know about Boris Johnson's finances? The investigations into Boris Johnson and the government In the end, the exhibition did not happen, but Labour say Lord Brownlow's November 2020 text exchanges with the PM still matter. Speaking to the BBC, Labour's shadow justice secretary Steve Reed said: ""The issue is not whether it [the festival] happened, it is whether rich people can pay to get access to government ministers to try and influence them over how they decide to spend taxpayers' money."" Designer Lulu Lytle was commissioned to help decorate the prime minister's Downing Street flat The texts between Mr Johnson and Lord Brownlow were revealed during a separate investigation by the elections watchdog into the funding of the refurbishment, estimated to have cost Â£112,000. Mr Johnson wasstrongly criticised by his standards adviser Lord Geidtfor not disclosing the messages during an official inquiry into the Downing Street flat renovations. However, Lord Geidt said he would not have changed the verdict of his original investigation last year that Mr Johnson had not breached the ministerial code. Defending the prime minister, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Lord Geidt was ""fiercely independent"" and had found there was there was ""no conflict of interest whatsoever"". But, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner argued that the ministerial code prohibits not just actual but also perceived conflicts of interest. This video can not be played Sajid Javid says the ""important thing"" from Lord Geidt's report is that the ministerial code ""has been met at all times."" ""A reasonable person could surely perceive that his [Lord Brownlow's] financial relationship with the prime minister has provided him with privileged access to government, and that relationship was undeclared at the time,"" she wrote in a letter to Lord Geidt. She said the adviser in his original report had decided the relationship did not constitute a conflict of interest because he believed Lord Brownlow's motivations had been altruistic. Ms Rayner said this was not the test set in either the ministerial code or the rules for MPs, and urged him to either amend his original investigation or amend the existing one. Lord Brownlow supplied the money, both directly and indirectly, for the changes to the flat, but Mr Johnson says he has now covered all the costs out of his own pocket. The Conservative Partywas fined Â£17,800 last monthafter the Electoral Commission found it had failed to accurately declare all of Lord Brownlow's donations towards the renovation. The Downing Street buildings are publicly owned and prime ministers receive an annual grant of Â£30,000 to spend on their living quarters - if they want to spend more than that they have fund it out of their own pocket. The saga of the Downing Street flat refurbishment has left several questions hanging. Why did the key messages between Lord Brownlow and the prime minister take so long to come to light? They were found by the Electoral Commission's investigation, but not inquiries triggered by the government itself. Can or should more be done to record ministers' communications, amid accusations of ""government by WhatsApp""? Critics argue that informal channels, like the messaging service, lack transparency and allow inappropriate access and influence. Who or what can hold the prime minister to account? Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on ministers' interests, could see his powers increased and Boris Johnson himself said he wanted to ""strengthen"" the office. Is another investigation looming? While cleared of breaking ministerial rules, Mr Johnson could face an investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner Kathryn Stone into his conduct as an MP. Reflecting on Lord Geidt's report, Labour peer Peter Mandelson told the BBC's Week in Westminster the adviser had ""loaded the gun... but ultimately chose not to pull the trigger on the prime minister"". ""I think he would have been reluctant to do that even though he had the grounds to do so,"" he said in an interview which can be be heard on Radio 4 at 11:00 GMT on Saturday 8 January. The former deputy prime minister, said Lord Geidt, who he had worked with in the past, was a man of ""integrity"", adding: ""He found himself drawn into a mire of sleaze which I'm sure with hindsight he might have preferred not to have got involved with at all."" An engraving showing the crystal palace where the Great Exhibition was held in 1851 Lord Brownlow proposed the idea of a Great Exhibition festival in partnership with the Royal Albert Hall, a London venue for whom he acts as a Trustee. The plan was inspired by the original Great Exhibition held in London's Hyde Park in 1851, showcasing new technologies from Britain and its empire at the time. The peer discussed the proposal with then Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden but in the the end the government did not pursue the idea. Instead the governmentwill hold a series of events across the UK, entitled ""Unboxed"",externalincluding light installations and a project encouraging people to grow crops.

"The Armed Forces have sent 200 personnel into NHS hospitals across London to plug staff shortages. The Ministry of Defence will provide 40 defence medics and 160 general duty personnel for the next three weeks. Hospitals in London have been hit hard by staff absences, with thousands off sick or isolating as the Omicron variant surged through the capital. Earlier this week, the PM saidhe hoped England could ""ride out"" the latest wavewithout further restrictions. Pressure on London hospitals has increased over the past month, with 4,000 patients currently in hospital with Covid compared with 1,100 in early December. The Royal College of Nursing's director for England, Patricia Marquis, said the deployment showed the government could not deny there was a ""staffing crisis"" in the NHS. ""The prime minister and others can no longer be dismissive of questions about the ability of NHS staff to deliver safe care,"" she said. Across the UK, about 1,800 armed forces personnel are supporting the NHS response to the pandemic. How is the NHS in my area coping this winter? Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? How many cases are there where I live? As of Friday morning, 16 hospital trusts in England were experiencing critical incidents - about one in eight of the total. A critical incident is declared when a trust is worried it might not be able to provide core priority services, such as emergency care. It means they can get extra help and draft staff in from other duties. Approximately 4% of staff at acute NHS trusts in England were off because of Covid each day during the week ending 2 January, latest figures show. That equates to 35,596 staff each day on average, up by 41% on the previous week. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive.

This data shows the proportion of ambulance patients who waited 30 minutes or more, in the week shown. It comes from daily situation reports which are published weekly during the winter in England. As this is fast-turnaround data, the NHS says only minimal validation can be carried out but it is considered fit for purpose. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not publish ambulance queue data. Patients at A&E should be seen within four hours of arrival. This data shows the proportion of patients attending A&E who waited longer than four hours to be treated, discharged or admitted. This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed. In Wales, bed wait data is not published, so the figure shown is the occupancy level in general and acute beds. Scotland and Northern Ireland do not publish bed wait or bed occupancy data. Data for England is show by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board.

If you can't see the lookup, click here But the overall figures mask stark regional differences. Some of the hardest-hit hospitals in the country are in the north of England - Sheffield's teaching hospitals were missing 11% of staff due to Covid. But in London, where data suggests a slowdown in the Omicron wave after Christmas, staff absences actually fell very slightly. There are 236 patients on ventilators in the capital - compared with 190 last month - and daily admissions are about four times higher than the beginning of December. Vaccination rates in London are also running behind the UK as a whole, with 69% having had a first dose, 63% a second and 40% a booster jab. Across the UK, 90% have had their first jab, 83% have had a second, and 61% a booster. Health Secretary Sajid Javid urged people to get their vaccinations to help cut the pressure on the NHS, as he welcomed support from the military. He said: ""Once again they are stepping up to assist NHS workers who are working round the clock across the capital, helping the health service through this difficult winter period where the need is greatest."" The NHS is in crisis every winter - so is this any different? The Army has been brought in before to lend a hand in extreme circumstances and has already been used in the pandemic. This tends to be the busiest week for the health service so it's not surprising given the pressure it is under that steps like this are being taken or that we are hearing so much about critical incidents. As of yesterday, one in eight hospital trusts in England had declared a critical incident - an internal warning to the system that they are struggling to provide priority services such as emergency care. We do not have comparable figures for previous years. But to provide some comparison, there are two key figures to keep in mind. Firstly the number of Covid admissions being seen is already double the number normally seen at this time of year for all types of respiratory infection - and it is still rising. Staff absences are also thought to be twice what they would usually be - although the latest figures are not due out until later. Army medics and support staff have been used to support health services throughout the pandemic - they were deployed to work in Northern Ireland's hospitals in September andwere also needed in Londonthis time last year. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the Armed Forces would again be working ""hand-in-hand"" with NHS staff ""to protect the nation from Covid-19"". He added: ""They have shown their worth time and again throughout this pandemic, whether driving ambulances, administering vaccines or supporting patients in hospital and they should be proud of their contribution to this truly national effort."" 400 military troops deployed to hospitals Covid: Military could be used to transport Covid vaccine Covid test centre troops receive Freedom of City There are 40 teams of five, with one medic and four general duties personnel, who have started work this week and will be allocated according to need. Medics will work with patients, whereas the soldiers will be working on maintaining stocks, checking in patients on arrival, and conducting basic checks. Paramedics in the South Central Ambulance Service, which covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, will also be bolstered with 32 military co-responders, who are expected to stay with them until the end of March. Staff testing positive for Covid are off work for much longer than is typical for a sickness absence and about 10% of staff at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust are off sick Jane Clegg, the regional chief nurse for the NHS in London, said: ""We are thankful for the support of the armed forces alongside thousands of NHS staff, as they respond to the increased demands brought by Covid - ensuring continued high quality care and treatment for the many Londoners being looked after by the NHS this winter."" About 1,800 regulars and reservists from the Army, Navy and the RAF are supporting the NHS response to the pandemic in the UK. More than 400 military paramedics are assisting ambulance trusts, with 313 in the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust and 96 in the Scottish Ambulance Service. And more than another 1,000 are working on the vaccine booster programme, with 730 in England, 221 in Scotland and 98 in Wales. Have you been affected by NHS staff absences? Do you work for the NHS?

"Covid-related staff absences at hospitals in England have risen sharply since Omicron took hold last month, latest figures show. The number of workers off sick for Covid reasons trebled from the beginning of December. The Royal College of Nursing said growing absences meant the situation was ""simply not safe."" NHS national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said staff were under pressure but were ""stepping up"". Downing Street said Boris Johnson saw no need for further restrictions despite the staff absences, as England's current measures were ""balanced and proportionate"". Earlier this week, the prime minister saidhe hoped England could ""ride out""the Omicron wave without more restrictions. How many cases are there in my area? Military sends 200 personnel to back NHS in London How is the NHS in your area coping this winter? Approximately 4% of hospital staff in England - nearly 36,000 - were off for Covid reasons each day during the week ending 2 January. That was a rise of 41% on the previous week, and treble the 11,957 absences seen at the beginning of the Omicron wave in the week ending 5 December. When other sickness absence is added it brings the total off to 9% - nearly double what would normally be seen at this time of year. However, the national figures - released by NHS England - mask stark regional differences. Some of the hardest-hit hospitals in the country are in northern England, with Mid Yorkshire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust currently seeing about 6% of staff off due to Covid. But in London, where data suggests a slowdown in the Omicron wave after Christmas, staff absences fell slightly. Health Secretary Sajid Javid acknowledged the NHS was facing a ""rocky few weeks ahead"" and called on people to continue to get vaccinated to help the relieve pressure on the health service. During a visit to a hospital in south London, he said the decision from a number of English health trusts to declare critical incidents in recent days was ""understandable"" in the context of mounting pressure on them. Mr Javid added: ""It is all part of trying to work together providing the NHS every support that it needs to get through this difficult time."" Prof David Spiegelhalter, a statistician from the University of Cambridge, said Covid cases in younger people were coming down ""fairly fast"" in the capital. He said hospital admissions in London - which has been at the leading edge of the Omicron wave - seemed to be stable, but elsewhere in the UK admissions were still rising. Prof Spiegelhalter said there was still no sign of a ""serious increase"" in patients in intensive care, those needing ventilation and deaths. ""We would have expected to see that by now in London and elsewhere, so that is the really reassuring thing,"" he told the BBC. ""I think we can guarantee that over this wave... what we're not going to see is a big surge in very severe outcomes."" He said the ""crucial"" thing was the disruption to the NHS and other services. Patricia Marquis, from the Royal College of Nursing said: ""Outside of healthcare, staffing shortages are closing shops and cancelling trains but nurses can't stop helping their patients. ""Instead, they find themselves spread thinner and thinner, but they can't keep spinning plates indefinitely either - this situation is simply not safe."" Latest estimates suggestmore than one in 15 people in the UK would have tested positive for Covidin the last week of 2021.

On Wednesday night the number exceeded 20, but since then several have declared their critical incident over, NHS sources told the BBC. NHS national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said Omicron meant ""more patients to treat and fewer staff to treat them"". ""While we don't know the full scale of the potential impact this new strain will have, Covid cases in hospitals are the highest they've been since February last year - piling even more pressure on hard working staff. ""Those staff are stepping up as they always do,"" he said. Earlier, the armed forcessent 200 personnel into NHS hospitalsacross London to plug staff shortages.

Ambulances should be able to hand over their patients to A&E staff within 15 minutes of arriving. But in the week to 2 January 23% waited more than 30 minutes. That is a similar level to what was being seen before Christmas, but above the numbers seen before the pandemic began, when 18% of ambulances were facing delays at this point of winter.

"Chester FC fans celebrate - but will they be stopped from watching matches at the Deva Stadium? An investigation is looking into whether an English football team broke Covid rules - because their ground is in Wales. In Wales, restrictions mean most matches are being played behind closed doors. However, since rules came into force on 26 December, Chester FC has held two games with each attracting more than 2,000 fans. The Welsh government said the club was in Wales and must follow Welsh rules. Club officials say they have been informed of potential breaches of Welsh Coronavirus Regulations for fixtures held on 28 December 2021 and 2 January 2022. WRU considering hosting games in England Current restrictions to stay in place In a statement the club said they have been told they ""may commit further potential breaches if it continues to play home fixtures with crowds while the current restrictions in Wales remain in place"". ""It was agreed that all parties would seek further legal advice given the complex issues and future implications of any outcome,"" they added. ""Chester Football Club's stadium is in Wales therefore Welsh regulations apply,"" a Welsh government spokesperson said. ""As the enforcing authorities Flintshire County Council and North Wales Police are dealing with the matter."" Chester's Deva Stadium is in Flintshire, with the border between Wales and England running through the car park to the east of the stands. Allow Twitter content?

Wales has been inLevel Two Coronavirus restrictions since 26 December, which means all sporting events effectively have to be played behind closed doors. The number of spectators is limited to 50, in addition to those taking part. Stewarding and policing costs mean thatit can be impractical for clubs to allow a handfulof fans through turnstiles. However, there are no crowd limits in England. Since the rule changes in Wales, Chester FC's home ground has hosted two games in National League North (the sixth tier of English football). The match attendance for Chester FC's home game against AFC Fylde on 28 December was reported to be 2,075 and against Telford on 2 January was 2,116. Chester may be an English club, but their ground is in Wales Chester's 1-1 draw against Telford saw the biggest attendance in the National League North. Despite the geographic conundrum, matchday policing at the Deva Stadium is carried out by Cheshire Constabulary. Chester fans have argued on social media that the border runs through the clubhouse and that the stadium has a Chester postcode. The club's next home game is against Brackley Town on the 15 January. Large crowds that usually attend the festive rugby derbies in Wales were locked out because of the ruling. However, the majority of matches fell victim to Covid, with only the Scarlets versus Ospreys going ahead on New Year's Day. The ruling also affects Wales' top football sides such as Cardiff City, Swansea City, Newport County and Wrexham AFC. Almost 250,000 fans attended Wales' Autumn matches - will they be allowed back for the Six Nations Wales are due to host three games in this year's Six Nations rugby championship - with 72,000 fans expected in Cardiff for the first against Scotland on 12 February. However, the Welsh Rugby Union has said it is exploring the option of moving games over the border to England - where there are no limits on fans. First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmedthere will be no change to the rules for the next weekat least.

"Stabbing victim Dariusz Wolosz lived in the Yiewlsey area A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder following a fatal stabbing in west London. Dariusz Wolosz, 46, was attacked on Yiewsley High Street in West Drayton in the early hours of Tuesday morning. He was pronounced dead at the scene. A post-mortem examination found he had suffered fatal wounds to his groin and chest. The suspect remains in custody and a 13-year-old boy arrested on Thursday has been bailed, the Met Police said. Officers believe Mr Wolosz, a Polish national who lived locally, was attacked by a ""group of males"". Following the arrest, Det Ch Insp Wayne Jolley continued to appeal for witnesses and those with dashcam footage to come forward, adding that Mr Wolosz's family had been left ""distraught"" by his death. He said: ""We believe Dariusz was attacked by a group of males in Tavistock Road following a verbal dispute. The group then fled in different directions. ""Dariusz's family are distraught and we are doing everything we can to support them at this time."" Mr Wolosz's death was the second fatal stabbing in the Yiewsley area in less than a week. Ionut Elvis Tacu was fatally stabbed on 30 December - making him London's 30th teenage homicide victim in 2021 Ionut Elvis Tacu, 16, died after being stabbed at Philpot's Farm Open Space, close to Heather Lane, on 30 December. A 16-year-old boy has been charged with murder. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the two fatal stabbings. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of both victims at this time,"" he said. He added: ""There continues to be an increased police presence in the local area and anyone with any further information in relation to either of these incidents should speak to local officers or call 101. ""I continue to offer my full support to the police both in Hillingdon and across the country in their efforts to tackle knife crime.""

"Steam which would have been used to turn the turbines is released from the reactor at Hunterston B The Hunterston B nuclear power plant in North Ayrshire has been shut down for the final time after generating electricity for 46 years. The plant's original 25-year lifespan was extended by more than two decades. But the final closure was brought forward after cracks were found in the graphite bricks which make up the reactor cores. A small group of former workers gathered at the power station at midday to see the final shut down. The site, owned by EDF Energy, will now begin a three-year process of defueling with the spent nuclear fuel sent to Sellafield for reprocessing. After that, the site will be handed over to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The 480-strong workforce at Hunterston will be cut by a quarter during defueling but the company said those 125 employees would either retire or be redeployed to other sites. Nuclear power station to close two years early Pictures show cracks in nuclear reactor Over 350 cracks found in nuclear reactor Station director Paul Forrest said: ""It was originally thought Hunterston B would run for 25 years but investment in the plant and the people who work here mean we've been able to safely extend that to 46 years. ""This is an incredible achievement and everyone here is proud of what the station has accomplished."" Plans had been made to operate Hunterston until 2023 but the hairline cracks in the graphite bricks have shortened the life of the power station. Hunterston B soon after it began generating power in 1976 The cracks were first spotted in two graphite bricks in the reactor in 2014. By 2018, a total of 350 bricks had been affected although the Office for Nuclear Regulation subsequently gave permission to operate at much greater numbers. Each of the two reactor cores is made up of 3,000 bricks which form vertical channels for nuclear fuel and control rods to slide in and out. The concern was that too many cracks, combined with a rare seismic event, could affect the structural integrity of the core and prevent it being shut down in an emergency. Hunterston B under construction in 1969 The Hunterston A plant, which is already closed, comprised two 180MWe Magnox reactors. It began operation in 1964. Reactor 2 shut down in December 1989 and Reactor 1 in March 1990. Construction of Hunterston B began in 1968 and reactors 3 and 4 began operating in February 1976 and March 1977. When operational, the two reactors at Hunterston B provided a base-load of electricity which was enough to power 1.8 million homes. Reactor 3, a 490MWe advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR), was permanently closed down on 26 November. Hunterston Reactor 4 - also a 490MWe AGR - has now shut down. The closure will likely mean an increased reliance in the short-term on fossil fuel or imported energy sources but a bidding round is under way to significantly increase Scotland's offshore wind capacity. The Scottish government has long been opposed to building new nuclear power stations. Nuclear energy will still be generated in Scotland at the newer Torness power station in East Lothian. Similar cracks are expected to develop there and at several other similar sites in England. Onlookers took pictures as the plant was shut down In December, EDF Energy announced that Torness would close two years earlier than planned in 2028 because of the issue. Louise Gilmour, of the GMB union, said it should not be the beginning of the end for Scotland's nuclear story. She said: ""This is a viable low-carbon industry that can help create and sustain the domestic energy production and employment opportunities we need to play our part in confronting the climate crisis."" Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: ""As the current energy crisis demonstrates, without nuclear the cost of the electricity we rely on is higher, causes pollution and leaves us reliant on burning imported fossil fuels. ""That's why we need new nuclear - to get to net zero and provide the reliable, secure and clean power to live our lives."" Lang Banks, from WWF Scotland, said: ""Thankfully Scotland has massively grown its renewable power generating capacity which means we'll no longer need the electricity from this increasingly unreliable nuclear power plant. ""As the expensive and hazardous job of cleaning up the radioactive legacy Hunterston leaves in its wake now begins, Scotland must press on with plans to harness more clean, renewable energy."" A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""Hunterston B, its operators and in particular the workforces who have staffed the plant for more than 40 years, have played an important role in supporting Scotland's energy requirements. ""We do however remain clear in our opposition to the building of new nuclear power plants in Scotland under current technologies. ""Significant growth in renewables, storage, hydrogen and carbon capture provide the best pathway to net zero by 2045, and will deliver the decarbonisation we need to see across industry, heat and transport. ""We recognise that planning will be crucial to ensure that economic and social opportunities from the transition are not missed.""

"By 2050, more than 153 million people could have dementia, up from 57 million in 2019, experts are warning. The predicted rise is largely down to ageing and growing populations. But unhealthy lifestyles contribute too, the researchers say inThe Lancet Public Health,externaljournal. Risk factors that urgently need addressing and account for more than six million of the projected increase include high rates of smoking, obesity and diabetes, they say. The study, which looks at 195 countries, aims to give governments an idea of what resources and support may be needed and what action might help. I've got dementia - dementia hasn't got me Dementia is already the seventh leading cause of death worldwide and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people. But it is not an inevitability. The researchers point to the importance of improvements in access to education in countries around the world and say that their projected figure for 2050 has already been adjusted downwards by 6.2 million based on what is expected to happen in this area. They are less optimistic about the effects of obesity, high blood sugar and smoking and have already factored in an extra seven million cases in 2050 linked to those causes. Lead author Emma Nichols, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, at the University of Washington, in the US, said: ""We need to focus more on prevention and control of risk factors before they result in dementia. ""Even modest advances in preventing dementia or delaying its progression would pay remarkable dividends. ""To have the greatest impact, we need to reduce exposure to the leading risk factors in each country. ""For most, this means scaling up locally appropriate, low-cost programmes that support healthier diets, more exercise, quitting smoking and better access to education."" The study predicts cases will rise: in eastern sub-Saharan Africa, from nearly 660,000 to more than three million - mainly driven by population growth in North Africa and the Middle East, from almost three million to nearly 14 million in the higher-income Asia Pacific region, from 4Â·8 million to 7Â·4 million in Western Europe, from almost eight million to nearly 14 million in the UK, from just over 907,000 to almost 1.6 million Viagra may be useful against Alzheimer's dementia Pioneering dementia care village approved I've got dementia - dementia hasn't got me The Lancet Public Health Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Wales' first minister said England was a âglobal outlierâ when it came to coronavirus Mark Drakeford has accused Boris Johnson of failing to take the necessary action to protect people in England from Covid. ""The one country that stands up as not taking action to protect its population is England,"" said the first minister. The comments come as Mr Drakeford announced Covid restrictions would not be relaxed in Wales. He added that England was the ""outlier"" in the UK when it came to Covid. The UK government has been asked to comment. Earlier this week, the prime minister said he hoped England could""ride out"" the Omicron wave without further restrictions. What are Wales' Covid rules? Scientists wanted pre-Christmas lockdown Pubs and restaurants suffer 'festive flop' However, defending keeping tighter restrictions in Wales, Mr Drakeford criticised Mr Johnson's approach, saying: ""Wales is taking action as is Scotland, as is Northern Ireland and are countries right across Europe and right across the globe. ""In England, we have a government that is politically paralysed with a prime minister is unable to secure an agreement through his cabinet to take the actions that his advisors have been telling him ought to be taken."" Mr Drakeford said the peak of the Omicron wave was likely to be ""about 10 to 14 days away"", and insisted those calling for Covid restrictions to be eased were ""factually wrong"". The comments came after a senior epidemiologist, who has advised the Welsh and UK governments, called forrestrictions to be droppedto pre-Omicron levels. However, the first minister said the idea that Omicron is an illness we can afford to ""take lightly"" does not ""bear any connection to the actual position we are facing"". The first minister warned ""the storm of Omicron"" had arrived as Wales sees ""astronomically high"" positivity rates. ""We have a tough few weeks ahead and we are not in a position to withdraw any of the protections,"" he added. Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""This is a first minister who isn't prepared to have an independent public inquiry into his handling of the Covid crisis here in Wales. ""And it is a Labour first minister here in Wales who has presided over the highest death rate, unfortunately, of any part of the United Kingdom, so it's a little bit rich of him to be offering criticism of the prime minister."" In Wales nightclubs are closed, with limits on hospitality businesses, sporting events and who people can meet indoors and outdoors. The decision to limit outdoor gatherings, including organised exercise groups, haspreviously been criticisedby the UK health minister, and there have been concerns that hospitality rulescould see people head across the border to England to socialise. Public Health Wales has reported 7,915 new Covid cases and 21 further deaths. The seven day rolling case rate per 100,000 has continued to climb to 2,324, compared to 2,228 reported on Thursday. The testing positivity rate - the percentage of Covid test returning a positive result - has fallen very slightly to 51.2%. There was a daily average of 662 patients with confirmed Covid in hospital beds - a 77% increase on a week ago - although there were two and a half times as many people in hospital at the same point in 2021. However, NHS bosses have said this includes ""a lot"" of ""incidental"" Covid patients, who are in hospital for non-Covid reasons but test positive for Covid. But Mr Drakeford said this ""doesn't make any difference to the hospitals"" as they must still ""treat every one of those patients as a coronavirus patient"". Speaking at Friday's Welsh government Covid press conference the first minister said it would not be right to say the Welsh NHS is ""being overwhelmed"" but it is ""certainly facing very challenging circumstances"". He said Omicron was ""driving more people to fall ill and then to need hospital treatment"" and also making more health staff ill. ""The latest figures suggest staff absences from illness and isolation across the NHS is 8.3% but it is as high as 16.5% in some NHS organisations."" He urged people to limit the number of people they meet, take lateral flow tests before going out, and make getting a booster vaccine a priority. On those eligible for a vaccine that have chosen not to receive one, Mr Drakeford said they are ""expecting someone else to put themselves in harms way to look after them, and it simply isn't fair."" One senior doctor says restrictions are needed as hospitals are at ""bursting point"" Dr Rowena Christmas, head of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, told BBC Radio Wales that while the rules were difficult hospitals were at ""bursting point"". ""The numbers are absolutely huge, so I think we have to continue as we are at least for the time being,"" she said. UK Hospitality Cymru warned this week that without extra money and lighter restrictionsbusinesses would be left in ""peril"", with ministers responding that  a emergency financial support package will be available from 10 January. A government spokesman said they would continue to consider whether additional emergency business support funding was needed. Gary Lulham, boss of Sin City nightclub in Swansea, said while he did not expect any changes the news was ""devastating"" for an industry that was already at a ""critical breaking point"". He added that without significant financial support there would be ""hundreds of thousands"" of people at the end of the month who ""won't be able to pay their rent, or be able to put food on the table for themselves or their kids"". The Welsh Conservatives urged ministers to provide urgent support for businesses, and said restrictions on outdoor sporting events should be relaxed. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Tory leader in the Senedd, called for ""greater flexibility"" on restrictions for hospitality settings. ""I think all people have done is move that socialising indoors into house party environments which are unregulated environments,"" he said. ""I do think there is scope to lift some of the restrictions in that particular area."" He also called for Welsh ministers to scrap ""ridiculous"" fines for workers who go into the workplace when they could work at home. Mr Drakeford had previously defended the fines saying they were in place the last time there was a work from home obligation, that ""no fines were issued at all"" during that period and ""they are designed to protect workers, not to penalise them"".

There was a daily average of 662 patients with confirmed Covid in hospital beds - a 77% increase on a week ago - although there were two and a half times as many people in hospital at the same point in 2021. However, NHS bosses have said this includes ""a lot"" of ""incidental"" Covid patients, who are in hospital for non-Covid reasons but test positive for Covid. But Mr Drakeford said this ""doesn't make any difference to the hospitals"" as they must still ""treat every one of those patients as a coronavirus patient"". Speaking at Friday's Welsh government Covid press conference the first minister said it would not be right to say the Welsh NHS is ""being overwhelmed"" but it is ""certainly facing very challenging circumstances"". He said Omicron was ""driving more people to fall ill and then to need hospital treatment"" and also making more health staff ill. ""The latest figures suggest staff absences from illness and isolation across the NHS is 8.3% but it is as high as 16.5% in some NHS organisations."" He urged people to limit the number of people they meet, take lateral flow tests before going out, and make getting a booster vaccine a priority. On those eligible for a vaccine that have chosen not to receive one, Mr Drakeford said they are ""expecting someone else to put themselves in harms way to look after them, and it simply isn't fair."" One senior doctor says restrictions are needed as hospitals are at ""bursting point"" Dr Rowena Christmas, head of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, told BBC Radio Wales that while the rules were difficult hospitals were at ""bursting point"". ""The numbers are absolutely huge, so I think we have to continue as we are at least for the time being,"" she said. UK Hospitality Cymru warned this week that without extra money and lighter restrictionsbusinesses would be left in ""peril"", with ministers responding that  a emergency financial support package will be available from 10 January. A government spokesman said they would continue to consider whether additional emergency business support funding was needed. Gary Lulham, boss of Sin City nightclub in Swansea, said while he did not expect any changes the news was ""devastating"" for an industry that was already at a ""critical breaking point"". He added that without significant financial support there would be ""hundreds of thousands"" of people at the end of the month who ""won't be able to pay their rent, or be able to put food on the table for themselves or their kids"". The Welsh Conservatives urged ministers to provide urgent support for businesses, and said restrictions on outdoor sporting events should be relaxed. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Tory leader in the Senedd, called for ""greater flexibility"" on restrictions for hospitality settings. ""I think all people have done is move that socialising indoors into house party environments which are unregulated environments,"" he said. ""I do think there is scope to lift some of the restrictions in that particular area."" He also called for Welsh ministers to scrap ""ridiculous"" fines for workers who go into the workplace when they could work at home. Mr Drakeford had previously defended the fines saying they were in place the last time there was a work from home obligation, that ""no fines were issued at all"" during that period and ""they are designed to protect workers, not to penalise them"".

"Bookmaker Ladbrokes claimed Â£102m from the furlough scheme, despite rapid growth in online betting making up for all losses from the closure of stores. Accounts published on Thursday show that Ladbrokes claimed Â£57.5m in 2020, and the BBC understands it claimed a further Â£44m this year. Since the pandemic began parent company Entain has actually increased revenues, driven by strong online growth. Entain said the money protected 14,000 jobs, and is âunder review.â The biggest claimers from the furlough scheme were mostly those for whom Covid lockdowns meant steep falls in revenue â airlines, pub companies, leisure groups, shops, restaurants and caterers. One company stands out in the list â Ladbrokes, the UKâs largest operator of betting shops, with 2,845 premises branded Ladbrokes or Coral. For though it had to close them for large parts of 2020 and 2021, it had a lifeline - online. Its parent company, FTSE 100-listed gaming giant Entain, has a big online gambling business, and customers who couldnât bet in shops during the dark days of lockdown flocked to websites and apps instead. Last Aprilâs Grand National broke the record for the biggest online sports betting event in the UK. This meant that despite lockdowns, Entainâs 2020 revenues were unchanged from the year before at Â£3.6bn, and it even managed to record a profit of Â£114m. In the first nine months of 2021 revenues grew 8%. Entain is also well placed to benefit from the explosive growth of online betting in the US through its BetMGM joint venture. Rachael Blackmore winning the Grand National riding Minella Times Despite a strong financial performance, Ladbrokes made a large furlough claim. Accounts for Ladbrokes Gaming and Betting Ltd, a subsidiary company of Entain, filed with Companies House and published on Thursday show that it claimed Â£57.5m of furlough in 2020. The BBC understands the company claimed around Â£44m in 2021, taking the total to Â£102m. According to BBC analysis of data published by HMRC, that would be one of the 20 biggest furlough claims for 2021. A spokesperson for Entain said: âThe furlough scheme was a sensible and highly welcome policy intervention that helped us, as one of the countryâs largest retailers, to maintain the livelihoods of more than 14,000 retail colleagues on full pay. âWhilst the virus is still with us and the outlook, although improving, is still far from certain, the Board will continue to keep the situation under review.â Entain is legally entitled to claim the money, and there is no suggestion that it did anything wrong in making the claim or retaining the money. However rival bookmaker William Hillopted to return Â£24.5m of furlough moneyin August 2020, citing the âstrength of the post-lockdown recovery.â Iain Duncan Smith MP, the vice chair of the Gambling Related Harm All Party Parliamentary Group, said: ""The greed of these companies, that derive vast profits from addicted gamblers, never ceases to amaze. ""Any company with a clear sense of morality would immediately hand this money back to the UK taxpayer."" A number of companiesin other industries opted to return furlough fundswhen the impact of the pandemic proved less severe than initially feared - including housebuilders Redrow, Barratt and Taylor Wimpey, Games Workshop, and distribution giant Bunzl. Flutter, owner of the Paddy Power betting shops, did not tap the furlough scheme at all. Betfred shop in Stockport, closed during the pandemic Betfred, which operates 1500 betting shops, also made substantial furlough claims despite rising profits. It claimed Â£28.1m in furlough the year ending 27 Sep 2020, according to company accounts. In addition, a Betfred subsidiary company, Done Brothers (Cash Betting) Ltd, claimed somewhere between Â£18.5m and Â£37.5m from Dec 2020 to May 2021, according to HMRC data (which only gives a range, not a specific figure). The total for the group adds up to between Â£46.6m and Â£65.6m, though these figures don't include any claims it may have made in October and November 2020. Betfred Group saw turnover fall from Â£621m to Â£525m in the year ending 27 September 2020, the latest figures available, as lockdowns forced its shops to close. However the group still made substantial profits, up from Â£171m to Â£205m, lifted by some one-off gains including Â£98m resulting from a successful court case against HMRC for VAT paid on fixed-odds betting terminals from 2005 to 2013. A Betfred spokesman said: âThanks to the Governmentâs Job Retention [furlough] Scheme we have not had to make a single redundancy due to the pandemic and we will continue to invest in our shops on the high street.â Ladbrokes owner gets Â£8.1bn offer from MGM Resorts Trump golf resorts claimed over Â£3m in furlough Businesses welcome back workers as furlough ends Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Asda has backed out of a commitment it made in October to stock exclusively British beef, angering farmers. National Beef Association (NBA) chief executive Neil Shand said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by Asda's choice. Asda said their policy had changed because of the rise in British beef prices. ""Whilst we continue to work hard to keep prices as low as possible for our customers, these increases are significant"", a spokesperson said. Farmers are struggling with feed, fertilizer and energy costs escalating at rates ""never seen before"", according to the NBA. ""Our supermarkets need to support domestic producers as much as possible - now more than ever,"" Mr Shand said. Morrisons and Co-op both told the BBC they would continue to only sell British beef, despite the rise in prices. ""We're proud to support British beef farmers and Co-op was the first national supermarket to commit to only selling 100% own brand British meat and poultry.  We also only use British meat ingredients in our frozen products and sandwiches and ready meals,"" Co-op said in a statement. An Aldi spokesman said the grocer had ""no plans to change"". Asda said all fresh beef in its premium Extra Special tier would remain 100% British, while all of the rest of its fresh beef would be sourced from farms in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The country's largest supermarket, Tesco, also sources the fresh beef it sells in the UK from either the UK or the Republic of Ireland. Asda declined to comment on the decisions of other grocers. In a statement, the supermarket said: ""We know that it is important to our customers that the beef on our shelves has been produced to high welfare standards and is affordable."" Food firms call on government to fix supply chain Shoppers return to supermarkets for festive feasts Republic of Ireland beef is currently around 20% less expensive than British, according tothe Irish Examiner,external. Ireland accounted for almost 80% of UK beef imports in 2020, according to Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board. Beef makes up nearly half of all meat imports to the UK according to the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA). In response to Asda's shift, Deborah Deymond, a beef farmer who has a herd of 80 cattle in Rattery, said: ""Farmers believe in long term commitments and so should supermarkets"". ""I was so pleased to hear they had made the pledge in October but think it's disgraceful they're not supporting British farmers more"". ""You cannot have a good product for next to nothing prices and supermarkets should value domestic farmers properly,"" she added. National Farmers Union (NFU) livestock board chairman Richard Findlay, was also disappointed and said that, given the ""significant"" changes to trade and agricultural policy, it was ""more important than ever"" for retailers to ""champion"" British farmers. Mr Findley said that any sourcing commitments made by supermarkets need to be honoured. ""Our beef is renowned for its quality and high production standards, and retail support plays a big part in enabling farmers to make further investments in climate and environmentally-friendly food production,"" he added. Asda made the initial announcement after it was bought by the Issa brothers, two entrepreneurs from Blackburn who made billion-pound fortunes running petrol stations.

"The Armed Forces have sent 200 personnel into NHS hospitals across London to plug staff shortages. The Ministry of Defence will provide 40 defence medics and 160 general duty personnel for the next three weeks. Hospitals in London have been hit hard by staff absences, with thousands off sick or isolating as the Omicron variant surged through the capital. Earlier this week, the PM saidhe hoped England could ""ride out"" the latest wavewithout further restrictions. Pressure on London hospitals has increased over the past month, with 4,000 patients currently in hospital with Covid compared with 1,100 in early December. The Royal College of Nursing's director for England, Patricia Marquis, said the deployment showed the government could not deny there was a ""staffing crisis"" in the NHS. ""The prime minister and others can no longer be dismissive of questions about the ability of NHS staff to deliver safe care,"" she said. Across the UK, about 1,800 armed forces personnel are supporting the NHS response to the pandemic. How is the NHS in my area coping this winter? Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? How many cases are there where I live? As of Friday morning, 16 hospital trusts in England were experiencing critical incidents - about one in eight of the total. A critical incident is declared when a trust is worried it might not be able to provide core priority services, such as emergency care. It means they can get extra help and draft staff in from other duties. Approximately 4% of staff at acute NHS trusts in England were off because of Covid each day during the week ending 2 January, latest figures show. That equates to 35,596 staff each day on average, up by 41% on the previous week. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive.

Data not available  Data not available   Data not available    Data not available  Data not available   Data not available When patients arrive at hospital by ambulance they should be handed over within 15 minutes. This data shows the proportion of ambulance patients who waited 30 minutes or more, in the week shown. It comes from daily situation reports which are published weekly during the winter in England. As this is fast-turnaround data, the NHS says only minimal validation can be carried out but it is considered fit for purpose. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not publish ambulance queue data. Patients at A&E should be seen within four hours of arrival. This data shows the proportion of patients attending A&E who waited longer than four hours to be treated, discharged or admitted. This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed. In Wales, bed wait data is not published, so the figure shown is the occupancy level in general and acute beds. Scotland and Northern Ireland do not publish bed wait or bed occupancy data. Data for England is show by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board. Comparative data from two years ago is shown where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Bed occupancy data in Wales only goes back to April 2020. If you can't see the lookup, click here But the overall figures mask stark regional differences. Some of the hardest-hit hospitals in the country are in the north of England - Sheffield's teaching hospitals were missing 11% of staff due to Covid. But in London, where data suggests a slowdown in the Omicron wave after Christmas, staff absences actually fell very slightly. There are 236 patients on ventilators in the capital - compared with 190 last month - and daily admissions are about four times higher than the beginning of December. Vaccination rates in London are also running behind the UK as a whole, with 69% having had a first dose, 63% a second and 40% a booster jab. Across the UK, 90% have had their first jab, 83% have had a second, and 61% a booster. Health Secretary Sajid Javid urged people to get their vaccinations to help cut the pressure on the NHS, as he welcomed support from the military. He said: ""Once again they are stepping up to assist NHS workers who are working round the clock across the capital, helping the health service through this difficult winter period where the need is greatest."" The NHS is in crisis every winter - so is this any different? The Army has been brought in before to lend a hand in extreme circumstances and has already been used in the pandemic. This tends to be the busiest week for the health service so it's not surprising given the pressure it is under that steps like this are being taken or that we are hearing so much about critical incidents. As of yesterday, one in eight hospital trusts in England had declared a critical incident - an internal warning to the system that they are struggling to provide priority services such as emergency care. We do not have comparable figures for previous years. But to provide some comparison, there are two key figures to keep in mind. Firstly the number of Covid admissions being seen is already double the number normally seen at this time of year for all types of respiratory infection - and it is still rising. Staff absences are also thought to be twice what they would usually be - although the latest figures are not due out until later. Army medics and support staff have been used to support health services throughout the pandemic - they were deployed to work in Northern Ireland's hospitals in September andwere also needed in Londonthis time last year. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the Armed Forces would again be working ""hand-in-hand"" with NHS staff ""to protect the nation from Covid-19"". He added: ""They have shown their worth time and again throughout this pandemic, whether driving ambulances, administering vaccines or supporting patients in hospital and they should be proud of their contribution to this truly national effort."" 400 military troops deployed to hospitals Covid: Military could be used to transport Covid vaccine Covid test centre troops receive Freedom of City There are 40 teams of five, with one medic and four general duties personnel, who have started work this week and will be allocated according to need. Medics will work with patients, whereas the soldiers will be working on maintaining stocks, checking in patients on arrival, and conducting basic checks. Paramedics in the South Central Ambulance Service, which covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, will also be bolstered with 32 military co-responders, who are expected to stay with them until the end of March. Staff testing positive for Covid are off work for much longer than is typical for a sickness absence and about 10% of staff at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust are off sick Jane Clegg, the regional chief nurse for the NHS in London, said: ""We are thankful for the support of the armed forces alongside thousands of NHS staff, as they respond to the increased demands brought by Covid - ensuring continued high quality care and treatment for the many Londoners being looked after by the NHS this winter."" About 1,800 regulars and reservists from the Army, Navy and the RAF are supporting the NHS response to the pandemic in the UK. More than 400 military paramedics are assisting ambulance trusts, with 313 in the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust and 96 in the Scottish Ambulance Service. And more than another 1,000 are working on the vaccine booster programme, with 730 in England, 221 in Scotland and 98 in Wales. Have you been affected by NHS staff absences? Do you work for the NHS?

"Security forces on the streets of Almaty, Kazakhstan's biggest city Fresh gunshots have been heard in Kazakhstan's largest city, as the president claims order has been largely restored after a violent crackdown to days of anti-government demonstrations. Reports said gunfire was heard near the main square of Almaty, the epicentre of protests sparked by a fuel price hike.

"Bookmaker Ladbrokes claimed Â£102m from the furlough scheme, despite rapid growth in online betting making up for all losses from the closure of stores. Accounts published on Thursday show that Ladbrokes claimed Â£57.5m in 2020, and the BBC understands it claimed a further Â£44m this year. Since the pandemic began parent company Entain has actually increased revenues, driven by strong online growth. Entain said the money protected 14,000 jobs, and is âunder review.â The biggest claimers from the furlough scheme were mostly those for whom Covid lockdowns meant steep falls in revenue â airlines, pub companies, leisure groups, shops, restaurants and caterers. One company stands out in the list â Ladbrokes, the UKâs largest operator of betting shops, with 2,845 premises branded Ladbrokes or Coral. For though it had to close them for large parts of 2020 and 2021, it had a lifeline - online. Its parent company, FTSE 100-listed gaming giant Entain, has a big online gambling business, and customers who couldnât bet in shops during the dark days of lockdown flocked to websites and apps instead. Last Aprilâs Grand National broke the record for the biggest online sports betting event in the UK. This meant that despite lockdowns, Entainâs 2020 revenues were unchanged from the year before at Â£3.6bn, and it even managed to record a profit of Â£114m. In the first nine months of 2021 revenues grew 8%. Entain is also well placed to benefit from the explosive growth of online betting in the US through its BetMGM joint venture. Rachael Blackmore winning the Grand National riding Minella Times Despite a strong financial performance, Ladbrokes made a large furlough claim. Accounts for Ladbrokes Gaming and Betting Ltd, a subsidiary company of Entain, filed with Companies House and published on Thursday show that it claimed Â£57.5m of furlough in 2020. The BBC understands the company claimed around Â£44m in 2021, taking the total to Â£102m. According to BBC analysis of data published by HMRC, that would be one of the 20 biggest furlough claims for 2021. A spokesperson for Entain said: âThe furlough scheme was a sensible and highly welcome policy intervention that helped us, as one of the countryâs largest retailers, to maintain the livelihoods of more than 14,000 retail colleagues on full pay. âWhilst the virus is still with us and the outlook, although improving, is still far from certain, the Board will continue to keep the situation under review.â Entain is legally entitled to claim the money, and there is no suggestion that it did anything wrong in making the claim or retaining the money. However rival bookmaker William Hillopted to return Â£24.5m of furlough moneyin August 2020, citing the âstrength of the post-lockdown recovery.â Iain Duncan Smith MP, the vice chair of the Gambling Related Harm All Party Parliamentary Group, said: ""The greed of these companies, that derive vast profits from addicted gamblers, never ceases to amaze. ""Any company with a clear sense of morality would immediately hand this money back to the UK taxpayer."" A number of companiesin other industries opted to return furlough fundswhen the impact of the pandemic proved less severe than initially feared - including housebuilders Redrow, Barratt and Taylor Wimpey, Games Workshop, and distribution giant Bunzl. Flutter, owner of the Paddy Power betting shops, did not tap the furlough scheme at all. Betfred shop in Stockport, closed during the pandemic Betfred, which operates 1500 betting shops, also made substantial furlough claims despite rising profits. It claimed Â£28.1m in furlough the year ending 27 Sep 2020, according to company accounts. In addition, a Betfred subsidiary company, Done Brothers (Cash Betting) Ltd, claimed somewhere between Â£18.5m and Â£37.5m from Dec 2020 to May 2021, according to HMRC data (which only gives a range, not a specific figure). The total for the group adds up to between Â£46.6m and Â£65.6m, though these figures don't include any claims it may have made in October and November 2020. Betfred Group saw turnover fall from Â£621m to Â£525m in the year ending 27 September 2020, the latest figures available, as lockdowns forced its shops to close. However the group still made substantial profits, up from Â£171m to Â£205m, lifted by some one-off gains including Â£98m resulting from a successful court case against HMRC for VAT paid on fixed-odds betting terminals from 2005 to 2013. A Betfred spokesman said: âThanks to the Governmentâs Job Retention [furlough] Scheme we have not had to make a single redundancy due to the pandemic and we will continue to invest in our shops on the high street.â Ladbrokes owner gets Â£8.1bn offer from MGM Resorts Trump golf resorts claimed over Â£3m in furlough Businesses welcome back workers as furlough ends Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Wales' first minister said England was a âglobal outlierâ when it came to coronavirus Mark Drakeford has accused Boris Johnson of failing to take the necessary action to protect people in England from Covid. ""The one country that stands up as not taking action to protect its population is England,"" said the first minister. The comments come as Mr Drakeford announced Covid restrictions would not be relaxed in Wales. He added that England was the ""outlier"" in the UK when it came to Covid. The UK government has been asked to comment. Earlier this week, the prime minister said he hoped England could""ride out"" the Omicron wave without further restrictions. What are Wales' Covid rules? Scientists wanted pre-Christmas lockdown Pubs and restaurants suffer 'festive flop' However, defending keeping tighter restrictions in Wales, Mr Drakeford criticised Mr Johnson's approach, saying: ""Wales is taking action as is Scotland, as is Northern Ireland and are countries right across Europe and right across the globe. ""In England, we have a government that is politically paralysed with a prime minister is unable to secure an agreement through his cabinet to take the actions that his advisors have been telling him ought to be taken."" Mr Drakeford said the peak of the Omicron wave was likely to be ""about 10 to 14 days away"", and insisted those calling for Covid restrictions to be eased were ""factually wrong"". The comments came after a senior epidemiologist, who has advised the Welsh and UK governments, called forrestrictions to be droppedto pre-Omicron levels. However, the first minister said the idea that Omicron is an illness we can afford to ""take lightly"" does not ""bear any connection to the actual position we are facing"". The first minister warned ""the storm of Omicron"" had arrived as Wales sees ""astronomically high"" positivity rates. ""We have a tough few weeks ahead and we are not in a position to withdraw any of the protections,"" he added. Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""This is a first minister who isn't prepared to have an independent public inquiry into his handling of the Covid crisis here in Wales. ""And it is a Labour first minister here in Wales who has presided over the highest death rate, unfortunately, of any part of the United Kingdom, so it's a little bit rich of him to be offering criticism of the prime minister."" In Wales nightclubs are closed, with limits on hospitality businesses, sporting events and who people can meet indoors and outdoors. The decision to limit outdoor gatherings, including organised exercise groups, haspreviously been criticisedby the UK health minister, and there have been concerns that hospitality rulescould see people head across the border to England to socialise. Public Health Wales has reported 7,915 new Covid cases and 21 further deaths. The seven day rolling case rate per 100,000 has continued to climb to 2,324, compared to 2,228 reported on Thursday. The testing positivity rate - the percentage of Covid test returning a positive result - has fallen very slightly to 51.2%. There was a daily average of 662 patients with confirmed Covid in hospital beds - a 77% increase on a week ago - although there were two and a half times as many people in hospital at the same point in 2021. However, NHS bosses have said this includes ""a lot"" of ""incidental"" Covid patients, who are in hospital for non-Covid reasons but test positive for Covid. But Mr Drakeford said this ""doesn't make any difference to the hospitals"" as they must still ""treat every one of those patients as a coronavirus patient"". Speaking at Friday's Welsh government Covid press conference the first minister said it would not be right to say the Welsh NHS is ""being overwhelmed"" but it is ""certainly facing very challenging circumstances"". He said Omicron was ""driving more people to fall ill and then to need hospital treatment"" and also making more health staff ill. ""The latest figures suggest staff absences from illness and isolation across the NHS is 8.3% but it is as high as 16.5% in some NHS organisations."" He urged people to limit the number of people they meet, take lateral flow tests before going out, and make getting a booster vaccine a priority. On those eligible for a vaccine that have chosen not to receive one, Mr Drakeford said they are ""expecting someone else to put themselves in harms way to look after them, and it simply isn't fair."" One senior doctor says restrictions are needed as hospitals are at ""bursting point"" Dr Rowena Christmas, head of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, told BBC Radio Wales that while the rules were difficult hospitals were at ""bursting point"". ""The numbers are absolutely huge, so I think we have to continue as we are at least for the time being,"" she said. UK Hospitality Cymru warned this week that without extra money and lighter restrictionsbusinesses would be left in ""peril"", with ministers responding that  a emergency financial support package will be available from 10 January. A government spokesman said they would continue to consider whether additional emergency business support funding was needed. Gary Lulham, boss of Sin City nightclub in Swansea, said while he did not expect any changes the news was ""devastating"" for an industry that was already at a ""critical breaking point"". He added that without significant financial support there would be ""hundreds of thousands"" of people at the end of the month who ""won't be able to pay their rent, or be able to put food on the table for themselves or their kids"". The Welsh Conservatives urged ministers to provide urgent support for businesses, and said restrictions on outdoor sporting events should be relaxed. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Tory leader in the Senedd, called for ""greater flexibility"" on restrictions for hospitality settings. ""I think all people have done is move that socialising indoors into house party environments which are unregulated environments,"" he said. ""I do think there is scope to lift some of the restrictions in that particular area."" He also called for Welsh ministers to scrap ""ridiculous"" fines for workers who go into the workplace when they could work at home. Mr Drakeford had previously defended the fines saying they were in place the last time there was a work from home obligation, that ""no fines were issued at all"" during that period and ""they are designed to protect workers, not to penalise them"".

"Security forces in the Central Asian country of Kazakhstan say they have killed rioters while trying to restore order. Meanwhile, troops from neighbouring countries, including Russia, have been sent to help ""stabilise"" the situation. Kazakhstan restores internet after five-day outage Kazakhstan is a huge country, the size of Western Europe, situated in Central Asia and bordering Russia and China. Made up mostly of mountains and arid steppe land, it has a population of only 19 million people. It gained independence in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The country has some of the largest oil reserves in the world. It produces 1.6 million barrels a day and has attracted billions of dollars in foreign investment. However, the wealth has not trickled down to the population, who have an average income of less than Â£2,500 a year. For nearly three decades following independence, the country was run by Nursultan Nazarbayev - a former Communist Party politburo member with strong links to Russian President Vladimir Putin. President Nazarbayev focused on economic reform while resisting moves to introduce more democracy. Public protests in Kazakhstan are illegal without a government permit, andprevious strikes and demonstrations were dealt with very harshly. The president erected statues of himself and built a new capital, Astana, which was later renamed Nur-Sultan in his honour. Mr Nazarbayev stood down in 2019, making way for the current president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. Demonstrations started on 2 January in the town of Zhanaozen, an oil hub and the site of deadly clashes between protesters and police just over 10 years ago. Protests then spread across the rest of the country. The information ministry says that 44 deaths have been confirmed (it earlier put the number at 164 but then claimed this was a ""technical mistake""). The security forces say rioters were killed in Almaty during clashes. Police say protesters tried to take control of police stations and government buildings in the city. President Tokayev said ""20,000 bandits"" had attacked the city. He said many were Islamic militants who had been trained abroad, although he did not name any specific groups. Nationwide, about 1,000 people have reportedly been injured, with 400 being treated in hospital. More than 8,000 people have been detained, according to the Kazakh government. Curfews have been declared and mass gatherings banned. The protests began when the government lifted its price cap on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Many Kazakhs converted their cars to use LPG because it was cheaper than other fuel. However, the government said the price cap was leading to LPG shortages and it could no longer afford to boost supplies. Its decision to remove the cap virtually doubled the price. A statue of former leader Nursultan Nazarbayev The rioters also appear to have other grievances. Some chanted the name of Mr Nazarbayev and tried to tear down a bronze statue of him. After stepping down as president, Mr Nazarbayev continued to hold a strong position in government as head of Kazakhstan's Security Council. He also appeared to be groominghis daughter Dariga as a future leader, according to observers.,external To placate the protesters,Mr Nazarbayev has been removed from his post,external. Another former national security boss, Karim Masimov, has been arrested and charged with treason. There seems to have been a power struggle taking place within during the time of the riots between President Tokayev and allies of his predecessor, according to Ben Godwin, head of analysis at Prism Political Risk Management. Russian paratroopers have been sent to Kazakhstan at the request of its president to help ""stabilise"" the country. They were sent under the authority of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) - a group of countries comprising Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, which was set up after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It's thought 2,500 soldiers have been deployed, from across the CSTO's member states but mostly from Russia. The CSTO says the troops are a peacekeeping force which will protect state and military installations such as gas pipelines, Russian military bases and the Russian space station at Baikonur. Russia is keen to protect its assets in Kazakhstan such as the Baikonur Cosmodrome Kazakhstan's National Security Committee says the situation in Almaty has stabilised and that security forces have restored control. As a concession, the government has delayed removing its price cap on LPG - ordering the prices of all vehicle fuel to be regulated for six months. Ministers have also been sacked. President Tokayev said the government had failed to carry out ""one of its main tasks -  keeping inflation in check"". However, according to Godwin, protests may continue for longer in Zhanaozen, which has a history of anti-government strikes and demonstrations.

"The Armed Forces have sent 200 personnel into NHS hospitals across London to plug staff shortages. The Ministry of Defence will provide 40 defence medics and 160 general duty personnel for the next three weeks. Hospitals in London have been hit hard by staff absences, with thousands off sick or isolating as the Omicron variant surged through the capital. Earlier this week, the PM saidhe hoped England could ""ride out"" the latest wavewithout further restrictions. Pressure on London hospitals has increased over the past month, with 4,000 patients currently in hospital with Covid compared with 1,100 in early December. The Royal College of Nursing's director for England, Patricia Marquis, said the deployment showed the government could not deny there was a ""staffing crisis"" in the NHS. ""The prime minister and others can no longer be dismissive of questions about the ability of NHS staff to deliver safe care,"" she said. Across the UK, about 1,800 armed forces personnel are supporting the NHS response to the pandemic. How is the NHS in my area coping this winter? Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? How many cases are there where I live? As of Friday morning, 16 hospital trusts in England were experiencing critical incidents - about one in eight of the total. A critical incident is declared when a trust is worried it might not be able to provide core priority services, such as emergency care. It means they can get extra help and draft staff in from other duties. Approximately 4% of staff at acute NHS trusts in England were off because of Covid each day during the week ending 2 January, latest figures show. That equates to 35,596 staff each day on average, up by 41% on the previous week. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive.

Some of the hardest-hit hospitals in the country are in the north of England - Sheffield's teaching hospitals were missing 11% of staff due to Covid. But in London, where data suggests a slowdown in the Omicron wave after Christmas, staff absences actually fell very slightly. There are 236 patients on ventilators in the capital - compared with 190 last month - and daily admissions are about four times higher than the beginning of December. Vaccination rates in London are also running behind the UK as a whole, with 69% having had a first dose, 63% a second and 40% a booster jab. Across the UK, 90% have had their first jab, 83% have had a second, and 61% a booster. Health Secretary Sajid Javid urged people to get their vaccinations to help cut the pressure on the NHS, as he welcomed support from the military. He said: ""Once again they are stepping up to assist NHS workers who are working round the clock across the capital, helping the health service through this difficult winter period where the need is greatest."" The NHS is in crisis every winter - so is this any different? The Army has been brought in before to lend a hand in extreme circumstances and has already been used in the pandemic. This tends to be the busiest week for the health service so it's not surprising given the pressure it is under that steps like this are being taken or that we are hearing so much about critical incidents. As of yesterday, one in eight hospital trusts in England had declared a critical incident - an internal warning to the system that they are struggling to provide priority services such as emergency care. We do not have comparable figures for previous years. But to provide some comparison, there are two key figures to keep in mind. Firstly the number of Covid admissions being seen is already double the number normally seen at this time of year for all types of respiratory infection - and it is still rising. Staff absences are also thought to be twice what they would usually be - although the latest figures are not due out until later. Army medics and support staff have been used to support health services throughout the pandemic - they were deployed to work in Northern Ireland's hospitals in September andwere also needed in Londonthis time last year. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the Armed Forces would again be working ""hand-in-hand"" with NHS staff ""to protect the nation from Covid-19"". He added: ""They have shown their worth time and again throughout this pandemic, whether driving ambulances, administering vaccines or supporting patients in hospital and they should be proud of their contribution to this truly national effort."" 400 military troops deployed to hospitals Covid: Military could be used to transport Covid vaccine Covid test centre troops receive Freedom of City There are 40 teams of five, with one medic and four general duties personnel, who have started work this week and will be allocated according to need. Medics will work with patients, whereas the soldiers will be working on maintaining stocks, checking in patients on arrival, and conducting basic checks.

About 1,800 regulars and reservists from the Army, Navy and the RAF are supporting the NHS response to the pandemic in the UK. More than 400 military paramedics are assisting ambulance trusts, with 313 in the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust and 96 in the Scottish Ambulance Service.

"This video can not be played Wales' first minister said England was a âglobal outlierâ when it came to coronavirus Mark Drakeford has accused Boris Johnson of failing to take the necessary action to protect people in England from Covid. ""The one country that stands up as not taking action to protect its population is England,"" said the first minister. The comments come as Mr Drakeford announced Covid restrictions would not be relaxed in Wales. He added that England was the ""outlier"" in the UK when it came to Covid. The UK government has been asked to comment. Earlier this week, the prime minister said he hoped England could""ride out"" the Omicron wave without further restrictions. What are Wales' Covid rules? Scientists wanted pre-Christmas lockdown Pubs and restaurants suffer 'festive flop' However, defending keeping tighter restrictions in Wales, Mr Drakeford criticised Mr Johnson's approach, saying: ""Wales is taking action as is Scotland, as is Northern Ireland and are countries right across Europe and right across the globe. ""In England, we have a government that is politically paralysed with a prime minister is unable to secure an agreement through his cabinet to take the actions that his advisors have been telling him ought to be taken."" Mr Drakeford said the peak of the Omicron wave was likely to be ""about 10 to 14 days away"", and insisted those calling for Covid restrictions to be eased were ""factually wrong"". The comments came after a senior epidemiologist, who has advised the Welsh and UK governments, called forrestrictions to be droppedto pre-Omicron levels. However, the first minister said the idea that Omicron is an illness we can afford to ""take lightly"" does not ""bear any connection to the actual position we are facing"". The first minister warned ""the storm of Omicron"" had arrived as Wales sees ""astronomically high"" positivity rates. ""We have a tough few weeks ahead and we are not in a position to withdraw any of the protections,"" he added. Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""This is a first minister who isn't prepared to have an independent public inquiry into his handling of the Covid crisis here in Wales. ""And it is a Labour first minister here in Wales who has presided over the highest death rate, unfortunately, of any part of the United Kingdom, so it's a little bit rich of him to be offering criticism of the prime minister."" In Wales nightclubs are closed, with limits on hospitality businesses, sporting events and who people can meet indoors and outdoors. The decision to limit outdoor gatherings, including organised exercise groups, haspreviously been criticisedby the UK health minister, and there have been concerns that hospitality rulescould see people head across the border to England to socialise. Public Health Wales has reported 7,915 new Covid cases and 21 further deaths. The seven day rolling case rate per 100,000 has continued to climb to 2,324, compared to 2,228 reported on Thursday. The testing positivity rate - the percentage of Covid test returning a positive result - has fallen very slightly to 51.2%. There was a daily average of 662 patients with confirmed Covid in hospital beds - a 77% increase on a week ago - although there were two and a half times as many people in hospital at the same point in 2021. However, NHS bosses have said this includes ""a lot"" of ""incidental"" Covid patients, who are in hospital for non-Covid reasons but test positive for Covid. But Mr Drakeford said this ""doesn't make any difference to the hospitals"" as they must still ""treat every one of those patients as a coronavirus patient"". Speaking at Friday's Welsh government Covid press conference the first minister said it would not be right to say the Welsh NHS is ""being overwhelmed"" but it is ""certainly facing very challenging circumstances"". He said Omicron was ""driving more people to fall ill and then to need hospital treatment"" and also making more health staff ill. ""The latest figures suggest staff absences from illness and isolation across the NHS is 8.3% but it is as high as 16.5% in some NHS organisations."" He urged people to limit the number of people they meet, take lateral flow tests before going out, and make getting a booster vaccine a priority. On those eligible for a vaccine that have chosen not to receive one, Mr Drakeford said they are ""expecting someone else to put themselves in harms way to look after them, and it simply isn't fair."" One senior doctor says restrictions are needed as hospitals are at ""bursting point"" Dr Rowena Christmas, head of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, told BBC Radio Wales that while the rules were difficult hospitals were at ""bursting point"". ""The numbers are absolutely huge, so I think we have to continue as we are at least for the time being,"" she said. UK Hospitality Cymru warned this week that without extra money and lighter restrictionsbusinesses would be left in ""peril"", with ministers responding that  a emergency financial support package will be available from 10 January. A government spokesman said they would continue to consider whether additional emergency business support funding was needed. Gary Lulham, boss of Sin City nightclub in Swansea, said while he did not expect any changes the news was ""devastating"" for an industry that was already at a ""critical breaking point"". He added that without significant financial support there would be ""hundreds of thousands"" of people at the end of the month who ""won't be able to pay their rent, or be able to put food on the table for themselves or their kids"". The Welsh Conservatives urged ministers to provide urgent support for businesses, and said restrictions on outdoor sporting events should be relaxed. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Tory leader in the Senedd, called for ""greater flexibility"" on restrictions for hospitality settings. ""I think all people have done is move that socialising indoors into house party environments which are unregulated environments,"" he said. ""I do think there is scope to lift some of the restrictions in that particular area."" He also called for Welsh ministers to scrap ""ridiculous"" fines for workers who go into the workplace when they could work at home. Mr Drakeford had previously defended the fines saying they were in place the last time there was a work from home obligation, that ""no fines were issued at all"" during that period and ""they are designed to protect workers, not to penalise them"".

The day's highlights... enjoy! #bbccricket Mark Burt:Fantastic innings by Bairstow but shows how low England have sunk. Theyâre still 150 behind in the game and the majority of the batters, including Root, have failed dismally again but people are so excited theyâve survived a rain-affected day. Be rude of me to not share the highlights of Jonny Bairstow's century again at this point... I don't think anyone will ever be able to doubt Jonny Bairstow's passion... He loves playing for England.

That's a little unfair on Chris Silverwood, Lee. The rest and rotation policy was an ECB wide strategy with Ashley Giles and Mo Bobat. If anything I imagine Silverwood regularly wanted his best players around, but they are not robots. They can't play in every single game. #bbccricket Lee Welsh:I presume weâll send Bairstow home now, as part of Siverwoodâs rest and rotation policy? Ben Stokes struggled throughout his innings with the left side strain that he picked up while bowling yesterday. He looked OK on the drive, but any pulls and sweeps caused him a lot of discomfort. In true Stokes fashion he battled through it though, and played some remarkable shots, before falling for 66. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special I can't think we'll see Ben Stokes in the fifth Test. You can't mess about with side strains. #bbccricket Roberto:Forget Steve Waughâs last-ball-of-the-day century at the SCG - Jonny Bairstowâs was more epic given the circumstances and how poor England have been all series. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special I enjoyed Mark Wood's innings enormously - and we'll never hear the end of it. England's Jonny Bairstow, speaking to BT Sport:""We've got two days to scrap and scrap hard. Our challenge this morning was to bat all day, and we're still batting. Let's see how close we can get to them."" More from Australia batter Steve Smith:""Credit to Bairstow, he took the game on. I doubt his thumb is broken, the way he was able to continue. He took the game on and played really aggressively against Nathan Lyon, and credit to him."" England's Jonny Bairstow, speaking to BT Sport:""I'm extremely proud. I had to dig deep. I went back to some things with my technique which I used a couple of years ago. I worked on not being too rigid in the indoor school with James Foster this morning. ""My thumb is slightly sore, and it was hurting. But when you're playing a New Year's Test match at Sydney, it takes a lot to get you off the field. At the end of the day, I'm very proud to be playing cricket for England."" Here's where Jonny Bairstow scored his runs - so many behind square, including the four which brought up his century. BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra More from Jonny Bairstow:""There's been a lot of talk about how we're batting but I also think you look at their bowling attack. They have four bowlers bowling very well and you have to give credit to those guys. There are lots of different factors to look at. We're not making excuses - we haven't batted well enough."" Steven FinnFormer England bowler on BBC Test Match Special When Jonny got hit on the thumb you fear the worst, but then the next over he went and hit a couple of sixes off Nathan Lyon. BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra England batter Jonny Bairstow, speaking to TMS:""I was relieved and overjoyed, to be honest with you. ""I felt I was playing nicely in Melbourne but when you've not been out in the middle, you need time to get your rhythm going. Happy with today but we need to build on it tomorrow as well. ""My thumb is sore, I'll be honest with you. But you're playing in the Ashes and you're going to take blows. It's going to take a lot to remove me from things. I might get an x-ray on it tomorrow but I reckon I'll still be there in the morning."" It's 8am. Alarm clocks will be blaring up and down the country and you'll be checking this page for the first time today. The game isn't over.

"The Armed Forces have sent 200 personnel into NHS hospitals across London to plug staff shortages. The Ministry of Defence will provide 40 defence medics and 160 general duty personnel for the next three weeks. Hospitals in London have been hit hard by staff absences, with thousands off sick or isolating as the Omicron variant surged through the capital. Earlier this week, the PM saidhe hoped England could ""ride out"" the latest wavewithout further restrictions. Pressure on London hospitals has increased over the past month, with 4,000 patients currently in hospital with Covid compared with 1,100 in early December. The Royal College of Nursing's director for England, Patricia Marquis, said the deployment showed the government could not deny there was a ""staffing crisis"" in the NHS. ""The prime minister and others can no longer be dismissive of questions about the ability of NHS staff to deliver safe care,"" she said. Across the UK, about 1,800 armed forces personnel are supporting the NHS response to the pandemic. How is the NHS in my area coping this winter? Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? How many cases are there where I live? As of Friday morning, 16 hospital trusts in England were experiencing critical incidents - about one in eight of the total. A critical incident is declared when a trust is worried it might not be able to provide core priority services, such as emergency care. It means they can get extra help and draft staff in from other duties. Approximately 4% of staff at acute NHS trusts in England were off because of Covid each day during the week ending 2 January, latest figures show. That equates to 35,596 staff each day on average, up by 41% on the previous week. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive.

"Security forces in the Central Asian country of Kazakhstan say they have killed rioters while trying to restore order. Meanwhile, troops from neighbouring countries, including Russia, have been sent to help ""stabilise"" the situation. Kazakhstan restores internet after five-day outage Kazakhstan is a huge country, the size of Western Europe, situated in Central Asia and bordering Russia and China. Made up mostly of mountains and arid steppe land, it has a population of only 19 million people. It gained independence in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The country has some of the largest oil reserves in the world. It produces 1.6 million barrels a day and has attracted billions of dollars in foreign investment. However, the wealth has not trickled down to the population, who have an average income of less than Â£2,500 a year. For nearly three decades following independence, the country was run by Nursultan Nazarbayev - a former Communist Party politburo member with strong links to Russian President Vladimir Putin. President Nazarbayev focused on economic reform while resisting moves to introduce more democracy. Public protests in Kazakhstan are illegal without a government permit, andprevious strikes and demonstrations were dealt with very harshly. The president erected statues of himself and built a new capital, Astana, which was later renamed Nur-Sultan in his honour. Mr Nazarbayev stood down in 2019, making way for the current president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. Demonstrations started on 2 January in the town of Zhanaozen, an oil hub and the site of deadly clashes between protesters and police just over 10 years ago. Protests then spread across the rest of the country. The information ministry says that 44 deaths have been confirmed (it earlier put the number at 164 but then claimed this was a ""technical mistake""). The security forces say rioters were killed in Almaty during clashes. Police say protesters tried to take control of police stations and government buildings in the city. President Tokayev said ""20,000 bandits"" had attacked the city. He said many were Islamic militants who had been trained abroad, although he did not name any specific groups. Nationwide, about 1,000 people have reportedly been injured, with 400 being treated in hospital. More than 8,000 people have been detained, according to the Kazakh government. Curfews have been declared and mass gatherings banned. The protests began when the government lifted its price cap on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Many Kazakhs converted their cars to use LPG because it was cheaper than other fuel. However, the government said the price cap was leading to LPG shortages and it could no longer afford to boost supplies. Its decision to remove the cap virtually doubled the price. A statue of former leader Nursultan Nazarbayev The rioters also appear to have other grievances. Some chanted the name of Mr Nazarbayev and tried to tear down a bronze statue of him. After stepping down as president, Mr Nazarbayev continued to hold a strong position in government as head of Kazakhstan's Security Council. He also appeared to be groominghis daughter Dariga as a future leader, according to observers.,external To placate the protesters,Mr Nazarbayev has been removed from his post,external. Another former national security boss, Karim Masimov, has been arrested and charged with treason. There seems to have been a power struggle taking place within during the time of the riots between President Tokayev and allies of his predecessor, according to Ben Godwin, head of analysis at Prism Political Risk Management. Russian paratroopers have been sent to Kazakhstan at the request of its president to help ""stabilise"" the country. They were sent under the authority of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) - a group of countries comprising Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, which was set up after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It's thought 2,500 soldiers have been deployed, from across the CSTO's member states but mostly from Russia. The CSTO says the troops are a peacekeeping force which will protect state and military installations such as gas pipelines, Russian military bases and the Russian space station at Baikonur. Russia is keen to protect its assets in Kazakhstan such as the Baikonur Cosmodrome Kazakhstan's National Security Committee says the situation in Almaty has stabilised and that security forces have restored control. As a concession, the government has delayed removing its price cap on LPG - ordering the prices of all vehicle fuel to be regulated for six months. Ministers have also been sacked. President Tokayev said the government had failed to carry out ""one of its main tasks -  keeping inflation in check"". However, according to Godwin, protests may continue for longer in Zhanaozen, which has a history of anti-government strikes and demonstrations.

"US politicians remembered the Capitol riot one year on, with President Joe Biden blaming Donald Trump Trump ""created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election"" in the lead-up to the attack, Biden said Trump responded with unsubstantiated claims about the election and saying Biden is destroying the nation Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in Congress, paid tribute to police officers who confronted the mob The mother of Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was killed that day, said her daughter was ""publicly executed"" Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on 6 January 2021 in a bid to halt certification of Biden's election win Edited by Jessica Murphy A candlelit vigil was held on the steps of Capitol Hill to cap off the day Night has fallen in Washington, and speeches marking the anniversary of the attack on Congress are wrapping up. The day began with Biden condemning Trump for his ""web of lies"" about the 2020 vote that led to the violence at the Capitol. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi led lawmakers on Capitol Hill in a moment of silence, and expressed hope that Americans would turn to their âbetter angelsâ. Most Republicans left Washington, and accused Democrats of politicising the attack. The day ended with a prayer and candlelit vigil. Today's reporting was by Sam Cabral, Bernd Debusmann, Robin Levinson-King, Sophie Williams and Max Matza. Lewis was a civil rights leader before becoming a congressman We've heard a lot today about the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a law that Democrats are proposing to require states with a history of discriminatory voting laws to obtain federal approval before enacting changes to election laws or practices. Last November, the law failed to pass the Senate for a fourth time that year amid overwhelming opposition from Republicans. Earlier today Vice-President Kamala Harris, who broke barriers last year as the first black woman to hold that office, tweeted her support for the bill. ""We cannot sit on the sidelines. We must unite in defence of our democracy,"" she wrote. Next week Biden will travel to Atlanta - where Lewis was from - to give a speech calling for the act to be passed. He has hinted that he may opt for the radical step of ending the filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes for legislation to pass the Senate. Republicans have warned of a âscorched-earthâ response should Democrats go there. Democrats are also hoping to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, which would establish national standards for postal and early voting. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. ""When you think things can't get any worse, this happened? What a way to start the new year!"" That's what Rom thought as he watched the chaos unfold one year ago. A former US Marine who twice voted for Donald Trump, Rom is among a minority of Republican voters who accept the 2020 election results and view Joe Biden as the legitimate president. He strongly disapproved of the riot at the US Capitol and says political violence is unacceptable in a representative democracy like the US, but he does not assign any blame to Trump for what happened, instead calling it the work of ""a few bad apples"". Rom is also disappointed that the incident has been ""politicised by one side for their own benefit, far more than it needed to be"". ""I absolutely was stunned by what happened on January 6, but I was just as stunned throughout 2020 when riots were happening on a nightly basis across the country and nobody was doing anything to stop them,"" he says. Illinois Congressman Mike Quigley recalled the ""quintessential heartfelt moment that I was involved with personally"" on the day of the riot. While fleeing the approaching mob, he said he heard congresswoman Pramila Jayapal express concern she was walking too slowly because of the cane she was using that day. Quigley recalls that another Illinois lawmaker, Brad Schneider, overheard her remark and came back to accompany her, saying: ""Then let's all just walk together."" ""I was never more proud at that moment to walk alongside any of you. It reminds me that we have to walk alongside and help guide our country away from darkness."" At a vigil outside the Capitol, members of Congress and citizens alike said a silent prayer, while the Baltimore Urban Inspiration Choir sang Amazing Grace. Presiding Bishop Michael Curry of the Episcopal Church said a prayer for the nation as a whole to heal. ""We come before you because we need your help. We need your help in these troubled times. We need your help for this beloved nation,"" he said. ""We need your help for those who have been traumatised and troubled by the painful events of one year ago and all that has continued since."" Ohio Congresswoman Joyce Beatty recalled that 6 January was her first day as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. She said: ""I listened as my young staffers called their parents in a state of terror. Asking me, 'Are we going to die? Will we make it out of this alive?'"" She went on to remember the ""banging"" of a lawmaker on her office door. He was desperately searching for ""a place of refuge"", she said. ""For hours we waited, we prayed for safety,"" said Beatty. She added that she was comforted by the presence of congresswoman Val Demings, a police veteran. Democrats are now holding an outdoor candlelit vigil outside the Capitol building. The speeches are continuing on a less sombre note than earlier, with Democrats coming to the stage to cheers from the audience. They are calling for Democratic priorities to be enacted, including a change to voting rules that they argue are urgently needed in light of Trump's efforts to undermine the 2020 vote. Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent The Capitol is largely a Republican-free zone today, but two of the most vociferous outriders for former President Trump were here. In a small room on the fifth floor of the Cannon Building, 40 of us crammed in with camera crews and photographers to await House members Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz. They arrived: he in a dark suit, she in a sleeveless dress. What happened on 6 January last year was something orchestrated by the FBI and the CIA, they claimed. All was couched in fairly reasonable tones; they didnât raise their voices, there was no finger wagging. I raise the case of Robert Scott Palmer. He has the honour of receiving the longest jail term so far from the FBI inquiry (63 months for hurling a fire extinguisher at a police officer). Was he an undercover federal agent, I ask? ""Weâre not interested in the facts of individual cases,"" Gaetz tells me. ""I donât know about that,"" says Taylor Greene. I try a couple more times, but despite spending most of their press conference talking about getting to the facts, these are facts they are not interested in discussing. Such are the parallel universes that Americans inhabit today - it is difficult to see right now what exactly is holding the nation together. California congressman Adam Schiff said he was not focused on the ""growing mass of rioters"" outside the building last year, because his attention was absorbed by a speech he was preparing to give on the House floor. ""It was not until our leadership was swiftly removed from the chamber and police announced that we needed to take out our gas masks that I understood the full extent of the danger,"" he said at an event for lawmakers to share their memories of that day. ""When the order came to evacuate, I stayed behind for a while until two Republicans came up to me. ""One of them said: 'You can't let them see you. I know these people. I can talk to these people. I can talk my way through these people. You're in a whole different category.'"" Schiff thanked the police officers who kept lawmakers safe during the riot. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. Simon became a US citizen in 2020 and cast his first vote - reluctantly - for Joe Biden. He felt fear and dread during the Trump years, almost as if he was back in war-torn northern Uganda, where he grew up. He says the the scale of the Capitol riots should be ""shocking for anyone who cares about democracy"". ""If people in America do not believe an election is free and fair, what other nations can believe in democracy again?"" he asks. A small-business owner and father of two children, Simon is gravely concerned that what happened a year ago is far from an isolated incident. ""Between social media disinformation and the dissatisfaction among voters, we have folks who live on a different planet right now,"" he says. ""You cannot govern people who do not believe you are legitimate, and a big faction of Americans do not believe they can be governed by this administration."" US Democrats have been sharing their recollections of the 6 January riot as they mark its anniversary. Among those who spoke was Washington state Democrat Pramila Jayapal, who recalled preparing to
use a cane to âfight backâ if she was attacked by the mob. Jayapal warned that she
believes the âdanger is still clear and it is still presentâ. âOur Democracy is very fragile,
and the cult of the âbig lieâ is still very in action,â she said, referring to unsubstantiated
claims from former President Trump that mass voter fraud swayed the 2020 election. Jayapal added that she believes
it is âcritically importantâ those responsible for the riot â including Trump, she said â be held accountable. Another congresswoman, New
Jersey Democrat and long-time Navy veteran Mikie Sherrill, said she witnessed âso
many acts of courageâ during the riot, including hearing fellow representatives calling their family and behaving with ""calm and dignity"" as the crowd entered the Capitol. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio
Democrat, remembered moments of chaos as she sheltered with her young aides. âReflecting on the moments
of terror and tragedy, and a Confederate flag being flown in the United States
Capitol, and Capitol Police officers putting their lives at risk for us, I am
reminded on the advancements that weâve made as a nation. Today we stand
strong,â she said. Republican lawmakers were conspicuous by their absence, and none of the party's leaders participated in today's events. Representative Pramila Jayapal taking cover during the 6 January riot. A number of US lawmakers
have named Capitol Police officer Billy Evans as a victim of the 6 January riot
â despite the fact he was killed in an unrelated incident in April 2020. US President Joe Biden, for
example, invoked Evansâ name in his speech marking the 6 January anniversary, saying ""he lost his life defending the Capitol"". Similarly, Ohio congressman
Tim Ryan included Evans on a list of officers who died âin the weeks and monthsâ
after 6 January, while Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said in a statement
that Evans and his colleagues' actions on that day âwill stand as a shining
example of heroism and braveryâ. Evans, however, was killed
three months after the 6 January riot when a car crashed into a security
barrier and the driver lunged at the officer with a knife. Here is the BBC's storyabout the 2 April 2021 attack. The suspect, a 25-year-old Indiana man, was shot dead. No police officer was killed on the day of the Capitol riot. Officer Brian
Sicknick died of natural causes a day later after suffering two strokes. Capitol Police officer Billy Evans was killed in an April attack. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. As a proud 'Latino for Trump', Gabriel attended the 6 January rally near the US Capitol in ""a genuine show of support"" for the outgoing president. He says he went back to his hotel, never saw the riot itself and avoided the area thereafter. ""What I saw were people who were extremely disappointed that Republicans failed them. That's why a lot of people had showed up,"" he tells the BBC. ""We pride ourselves on being the party of critical thinking, common sense and responsibility. There was a select minority that had no regard for that and expressed some sort of horrible herd mentality,"" he continues. Gabriel - a founding member of the New York Young Republicans' Hispanic Caucus - feels that the focus of the past year has been less on justice and more about persecuting Trump supporters. ""People need to stop saying that this is our generationâs 9/11,"" he stresses. ""The comparison is extremely disingenuous and egregious. Close to 3,000 Americans died on 9/11 and it sparked a 20-year war on terror."" We've heard a lot of praise today from lawmakers for Capitol Police officers, but one congressman is putting his money where his mouth is. Minnesota representative Dean Phillips has been giving out free lunches to police officers and other Capitol Hill staff members who protected lawmakers during the riot. Shrai PopatBBC News, Washington Erin Little and Trevor Valenti Erin Little and Trevor Valenti from Rhode Island were working at the same restaurant when rioters seized the Capitol last year. They remember watching the events unfold alongside their patrons in disbelief. âIt made everyone around the world think that America is lost,â Valenti said. âI think the world still considers us a laughing stock,â Little added.  Sonia Nussencweig-Hotimsky Those from further afield spoke to the BBC about Americaâs place on 
the international stage as they watched the Capitol riot unfold from 
their home countries. Sonia Nussencweig-Hotimsky, visiting Washington from Sao Paulo, Brazil, called the riot âan abuse of 
democracyâ that has emboldened more conspiratorial attacks globally.  Nicolas Posada And
 for Nicolas Posada, from Bogota, Colombia, the siege on the Capitol resembled infamous coups that have been seen in Latin America. âThe
 US has always been the country everyone is looking up to,â he said. 
âBut it stopped being that on that day.â US representatives Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene, both vocal Trump supporters, just spoke at an event billed as a ""Republican response"" to the main events marking today's anniversary. Gaetz, a Florida congressman, said the riot may have been a âFedsurrectionâ incited by federal
agents and informants. They played videos of individuals encouraging the crowd of rioters, questioning why they had not been arrested, and calling for a counter-investigation into federal informants. The FBI, which is leading the investigation into the Capitol riot, has not so far acknowledged that any of its agents or informants incited or took part in the attack on Congress. Gaetz and Greene, a Georgia congresswoman, have described the dozens of inmates being held in Washington DCâs
jail in connection with the riot as âpolitical prisonersâ. Speaking on a podcast hosted
by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon earlier in the day, Gaetz said the ex-president's supporters
âare ashamed of nothingâ and âproud of the workâ on 6 January 2021. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. James is a lifelong Republican who refused to vote for Donald Trump. His vote for Joe Biden in 2020 was the first time he ever cast his presidential ballot for a Democrat. After watching the siege at the Capitol unfold on national television, he wrote to his local Republican Party, begging them to condemn what had happened. ""Your committee is in part responsible for the violence,"" his letter said. ""If you still believe the Trump disinformation, then you should go join a proper cult instead of continuing to destroy the Republican Party from within."" For James, the shock from a year ago has not dissipated and he fears that more violence may come. ""There's a shift in the country with all the misinformation that is promulgated on the internet,"" he tells the BBC. He hopes his party will stop listening to Trump and ""the madness will end at some point"". ""These things go in cycles. The current situation is just so crazy it can't maintain itself."" One of those who died in the riot was Ashli Babbitt, an unarmed woman who was shot by police while trying to storm the House of Representatives. Her mother has been seen speaking to conservative media outlets outside of Congress. ""She was a patriot. She served this country her whole adult life,"" Micki Witthoeft told the Alabama-based Right Side Broadcasting Network. Babbitt, a US Air Force veteran, ""came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election"", Witthoeft said. ""She felt like that was her last time to hear him speak. Little did we know that'd be her last time to hear anybody speak after she was murdered by a careless, reckless Capitol Police officer."" ""My daughter was publicly executed,"" she added, with Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene by her side. Babbitt, who operated a pool cleaning business in California, was not the only person to die that day. Two others died from natural causes related to cardiovascular disease and another succumbed to a drug overdose. Keith Scott attended the pro-Trump protest outside Congress last year and has returned again today Former President Donald Trump has released a second statement to follow up on one he made shortly after President Biden's morning speech. This latest continues to focus on unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. ""To watch Biden speaking is very hurtful to many people,"" the statement begins. ""They're [the Democrats] the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election."" Using Biden's words from this morning, Trump accuses Democrats of spreading a ""web of lies"" about suspected Russian meddling in 2016, the election he won against Hillary Clinton. He says Americans are ""aggrieved"" because of inflation, the Afghan pull-out, and rising crime. ""America is a laughingstock of the world, and it's all because of the real insurrection,"" Trump says, calling for voters to ""work with me to fix this horror that Joe Biden and the Democrats have brought us"".  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played Then and now: Kevin McCarthy on Trump and Capitol riot Few better exemplify the shifting attitudes of Republican politicians toward Donald Trump since 6 January, from criticism to renewed embrace, than House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. The man who hopes to become House Speaker if Republicans take control of the chamber next January condemned the then-president in the days after the 6 January attacks.Now he claims Trump as a close allyâ one whose support probably will be essential if McCarthy wants to realise his political ambitions. It took some time for most Republicans to come to the realisation that if they wanted to stay in the good graces of the rank-and-file of their party - and advance their political careers - they would have to continue to stand by the former president. A year after the Capitol attack, however, that understanding appears to have fully set in, as one by one Trump's critics have changed their tune or been ushered out of power. Â© 2025 BBC.

That's a little unfair on Chris Silverwood, Lee. The rest and rotation policy was an ECB wide strategy with Ashley Giles and Mo Bobat.

Be rude of me to not share the highlights of Jonny Bairstow's century again at this point... I don't think anyone will ever be able to doubt Jonny Bairstow's passion... He loves playing for England.

That's a little unfair on Chris Silverwood, Lee. The rest and rotation policy was an ECB wide strategy with Ashley Giles and Mo Bobat. If anything I imagine Silverwood regularly wanted his best players around, but they are not robots. They can't play in every single game. #bbccricket Lee Welsh:I presume weâll send Bairstow home now, as part of Siverwoodâs rest and rotation policy? Ben Stokes struggled throughout his innings with the left side strain that he picked up while bowling yesterday. He looked OK on the drive, but any pulls and sweeps caused him a lot of discomfort. In true Stokes fashion he battled through it though, and played some remarkable shots, before falling for 66.

"On 6 January, 2021, people around the United States were shocked by images coming from the US Capitol. The pictures - many of which were captured by news agency photojournalists on hand to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's electoral win - depicted rioters trespassing in government offices, or roaming the Senate chamber, or assaulting police officers. This week, a House of Representatives select committee set up to investigate the events will begin public hearings aimed at piecing together what happened and who can be held accountable. While the committee can refer cases for prosecution, it is up to the Justice Department to determine if charges are actually filed. But for many of the rioters, the snaps taken that day have already come back to haunt them. To date, more than 810  have been arrested in nearly every US state and Washington DC. More than 60 so far have been sentenced to incarceration, with US officials vowing that more prosecutions are likely in the future. Investigators are seeking public help in identifying over 350 rioters, including 250 suspected of attacking police officers. Here are five of the most iconic pictures of rioters and what's happened to them since 6 January. Among the most widely shared images was that of Jacob Anthony Chansley, a 34-year old who referred to himself as the ""QAnon Shaman"". An ardent Trump supporter, Chansley was pictured wearing horns and a bearskin headdress during the riot, quickly becoming one of the most recognisable figures from the siege. Chansley was arrested just days after the riot. In November, he was sentenced to 41 months in prison for his involvement, in addition to 36 months of supervised release. In court, Chansley said he now believes it was ""wrong"" to enter the Capitol and that he hopes to ""evolve"". His sentence is one of the longest so far doled out to 6 January rioters. He is currently being held in a low-security federal prison in Arizona. Another rioter, 36-year-old Florida resident Adam Johnson, was famously pictured walking - wearing a Trump beanie - between guide ropes meant for tours at the Capitol. He was carrying a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House and posed in front of a painting depicting the surrender of British General John Burgoyne in the American Revolutionary War. Johnson, who was dubbed ""Podium Guy"" by social media users in the wake of the riot, was charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct and theft of government property just days later. In November, Johnson pleaded guilty to entering and remaining in a restricted building. The other charges were dropped by prosecutors in exchange for a guilty plea. Additionally, Johnson - who has expressed interest in writing a book - agreed to hand over any publishing profits to the government for a five-year period. Early this year, he was sentenced to 75 days in prison and was also fined $5,000 (Â£3,996). Ahead of his prison sentence, Johnson reportedly planned to host an ""Adam is going to prison"" party at a Florida restaurant. The event was eventually cancelled by the venue. ""Come help me celebrate my last Friday of freedom before I go to prison for the lamest charge in history,"" a Facebook page for the event read. Another Trump supporter, Richard Barnett, was pictured sitting with one boot on a desk in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The image of Mr Barnett - dressed in a baseball cap and chequered shirt - went viral, as did pictures of the notes he and others left on Mrs Pelosi's desk. Mr Barnett now faces multiple charges in connection with the riot, including obstruction of an official proceeding, entering a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon and disorderly conduct. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and in April rejected the government's offer of a plea deal. He is currently not in jail. Mr Barnett's trial is scheduled to begin on 6 September. A fourth rioter, Kevin Seefried, was photographed holding a Confederate battle flag while walking through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Mr Seefried and his son, Hunter, were arrested a week after the riot and hit with multiple charges, including violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol Grounds. The father-son duo is scheduled to begin a bench trial - in which their culpability will be determined by a judge, rather than a jury - on 13 June. Aaron Mostofsky, a Trump supporter, in the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 The son of a prominent and politically connected New York City judge, Aaron Mostofsky was famously pictured wearing a fur pelt as a ""caveman"" and holding a police riot shield and wooden stick inside the US Capitol during the 6 January riot. He told the New York Post he felt that supporters of President Trump ""were cheated"" in the election. ""I don't think 75 million people voted for Trump - I think it was close to 85 million,"" he told the newspaper. ""I think certain states that have been red for a long time turned blue and were stolen, like New York."" Mostofsky was arrested in New York six days after the riot and charged with multiple offences, including theft of government property, assaulting or impeding officers and disorderly conduct. In February, he pleaded guilty to one felony charge of civil disorder, as well as several misdemeanor charges. Three months later, he was sentenced to eight months in prison followed by 12 months of supervised release, including 200 hours of community service and $2,000 (Â£1,600) restitution.
