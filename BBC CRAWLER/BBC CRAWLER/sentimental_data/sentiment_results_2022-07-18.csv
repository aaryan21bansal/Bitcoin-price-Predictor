"The price of petrol has fallen from record highs, leading to reductions worth Â£1.50 per tank, according to the AA motoring group. Average pump prices are down to 188.76p per litre for petrol and 196.96p per litre for diesel. At the start of the month, prices were 191.53p for petrol and 199.07p for diesel. The AA said falling wholesale costs could lead to savings of Â£10 off a tank within a fortnight. Five tips for saving petrol money examined Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Petrol pricing is cause for concern, warns watchdog Refineries cash in as petrol prices soar Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine and moves to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian oil. With food and energy bills also surging, many households are under pressure. Wholesale petrol peaked above Â£1 per litre at the start of June, but dropped to below 80p per litre for much of last week. Wholesale prices have fallen as the price of oil has dropped back. Fears of a recession in the US have hit demand for oil, and the price of Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil - fell below $95 a barrel last week for the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman, said: ""Wholesale petrol's trajectory, if sustained, would lead to savings of a tenner off a tank from the record highs, providing the fuel trade is prepared to pass them on."" ""The problem is that, in many places, the price cuts are quite simply not happening despite more than six weeks of falling costs,"" he added. Earlier this month, the UK's competition watchdogsaid it would investigate petrol and diesel pricingafter it found ""cause for concern in some parts"" of the industry. The Competition and Markets Authority said it had discovered a sharp rise in prices once fuel had been processed by oil refineries. It also found ""significant differences in price"" between forecourts in ""many rural and urban areas"". However, it said retailers had passed on the 5p fuel duty cut to motorists. Part of the reason that petrol prices have surged is down to the high price of crude oil, which has been driven up by the war in Ukraine. David Cox, an independent energy analyst, warned that while oil prices may have come off their recent highs, they are likely to remain elevated due to the ongoing conflict. ""It's difficult to see how crude does anything but go up, while the war rages, and that's not good news in the medium term for petrol prices,"" he said. The loss of Russian supplies has stretched an industry which was already at full capacity, and it will be difficult to replace that supply, Mr Cox warned. ""The trouble is, you just can't replace the volume of oil that Russia produces,"" he said. He said even with efforts from the US to persuade Saudi Arabia to export more oil, the price was unlikely to shift back. ""There might be minor changes up and down, but essentially crude is likely to keep marching upwards and that will keep the pressure on petrol prices upwards too.""

"Tagg's Island is the site of what police describe as a ""tragedy"" A body has been recovered from the Thames after a search for a missing 14-year-old boy. The body, found about 15:30 BST, is believed to be that of the teenager, who entered the water at Tagg's Island in Hampton, west London, on Monday afternoon. Police, who have not named the boy, called off a search on Monday evening, praising those who tried to find him. The teenager's death follows a number of others in open water in recent days. A16-year-old boy died in Bray Lake near Maidenhead,Berkshire, a 13-year-old boy drownedwhen he got into difficulty in the River Tynein Northumberland on Sunday, and a16-year-old boy died in Salford Quays, Greater Manchester, on Saturday. Speaking after the search was called off, Supt Richard Smith from the Met's South West Command Unit said: ""Despite the very best efforts of all involved, we must now sadly conclude that this young boy has died."" He warned that what had happened demonstrated the ""terrible consequences"" of things going wrong and urged young people in particular to be ""the person in your group of friends who says no"". Police, fire crews and paramedics led the search of the Thames at Hampton London Fire Brigade's assistant commissioner Charlie Pugsley offered an additional warning to those tempted to swim in rivers during the heatwave.

"Katie Melua has said uncertainty over touring in Europe has cost her record sales The government should appoint a touring ""tsar"" to unravel the red tape facing British musicians in Europe, a cross-party group of MPs and peers has said. They would need to tackle the soaring costs of obtaining visas and transporting instruments that bands have encountered since Brexit. Some orchestras face bills of Â£5,000 every time they play abroad, said the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Music. It added the industry faced a ""crisis"" that required ""urgent"" action. The call came in a major report into the state of touring post-Brexit, which warned that musicians and their crew were ""facing more costs, more complications and getting fewer opportunities"" since the UK left the EU at the end of January 2020. ""It's over two years since Brexit, yet there is still a mountain of red tape,"" said Labour MP Kevin Brennan, who chairs the all-party group. ""Ultimately, it's a self-inflicted wound that doesn't have to be there."" In response, a spokesperson said the government was ""supporting the UK's brilliant musicians to adapt to the new arrangements and make touring easier"". Rock band White Lies became painfully aware of the situation in April. The group, who have a huge live following in Europe, had to cancel the first date of their 2022 tour, after their equipment was caught up in border checks at Dover. ""It was a real disaster,"" drummer Jack Lawrence-Brown recalled. ""Our truck containing all of our equipment and all of the lights and the stage for the show got stuck in an enormous two or three-day-long queue - and there was no chance of the driver getting onto a boat in time to make the show happen, which was pretty devastating."" White Lies criticised the ""painful and unworkable"" regulations facing UK musicians Lawrence-Brown said the band built extra time into their schedule to account for any post-Brexit delays, but it still wasn't enough. ""I just don't know how a newer band, with less resources than us, would ever cope with that kind of situation,"" he added. ""We can just about shrug it off financially, but on a European tour we need every show to happen really for it to be a success. And as soon as you pull a show, it loses us money, so it was a big dampener to start a seven week tour without the first show."" UK stars urge action over post-Brexit touring Musicians fear being priced out of European tours Sir Elton John fears musicians face 'catastrophe' The impact on new bands was also raised by Sir Elton John, who told the All-Party Parliamentary Group that the government had squandered a ""golden opportunity"" to fix the issues around touring during the Covid lockdown. ""While some progress has been made that opportunity has been allowed to slip,"" he said in a written statement. ""The heartbeat and future of our vibrant industry face finding themselves stranded in Dover through no fault of their own."" Last year, more than 200 artists including Radiohead, Rick Astley and Little Mix launched a campaign called #LetTheMusicMove, which argued that restrictions on touring Europe ""threaten the future success of British music"" and could result in the ""collapse of the industry"". Singer Katie Melua told the campaign she had turned down several European TV appearances due to uncertainty over travel restrictions. ""Naturally, this has an impact on streaming numbers and physical record sale figures,"" she added. Elton John has led calls for government action on the issue The live music business is estimated to employ 30,000 people in the UK. British artists play four times as many gigs in the EU as the US; and it is estimated that 80% of the touring buses that operate across the UK and Europe are based on British shores. The new report, also called Let The Music Move, said the bureaucracy that has sprung up since Brexit was ""clogging the arteries of the sector"" and was ""hampering the competitiveness"" of British bands. It was authored by a cross-party group of more than 100 MPs and members of the House of Lords, whose recommendations included: The appointment of a ""Touring Tsar"" to steer the Government's response to the crisis. Working with the EU to create a Cultural Touring Agreement that would exempt musicians and their crew from red tape. The creation of a temporary support fund to help the industry deal with increased costs. An expansion of the number of border points where goods passports and music instrument certificates can be checked. Mr Brennan said that musicians hadn't been a ""big enough priority"" for the government. ""Although it's true that it [touring] has become a little bit easier in some countries than it was immediately after Brexit, it's still an extremely complicated and patchy picture,"" he told BBC News. ""Musicians have faced this cacophony of bureaucracy, of different bits of government, trying to sort out different problems that have arisen from us leaving the European Union without a comprehensive settlement for touring musicians and other artists. ""So our report says there needs to be someone at the heart of government, who's in charge of sorting all these things out."" In a statement to the BBC, a government spokesperson said: ""Following our engagement, 24 EU member states including the biggest touring markets such as Spain, France, Germany and the Netherlands have confirmed they offer visa and work permit-free routes for UK performers and other creative professionals. ""We continue to engage with the few remaining countries which do not offer visa or work permit-free routes."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Russia has hit Google with a 21.1bn rouble ($373m; Â£301m) fine for failing to restrict access to ""prohibited"" material about the war in Ukraine and other content. Roskomnadzor, the country's communications regulator, said the information included ""fake"" reports that discredited Russia's military and posts urging people to protest. It called the US tech giant a ""systematic"" violator of its laws. Google did not comment immediately. The company's local subsidiary declared bankruptcy last month. The move came after Russian authorities seized its local bank account, allowing them to recover 7.2bn roubles that the firm had been ordered to pay for similar reasons last year. In recent years, Russia has been ramping up pressure on tech firms, accusing them of not moderating their content properly, and interfering in the country's internal affairs. How Russia tries to censor Western social media The efforts to control social media and other news sites have escalated following the invasion of Ukraine in February. The government also passed a law threatening people who spread ""fake"" information about the war with 15 years in prison. In March, Google, owned by Alphabet, stopped offering its commercial services in Russia, such as advertising. It has also stepped up its restrictions for news accounts backed by Russia and relocated staff. However, unlike some other social media sites, such as Facebook, it has not been completely banned in Russia, where many smart phones rely on the company's technology. In March, Alphabet said the decision to continue offering search, maps and YouTube provided Russians with access to ""global information and perspectives"". The fine announced on Monday,external, which was calculated as a share of the firm's local revenue, marks the biggest penalty ever imposed on a tech company in Russia, according to state media.

"A 50 kilowatt-class laser mounted on a US Army Stryker vehicle A European hub for high-energy laser weaponry is to be based in Livingston, Scotland, a big defence firm has said. Raytheon UK said the ""advanced laser integration centre"" would open next year and would help meet growing demand for laser weapons designed to destroy small attack drones. The firm said the war in Ukraine had highlighted the threat they posed. The centre will focus on the testing, fielding and maintenance of defensive high-energy laser (HEL) weapons. Raytheon's anti-drone lasers are small enough to be fitted to military vehicles. Last year, Raytheon was awarded a demonstrator contract to provide a high-energy laser weapon system to the UK Ministry of Defence, to beinstalled on the UK Wolfhound land vehicle,,externalthe company said. It claims that ""demand is spiking for cost-effective lasers"" able to defeat ""asymmetric"" threats from drones, rockets and mortars. Small commercial drones, which the weapons are designed to defend against, havedemonstrated their military effectiveness in Ukraine,directing and correcting artillery fire and, in some cases, being modified to carry explosives. Speaking from the Farnborough Airshow, Annabel Flores, Raytheon's president of electronic warfare systems, told the BBC some of the additional interest and demand for the technology was as a result of how drones had been used in the conflict. ""The thought is coming into how do you defend against them effectively, making our ongoing conversations with customers much deeper and much more pronounced,""  she said. HEL weapons had advantages she added, particularly the cost per shot. While military ordnance can be very expensive, drones and quadcopters are in the Â£84 range, she said. Once connected to a power supply, she said, the system could keep running. However, the weapons do not resemble the lasers of popular sci-fi, as their drone-destroying beams are invisible. ""Hollywood makes it look very, very interesting and very dramatic. And this is a little different. It can look a little anti-climactic,"" Ms Flores said. Raytheon says the laser system has 20,000 hours of operational use, but Ms Flores would not be drawn on whether the system had been ""used in anger"" yet. The site of the planned hub Initially the number of jobs created by the new centre is likely to be small, but could increase to potentially ""hundreds of jobs"". That will depend on many factors of course, but the company believes that high-energy lasers could make up as much as 30% of of future air defence infrastructure. While the firm would not be drawn on how much it would ultimately invest - citing pending financial results - it has already spent about Â£20m developing the Livingston site, the BBC understands. It said the announcement was a ""statement of faith""  in both the UK's engineering sector and the important nature of the technology.

"Jeremy Hartwell appeared in the second series of Netflix dating show Love Is Blind A contestant on the second series of Netflix show Love Is Blind is suing the streaming service over alleged breaches of labour laws. Jeremy Hartwell alleges that producers encouraged the cast to drink alcohol, while limiting access to food and water and underpaying them. Production company Kinetic Contenttold Variety,externalthere was ""absolutely no merit"" to Mr Hartwell's allegations. ""We will vigorously defend the claims,"" a spokesman added. Netflix have also been contacted by the BBC for comment. The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles, names both Netflix and Kinetic Content as defendants alongside Kinetic's casting company Delirium TV. In Love Is Blind, the contestants meet their dates but are unable to see each other and have to converse solely through speakers. The candidates then couple up but must get engaged before they are allowed to meet face-to-face. Some couples end up marrying on-screen while others break up. Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed married after meeting on the first series and are still together Mr Hartwell told CNN,externalin an interview at the weekend that he had to try to fight the effects of sleep deprivation after long hours filming under bright lights. He said he could not access food and water, but alcohol was available and even encouraged to be consumed on an empty stomach. Mr Hartwell added that the way the cast's luggage was searched was reminiscent of being on a ""boot camp"". The lawsuit,obtained by People,,externalclaims the cast were ""regularly refused timely food and water... while on set, severely restricting the availability of hydration opportunities. ""Even at the hotel living quarters, food was restricted to the point of severe hunger."" According to the lawsuit, the contestants should have been treated as employees rather than independent contractors under California state law because producers made all the decisions about the nature of the cast's work and how many hours they worked. Hartwell's lawsuit reportedly seeks unpaid wages plus financial compensation for missed meal breaks and rest periods, as well as unspecified monetary damages for unfair business practices and civil penalties for labour code violations. According to Kinetic, which is also behind Married at First Sight, Hartwell was in the show for less than a week ""after he failed to develop a significant connection with any other participant"". ""While we will not speculate as to his motives for filing the lawsuit, there is absolutely no merit to Mr. Hartwell's allegations, and we will vigorously defend against his claims,"" their statement read. Love Is Blind was nominated for an Emmy award - outstanding structured reality programme - last week. The ceremony takes place in September.

"Inflation will be brought back under control by the government, Nadhim Zahawi said in his first speech as chancellor. The government will deliver ""sound public finances"" to help achieve that, Mr Zahawi said. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 40-year high of 9.1% and expected to rise further by the autumn. In his speech, Mr Zahawi set out aims for a post-Brexit shake up of financial services regulation. The priorities include changing regulation ""so that UK insurers have more flexibility to invest in long-term assets like infrastructure"". Mr Zahawi was appointed chancellor earlier this month following the resignation of Rishi Sunak and during a period of political upheaval that eventually led to the resignation of Boris Johnson as leader of the Conservative Party. He stood for the party leadership but failed to attract enough support. In his Mansion House speech on Tuesday, Mr Zahawi said that despite the ""short-term uncertainty"" he would focus on providing ""stability, reassurance and continuity"". While the cost of living looms large over every decision made by the new chancellor, however long his stay is at Number 11, the main point of the Mansion House speech is to push a plan to repeal hundreds of pieces of retained EU law. The aim is to reform, in particular, EU solvency laws for insurers that the chancellor argues restricts the flexibility to invest in long-term infrastructure. This continues Rishi Sunak's agenda for the Bank of England to promote the growth and competitiveness of the financial services industry. Some fears were expressed that such moves could see more risks taken with financial stability. And a new Finance Bill is thought to contain more power for the government to overrule some Bank of England regulatory decisions. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey also addressed the same City audience, and they are keen to hear from both men, amid fears about a rapidly slowing economy, about exactly how inflation will be brought back under control. Official figures released last week showed the economy grew faster than expected in May, by 0.5%, after shrinking in April and March. However, businesses are reporting that higher running costs are leading them to put up prices for customers. And with household disposable incomes set to fall further in the autumn when energy prices are set to rise again, some economists say there still a risk the economy could fall into a recession. Cutting UK taxes now would be a mistake, says IMF UK economy grows but fears remain over high prices UK inflation hits 40-year high as food prices jump Mr Zahawi set out three core priorities in his speech - controlling inflation; creating the conditions for a private sector recovery; and a ""post-Brexit vision"" for financial services. He said the government would concentrate on ""delivering sound public finances to avoid pushing up demand still further, providing help for households as they deal with the worst price rises in over a generation"". ""And, where we can, easing the supply constraints that are the underlying cause of high inflation."" Regarding financial services, Mr Zahawi said that Brexit would allow opportunities for the financial services industry. He committed to repealing ""hundreds of pieces of retained EU law and replacing them with a coherent and agile approach to financial regulation that is right for us"". Labour's Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Tulip Siddiq, said: ""All we have here are more woolly promises from a chancellor whose central pledge so far has been to ransack public services and provide a plethora of unfunded tax cuts. ""It has been six years since the Brexit vote, and the government still has nothing to offer the City other than rhetoric, empty promises and desperate threats to undermine the independence of our world-leading financial services regulators."" Mick McAteer, a former board member of the UK's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, said the government seemed ""intent on bringing in measures that will seriously compromise the independence"" of regulators. He told the BBC that proposals requiring regulators to promote the competitiveness of the City of London around the world would put pressure on them to reduce regulations, which was ""really bad news"" for consumer protection and the economy. Responding to Chancellor's speech, David Postings, Chief Executive of UK Finance, said: ""The Chancellor's vision in his Mansion House speech is for the UK to have a strong and internationally competitive banking and finance sector, which we strongly welcome. ""To ensure the sector continues to be successful, alongside maintaining the pace of reform, there needs to be a keen focus on international competitiveness from the next government,"" he added.

Anational emergency has been declaredacross the UK due to the hot weather. Some trains have been cancelled as temperatures soared, with Network Rail saying in serious casesrailway tracks could buckle in extreme heat. The Met Office records data from 45 weather stations spread out across Wales - with 26 of them automatically taking the temperature every hour. Earlier on Monday, a provisional new record in Wales was set at Gogerddan near Aberystwyth (35.3C) but this was still a few degrees cooler than the UK record of 38.7C set in Cambridge in 2019. By 16:00 BST, Hawarden had its Welsh daily record back. Forecasters had already warned that the heatwave could push the mercury to record levels either on Monday or Tuesday in both Wales andacross the UK. For the first time, a red extreme heat warning has been issued for the UK - covering large parts of England including London, Manchester, Birmingham and York on Monday and Tuesday - with predictions that temperatures could hit 41C (106F). The Met Office's amber extreme heat alerts, which cover the whole of Wales, will also run until Tuesday night. Aiden McGivern, Met Office meteorologist said an ""extraordinary area of very hot air"" moved in from Spain and Portugal. ""It has peaked across Wales, I think overnight it starts to cool from the west while other parts of UK turn even hotter from Tuesday,"" he said. ""People struggle to cool down but overnight it's also a problem, it will be very warm tonight and it could be Wales' warmest night on record."" In Hawarden mum Emma Hughes, from Ewloe, Flintshire, was out with 15-month-old daughter Poppy, five-year-old son Leo, and her mother Liz Fenlon. Ms Hughes said they were keeping cool with ice creams, paddling pools and air conditioning in the house. She said she had stayed out of the heat at home on Sunday. Emma Hughes, son Leo, daughter Poppy and her mother Liz Fenlon were keeping cool with ice creams, paddling pools and air conditioning in the house ""We just made sure there was plenty of shade for the children and spent a lot more time inside than we probably would have normally,"" she added. ""We've just come out because it is lovely and cool here for some lunch and just popped out for an ice cream."" Ms Fenlon said it was too hot but ice cream was helping. John Selby, from Liverpool, and partner Jean Curran, from Chester, both love hot weather John Selby, from Liverpool, and partner Jean Curran, from Chester, both love hot weather.

Welsh government health officials said the Met Office's amber extreme heat warning ""needed to be taken seriously"" as it could be mean a danger to life or potential serious illness from the scorching temperatures. An aerial view during low tide in the Carew River which runs alongside Carew Castle Wales' deputy chief medical officer Chris Jones toldBBC Radio Walespeople may need to ""change some of their plans"" in the coming days. Health officials have told schools that children should avoid vigorous physical activity in extreme heat and ""maximise shade and ventilation"" while pupils should wear loose, light-coloured clothing if possible, wear hats outdoors and drink plenty of water. People who may be temped to cool off in rivers and lakes are beingwarned to be careful of the dangers of open water,externalwhile burn specialists have stressed the importance of usingsunscreenthat has been bought this year. The Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery in Swansea are already seeing an increase in children being treated or refereed to the specialist unit at Morriston Hospital with severe sunburn. ""Burning your skin causes increases your risk of skin cancer later on in life,"" said paediatric specialist nurse Louise Scannell. ""And once you've reached the age of 18, if you've had a significant sunburn then the damage is done and could increase your risk of skin cancer in later life. So it's really important to apply sun cream."" She also warned sunscreen is less effective if it was opened last year and was beyond its best before date. How does sunscreen work? Sunburn warning as Wales prepares for extreme heat Why sunscreen is not enough to prevent sunburns ""People are bringing out sun creams from last year which, once they are opened, should be disposed of and not used the following year,"" added Ms Scannell. Pembrokeshire fire fighters were dealing with a grass fire above Newgale, in very hot conditions More than 50,000 people are expected every day at the four-day Royal Welsh Show - one of Europe's biggest agricultural events - and organisers have been told by public health bodies to prepare for the extreme heat. The Royal Welsh Show is a significant date in Wales' cultural calendar The Royal Welsh's chief vet Dafydd Jones admitted the forecast for the show near Builth Wells in Powys was ""worrying"". ""Animals suffer like people - if not worse - in extreme heat and with so many animals there, it is very worrying that animals will find it difficult to cope with the heat,"" he toldBBC Radio Cymru. Organisers have spent more than Â£50,000 on extra fans and ventilation in livestock sheds to keep the approximate 8,000 animals as cool as possible while extra water will be available. This video can not be played The Royal Welsh Show finds ways to keep animals safe during the heatwave Head of operations Mared Jones said organisers had ""risen to the occasion"" in tackling the expected heat, adding: ""Please come prepared, and wear appropriate clothing, that would be my message to visitors.

Swimmers cooled down in Llyn Padarn in Llanberis, Gwynedd, as temperatures soared A family day out at Aberporth in Ceredigion Port Eynon, Gower Some pigs at the four-day Royal Welsh Show that starts on Monday will be lathered in sunscreen Some pig owners will lather their animals in sunscreen to protect their animals from getting sunburnt while award-winning pig farmer Ela Mair will be covering her six entrants - including five pedigree Welsh pigs - in cold wet towels to keep them cool. ""Pigs don't let out the heat as well as other animals so it is difficult to keep them cool,"" said the 45-year-old who has a farm near Pwllheli in Gwynedd. ""We put cold wet towels over them but we need to be careful that the heat doesn't dry the towels too quickly so it can reheat them. ""So we'll be keeping them in the shade as much as possible and keeping the fans on them as much as we can."" Geraint and Sue Richards are expecting their ice creams to be in high demand Sue and Geraint Richards, who run Basil and Rusty's ice cream parlour in Machen, Caerphilly, are hoping to keep people cool at the show. ""After three years away (because of Covid), it feels like you're coming home again, it's massively important, the show is one big family,"" Mr Richards toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. This video can not be played Why is it so hot (in under 60 seconds)? Chief executive Steve Hughson hasasked people,externalto ""be careful, wear sun cream and hats and use the shade"" when visiting the 150-acre Llanelwedd site. Animal charity RSPCA warned pet-owners to take extra precautions tokeep their animals safe in the hot weather, having access to fresh water, ventilation and shade from direct sunlight. Ice in hats, ventilated suits - keeping cool at work What does hot weather do to the body? Is the UK getting hotter? British Veterinary Association President Justine Shotton said owners need to stop their pets overheating, including ""making sure pets aren't walked or exercised in the middle of a hot day or left inside a hot car or conservatory for even a little while, as not long can prove fatal"". The Met Office said the hot weather is being caused by high pressure over the UK and hot air flowing from southern Europe and a heatwave spreading across Europe has fuelledwildfires in Portugal, France and Spain. Commuters have been been advised to only use public transport unless absolutely necessary during the extreme heat warnings. The speed limit on lines across Wales and England has been reduced, with trains mostly limited to 90mph (145km/h), where it would usually be up to 125mph (200km/h), meaning journeys will take longer. Transport for Wales (TfW) has even cancelled trains on routes within the areas covered by the Met Office red weather warning. This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool Services between Shrewsbury and Birmingham, Chester and Liverpool, Chester and Manchester, Chester and Crewe, Crewe and Manchester and the Conwy Valley Line will be cancelled. TfW has warned services to Wales' coastal resorts, along the Heart of Wales Line to the Royal Welsh Show and in south Wales due to university graduations in Cardiff and Swansea ""will be very busy"". The train operator has said ""conditions onboard are likely to be very uncomfortable in the extreme weather"" but are ""working to provide additional capacity to avoid overcrowding"". Network Rail said the need for speed restrictions and longer journey times was because steel rails absorb heat easily and ""tend to be around 20 degrees above air temperature"". ""When steel becomes very hot it expands and rails can bend, flex and, in serious cases, buckle,"" it said.

Here are the latest developments where things have been hotting up inside and outside the Commons.  Two more rounds of voting tomorrow and Wednesday will cut the number of candidates down to a final two. Conservative Party members will then pick a winner, determining their next leader and the UK's new prime minister. Rishi Sunak still leads the way in voting and he's turned to Twitter to react to the latest result of polling among Conservative MPs. He says he's got ""great momentum after a tough set of debates"". The former chancellor also thanks Tom Tugendhat, who was knocked out of the contest earlier, for fighting a ""really good, positive campaign"". Allow Twitter content?

The government haswona vote of confidence in itself, by349votes to238. It had been expected to win the motion as it had the support of many Tory MPs. Had it lost, the country would have almost certainly faced an early general election. MPs have just filed out of the chamber to start voting on whether they have confidence in the government. The government is expected to win, as the Conservatives still have a large majority. But if it doesn't, it will likely spell an early general election. In a slight quirk, the government brought forward the motion itself after it rejected Labour's proposed wording, which contained a specific reference to the prime minister. We'll bring you the result as soon as we get it. With Boris Johnson back in the Commons, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab says he ""proudly"" defends the government under his leadership. Raab says the government has ""steered the country through some of the most difficult challenges in living memory"" and has got the big calls right on issues including vaccines and lockdowns. Back in the House of Commons, MPs are still debating a confidence motion in the government. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner says the prime minister is not fit for office but the Conservatives plan to ""indulge"" him for the next seven weeks, until his successor is chosen. Describing him as a ""caretaker known for no care"", she says: ""Every day he's in Downing Street he does more damage. He should be long gone."" ""Let us tell this prime minister to go, and to go now. Enough is enough."" With the latest round of Tory leadership votes revealed, and with four runners left in the race, who are the candidates hoping to progress further in the race? Rishi Sunakis the former chancellor who launched his leadership bid with a focus on the economy, ruling out tax cuts before public finances improve. Despite his reputation being dented by acontroversy over his wife's tax affairs- and beingfined for breaching lockdown rules- Sunak currently leads after the latest round of voting by Tory MPs, with backers including former leadership rivals Grant Shapps and Jeremy Hunt, as well as Deputy PM Dominic Raab. Trade ministerPenny Mordaunthas, so far, been the shock contender. She has come second in all three rounds of voting, and was for a time the bookies' favourite. She has promised to cut VAT on fuel and to raise the basic and middle earner income tax thresholds in line with inflation. Her supporters include senior backbenchers Andrea Leadsom and David Davis. A Royal Navy reservist, Mordaunt made history in 2019 when she became the UKâs first female defence secretary â a post she held for just 85 days until Boris Johnson replaced then PM Theresa May. Foreign SecretaryLiz Trussdecided to lead on promising immediate tax cuts, a reversal of the National Insurance hike and a long-term commitment to reducing the size of the state. Popular among Conservative Party members, Truss secured earlybacking from Boris Johnson loyalistsNadine Dorries, the culture secretary, and Jacob Rees-Mogg â as well as former leadership hopeful and staunch Brexiteer Suella Braverman. Former equalities ministerKemi Badenochhas pledged tax cuts and low regulation â and repeatedlychallenged Mordaunt on her record when it comes to gender self-identification for transgender people. A former software engineer, she became an MP in 2017 and went on to become equalities minister in 2021 then minister for levelling up under Michael Gove, who has backed her leadership bid. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady reveals the latest round of Tory leadership results Liz Truss gained seven votes in this round, coming third with 71. Chloe Smith, who's campaigning for the foreign secretary, tells the BBC ""youâve seen people coming toward
Liz"". ""The key point people see is experience, her wide range of experience across
departments, she's trusted to deliver from day one"". When challenged on the fact that Truss still came third, again behind Penny Mordaunt, she adds ""Lizâs
result is going up, Pennyâs has come down by one"". But MPs who voted for Tom Tugendhat may prefer to back Mordaunt, rather than Truss, in the next round. Smith however says the Truss campaign ""is a very broad
church, so I'd say to friends and colleagues: please come and look at Lizâs wide
range of experience"". It's the end of the road for Tom Tugendhat, who has just tweeted his reaction to being eliminated: ""Although it wasnât to be today, I am immensely proud of the positive vision we put forward for our country."" In an accompanying video, he says he won't talk about who he is backing yet: ""I'll listen to what they have to say and I'll be making my judgement later."" He says the country is ""crying out"" for a clean start and concludes: ""This is only the beginning!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Chris MasonPolitical editor Sir Graham Brady reveals the latest round of results Tonight's result was very close to what many here expected. Tom Tugendhat knocked out, and the remaining four in the same order as they were in the second round. But let's look at the numbers in a bit more detail. TeamSunakappear happy. The challenge with being the frontrunner is the focus and novelty shifts to those chasing the other place in the final two, and you potentially lose your ooomph. ""Thatâs a cracking result - Rishi gaining most - even given Suellaâs voters least likely to be attracted,"" one former cabinet minister backing Sunak tells me. ""He had a lead of 18 over 2nd placed Penny on Friday. Now itâs 33. Momentum."" PennyMordaunthas gone backwards â losing a vote compared to last time. This has cheered TeamTruss, who point out they have narrowed the gap to Mordaunt ""pretty considerably"" and they say there is ""all to play for."" But KemiBadenoch, who finished fourth, is only 13 votes behind the foreign secretary. A Team Badenoch campaign source tells me: âKemi is pleased to have taken it to the next vote. She has momentum over both Mordaunt and Truss. Itâs all to play for and Kemi is in it to win."" And then there is TomTugendhat. He has bowed out with warm words about the contest and his colleagues â but hasn't yet said who he will now back. There are 31 votes looking for a home tomorrow, in round four. And so five become four as we approach the final two votes for MPs â tomorrow and Wednesday â which will determine the two contenders who will be picked from by Conservative Party members. Mordaunt supporter Harriett Baldwin speaks to BBC News Penny Mordaunt supporter Harriett Baldwin tells the BBC, supporters of Tom Tugendhat, who has just been knocked out of the running, will go to her preferred candidate. ""Penny will attract a lot of his supporters because she's someone who's also very strong on defence,"" she says. Mordaunt is also strong on the economy and security, Baldwin says, adding she's ""someone ready to be prime minister on day one"" but also with the ability to ""win an unprecedented fifth general election"". Ben Bradley MP, a Conservative campaigner for Kemi Badenoch, said her 58
votes â meaning she gained votes â showed that she had gained ""momentum"". ""Kemi is in a good place to move forward,"" he told the BBC. ""It's a good result, Kemi has done well,"" he said. ""I think she'll be quite positive, see the momentum that's builtâ¦
we'll talk to colleagues and try to drag them into our tent."" In the second round Badenoch got 49 votes, so she gained nine more this
time. Bradley also said Badenoch had ""resonated with the public, with
[Conservative] members"". He dismissed
speculation about any job deal for her in exchange for withdrawing from the
race. Her tally means she came fourth in this round. Frontrunner Rishi Sunak has added 14 votes to his tally in this latest
round, going from 101 votes to 115 today. Penny Mordaunt is now in second position, despite losing one vote this
round, moving from 83 to 82 votes. Third-placed Liz Truss added seven votes, bringing her total up to 71
from 64. Despite now being
in last place, Kemi Badenoch added on the second largest number of supporters
this round, increasing her share by nine votes and going from 49 to 58 votes. Tom Tugendhat made it far enough to take part in the TV debates, and played up the fact he had never served in Boris Johnson's cabinet. Campaigning for a ""clean start"", he tried to persuade Conservative MPs he'd demonstrated leadership as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. That experience, he said, plus his military service on the
frontlines of Iraq and Afghanistan, meant he was now ready to serve the country
on a political battleground. But Tugendhat's campaign has now ended in defeat, with not enough support to see him through to the final stages. With 115 votes, former chancellor Rishi Sunak has held onto his place at the front of the pack. In second place, we have Penny Mordaunt with 82 votes, leaving them the most likely to be one of the final two candidates in the leadership race. Two candidates will now battle over third place: Liz Truss with 71 votes and Kemi Badenoch with 58 votes. Tom Tugendhat has been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting. Rishi Sunak secured the most votes in third ballot among Tory MPs, with Penny Mordaunt coming second. The votes were as follows:  The four remaining candidates will face another vote tomorrow, where the slate will be whittled down to three. Tom Tugendhat's bid to be the next Tory leader has come to an end, leaving four contenders in the race to take over the reins from Boris Johnson. Best known as the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tugendhat secured 31 votes, leaving him in last place. Sir Graham Brady has just arrived in the committee room and is about to tell us who has made it through the third round of voting in this Tory leadership contest. Stick with us â we'll bring you the results very shortly. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.14388393

"Robert Hattersley brought a smile to many people, his family have said The family of a 13-year-old boy who died in a river say they are ""absolutely devastated"" by their loss. Robert Hattersley, of Crawcrook, Tyne and Wear, got into difficulty in the River Tyne near Ovingham, Northumberland, at about 16:15 GMT on Sunday. His family said he was ""so kind and loving"" and ""brought a smile to so many people's faces"". Northumbria Police described his death as ""absolutely tragic"". In a statement released through the police, Robert's family said: ""It is impossible to put into words the heartbreak we are feeling - Robert was so kind and loving. We are absolutely devastated by what has happened. ""He brought a smile to so many people's faces and he will be missed by absolutely everyone who knew and loved him."" Police, fire and ambulance crews were at the scene on Sunday The family also thanked the emergency services and volunteers who searched for and found Robert after the alarm was raised when he went missing. Northumbria Police said it did not believe there to be any third party involvement and a report would be made for the coroner. Det Ch Insp Martin Brooks said: ""This is an absolutely tragic incident and our thoughts are with Robert's family at this absolutely horrendous time. ""We will continue to support them in any way that we can, as they attempt to process the events of the last 24 hours. ""I would like to thank every organisation who assisted us with our searches, including all the volunteers. ""Your support is absolutely vital and it is hugely appreciated. It is with great sadness that we could not provide a more positive update."" Flowers from Robert's friends and family have been left beside the river Robert's death has prompted calls for improved river safety education especially on that part of the Tyne. Angie Scott, who represents Prudhoe North on Northumberland County Council, had to be rescued while swimming in that area when she was 14. She said another boy had to be pulled from the same stretch of water recently and urged people not swim there, even if tempted by the current heatwave. ""It looks a lovely part of the Tyne but it is so dangerous,"" Ms Scott told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. She said she would look at safety measures in the area including signage warning of the danger. Paul Hedley, the chief fire officer for Northumberland Fire and Rescue Service, said the ""absolute tragedy"" underlines the ""very real dangers presented by rivers and the sea"". ""The water may look calm on the surface, but there can be strong undercurrents that could pull even a strong swimmer under the water,"" he said, adding: ""Even when the weather feels very hot, the water may feel warm on the surface, but just a few feet below the surface it can be icy cold - affecting the stamina and strength of even strong swimmers.""

"This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady reads out the result of third round of voting by Tory MPs in the leadership contest Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak has topped the third MPs' vote for the next Tory leader and prime minister, with backbencher Tom Tugendhat eliminated. Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt took second place, while Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was third and ex-Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch was fourth. The four remaining candidates go to another round of voting on Tuesday. The field will be cut to two on Wednesday, with Conservative Party members then having the final say. The placings were the same as in the second round of voting last Thursday, but Mr Sunak picked up 14 more votes, Ms Badenoch nine and Ms Truss seven. Ms Mordaunt's support dropped by one vote, as did Mr Tugendhat's. In a statement, Mr Tugendhat said: ""I want to thank my team, colleagues and, most of all, the British people for their support. ""I have been overwhelmed by the response we have received across the country. People are ready for a clean start and our party must deliver on it and put trust back into politics."" Tory TV debate shelved amid infighting concerns Tory race gets personal in latest TV debate Who could be the next prime minister? A source within Ms Truss's campaign told the BBC: ""We've narrowed the gap to Penny pretty considerably. Story is Penny going backwards. All to play for!"" But Ms Mordaunt said: ""My vote is steady and I'm grateful to my colleagues for all their support and thrilled to be in second place once more."" A prominent Sunak supporter said: ""That's a cracking result - Rishi gaining most [votes]."" And a Badenoch campaign source said: ""Kemi is pleased to have taken it to the next vote. She has momentum over both Mordaunt and Truss. It's all to play for and Kemi is in it to win."" The Tory leadership contest has become increasingly bitter and personal in tone, as those left in it fight for the final two places. Mr Tugendhat earlier rejected calls to stand aside and throw his support behind another candidate, as did Ms Badenoch. But most of the rancour has been between Mr Sunak, Ms Mordaunt and Ms Truss, who clashed in an ITV-hosted debate on Sunday over their economic policies. A Sky News debate scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled after Mr Sunak and Ms Truss declined to take part, and amid concern among senior Tories that angry arguments in public could damage the party. The new Tory leader and prime minister is due to be announced on 5 September. In seven weeks' time, we will have a new prime minister. For centuries in this country, with a few exceptions, we have collectively been in the habit of getting white men to run the place. We now know for certain that that isn't going to happen this time around. We are now down to the final quartet: former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch. And so to Round Four. Read Chris's analysis in full Separately, the government won a vote of confidence in itself in the House of Commons. It could have led to a general election, had ministers been defeated. But this would have required dozens of Conservative MPs to side with Labour and other opposition parties. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he has ""no idea"" why the Labour leader âinsistedâ in holding a confidence motion in the government Opening the debate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was still in charge of ""one of the most dynamic governments of modern times"". He told MPs: ""He [Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer] wants [a confidence vote] and since they want one, it's his constitutional prerogative, we will comply and we will win."" He also told the Commons: ""Some people will say as I leave office that this is the end of Brexit, and the Leader of the Opposition and the deep state will prevail in its plot to haul us back into alignment with the EU as a prelude to our eventual return, and we on this side of the House will prove them wrong, won't we?"" Tory MPs cheered in response. Sir Keir responded to the PM's speech, saying: ""Unlike his predecessors, this prime minister has not been forced out over policy disagreements. ""And despite the delusions he has fostered in his bunker, he has not been felled by the stampede of an eccentric herd. Instead, he has been forced out in disgrace."" The government won by 349 votes to 238, a majority of 111.

H&M is understood to have more than 150 stores and about 6,000 staff in Russia. It has not given a date or timescale for its exit. ""After careful consideration, we see it as impossible given the current situation to continue our business in Russia,"" said chief executive Helena Helmersson. ""We are deeply saddened about the impact this will have on our colleagues and very grateful for all their hard work and dedication. Furthermore, we wish to thank our customers for their support throughout the years."" Which companies are pulling out of Russia? H&M is one of many brands pulling out of Russia in recent months. Many have said sanctions imposed after the invasion by Western allies have made trading unviable and in some sectors impossible. Others have left taking a moral stance on the war, or are responding to pressure from consumers to act. Prior to it suspending sales, Russia was H&M's sixth-biggest market, accounting for about 4% of group sales in the fourth quarter of 2021. The fashion giant had been expanding its presence in Russia since starting operations there in 2009, including opening shops under other brand names in its portfolio, Weekday and & Other Stories. Russian shoppers could previously order clothes from the brands Monki and Cos online. H&M forecast departing from Russia will cost the group about two billion Swedish Krona (Â£160m). The retailer's shops in Ukraine have been closed for some time due to concerns over the safety of customers and staff.

"Aerial footage showed a large rectangular area on the surface being examined by airport staff Flights have resumed at London Luton Airport following repairs after high temperatures lifted a small section of the runway. The airport said departing flights resumed at 17:40 BST, with inbound resuming 15 minutes later. Easyjet and Ryanair both diverted some of their arrivals to other airports. The damage occurred as the Met Office issueda red extreme heat warningin much of England, with temperatures set to hit 41C (106F) on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, an airport spokesperson said flights had been temporarily suspended ""to allow for an essential runway repair after high surface temperatures caused a small section to lift"". Easyjet said three inbound flights to Luton had been diverted to nearby airports, and flights to and from Belfast, Milan and Palma due to fly were ""unfortunately now unable to operate"". Ryanair said it had not cancelled any flights from the airport but had diverted a small number of inbound flights to Stansted. Several flights were delayed and some cancelled at Luton Airport Pictures on social media showed a packed terminal as passengers waited for their flights to resume. Alison Cybe, 39, from Brighton, was caught up in the delays. She had been due to fly to Naples at 15.15 BST but was informed her flight was delayed due to the ""melted"" runway. Talking from the departure lounge, she said: ""It's hot, but the number of people in the departure area makes it even hotter. ""People are just feeling pretty fed-up. A lot have been making the best of it, but you can tell we are tired.""

"This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady reads out the result of third round of voting by Tory MPs in the leadership contest Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak has topped the third MPs' vote for the next Tory leader and prime minister, with backbencher Tom Tugendhat eliminated. Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt took second place, while Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was third and ex-Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch was fourth. The four remaining candidates go to another round of voting on Tuesday. The field will be cut to two on Wednesday, with Conservative Party members then having the final say. The placings were the same as in the second round of voting last Thursday, but Mr Sunak picked up 14 more votes, Ms Badenoch nine and Ms Truss seven. Ms Mordaunt's support dropped by one vote, as did Mr Tugendhat's. In a statement, Mr Tugendhat said: ""I want to thank my team, colleagues and, most of all, the British people for their support. ""I have been overwhelmed by the response we have received across the country. People are ready for a clean start and our party must deliver on it and put trust back into politics."" Tory TV debate shelved amid infighting concerns Tory race gets personal in latest TV debate Who could be the next prime minister? A source within Ms Truss's campaign told the BBC: ""We've narrowed the gap to Penny pretty considerably. Story is Penny going backwards. All to play for!"" But Ms Mordaunt said: ""My vote is steady and I'm grateful to my colleagues for all their support and thrilled to be in second place once more."" A prominent Sunak supporter said: ""That's a cracking result - Rishi gaining most [votes]."" And a Badenoch campaign source said: ""Kemi is pleased to have taken it to the next vote. She has momentum over both Mordaunt and Truss. It's all to play for and Kemi is in it to win."" The Tory leadership contest has become increasingly bitter and personal in tone, as those left in it fight for the final two places. Mr Tugendhat earlier rejected calls to stand aside and throw his support behind another candidate, as did Ms Badenoch. But most of the rancour has been between Mr Sunak, Ms Mordaunt and Ms Truss, who clashed in an ITV-hosted debate on Sunday over their economic policies. A Sky News debate scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled after Mr Sunak and Ms Truss declined to take part, and amid concern among senior Tories that angry arguments in public could damage the party. The new Tory leader and prime minister is due to be announced on 5 September. In seven weeks' time, we will have a new prime minister. For centuries in this country, with a few exceptions, we have collectively been in the habit of getting white men to run the place. We now know for certain that that isn't going to happen this time around. We are now down to the final quartet: former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch. And so to Round Four. Read Chris's analysis in full Separately, the government won a vote of confidence in itself in the House of Commons. It could have led to a general election, had ministers been defeated. But this would have required dozens of Conservative MPs to side with Labour and other opposition parties. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he has ""no idea"" why the Labour leader âinsistedâ in holding a confidence motion in the government Opening the debate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was still in charge of ""one of the most dynamic governments of modern times"". He told MPs: ""He [Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer] wants [a confidence vote] and since they want one, it's his constitutional prerogative, we will comply and we will win."" He also told the Commons: ""Some people will say as I leave office that this is the end of Brexit, and the Leader of the Opposition and the deep state will prevail in its plot to haul us back into alignment with the EU as a prelude to our eventual return, and we on this side of the House will prove them wrong, won't we?"" Tory MPs cheered in response. Sir Keir responded to the PM's speech, saying: ""Unlike his predecessors, this prime minister has not been forced out over policy disagreements. ""And despite the delusions he has fostered in his bunker, he has not been felled by the stampede of an eccentric herd. Instead, he has been forced out in disgrace."" The government won by 349 votes to 238, a majority of 111.

"The London Fire Brigade declares a major incident after a number of fires break out in areas around the capital A major blaze in the village of Wennington, in east London, burns fields and sets homes alight The UK records its hottest-ever temperature, with 40.3C recorded in Coningsby in Lincolnshire Over 34 locations exceeded the UK's previous temperature record of 38.7C recorded in Cambridge in July 2019, the Met Office says People in the capital are urged not to have barbeques or bonfires due to the risk of fire The extreme heat is fuelled by climate change which is making heatwaves more intense, frequent and likely, scientists warn Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany are also seeing temperatures soar, while wildfires still threaten parts of southwest France and Spain Edited by Emma Owen and Jeremy Gahagan We're going to leave our live coverage of the heatwave here for today. For a full overview of the day's events, read our main storyhere. And to see how hot it'll be overnight tonight,check out BBC Weather's latest forecast. Today's page was written by Adam Durbin, Krystyna Gajda, Laura Gozzi, James Harness, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Alex Therrien, Emma Owen, Chris Giles and Jeremy Gahagan. Today the UK officially reached 40C â something the Met Office said was ""virtually impossible"" in an undisrupted climate. But with human-induced climate change, such extreme temperatures have now become a reality. Let's take look at the day:  Get your latest weather forecasthere. Want more?WatchThe UKâs Hottest Day, A New Normal?with BBC Weatherâs Nick Miller on BBC iPlayer now Smoke columns rise from the grassland fires in Dartford, Kent Firefighters have been tackling many fires across the country, including a number in and around the capital, leading to London Fire Brigade declaring a major incident. Some of these include: Merlyn ThomasBBC climate change disinformation specialist A Met Office meteorologist has debunked a misleading map
which has been gaining traction on social media. The image above, designed to downplay the heatwave and cast
doubt on climate change, spread on groups and accounts including some that post
debunked weather conspiracy theories. But the comparison is misleading. For one thing, the map on
the left appears to be an older BBC map which did not use colour zones for
temperatures. However, Met Office maps did include colours, even before a recent
redesign, and the image on the right is not from the current heat wave. Meterologist Aidan McGivern explained that temperature symbols and
colour scale were tweaked to make it more accessible to those, like him, who
are colourblind. Mr McGivern says at the time the new colours were designed
in autumn 2021, parts of the Middle East and North Africa were above 39C, and
he had expected the darker colours to crop up in Spain from time to time. âI never expected them to be used on UK maps,âhe tweeted,external. Scientists have long warned that climate change is leading to rising temperatures. But some have been surprised at how soon 40C has happened in the UK. The Met Office said these temperatures were thought improbable a decade ago. What does this mean for other long-term predictions, including some that suggest 40C would be happeningevery 3-4 years by 2100,external? Recording a provisional 40C today has made metereologists ""sit up and think"", the Met Office told BBC News ""But this is still expected to be a fairly rare event,"" it said. Currently it's considered around one in every 100 years occurence. The way that modelling works is that we could have one or even several years of extreme temperatures, but they are still considered unusual in the long-term. The challenge now is for scientists to understand if this is a very unusual event, or if it will be occuring much more frequently than expected. Harry LowReporting from Dartford You can smell it in the air, you can see it in the skyline - and the sweat soaked shirts of the firefighters bear testament to their hard work with 18 fire engines sent to this part of Dartford alone. Itâs swelteringly hot here - temperatures reached 37C - and those warm winds weâve been experiencing all day have hampered efforts to douse the flames in north Kent. These heath fires are both a symptom of the heatwave and contributing factor to these unprecedented conditions. Here at Spirits Rest animal sanctuary they put the call out for help earlier on - and how the community has responded. People rallied round, offering to rescue the animals in danger. The chickens, rabbits, cats and 12 horses were all helped to safety. This video can not be played We've been sent this footage of a field fire near Ravensdean in Bedfordshire. Samuel Kumar filmed as smoke drifted across the road, in front of motorists, not far from the village hall.  Drone footage shows of the aftermath of a field fire by Cheshunt Park that started yesterday Firefighters in Hertfordshire are attending several incidents - a combine harvester fire, a car crash, and several field fires. The service asks people calling 999 to be patient after a major incident was declared over the volume of calls it is receiving and responding to. People can help by following heatwave advice and staying safe over the next few hours, it adds. The fire that broke out in Wennington is still burning, and London Fire Brigade are still at the scene this evening. Residents were evacuated from their homes in the village, with the blaze igniting buildings and fields nearby. Around 100 firefighters have been working to bring it under control. But the BBC's Nick Johnson, who is in Wennington, says the situation has become more reassuring in the last half hour. He adds that it appears as if fire crews are starting to pack up and return to their engines after six hours of tackling the blaze. One firefighter helping to extinguish the blaze described the conditions as ""absolute hell"". Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Paris Here in Paris, itâs reached 41C. Walking around the city is
incredibly difficult, it almost feels like you're walking through soup. Most people are opting to take the cityâs metro but even then,
sitting on the train for more than a few stops is quite hard work - many people
have brought fans along with them. In the capitalâs famous Tulleries garden, people have been taking
shade under some of the parkâs trees, making use of all available seating.
Thankfully the water fountains are still working. Meanwhile
at Paris' Gare du Nord station this afternoon, queues of people were seen waiting
for trains. There appear to be quite a few delays - although itâs not clear if
this is weather related. A number of passengers have taken to Twitter claiming that they
have been stuck on trains outside the station. Many of them say the air
conditioning on their train is not working. I myself am on a Eurostar train to London that was delayed for almost two hours. It's just left the station. Images on TV news shows fire destroy homes in the east London village We've heard from some Wennington residents who were evacuated due to the fires in their village. Some have gone to a rescue centre set up in the nearby Premier Inn, including Riminta Maceikaite, 38, and her 13-year-old son Nikas. Riminta saw the devastation unfold on the TV, watching images shot from a helicopter. She says their neighbours' homes have burnt down, but it appears their home is saved. ""When it shows you from the sky it just freaks you out,"" says Riminta. ""Our house is on the news"", says Nikas, ""it's the only house that hasn't been burned so far."" Janet Hickey, 70, and her husband Patrick, 71, had to evacuate their home quickly. 

Janet, who has terminal pancreatic cancer, had to leave all her medicines in the fridge. ""We had to leave everything"", says Patrick. ""We're hoping against hope that our house is still there."" Georgina RannardBBC News Are the fires breaking out in the UK a sign of what is to come? Guillermo Rein, Professor of Fire Science at Imperial College London, told me he expects that more powerful wildfires will gradually take place in the UK due to warmer
and drier vegetation. They will be hotter, with larger flames, and will spread faster, he suggests. ""These
make wildfires more dangerous to people, homes and the environment,"" he adds. The risk inthe south and east of England,externalis particularly expected to increase. To reduce the risk, fire services are asking the public not to light barbecues, campfires or bonfires in the open and to get rid of cigarettes and rubbish, including glass bottles, responsibly.

authorities have instructed people in four areas to the east of Athens near
Penteli to evacuate due to forest fires. The 112
emergency service sent mobile phone alerts to people in the areas of Drafi,
Anthousa, Dioni and Dasmari to evacuate. Thick plumes of
smoke and smouldering fires are currently visible to the east of Athens. The fire
service says firefighters in the Attica region, which
includes Athens, are on general alert. In 2018, at
least 100 people died in a massive wildfire in Mati, 18 miles east of the Greek
capital. Hertfordshire Fire Service has declared a major incident. ""The service has received a very high volume of 999 calls, leading to crews attending more than 240 emergency incidents so far today, in part due to the extreme weather. ""These incidents include crop fires, field fires, and road traffic collisions on major roads.
Firefighters have continued to work hard in very difficult conditions,"" it says.

"This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady reads out the result of third round of voting by Tory MPs in the leadership contest Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak has topped the third MPs' vote for the next Tory leader and prime minister, with backbencher Tom Tugendhat eliminated. Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt took second place, while Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was third and ex-Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch was fourth. The four remaining candidates go to another round of voting on Tuesday. The field will be cut to two on Wednesday, with Conservative Party members then having the final say. The placings were the same as in the second round of voting last Thursday, but Mr Sunak picked up 14 more votes, Ms Badenoch nine and Ms Truss seven. Ms Mordaunt's support dropped by one vote, as did Mr Tugendhat's. In a statement, Mr Tugendhat said: ""I want to thank my team, colleagues and, most of all, the British people for their support. ""I have been overwhelmed by the response we have received across the country. People are ready for a clean start and our party must deliver on it and put trust back into politics."" Tory TV debate shelved amid infighting concerns Tory race gets personal in latest TV debate Who could be the next prime minister? A source within Ms Truss's campaign told the BBC: ""We've narrowed the gap to Penny pretty considerably. Story is Penny going backwards. All to play for!"" But Ms Mordaunt said: ""My vote is steady and I'm grateful to my colleagues for all their support and thrilled to be in second place once more."" A prominent Sunak supporter said: ""That's a cracking result - Rishi gaining most [votes]."" And a Badenoch campaign source said: ""Kemi is pleased to have taken it to the next vote. She has momentum over both Mordaunt and Truss. It's all to play for and Kemi is in it to win."" The Tory leadership contest has become increasingly bitter and personal in tone, as those left in it fight for the final two places. Mr Tugendhat earlier rejected calls to stand aside and throw his support behind another candidate, as did Ms Badenoch. But most of the rancour has been between Mr Sunak, Ms Mordaunt and Ms Truss, who clashed in an ITV-hosted debate on Sunday over their economic policies. A Sky News debate scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled after Mr Sunak and Ms Truss declined to take part, and amid concern among senior Tories that angry arguments in public could damage the party. The new Tory leader and prime minister is due to be announced on 5 September. In seven weeks' time, we will have a new prime minister. For centuries in this country, with a few exceptions, we have collectively been in the habit of getting white men to run the place. We now know for certain that that isn't going to happen this time around. We are now down to the final quartet: former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch. And so to Round Four. Read Chris's analysis in full Separately, the government won a vote of confidence in itself in the House of Commons. It could have led to a general election, had ministers been defeated. But this would have required dozens of Conservative MPs to side with Labour and other opposition parties. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he has ""no idea"" why the Labour leader âinsistedâ in holding a confidence motion in the government Opening the debate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was still in charge of ""one of the most dynamic governments of modern times"". He told MPs: ""He [Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer] wants [a confidence vote] and since they want one, it's his constitutional prerogative, we will comply and we will win."" He also told the Commons: ""Some people will say as I leave office that this is the end of Brexit, and the Leader of the Opposition and the deep state will prevail in its plot to haul us back into alignment with the EU as a prelude to our eventual return, and we on this side of the House will prove them wrong, won't we?"" Tory MPs cheered in response. Sir Keir responded to the PM's speech, saying: ""Unlike his predecessors, this prime minister has not been forced out over policy disagreements. ""And despite the delusions he has fostered in his bunker, he has not been felled by the stampede of an eccentric herd. Instead, he has been forced out in disgrace."" The government won by 349 votes to 238, a majority of 111.

"Russia has hit Google with a 21.1bn rouble ($373m; Â£301m) fine for failing to restrict access to ""prohibited"" material about the war in Ukraine and other content. Roskomnadzor, the country's communications regulator, said the information included ""fake"" reports that discredited Russia's military and posts urging people to protest. It called the US tech giant a ""systematic"" violator of its laws. Google did not comment immediately. The company's local subsidiary declared bankruptcy last month. The move came after Russian authorities seized its local bank account, allowing them to recover 7.2bn roubles that the firm had been ordered to pay for similar reasons last year. In recent years, Russia has been ramping up pressure on tech firms, accusing them of not moderating their content properly, and interfering in the country's internal affairs. How Russia tries to censor Western social media The efforts to control social media and other news sites have escalated following the invasion of Ukraine in February. The government also passed a law threatening people who spread ""fake"" information about the war with 15 years in prison. In March, Google, owned by Alphabet, stopped offering its commercial services in Russia, such as advertising. It has also stepped up its restrictions for news accounts backed by Russia and relocated staff. However, unlike some other social media sites, such as Facebook, it has not been completely banned in Russia, where many smart phones rely on the company's technology. In March, Alphabet said the decision to continue offering search, maps and YouTube provided Russians with access to ""global information and perspectives"". The fine announced on Monday,external, which was calculated as a share of the firm's local revenue, marks the biggest penalty ever imposed on a tech company in Russia, according to state media.

"The London Fire Brigade declares a major incident after a number of fires break out in areas around the capital A major blaze in the village of Wennington, in east London, burns fields and sets homes alight The UK records its hottest-ever temperature, with 40.3C recorded in Coningsby in Lincolnshire Over 34 locations exceeded the UK's previous temperature record of 38.7C recorded in Cambridge in July 2019, the Met Office says People in the capital are urged not to have barbeques or bonfires due to the risk of fire The extreme heat is fuelled by climate change which is making heatwaves more intense, frequent and likely, scientists warn Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany are also seeing temperatures soar, while wildfires still threaten parts of southwest France and Spain Edited by Emma Owen and Jeremy Gahagan We're going to leave our live coverage of the heatwave here for today. For a full overview of the day's events, read our main storyhere. And to see how hot it'll be overnight tonight,check out BBC Weather's latest forecast. Today's page was written by Adam Durbin, Krystyna Gajda, Laura Gozzi, James Harness, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Alex Therrien, Emma Owen, Chris Giles and Jeremy Gahagan. Today the UK officially reached 40C â something the Met Office said was ""virtually impossible"" in an undisrupted climate. But with human-induced climate change, such extreme temperatures have now become a reality. Let's take look at the day:  Get your latest weather forecasthere. Want more?WatchThe UKâs Hottest Day, A New Normal?with BBC Weatherâs Nick Miller on BBC iPlayer now Smoke columns rise from the grassland fires in Dartford, Kent Firefighters have been tackling many fires across the country, including a number in and around the capital, leading to London Fire Brigade declaring a major incident. Some of these include: Merlyn ThomasBBC climate change disinformation specialist A Met Office meteorologist has debunked a misleading map
which has been gaining traction on social media. The image above, designed to downplay the heatwave and cast
doubt on climate change, spread on groups and accounts including some that post
debunked weather conspiracy theories. But the comparison is misleading. For one thing, the map on
the left appears to be an older BBC map which did not use colour zones for
temperatures. However, Met Office maps did include colours, even before a recent
redesign, and the image on the right is not from the current heat wave. Meterologist Aidan McGivern explained that temperature symbols and
colour scale were tweaked to make it more accessible to those, like him, who
are colourblind. Mr McGivern says at the time the new colours were designed
in autumn 2021, parts of the Middle East and North Africa were above 39C, and
he had expected the darker colours to crop up in Spain from time to time. âI never expected them to be used on UK maps,âhe tweeted,external. Scientists have long warned that climate change is leading to rising temperatures. But some have been surprised at how soon 40C has happened in the UK. The Met Office said these temperatures were thought improbable a decade ago. What does this mean for other long-term predictions, including some that suggest 40C would be happeningevery 3-4 years by 2100,external? Recording a provisional 40C today has made metereologists ""sit up and think"", the Met Office told BBC News ""But this is still expected to be a fairly rare event,"" it said. Currently it's considered around one in every 100 years occurence. The way that modelling works is that we could have one or even several years of extreme temperatures, but they are still considered unusual in the long-term. The challenge now is for scientists to understand if this is a very unusual event, or if it will be occuring much more frequently than expected. Harry LowReporting from Dartford You can smell it in the air, you can see it in the skyline - and the sweat soaked shirts of the firefighters bear testament to their hard work with 18 fire engines sent to this part of Dartford alone. Itâs swelteringly hot here - temperatures reached 37C - and those warm winds weâve been experiencing all day have hampered efforts to douse the flames in north Kent. These heath fires are both a symptom of the heatwave and contributing factor to these unprecedented conditions. Here at Spirits Rest animal sanctuary they put the call out for help earlier on - and how the community has responded. People rallied round, offering to rescue the animals in danger. The chickens, rabbits, cats and 12 horses were all helped to safety. This video can not be played We've been sent this footage of a field fire near Ravensdean in Bedfordshire. Samuel Kumar filmed as smoke drifted across the road, in front of motorists, not far from the village hall.  Drone footage shows of the aftermath of a field fire by Cheshunt Park that started yesterday Firefighters in Hertfordshire are attending several incidents - a combine harvester fire, a car crash, and several field fires. The service asks people calling 999 to be patient after a major incident was declared over the volume of calls it is receiving and responding to. People can help by following heatwave advice and staying safe over the next few hours, it adds.

Conservative Party members will then pick a winner, determining their next leader and the UK's new prime minister. Rishi Sunak still leads the way in voting and he's turned to Twitter to react to the latest result of polling among Conservative MPs. He says he's got ""great momentum after a tough set of debates"".

The government haswona vote of confidence in itself, by349votes to238. It had been expected to win the motion as it had the support of many Tory MPs. Had it lost, the country would have almost certainly faced an early general election. MPs have just filed out of the chamber to start voting on whether they have confidence in the government. The government is expected to win, as the Conservatives still have a large majority. But if it doesn't, it will likely spell an early general election. In a slight quirk, the government brought forward the motion itself after it rejected Labour's proposed wording, which contained a specific reference to the prime minister. We'll bring you the result as soon as we get it. With Boris Johnson back in the Commons, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab says he ""proudly"" defends the government under his leadership. Raab says the government has ""steered the country through some of the most difficult challenges in living memory"" and has got the big calls right on issues including vaccines and lockdowns. Back in the House of Commons, MPs are still debating a confidence motion in the government. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner says the prime minister is not fit for office but the Conservatives plan to ""indulge"" him for the next seven weeks, until his successor is chosen. Describing him as a ""caretaker known for no care"", she says: ""Every day he's in Downing Street he does more damage. He should be long gone."" ""Let us tell this prime minister to go, and to go now. Enough is enough."" With the latest round of Tory leadership votes revealed, and with four runners left in the race, who are the candidates hoping to progress further in the race?

Mordaunt supporter Harriett Baldwin speaks to BBC News Penny Mordaunt supporter Harriett Baldwin tells the BBC, supporters of Tom Tugendhat, who has just been knocked out of the running, will go to her preferred candidate. ""Penny will attract a lot of his supporters because she's someone who's also very strong on defence,"" she says. Mordaunt is also strong on the economy and security, Baldwin says, adding she's ""someone ready to be prime minister on day one"" but also with the ability to ""win an unprecedented fifth general election"". Ben Bradley MP, a Conservative campaigner for Kemi Badenoch, said her 58
votes â meaning she gained votes â showed that she had gained ""momentum"". ""Kemi is in a good place to move forward,"" he told the BBC. ""It's a good result, Kemi has done well,"" he said. ""I think she'll be quite positive, see the momentum that's builtâ¦
we'll talk to colleagues and try to drag them into our tent."" In the second round Badenoch got 49 votes, so she gained nine more this
time. Bradley also said Badenoch had ""resonated with the public, with
[Conservative] members"". He dismissed
speculation about any job deal for her in exchange for withdrawing from the
race. Her tally means she came fourth in this round. Frontrunner Rishi Sunak has added 14 votes to his tally in this latest
round, going from 101 votes to 115 today. Penny Mordaunt is now in second position, despite losing one vote this
round, moving from 83 to 82 votes. Third-placed Liz Truss added seven votes, bringing her total up to 71
from 64. Despite now being
in last place, Kemi Badenoch added on the second largest number of supporters
this round, increasing her share by nine votes and going from 49 to 58 votes. Tom Tugendhat made it far enough to take part in the TV debates, and played up the fact he had never served in Boris Johnson's cabinet. Campaigning for a ""clean start"", he tried to persuade Conservative MPs he'd demonstrated leadership as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. That experience, he said, plus his military service on the
frontlines of Iraq and Afghanistan, meant he was now ready to serve the country
on a political battleground. But Tugendhat's campaign has now ended in defeat, with not enough support to see him through to the final stages. With 115 votes, former chancellor Rishi Sunak has held onto his place at the front of the pack. In second place, we have Penny Mordaunt with 82 votes, leaving them the most likely to be one of the final two candidates in the leadership race. Two candidates will now battle over third place: Liz Truss with 71 votes and Kemi Badenoch with 58 votes. Tom Tugendhat has been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting. Rishi Sunak secured the most votes in third ballot among Tory MPs, with Penny Mordaunt coming second. The votes were as follows:  The four remaining candidates will face another vote tomorrow, where the slate will be whittled down to three. Tom Tugendhat's bid to be the next Tory leader has come to an end, leaving four contenders in the race to take over the reins from Boris Johnson. Best known as the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tugendhat secured 31 votes, leaving him in last place. Sir Graham Brady has just arrived in the committee room and is about to tell us who has made it through the third round of voting in this Tory leadership contest.

The government haswona vote of confidence in itself, by349votes to238. It had been expected to win the motion as it had the support of many Tory MPs. Had it lost, the country would have almost certainly faced an early general election. MPs have just filed out of the chamber to start voting on whether they have confidence in the government. The government is expected to win, as the Conservatives still have a large majority. But if it doesn't, it will likely spell an early general election. In a slight quirk, the government brought forward the motion itself after it rejected Labour's proposed wording, which contained a specific reference to the prime minister. We'll bring you the result as soon as we get it. With Boris Johnson back in the Commons, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab says he ""proudly"" defends the government under his leadership. Raab says the government has ""steered the country through some of the most difficult challenges in living memory"" and has got the big calls right on issues including vaccines and lockdowns. Back in the House of Commons, MPs are still debating a confidence motion in the government. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner says the prime minister is not fit for office but the Conservatives plan to ""indulge"" him for the next seven weeks, until his successor is chosen. Describing him as a ""caretaker known for no care"", she says: ""Every day he's in Downing Street he does more damage. He should be long gone."" ""Let us tell this prime minister to go, and to go now. Enough is enough.""

"Aerial footage showed a large rectangular area on the surface being examined by airport staff Flights have resumed at London Luton Airport following repairs after high temperatures lifted a small section of the runway. The airport said departing flights resumed at 17:40 BST, with inbound resuming 15 minutes later. Easyjet and Ryanair both diverted some of their arrivals to other airports. The damage occurred as the Met Office issueda red extreme heat warningin much of England, with temperatures set to hit 41C (106F) on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, an airport spokesperson said flights had been temporarily suspended ""to allow for an essential runway repair after high surface temperatures caused a small section to lift"". Easyjet said three inbound flights to Luton had been diverted to nearby airports, and flights to and from Belfast, Milan and Palma due to fly were ""unfortunately now unable to operate"". Ryanair said it had not cancelled any flights from the airport but had diverted a small number of inbound flights to Stansted. Several flights were delayed and some cancelled at Luton Airport Pictures on social media showed a packed terminal as passengers waited for their flights to resume. Alison Cybe, 39, from Brighton, was caught up in the delays. She had been due to fly to Naples at 15.15 BST but was informed her flight was delayed due to the ""melted"" runway. Talking from the departure lounge, she said: ""It's hot, but the number of people in the departure area makes it even hotter. ""People are just feeling pretty fed-up. A lot have been making the best of it, but you can tell we are tired.""

"This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady reads out the result of third round of voting by Tory MPs in the leadership contest Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak has topped the third MPs' vote for the next Tory leader and prime minister, with backbencher Tom Tugendhat eliminated. Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt took second place, while Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was third and ex-Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch was fourth. The four remaining candidates go to another round of voting on Tuesday. The field will be cut to two on Wednesday, with Conservative Party members then having the final say. The placings were the same as in the second round of voting last Thursday, but Mr Sunak picked up 14 more votes, Ms Badenoch nine and Ms Truss seven. Ms Mordaunt's support dropped by one vote, as did Mr Tugendhat's. In a statement, Mr Tugendhat said: ""I want to thank my team, colleagues and, most of all, the British people for their support. ""I have been overwhelmed by the response we have received across the country. People are ready for a clean start and our party must deliver on it and put trust back into politics."" Tory TV debate shelved amid infighting concerns Tory race gets personal in latest TV debate Who could be the next prime minister? A source within Ms Truss's campaign told the BBC: ""We've narrowed the gap to Penny pretty considerably. Story is Penny going backwards. All to play for!"" But Ms Mordaunt said: ""My vote is steady and I'm grateful to my colleagues for all their support and thrilled to be in second place once more."" A prominent Sunak supporter said: ""That's a cracking result - Rishi gaining most [votes]."" And a Badenoch campaign source said: ""Kemi is pleased to have taken it to the next vote. She has momentum over both Mordaunt and Truss. It's all to play for and Kemi is in it to win."" The Tory leadership contest has become increasingly bitter and personal in tone, as those left in it fight for the final two places. Mr Tugendhat earlier rejected calls to stand aside and throw his support behind another candidate, as did Ms Badenoch. But most of the rancour has been between Mr Sunak, Ms Mordaunt and Ms Truss, who clashed in an ITV-hosted debate on Sunday over their economic policies. A Sky News debate scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled after Mr Sunak and Ms Truss declined to take part, and amid concern among senior Tories that angry arguments in public could damage the party. The new Tory leader and prime minister is due to be announced on 5 September. In seven weeks' time, we will have a new prime minister. For centuries in this country, with a few exceptions, we have collectively been in the habit of getting white men to run the place. We now know for certain that that isn't going to happen this time around. We are now down to the final quartet: former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch. And so to Round Four. Read Chris's analysis in full Separately, the government won a vote of confidence in itself in the House of Commons. It could have led to a general election, had ministers been defeated. But this would have required dozens of Conservative MPs to side with Labour and other opposition parties. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he has ""no idea"" why the Labour leader âinsistedâ in holding a confidence motion in the government Opening the debate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was still in charge of ""one of the most dynamic governments of modern times"". He told MPs: ""He [Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer] wants [a confidence vote] and since they want one, it's his constitutional prerogative, we will comply and we will win."" He also told the Commons: ""Some people will say as I leave office that this is the end of Brexit, and the Leader of the Opposition and the deep state will prevail in its plot to haul us back into alignment with the EU as a prelude to our eventual return, and we on this side of the House will prove them wrong, won't we?"" Tory MPs cheered in response. Sir Keir responded to the PM's speech, saying: ""Unlike his predecessors, this prime minister has not been forced out over policy disagreements. ""And despite the delusions he has fostered in his bunker, he has not been felled by the stampede of an eccentric herd. Instead, he has been forced out in disgrace."" The government won by 349 votes to 238, a majority of 111.

"The London Fire Brigade declares a major incident after a number of fires break out in areas around the capital A major blaze in the village of Wennington, in east London, burns fields and sets homes alight The UK records its hottest-ever temperature, with 40.3C recorded in Coningsby in Lincolnshire Over 34 locations exceeded the UK's previous temperature record of 38.7C recorded in Cambridge in July 2019, the Met Office says People in the capital are urged not to have barbeques or bonfires due to the risk of fire The extreme heat is fuelled by climate change which is making heatwaves more intense, frequent and likely, scientists warn Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany are also seeing temperatures soar, while wildfires still threaten parts of southwest France and Spain Edited by Emma Owen and Jeremy Gahagan We're going to leave our live coverage of the heatwave here for today. For a full overview of the day's events, read our main storyhere. And to see how hot it'll be overnight tonight,check out BBC Weather's latest forecast. Today's page was written by Adam Durbin, Krystyna Gajda, Laura Gozzi, James Harness, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Alex Therrien, Emma Owen, Chris Giles and Jeremy Gahagan. Today the UK officially reached 40C â something the Met Office said was ""virtually impossible"" in an undisrupted climate. But with human-induced climate change, such extreme temperatures have now become a reality. Let's take look at the day:  Get your latest weather forecasthere. Want more?WatchThe UKâs Hottest Day, A New Normal?with BBC Weatherâs Nick Miller on BBC iPlayer now Smoke columns rise from the grassland fires in Dartford, Kent Firefighters have been tackling many fires across the country, including a number in and around the capital, leading to London Fire Brigade declaring a major incident. Some of these include: Merlyn ThomasBBC climate change disinformation specialist A Met Office meteorologist has debunked a misleading map
which has been gaining traction on social media. The image above, designed to downplay the heatwave and cast
doubt on climate change, spread on groups and accounts including some that post
debunked weather conspiracy theories. But the comparison is misleading. For one thing, the map on
the left appears to be an older BBC map which did not use colour zones for
temperatures. However, Met Office maps did include colours, even before a recent
redesign, and the image on the right is not from the current heat wave. Meterologist Aidan McGivern explained that temperature symbols and
colour scale were tweaked to make it more accessible to those, like him, who
are colourblind. Mr McGivern says at the time the new colours were designed
in autumn 2021, parts of the Middle East and North Africa were above 39C, and
he had expected the darker colours to crop up in Spain from time to time. âI never expected them to be used on UK maps,âhe tweeted,external. Scientists have long warned that climate change is leading to rising temperatures. But some have been surprised at how soon 40C has happened in the UK. The Met Office said these temperatures were thought improbable a decade ago. What does this mean for other long-term predictions, including some that suggest 40C would be happeningevery 3-4 years by 2100,external? Recording a provisional 40C today has made metereologists ""sit up and think"", the Met Office told BBC News ""But this is still expected to be a fairly rare event,"" it said. Currently it's considered around one in every 100 years occurence. The way that modelling works is that we could have one or even several years of extreme temperatures, but they are still considered unusual in the long-term. The challenge now is for scientists to understand if this is a very unusual event, or if it will be occuring much more frequently than expected. Harry LowReporting from Dartford You can smell it in the air, you can see it in the skyline - and the sweat soaked shirts of the firefighters bear testament to their hard work with 18 fire engines sent to this part of Dartford alone. Itâs swelteringly hot here - temperatures reached 37C - and those warm winds weâve been experiencing all day have hampered efforts to douse the flames in north Kent. These heath fires are both a symptom of the heatwave and contributing factor to these unprecedented conditions. Here at Spirits Rest animal sanctuary they put the call out for help earlier on - and how the community has responded. People rallied round, offering to rescue the animals in danger. The chickens, rabbits, cats and 12 horses were all helped to safety. This video can not be played We've been sent this footage of a field fire near Ravensdean in Bedfordshire. Samuel Kumar filmed as smoke drifted across the road, in front of motorists, not far from the village hall.  Drone footage shows of the aftermath of a field fire by Cheshunt Park that started yesterday Firefighters in Hertfordshire are attending several incidents - a combine harvester fire, a car crash, and several field fires. The service asks people calling 999 to be patient after a major incident was declared over the volume of calls it is receiving and responding to. People can help by following heatwave advice and staying safe over the next few hours, it adds. The fire that broke out in Wennington is still burning, and London Fire Brigade are still at the scene this evening. Residents were evacuated from their homes in the village, with the blaze igniting buildings and fields nearby. Around 100 firefighters have been working to bring it under control. But the BBC's Nick Johnson, who is in Wennington, says the situation has become more reassuring in the last half hour. He adds that it appears as if fire crews are starting to pack up and return to their engines after six hours of tackling the blaze. One firefighter helping to extinguish the blaze described the conditions as ""absolute hell"". Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Paris Here in Paris, itâs reached 41C. Walking around the city is
incredibly difficult, it almost feels like you're walking through soup. Most people are opting to take the cityâs metro but even then,
sitting on the train for more than a few stops is quite hard work - many people
have brought fans along with them. In the capitalâs famous Tulleries garden, people have been taking
shade under some of the parkâs trees, making use of all available seating.
Thankfully the water fountains are still working. Meanwhile
at Paris' Gare du Nord station this afternoon, queues of people were seen waiting
for trains. There appear to be quite a few delays - although itâs not clear if
this is weather related. A number of passengers have taken to Twitter claiming that they
have been stuck on trains outside the station. Many of them say the air
conditioning on their train is not working. I myself am on a Eurostar train to London that was delayed for almost two hours. It's just left the station. Images on TV news shows fire destroy homes in the east London village We've heard from some Wennington residents who were evacuated due to the fires in their village. Some have gone to a rescue centre set up in the nearby Premier Inn, including Riminta Maceikaite, 38, and her 13-year-old son Nikas. Riminta saw the devastation unfold on the TV, watching images shot from a helicopter. She says their neighbours' homes have burnt down, but it appears their home is saved. ""When it shows you from the sky it just freaks you out,"" says Riminta. ""Our house is on the news"", says Nikas, ""it's the only house that hasn't been burned so far."" Janet Hickey, 70, and her husband Patrick, 71, had to evacuate their home quickly. 

Janet, who has terminal pancreatic cancer, had to leave all her medicines in the fridge. ""We had to leave everything"", says Patrick. ""We're hoping against hope that our house is still there."" Georgina RannardBBC News Are the fires breaking out in the UK a sign of what is to come? Guillermo Rein, Professor of Fire Science at Imperial College London, told me he expects that more powerful wildfires will gradually take place in the UK due to warmer
and drier vegetation. They will be hotter, with larger flames, and will spread faster, he suggests. ""These
make wildfires more dangerous to people, homes and the environment,"" he adds. The risk inthe south and east of England,externalis particularly expected to increase. To reduce the risk, fire services are asking the public not to light barbecues, campfires or bonfires in the open and to get rid of cigarettes and rubbish, including glass bottles, responsibly. Stephen RyanBBC News Greek
authorities have instructed people in four areas to the east of Athens near
Penteli to evacuate due to forest fires. The 112
emergency service sent mobile phone alerts to people in the areas of Drafi,
Anthousa, Dioni and Dasmari to evacuate. Thick plumes of
smoke and smouldering fires are currently visible to the east of Athens. The fire
service says firefighters in the Attica region, which
includes Athens, are on general alert. In 2018, at
least 100 people died in a massive wildfire in Mati, 18 miles east of the Greek
capital. Hertfordshire Fire Service has declared a major incident. ""The service has received a very high volume of 999 calls, leading to crews attending more than 240 emergency incidents so far today, in part due to the extreme weather. ""These incidents include crop fires, field fires, and road traffic collisions on major roads.
Firefighters have continued to work hard in very difficult conditions,"" it says. Paul KirbyDigital Europe editor The ferocious heatwave that has gripped Western Europe has shifted north and temperatures have climbed towards 40C in several areas. Parishas hit 40C today for only the third time on record.Germanyis having its hottest day of the year so far, and theNetherlandshas recorded its hottest 19 July ever, with 38.9C in Maastricht. One of the big supermarkets has halted home deliveries. The forest fires further south are still burning in France, Spain and Portugal, though. A BBC team has visited one of the five campsites that have burned down in the southwestern Gironde region and you can see what little is left. This video can not be played Heatwave: Surveying the damage after French fires InSpain, which has seen some of the highest temperatures on the continent, more than 60,000 hectares of land have burned in just a week. A fire also broke out in the dunes at theBelgiancoastal resort of De Haan on Tuesday, setting several vehicles alight. Italianforecasters are warning of temperatures as high as 40 to 42C between Wednesday and Friday. Experts at Italy's IlMeteo say new crevasses are opening up on Alpine peaks and ice is melting even on top of Western Europe's highest mountain, Mont Blanc. Todayâs extreme heat has certainly taken its toll on travel, with Network
Rail saying todayâs passenger train numbers are around 40% lower than this time
last week. There have been severe disruptions with all services to and from London
Euston suspended because of a lineside fire caused by overhead electric
cables brought down in Harrow. Similar problems with overhead lines meant trains were trapped on
the tracks in Rugby, Birmingham and Carlisle, resulting in the emergency
evacuations of passengers. As weâve been reporting, there were no rail services into or out
of Kingâs Cross today, and no Thameslink or Great Northern services running north
of London. Over 34 locations exceeded the UK's previous temperature record today, the Met Office says in a Tweet. The national record of 38.7C (101.6F) was topped in places such as Coningsby in Lincolnshire, and Gringley on the Hill, Nottinghamshire. Allow Twitter content?

We've now heard from his niece that the police have gone in to rescue him. Elsewhere in the village, a number of residents are worried about their pets, and there's concern for the livestock in a couple of nearby farms. There's a sense of the village being encircled by flames â it is boiling hot and tinder dry. But remarkably, villagers are very good-spirited, perhaps because there's a sense they really helped each other out in their moment of need. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Construction workers will endure soaring temperatures over the next few days An amber extreme heat health warning has been issued for large parts of England from Thursday, with temperatures set to soar to 35C (95F) in some areas. This is the second such alert in recent weeks. The Met Office said while conditions would be below record highs, this heatwave could last longer. A heatwave is defined as: above average temperatures sustained for three days or more. So what does that mean for people going to work in the heat? No law in the UK says a given temperature is too hot or too cold to work. Butguidance from,externalthe Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a workplace's temperature must be ""reasonable"" with ""clean and fresh air"". In cold weather, it says you shouldn't be asked to work in less than 16C - or 13C if the job is mostly physical. But it doesn't mention a top temperature. A number of MPs recently backed a campaign for alegal upper limit of 30C in most workplaces,external- or 27C for those doing strenuous work - but there's no sign of legislation on that for now. What do heatwaves do to the body and who is at risk? Whether your employer accepts that it's too hot to go to work is ""a matter for them"", according to Mark Scoggins, solicitor advocate at Fisher Scoggins Waters. ""The HSE won't issue any guidance on that and they shouldn't,"" he adds. But theHealth and Safety at Work Act,externalmeans bosses are generally responsible for employees' welfare. The Unite union says employers have ""a legal and moral duty to ensure workers' health is not damaged during the current hot weather"". And following the heatwave in July, the HSE has said employers should be responding to the changing environment by planning adaptations such as ventilation and air conditioning. The HSE encourages staff to talk to their bosses if the workplace isn't comfortable. The HSE says employers should let staff work flexibly where possible - shifting their hours to minimise working at the hottest times of day. Relaxing formal dress codes and moving workstations away from hot places or out of direct sunlight can also help. Where possible, windows should be opened, radiators should be switched off, and fans or air-conditioning units should be available. The TUC, the umbrella body for the UK's trades unions, says businesses should let office staff work from home or adjust their hours to avoid rush-hour travel. If you are working from home, close curtains to block out the sun, and in the morning and evening open windows on opposite sides of your home, to let hot air out and cold air in. Use a fan to encourage airflow. How to keep your cool when the office heats up How air conditioning changed the world The Unite union says manual workers are particularly vulnerable. ""Employers should consider rescheduling work to cooler times of the day, and provide cooling areas such as shade or air-conditioned rest rooms. ""If workers show any signs of heat exhaustion, the employer should immediately ensure they stop work and are allowed to recover, without loss of pay."" Watch out for heat exhaustion and heatstroke Wildfires broke out in several locations in July stretching fire service resources But Justin Sullivan, chair of the Construction Industry Council chair, says building sites' operating hours are often limited by planning laws designed to minimise their impact on surrounding communities. So starting early or finishing late isn't always an option. However, he agrees that all workers should have access to water, protective clothing and shade. Some materials, like paint and concrete, can't be used on extremely hot days as the heat causes the materials to fail. He says all site managers have temperature gauges, and switch workers to different jobs where possible. Lifeguards are especially important in hot weather, when more people are tempted to swim, but they also need to look after themselves. All lifeguards should have cold water, a wide-brimmed hat, a long-sleeved top, polarised sunglasses, a high factor sunscreen and access to shade, according to Jo Talbot from the Royal Life Saving Society UK. They should also have regular breaks. There is no official advice in place instructing you not to travel. Some disruption to transport services is likely, although not on the scale of the last heatwave. Network Rail says it is not planning blanket speed restrictions because temperatures are not predicted to hit their trigger point, although temperatures could be high enough to prompt ""spot"" speed restrictions. Railway tracks get a lot hotter than the air temperature; during the last period of hot weather hundreds of trains were cancelled and delayed. At airports in July the scorching heat also impacted runways causing disruption. National Highways is advising drivers to plan their journeys over the next few days in advance and carry out basic checks to ensure vehicles are roadworthy before setting off, including keeping coolant and engine oil topped up. Keep children out of sun as heatwave hits - NHS How does sunscreen work? Tips for sleeping in the heat There are some simple things individuals can do to make the heat more bearable. Dr Anna Mavrogianni, who researches sustainable building and urban design at University College London, says as well as avoiding direct sunlight and opening windows, it can help toswitch off electrical equipment that's not in use, like photocopiers. Light-coloured clothing is cooler than dark, as it absorbs less heat. Choose looser-fitting garments made from natural materials like cotton and linen, which are more breathable. To stay hydrated, drink water before you feel thirsty, and avoid heavy meals which require more digestion, in turnproducing more body heat.

"Aerial footage showed a large rectangular area on the surface being examined by airport staff Flights have resumed at London Luton Airport following repairs after high temperatures lifted a small section of the runway. The airport said departing flights resumed at 17:40 BST, with inbound resuming 15 minutes later. Easyjet and Ryanair both diverted some of their arrivals to other airports. The damage occurred as the Met Office issueda red extreme heat warningin much of England, with temperatures set to hit 41C (106F) on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, an airport spokesperson said flights had been temporarily suspended ""to allow for an essential runway repair after high surface temperatures caused a small section to lift"". Easyjet said three inbound flights to Luton had been diverted to nearby airports, and flights to and from Belfast, Milan and Palma due to fly were ""unfortunately now unable to operate"". Ryanair said it had not cancelled any flights from the airport but had diverted a small number of inbound flights to Stansted. Several flights were delayed and some cancelled at Luton Airport Pictures on social media showed a packed terminal as passengers waited for their flights to resume. Alison Cybe, 39, from Brighton, was caught up in the delays. She had been due to fly to Naples at 15.15 BST but was informed her flight was delayed due to the ""melted"" runway. Talking from the departure lounge, she said: ""It's hot, but the number of people in the departure area makes it even hotter. ""People are just feeling pretty fed-up.

"With a heatwave predicted to bring temperatures above 41C to parts of the UK over the next few days, how can the nation keep cool and carry on? Temperatures could be thehighest ever recorded in the UKthis week, beating the current record temperature from 2019, when a high of 38.7C was recorded in Cambridge. The Met Office has issued ared extreme heat warning,externalfor many parts of England, from London and the south-east up to York and Manchester. Amber warnings are also currently in place across the rest of England, all of Wales, and parts of Scotland. For those hoping to be given a day off, unfortunately, there are currentlyno laws in the UK,externalabout when it is too hot to work. Employers should provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a limit cannot be introduced because some industries have to work in high temperatures. It can, however, be too cold to work. Government guidance recommends a minimum working temperature of 16C (61F), or 13C, if employees are doing physical work. As avoiding work in the heat isn't an option, then there's the inevitable dilemma of what to wear.

How to sleep in hot weather What you should - and shouldn't do - to stay cool Reality Check: How does sunscreen work? Send your photos/videos of the hot weather toyourpics@bbc.co.uk A big part of the problem is humidity, which makes it hard for sweat to evaporate. To try and keep your bedroom as cool as possible, shut your blinds or curtains during the day - although doing so with metallic blinds and dark curtains could make the room hotter. You could also open windows on the shady side of your home and close them on the sunny side - and then open all the windows before going to bed to get a thorough breeze. That's not an option open to everyone, so an electric fan can be a handy substitute. A fan will help move the air around your body and increase the chance of sweat evaporating. Other recommendations include: Putting reflective material or shades outside bedroom windows Having a lukewarm shower before bed Using thin cotton sheets Wearing lightweight materials for bed as they can keep you cooler - as can sleeping naked and avoiding sharing space with partners Putting your sheets in the freezer for a spell before you go to bed When it comes to children, the NHS says a cool bath before bedtime can help. Pyjamas and bedclothes should be kept to a minimum, and if a baby kicks off its bedcovers during the night then they could sleep in just a nappy - babies sleep most comfortably when their room is between 16C (61F) and 20C (68F). As if you don't have enough to think about with a baby, a heatwave brings an added risk of dehydration, sunburn and sunstroke. The NHS recommends,externalkeeping all babies under six months out of direct sunlight, and older infants should be kept out of the sun as much as possible, particularly between 11:00 and 15:00. They should be kept in the shade or under a sunshade if they're in a buggy or pushchair. This video can not be played How to keep your baby safe in hot weather Sun cream with a high sun protection factor should be applied regularly - particularly if children are in water. All children should be given plenty of fluids and the NHS says babies who are being breastfed may want to feed more than usual, but will not need water as well as breast milk. If they are bottle feeding, babies can be given cooled boiled water as well as their usual milk feeds. This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool Dressing for the weather may sound obvious, but clothes can make a real difference to how our bodies handle heat. As tempting as it might be to strip off, you may be at greater risk of sunburn which can affect your body's ability to cool itself. It's best to choose light colours over dark - which absorb heat more - and loose garments that can allow air to get in. Hats with ventilation will also help and fabric choice is key - materials like cotton and linen are more breathable, absorbing sweat and encouraging ventilation. This is fast becoming the first question asked when extreme weather events strike - and the answer remains the same. It is almost impossible to say that a specific event, like the current hot spell, is caused by global heating. However there are some very strong connections to human-induced warming that increase the likelihood of such weather. Last year's blazing summer in the UKwas said by the Met Office to have been made 30 times more likelybecause of emissions from human activity. And the Met Office also said warm spells in the UK have more than doubled in length - increasing from 5.3 days in the 1961-1990 period to more than 13 days in the decade from 2008 to 2017. The heatwave also follows on from a previousrecord-breaking June across Europe, which was 1C above the long term trend and an incredible 3C above the average from 1850-1900. When researchers carried out a rapid analysis to see the impact of climate change on the June heatwave,they concluded it was made at least five times more likelyby warming. It may well be that the current period of extremely hot weather is purely down to natural variability, said BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath. But even if so, the fingerprints of fossil fuel burning are heavily influencing the background - and making such events much more likely. Strawberries are among the foods recommended during a heatwave Hydration is key. Our bodies sweat more in hot weather, so it is really important to restock lost water levels. Don't rely on your physical thirst to judge how dehydrated you are as it's not a very good indicator(urine colour,externalis better), so you should try to drink plenty before you feel parched. And try not to consume too much alcohol. The NHS says good drink options include water, lower-fat milks and tea and coffee. Foods with high water content such as strawberries, cucumber, courgette, lettuce, celery and melon can also help you stay hydrated. Try to avoid large, heavy meals laden with carbohydrates and protein because they take more digesting, which in turn produces more body heat. Although it may not be what you fancy on sweaty days,scientific research suggests spicy and hot foods can actually help cool you down.,external More tips on what to eat in a heatwave from BBC Good Food,external Dogs in particular struggle in the hot weather because they are not able to cool down through sweating, as humans do, and those breeds with long coats are especially prone to overheating. The RSPCA has a series of tips,externalfor keeping animals safe and comfortable during the heatwave. These include avoiding leaving animals in hot cars, conservatories, outbuildings or caravans, which, even just for a short while, can be fatal due to rising temperatures. It also says it is best to walk a dog early in the morning or late in the evening when it is cooler, as paws can burn on a hot pavement. Exercise can also increase the risk of heatstroke. This video can not be played Five ways to keep your dog cool this summer For those pets kept in cages, hutches, fish tanks or other enclosures, they should be kept out of direct sunlight. And it's not just humans who need sun cream, it might also be beneficial to apply some to your pet. Animals' exposed spots, such as ears and noses, are vulnerable to sunburn and - just like people - sun damage can lead to skin cancer. The Blue Cross saywhite cats are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer,externalfrom sunlight exposure than others. This video can not be played Dog owners have been urged to check pavements using the ""seven-second test"" This video can not be played Humidity explainer Most people in the UK aren't used to such extreme temperatures, which can cause heat exhaustion and, more seriously, heatstroke. Signs of heat exhaustion can include tiredness or weakness, feeling faint or dizzy, having muscle cramps or feeling sick. If left untreated, the more serious symptoms of heatstroke can develop, including confusion, disorientation and even a loss of consciousness. Those suffering the signs of heat exhaustion should go to a cool place with air conditioning or shade, use a cool, wet sponge or flannel and drink fluids - ideally water, fruit juice or a rehydration drink, such as a sports drink. Those most vulnerable include the elderly, people with conditions such as diabetes, young children and people working or exercising outdoors. NHS guidance on dealing with heatstroke,external If you choose to exercise, listen to your body - it will be under greater strain than in usual conditions so your usual limits may be different. Aim to do it when the weather is at its coolest: early or late in the day. If you do intensive exercise, drink lots of water. Isotonic sports drinks can also help ensure you are rehydrating properly. Cold showers and blotting with damp, cold materials can also work wonders. In general, stay in the shade or in air-conditioned places as much as possible, especially at the hottest part of the day. The risk of sunburn depends on how sensitive your skin is, and how strong the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays are. The UV index will vary, depending on where you are in the world, the time of year, what the weather is like, the time of day, and how high up you are compared to sea level. During the UK's summer months, the sun's UV rays are strongest between 11:00 and 15:00. Cancer Research UK suggests,externalusing a simple ""shadow rule"" to estimate the strength of the sun. It suggests that if your shadow is shorter than your height, the sun's UV rays are strong - and you are therefore more likely to burn. How much sun cream to use and what to do if you burn There are lots of ""extended wear"" sunscreens on the market that advertise themselves as being for use ""once a day"", or claiming to last for eight hours. But dermatologists recommend that these products should still be applied at least every two hours, like any other sunscreen, since the risk that you may have missed a spot - or that it will rub or wash off in that time - are too high. The British Association of Dermatologists says sunscreen with SPF 30 is a ""satisfactory form of sun protection in addition to protective shade and clothing"" and that it should be reapplied at least every two hours, no matter what SPF it is. There are lots of places that rate sunscreen brands, including consumer websiteWhich?,external. However,the British Association of Dermatologists,external(BAD) says in general you should look for two ratings on bottles of sun creams. The sun emits two types of ultraviolet rays - UVA (most commonly responsible for premature ageing and wrinkles) and UVB (which causes most sunburn). The BAD says you need to be protected from both. The sun protection factor (SPF) offers guidance on a cream's protection against UVB rays, while a star system indicates the level of protection against UVA rays.

"This video can not be played Watch: Tory leadership rivals step up their attacks during ITV debate The next live TV Tory leadership debate has been cancelled, after host Sky News said Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss declined to take part. The two contenders clashed repeatedly during an ITV debate on Sunday over each other's economic plans and record in office. It comes amid concerns in the Tory party about infighting in the contest. The five remaining candidates face another round of voting among Tory MPs later to stay in the race. The heated hour-long ITV debate laid bare divisions between ex-chancellor Mr Sunak and Foreign Secretary Ms Truss over the future of the economy. Mr Sunak also clashed with Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt over her plan to scrap his economic rule of only borrowing to invest. Tory race gets personal in latest TV debate Who could be the next prime minister? Chris Mason: TV debate turns colleagues into opponents Along with fellow contenders Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch, the trio had been invited to take part in a live debate on Sky News on Tuesday. It is understood that neither Mr Sunak nor Ms Truss had confirmed they would take part in the event, which was due to be hosted by presenter Kay Burley. But the event is now off, after Sky said their campaigns confirmed they did not want to participate. Mr Sunak is in pole position to secure a place in the final two places after MPs finish their voting rounds his week. The next stage in the contest sees around 160,000 party members picking the winner in a ballot. Ms Truss, who finished third last time, is locked an an increasingly bitter battle with second-placed Ms Mordaunt to secure a place in the run-off. It is understood that Ms Truss wants to focus on hustings between Tory MPs, whilst a source close to Mr Sunak said he would be ""happy"" to do more debates if he qualifies for the final two. A source in Ms Mordaunt's campaign said she hoped there would be ""ample opportunity"" for media scrutiny later in the contest, adding: ""MPs aren't just picking a new leader, but picking the nation's new PM."" The stakes are high and time is short - so the TV debates so far have been tense. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss in particular have been willing to knock lumps out of each other. That's left some Tory MPs nervous that the party will emerge from this process badly damaged. Remember: whoever wins, these candidates are going to have to work together in some form. Mr Sunak and Ms Truss haven't said the brutal nature of Sunday's debate was the reason they don't want to take part on Tuesday. But this has not been a friendly exchange of ideas so far. It's felt more like a battle for the future of the Tory Party. Some Tory MPs will be relieved the won't be more of it in public tomorrow. Others will accuse Mr Sunak and Ms Truss of dodging public scrutiny. The cancellation comes amid concerns in the Tory party about the tone of the campaign. As well as the two heated live TV debates, the past week has also seen supporters of the candidates disparage their rivals through briefings to the newspapers or during media interviews. In the latest personal attack on Monday, Tugendhat supporter and International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan questioned Ms Mordaunt's record as a minister at her department. Speaking on LBC radio, she accused Ms Mordaunt of focusing on her leadership bid for the last few months, leaving other ministers to ""pick up the pieces"" of her departmental work. The claim was rejected by former minister Harriett Baldwin, an ally of Ms Mordaunt, who said she was ""one of the most hard-working ministers and constituency MPs I know"". Ahead of the TV debate cancellation, former cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said the campaign had so far been ""plagued by allegations of dark arts and dirty tricks"". Writing in the Times,external, he added that ""aggressive briefing and counter-briefing only adds to Labour's research folders"" and would prove a ""gift to the opposition"". Warning that rival parties would ""take any opportunity they can to drive a wedge between rival campaigns and exploit division"", he added that the rest of the contest ""cannot be characterised by personal attacks and propaganda"". Opposition parties criticised Tory candidates over the cancellation of the debate, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer saying the withdrawals demonstrated a lack of confidence. ""I can see, based on what I've seen in the debates so far, why they want to do so because this is a party that is out of ideas, out of purpose, they're tearing each other apart,"" he told reporters. Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey accused contenders of wanting to ""duck scrutiny"" and ""taking people for granted"".

"The price of petrol has fallen from record highs, leading to reductions worth Â£1.50 per tank, according to the AA motoring group. Average pump prices are down to 188.76p per litre for petrol and 196.96p per litre for diesel. At the start of the month, prices were 191.53p for petrol and 199.07p for diesel. The AA said falling wholesale costs could lead to savings of Â£10 off a tank within a fortnight. Five tips for saving petrol money examined Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Petrol pricing is cause for concern, warns watchdog Refineries cash in as petrol prices soar Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine and moves to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian oil. With food and energy bills also surging, many households are under pressure. Wholesale petrol peaked above Â£1 per litre at the start of June, but dropped to below 80p per litre for much of last week. Wholesale prices have fallen as the price of oil has dropped back. Fears of a recession in the US have hit demand for oil, and the price of Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil - fell below $95 a barrel last week for the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman, said: ""Wholesale petrol's trajectory, if sustained, would lead to savings of a tenner off a tank from the record highs, providing the fuel trade is prepared to pass them on."" ""The problem is that, in many places, the price cuts are quite simply not happening despite more than six weeks of falling costs,"" he added. Earlier this month, the UK's competition watchdogsaid it would investigate petrol and diesel pricingafter it found ""cause for concern in some parts"" of the industry. The Competition and Markets Authority said it had discovered a sharp rise in prices once fuel had been processed by oil refineries. It also found ""significant differences in price"" between forecourts in ""many rural and urban areas"". However, it said retailers had passed on the 5p fuel duty cut to motorists. Part of the reason that petrol prices have surged is down to the high price of crude oil, which has been driven up by the war in Ukraine. David Cox, an independent energy analyst, warned that while oil prices may have come off their recent highs, they are likely to remain elevated due to the ongoing conflict. ""It's difficult to see how crude does anything but go up, while the war rages, and that's not good news in the medium term for petrol prices,"" he said. The loss of Russian supplies has stretched an industry which was already at full capacity, and it will be difficult to replace that supply, Mr Cox warned. ""The trouble is, you just can't replace the volume of oil that Russia produces,"" he said. He said even with efforts from the US to persuade Saudi Arabia to export more oil, the price was unlikely to shift back. ""There might be minor changes up and down, but essentially crude is likely to keep marching upwards and that will keep the pressure on petrol prices upwards too.""

The Competition and Markets Authority said it had discovered a sharp rise in prices once fuel had been processed by oil refineries. It also found ""significant differences in price"" between forecourts in ""many rural and urban areas"". However, it said retailers had passed on the 5p fuel duty cut to motorists. Part of the reason that petrol prices have surged is down to the high price of crude oil, which has been driven up by the war in Ukraine. David Cox, an independent energy analyst, warned that while oil prices may have come off their recent highs, they are likely to remain elevated due to the ongoing conflict. ""It's difficult to see how crude does anything but go up, while the war rages, and that's not good news in the medium term for petrol prices,"" he said. The loss of Russian supplies has stretched an industry which was already at full capacity, and it will be difficult to replace that supply, Mr Cox warned. ""The trouble is, you just can't replace the volume of oil that Russia produces,"" he said. He said even with efforts from the US to persuade Saudi Arabia to export more oil, the price was unlikely to shift back. ""There might be minor changes up and down, but essentially crude is likely to keep marching upwards and that will keep the pressure on petrol prices upwards too.""

"More households in Britain are cancelling video streaming subscriptions due to the rising cost of living, new research suggests. A total of 1.66 million services were canned in the second quarter of 2022, market research firm Kantar said. Under-24s were the most likely age group to cancel, the data showed. More than a third of cancellations were attributed to cutting costs, with people budgeting for higher prices and energy bills.

""It is increasingly less about taking out Netflix or Prime Video as an overall entertainment solution and more about wanting to watch Stranger Things or Reacher,"" said Dominic Sunnebo, global insight director at Kantar. ""This puts significant pressure on these services to ensure they are able to quickly entice them to stay subscribing,"" he added.

Mr Sunnebo said there are ""definite signs"" that consumers are making more short-term and content-driven decisions over subscriptions. Amazon Prime showed the largest share of new subscriptions, attracting 25.9 per cent which Kantar said was due to its free trial period and free delivery option. Kantar also said people surveyed had said they were more satisfied with Disney+ than Netflix because of the quality of its shows. Cancelling subscriptions to switch to another service was also slightly down year on year, according to the research. Some 12% of new subscribers in the latest quarter cancelled one service but and took out an alternative, compared to 14% in the same period last year. Meanwhile, Netflix teamed up with Microsoft last week to offer a cheaper subscription plan to customers that will show adverts. The streaming giant said its service will be an ""addition"" to its existing plans, which do not include adverts but has not yet revealed how much it plans to charge subscribers for the new service. Netflix announced the move after it reported its first subscriber loss in more than a decade and cut hundreds of jobs earlier this year.

"Jeremy Hartwell appeared in the second series of Netflix dating show Love Is Blind A contestant on the second series of Netflix show Love Is Blind is suing the streaming service over alleged breaches of labour laws. Jeremy Hartwell alleges that producers encouraged the cast to drink alcohol, while limiting access to food and water and underpaying them. Production company Kinetic Contenttold Variety,externalthere was ""absolutely no merit"" to Mr Hartwell's allegations. ""We will vigorously defend the claims,"" a spokesman added. Netflix have also been contacted by the BBC for comment. The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles, names both Netflix and Kinetic Content as defendants alongside Kinetic's casting company Delirium TV. In Love Is Blind, the contestants meet their dates but are unable to see each other and have to converse solely through speakers. The candidates then couple up but must get engaged before they are allowed to meet face-to-face. Some couples end up marrying on-screen while others break up. Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed married after meeting on the first series and are still together Mr Hartwell told CNN,externalin an interview at the weekend that he had to try to fight the effects of sleep deprivation after long hours filming under bright lights. He said he could not access food and water, but alcohol was available and even encouraged to be consumed on an empty stomach. Mr Hartwell added that the way the cast's luggage was searched was reminiscent of being on a ""boot camp"". The lawsuit,obtained by People,,externalclaims the cast were ""regularly refused timely food and water... while on set, severely restricting the availability of hydration opportunities. ""Even at the hotel living quarters, food was restricted to the point of severe hunger."" According to the lawsuit, the contestants should have been treated as employees rather than independent contractors under California state law because producers made all the decisions about the nature of the cast's work and how many hours they worked. Hartwell's lawsuit reportedly seeks unpaid wages plus financial compensation for missed meal breaks and rest periods, as well as unspecified monetary damages for unfair business practices and civil penalties for labour code violations. According to Kinetic, which is also behind Married at First Sight, Hartwell was in the show for less than a week ""after he failed to develop a significant connection with any other participant"". ""While we will not speculate as to his motives for filing the lawsuit, there is absolutely no merit to Mr. Hartwell's allegations, and we will vigorously defend against his claims,"" their statement read. Love Is Blind was nominated for an Emmy award - outstanding structured reality programme - last week. The ceremony takes place in September.

"Robert Hattersley brought a smile to many people, his family have said The family of a 13-year-old boy who died in a river say they are ""absolutely devastated"" by their loss. Robert Hattersley, of Crawcrook, Tyne and Wear, got into difficulty in the River Tyne near Ovingham, Northumberland, at about 16:15 GMT on Sunday. His family said he was ""so kind and loving"" and ""brought a smile to so many people's faces"". Northumbria Police described his death as ""absolutely tragic"". In a statement released through the police, Robert's family said: ""It is impossible to put into words the heartbreak we are feeling - Robert was so kind and loving. We are absolutely devastated by what has happened. ""He brought a smile to so many people's faces and he will be missed by absolutely everyone who knew and loved him."" Police, fire and ambulance crews were at the scene on Sunday The family also thanked the emergency services and volunteers who searched for and found Robert after the alarm was raised when he went missing. Northumbria Police said it did not believe there to be any third party involvement and a report would be made for the coroner. Det Ch Insp Martin Brooks said: ""This is an absolutely tragic incident and our thoughts are with Robert's family at this absolutely horrendous time. ""We will continue to support them in any way that we can, as they attempt to process the events of the last 24 hours. ""I would like to thank every organisation who assisted us with our searches, including all the volunteers. ""Your support is absolutely vital and it is hugely appreciated. It is with great sadness that we could not provide a more positive update."" Flowers from Robert's friends and family have been left beside the river Robert's death has prompted calls for improved river safety education especially on that part of the Tyne. Angie Scott, who represents Prudhoe North on Northumberland County Council, had to be rescued while swimming in that area when she was 14. She said another boy had to be pulled from the same stretch of water recently and urged people not swim there, even if tempted by the current heatwave. ""It looks a lovely part of the Tyne but it is so dangerous,"" Ms Scott told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. She said she would look at safety measures in the area including signage warning of the danger. Paul Hedley, the chief fire officer for Northumberland Fire and Rescue Service, said the ""absolute tragedy"" underlines the ""very real dangers presented by rivers and the sea"". ""The water may look calm on the surface, but there can be strong undercurrents that could pull even a strong swimmer under the water,"" he said, adding: ""Even when the weather feels very hot, the water may feel warm on the surface, but just a few feet below the surface it can be icy cold - affecting the stamina and strength of even strong swimmers.""

"The Conservatives have ditched their levelling up agenda to tackle regional inequalities, Labour has said, as it unveiled a policy to help local groups buy assets in their area. Shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said government promises ""made with a bang are fading with a whimper"". She also announced plans to tackle ""the challenge of second homes in coastal and rural areas"" through licensing. Levelling Up Secretary Greg Clark said Labour's claims were nonsense. ""We're pressing full steam ahead with levelling up and the second round of ourÂ£4.8bn Levelling Up Fund opened on Friday.,external"" He also said the government's Community Ownership Fund was helping local people ""take control of clubs, venues and other prized assets"". What is levelling up and how is it going? Levelling up to cost more than thought - report Cost of living could deepen inequality, says Gove The Conservative policy of levelling up aims to close the gap between rich and poor parts of the country, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies says are greater in the UK than other comparable countries. It formed a key part of Boris Johnson's general election campaign in 2019, which saw the Tories win seats in traditional Labour strongholds in the Midlands and the north of England. In his resignation speech on 7 July, Mr Johnson said that while ""genius and talent and enthusiasm"" were evenly distributed throughout the population, opportunity was not. He urged his successor to ""keep levelling up, keep unleashing the potential of every part of the UK"". Monday's speech by Ms Nandy in Darlington is part of a Labour effort to win back seats lost to the Conservatives in the 2019 election. In it she argued that the current Conservative leadership contest spells the ""final nail in the coffin"" for levelling up, as contenders promise tax cuts and deregulation. ""In short, the Tories' commitment to levelling up is dead. But levelling up is not dead. Not for the millions who voted for change - and who need and deserve to see it delivered."" Ms Nandy introduced a Labour ""right to buy"" policy which would give communities first refusal when Assets of Community Value (ACV) come up for sale. Legend has it the Crown Posada pub - which has been listed as an Asset of Community Value - was bought by a Spanish sea captain for his Tyneside mistress Currently, community groups and parish councils can nominate buildings or land to be deemed an ACV if it is or has been used to ""further social wellbeing or social interests of the local community and could so in the future"". If an ACV is put on for sale, local groups are given six months to determine if they can raise the money to make a purchase and put in a bid. During this time the owner cannot sell the asset - but when the time elapses, they are free to sell to whoever they choose. In 2015 a report by Parliament's Communities Committee raised concern that the six month time period was too short and meant disadvantaged areas were making less use of the rights. Labour would expand the time period from six months to 12 and give local groups powers to force the sale of land or buildings - such as long term vacant high street property - in a state of significant disrepair. Labour says it wants to deal with problems caused by second homes in costal areas such as St Ives in Cornwall Buildings recently designated Assets of Community Valueinclude Charlton football ground The Valley, the skate park in the Southbank, central London andthe Crown Posada,one of Newcastle's oldest pubs. The party has also commissioned Mark Gregory, the former chief economist of consulting firm Ernst & Young, to review how community groups ""can best leverage private investment to buy assets"". Ms Nandy said the party's policy will be ""the first step on the way to greater financial autonomy for our towns, villages, and cities"". The Wigan MP also announced plans to ""tackle the challenge of second homes in costal and rural areas"" in England by introducing a licensing system to identify genuine holiday lets, as opposed to second homeowners who ""leave properties empty while pretending to rent them out to holidaymakers"". The Labour government in Walesis planning to introduce a similar schemewhich would also allow councils to set a limit on the number of second homes. Local authorities in Wales have been given the power to increase council tax on second homes by 300% from next year. What is levelling up and who is it helping?

"Saffron Phillips says that before the chemical incident her role as a cook and kitchen worker meant she would regularly use stairs A woman put in a coma after a chlorine gas leak at the London Aquatics Centre, which left 29 people in hospital, says she fears she could have died. About 200 people were evacuated from the venue at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Stratford, when a""high quantity"" of gas was releasedon 23 March. Catering worker Saffron Phillips, who is asthmatic, says she can no longer go upstairs without feeling breathless. Operator Greenwich Leisure Limited (GLL) said an inquiry was ongoing. Newham Council's environmental health department is also continuing to investigate the leak, which was declared a major incident on the site of the 2012 London Olympic Games. Almost 50 people were treated by paramedics for breathing difficulties and people could be seen being placed in ambulances while others wore blankets. Residents in the area were asked to close windows and doors. Ms Phillips, 27, of East Ham, said the lack of oxygen she suffered during the gas leak was believed to have resulted in serious muscle weakness, which would take several months to recover from. She also suffered chemical burns on her arms. ""I could have died because of the gas leak at the London Aquatics Centre,"" said Ms Phillips, who is bringing legal action against GLL. Emergency services installed a large cordon after the leak Her solicitor, Charlie Holt from Leigh Day, said her firm had found chemical incidents at swimming pools were not uncommon. On the day of the leak, and once outside the building, the smell of chemicals overwhelmed her, Ms Phillips said. She could not breathe, began choking and gagging, and suddenly fainted. Building site medical emergency workers helped her to a minibus, which took her to an ambulance that went to Newham University Hospital. On the way, she said she was given nebulisers and steroids and then put into an induced coma. She said she had been told she would suffer memory problems for the next few years. This video can not be played Major incident declared at London Aquatics Centre Since the gas leak, Ms Phillips has attended hospital on a number of occasions because of breathing difficulties and has been receiving counselling forpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).,external ""I had to be rushed to hospital and only the emergency care I received on that day saved me,"" she said. ""I still have pain in my chest, throat, I can't stand up for a long time or walk for a long time. ""The GP has increased my asthma medication as a result. I have pain in my chest when sitting and standing and the GP has given me codeine to see if that will help relax me. ""I had antibiotics as I had a chest infection also. I had chemical burns on my arms, which thankfully have now healed."" The leak was declared a major incident for emergency services Ms Holt said: ""Leisure centres need to pay heed to their responsibility to ensure the safety of their customers, staff and workers and the general public who live and work in the surrounding buildings. ""The highest levels of safety need to be applied in the handling of chemicals in areas near to public use."" GLL confirmed the investigation remained ongoing and did not comment further. Ms Phillips is not the first person to take legal action against GLL since the leak. Tess Riley, who is pregnant,was taking her daughter Ruby for swimming lessons at centre when the leak occurred and has said she will sue the firm. She described ""apocalyptic"" and ""horrifying"" scenes as people ran to safety and was now worried her unborn baby had been exposed to the gas.

Conservative Party members will then pick a winner, determining their next leader and the UK's new prime minister. Rishi Sunak still leads the way in voting and he's turned to Twitter to react to the latest result of polling among Conservative MPs. He says he's got ""great momentum after a tough set of debates"".

The government haswona vote of confidence in itself, by349votes to238. It had been expected to win the motion as it had the support of many Tory MPs. Had it lost, the country would have almost certainly faced an early general election. MPs have just filed out of the chamber to start voting on whether they have confidence in the government. The government is expected to win, as the Conservatives still have a large majority. But if it doesn't, it will likely spell an early general election. In a slight quirk, the government brought forward the motion itself after it rejected Labour's proposed wording, which contained a specific reference to the prime minister. We'll bring you the result as soon as we get it. With Boris Johnson back in the Commons, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab says he ""proudly"" defends the government under his leadership. Raab says the government has ""steered the country through some of the most difficult challenges in living memory"" and has got the big calls right on issues including vaccines and lockdowns. Back in the House of Commons, MPs are still debating a confidence motion in the government. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner says the prime minister is not fit for office but the Conservatives plan to ""indulge"" him for the next seven weeks, until his successor is chosen. Describing him as a ""caretaker known for no care"", she says: ""Every day he's in Downing Street he does more damage. He should be long gone."" ""Let us tell this prime minister to go, and to go now. Enough is enough."" With the latest round of Tory leadership votes revealed, and with four runners left in the race, who are the candidates hoping to progress further in the race? Rishi Sunakis the former chancellor who launched his leadership bid with a focus on the economy, ruling out tax cuts before public finances improve. Despite his reputation being dented by acontroversy over his wife's tax affairs- and beingfined for breaching lockdown rules- Sunak currently leads after the latest round of voting by Tory MPs, with backers including former leadership rivals Grant Shapps and Jeremy Hunt, as well as Deputy PM Dominic Raab. Trade ministerPenny Mordaunthas, so far, been the shock contender. She has come second in all three rounds of voting, and was for a time the bookies' favourite. She has promised to cut VAT on fuel and to raise the basic and middle earner income tax thresholds in line with inflation. Her supporters include senior backbenchers Andrea Leadsom and David Davis. A Royal Navy reservist, Mordaunt made history in 2019 when she became the UKâs first female defence secretary â a post she held for just 85 days until Boris Johnson replaced then PM Theresa May. Foreign SecretaryLiz Trussdecided to lead on promising immediate tax cuts, a reversal of the National Insurance hike and a long-term commitment to reducing the size of the state. Popular among Conservative Party members, Truss secured earlybacking from Boris Johnson loyalistsNadine Dorries, the culture secretary, and Jacob Rees-Mogg â as well as former leadership hopeful and staunch Brexiteer Suella Braverman. Former equalities ministerKemi Badenochhas pledged tax cuts and low regulation â and repeatedlychallenged Mordaunt on her record when it comes to gender self-identification for transgender people. A former software engineer, she became an MP in 2017 and went on to become equalities minister in 2021 then minister for levelling up under Michael Gove, who has backed her leadership bid. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady reveals the latest round of Tory leadership results Liz Truss gained seven votes in this round, coming third with 71. Chloe Smith, who's campaigning for the foreign secretary, tells the BBC ""youâve seen people coming toward
Liz"". ""The key point people see is experience, her wide range of experience across
departments, she's trusted to deliver from day one"". When challenged on the fact that Truss still came third, again behind Penny Mordaunt, she adds ""Lizâs
result is going up, Pennyâs has come down by one"". But MPs who voted for Tom Tugendhat may prefer to back Mordaunt, rather than Truss, in the next round. Smith however says the Truss campaign ""is a very broad
church, so I'd say to friends and colleagues: please come and look at Lizâs wide
range of experience"". It's the end of the road for Tom Tugendhat, who has just tweeted his reaction to being eliminated: ""Although it wasnât to be today, I am immensely proud of the positive vision we put forward for our country."" In an accompanying video, he says he won't talk about who he is backing yet: ""I'll listen to what they have to say and I'll be making my judgement later.""

Chris MasonPolitical editor Sir Graham Brady reveals the latest round of results Tonight's result was very close to what many here expected. Tom Tugendhat knocked out, and the remaining four in the same order as they were in the second round. But let's look at the numbers in a bit more detail. TeamSunakappear happy. The challenge with being the frontrunner is the focus and novelty shifts to those chasing the other place in the final two, and you potentially lose your ooomph. ""Thatâs a cracking result - Rishi gaining most - even given Suellaâs voters least likely to be attracted,"" one former cabinet minister backing Sunak tells me. ""He had a lead of 18 over 2nd placed Penny on Friday. Now itâs 33. Momentum."" PennyMordaunthas gone backwards â losing a vote compared to last time. This has cheered TeamTruss, who point out they have narrowed the gap to Mordaunt ""pretty considerably"" and they say there is ""all to play for."" But KemiBadenoch, who finished fourth, is only 13 votes behind the foreign secretary. A Team Badenoch campaign source tells me: âKemi is pleased to have taken it to the next vote. She has momentum over both Mordaunt and Truss. Itâs all to play for and Kemi is in it to win."" And then there is TomTugendhat. He has bowed out with warm words about the contest and his colleagues â but hasn't yet said who he will now back. There are 31 votes looking for a home tomorrow, in round four. And so five become four as we approach the final two votes for MPs â tomorrow and Wednesday â which will determine the two contenders who will be picked from by Conservative Party members. Mordaunt supporter Harriett Baldwin speaks to BBC News Penny Mordaunt supporter Harriett Baldwin tells the BBC, supporters of Tom Tugendhat, who has just been knocked out of the running, will go to her preferred candidate. ""Penny will attract a lot of his supporters because she's someone who's also very strong on defence,"" she says. Mordaunt is also strong on the economy and security, Baldwin says, adding she's ""someone ready to be prime minister on day one"" but also with the ability to ""win an unprecedented fifth general election"". Ben Bradley MP, a Conservative campaigner for Kemi Badenoch, said her 58
votes â meaning she gained votes â showed that she had gained ""momentum"". ""Kemi is in a good place to move forward,"" he told the BBC. ""It's a good result, Kemi has done well,"" he said. ""I think she'll be quite positive, see the momentum that's builtâ¦
we'll talk to colleagues and try to drag them into our tent."" In the second round Badenoch got 49 votes, so she gained nine more this
time. Bradley also said Badenoch had ""resonated with the public, with
[Conservative] members"". He dismissed
speculation about any job deal for her in exchange for withdrawing from the
race. Her tally means she came fourth in this round. Frontrunner Rishi Sunak has added 14 votes to his tally in this latest
round, going from 101 votes to 115 today. Penny Mordaunt is now in second position, despite losing one vote this
round, moving from 83 to 82 votes. Third-placed Liz Truss added seven votes, bringing her total up to 71
from 64. Despite now being
in last place, Kemi Badenoch added on the second largest number of supporters
this round, increasing her share by nine votes and going from 49 to 58 votes. Tom Tugendhat made it far enough to take part in the TV debates, and played up the fact he had never served in Boris Johnson's cabinet. Campaigning for a ""clean start"", he tried to persuade Conservative MPs he'd demonstrated leadership as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. That experience, he said, plus his military service on the
frontlines of Iraq and Afghanistan, meant he was now ready to serve the country
on a political battleground. But Tugendhat's campaign has now ended in defeat, with not enough support to see him through to the final stages. With 115 votes, former chancellor Rishi Sunak has held onto his place at the front of the pack. In second place, we have Penny Mordaunt with 82 votes, leaving them the most likely to be one of the final two candidates in the leadership race. Two candidates will now battle over third place: Liz Truss with 71 votes and Kemi Badenoch with 58 votes. Tom Tugendhat has been knocked out of the leadership race after coming last in the latest round of voting. Rishi Sunak secured the most votes in third ballot among Tory MPs, with Penny Mordaunt coming second. The votes were as follows:  The four remaining candidates will face another vote tomorrow, where the slate will be whittled down to three. Tom Tugendhat's bid to be the next Tory leader has come to an end, leaving four contenders in the race to take over the reins from Boris Johnson. Best known as the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tugendhat secured 31 votes, leaving him in last place. Sir Graham Brady has just arrived in the committee room and is about to tell us who has made it through the third round of voting in this Tory leadership contest.

The government haswona vote of confidence in itself, by349votes to238. It had been expected to win the motion as it had the support of many Tory MPs. Had it lost, the country would have almost certainly faced an early general election. MPs have just filed out of the chamber to start voting on whether they have confidence in the government. The government is expected to win, as the Conservatives still have a large majority. But if it doesn't, it will likely spell an early general election. In a slight quirk, the government brought forward the motion itself after it rejected Labour's proposed wording, which contained a specific reference to the prime minister. We'll bring you the result as soon as we get it. With Boris Johnson back in the Commons, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab says he ""proudly"" defends the government under his leadership. Raab says the government has ""steered the country through some of the most difficult challenges in living memory"" and has got the big calls right on issues including vaccines and lockdowns. Back in the House of Commons, MPs are still debating a confidence motion in the government. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner says the prime minister is not fit for office but the Conservatives plan to ""indulge"" him for the next seven weeks, until his successor is chosen. Describing him as a ""caretaker known for no care"", she says: ""Every day he's in Downing Street he does more damage. He should be long gone."" ""Let us tell this prime minister to go, and to go now. Enough is enough.""

"Construction workers will endure soaring temperatures over the next few days An amber extreme heat health warning has been issued for large parts of England from Thursday, with temperatures set to soar to 35C (95F) in some areas. This is the second such alert in recent weeks. The Met Office said while conditions would be below record highs, this heatwave could last longer. A heatwave is defined as: above average temperatures sustained for three days or more. So what does that mean for people going to work in the heat? No law in the UK says a given temperature is too hot or too cold to work. Butguidance from,externalthe Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a workplace's temperature must be ""reasonable"" with ""clean and fresh air"". In cold weather, it says you shouldn't be asked to work in less than 16C - or 13C if the job is mostly physical. But it doesn't mention a top temperature. A number of MPs recently backed a campaign for alegal upper limit of 30C in most workplaces,external- or 27C for those doing strenuous work - but there's no sign of legislation on that for now. What do heatwaves do to the body and who is at risk? Whether your employer accepts that it's too hot to go to work is ""a matter for them"", according to Mark Scoggins, solicitor advocate at Fisher Scoggins Waters. ""The HSE won't issue any guidance on that and they shouldn't,"" he adds. But theHealth and Safety at Work Act,externalmeans bosses are generally responsible for employees' welfare. The Unite union says employers have ""a legal and moral duty to ensure workers' health is not damaged during the current hot weather"". And following the heatwave in July, the HSE has said employers should be responding to the changing environment by planning adaptations such as ventilation and air conditioning. The HSE encourages staff to talk to their bosses if the workplace isn't comfortable. The HSE says employers should let staff work flexibly where possible - shifting their hours to minimise working at the hottest times of day. Relaxing formal dress codes and moving workstations away from hot places or out of direct sunlight can also help. Where possible, windows should be opened, radiators should be switched off, and fans or air-conditioning units should be available. The TUC, the umbrella body for the UK's trades unions, says businesses should let office staff work from home or adjust their hours to avoid rush-hour travel. If you are working from home, close curtains to block out the sun, and in the morning and evening open windows on opposite sides of your home, to let hot air out and cold air in. Use a fan to encourage airflow. How to keep your cool when the office heats up How air conditioning changed the world The Unite union says manual workers are particularly vulnerable. ""Employers should consider rescheduling work to cooler times of the day, and provide cooling areas such as shade or air-conditioned rest rooms. ""If workers show any signs of heat exhaustion, the employer should immediately ensure they stop work and are allowed to recover, without loss of pay."" Watch out for heat exhaustion and heatstroke Wildfires broke out in several locations in July stretching fire service resources But Justin Sullivan, chair of the Construction Industry Council chair, says building sites' operating hours are often limited by planning laws designed to minimise their impact on surrounding communities. So starting early or finishing late isn't always an option. However, he agrees that all workers should have access to water, protective clothing and shade. Some materials, like paint and concrete, can't be used on extremely hot days as the heat causes the materials to fail. He says all site managers have temperature gauges, and switch workers to different jobs where possible. Lifeguards are especially important in hot weather, when more people are tempted to swim, but they also need to look after themselves. All lifeguards should have cold water, a wide-brimmed hat, a long-sleeved top, polarised sunglasses, a high factor sunscreen and access to shade, according to Jo Talbot from the Royal Life Saving Society UK. They should also have regular breaks. There is no official advice in place instructing you not to travel. Some disruption to transport services is likely, although not on the scale of the last heatwave. Network Rail says it is not planning blanket speed restrictions because temperatures are not predicted to hit their trigger point, although temperatures could be high enough to prompt ""spot"" speed restrictions. Railway tracks get a lot hotter than the air temperature; during the last period of hot weather hundreds of trains were cancelled and delayed. At airports in July the scorching heat also impacted runways causing disruption. National Highways is advising drivers to plan their journeys over the next few days in advance and carry out basic checks to ensure vehicles are roadworthy before setting off, including keeping coolant and engine oil topped up. Keep children out of sun as heatwave hits - NHS How does sunscreen work? Tips for sleeping in the heat There are some simple things individuals can do to make the heat more bearable. Dr Anna Mavrogianni, who researches sustainable building and urban design at University College London, says as well as avoiding direct sunlight and opening windows, it can help toswitch off electrical equipment that's not in use, like photocopiers. Light-coloured clothing is cooler than dark, as it absorbs less heat. Choose looser-fitting garments made from natural materials like cotton and linen, which are more breathable. To stay hydrated, drink water before you feel thirsty, and avoid heavy meals which require more digestion, in turnproducing more body heat.

are colourblind. Mr McGivern says at the time the new colours were designed
in autumn 2021, parts of the Middle East and North Africa were above 39C, and
he had expected the darker colours to crop up in Spain from time to time. âI never expected them to be used on UK maps,âhe tweeted,external. Scientists have long warned that climate change is leading to rising temperatures. But some have been surprised at how soon 40C has happened in the UK. The Met Office said these temperatures were thought improbable a decade ago. What does this mean for other long-term predictions, including some that suggest 40C would be happeningevery 3-4 years by 2100,external? Recording a provisional 40C today has made metereologists ""sit up and think"", the Met Office told BBC News ""But this is still expected to be a fairly rare event,"" it said. Currently it's considered around one in every 100 years occurence. The way that modelling works is that we could have one or even several years of extreme temperatures, but they are still considered unusual in the long-term. The challenge now is for scientists to understand if this is a very unusual event, or if it will be occuring much more frequently than expected. Harry LowReporting from Dartford You can smell it in the air, you can see it in the skyline - and the sweat soaked shirts of the firefighters bear testament to their hard work with 18 fire engines sent to this part of Dartford alone. Itâs swelteringly hot here - temperatures reached 37C - and those warm winds weâve been experiencing all day have hampered efforts to douse the flames in north Kent. These heath fires are both a symptom of the heatwave and contributing factor to these unprecedented conditions. Here at Spirits Rest animal sanctuary they put the call out for help earlier on - and how the community has responded. People rallied round, offering to rescue the animals in danger. The chickens, rabbits, cats and 12 horses were all helped to safety. This video can not be played We've been sent this footage of a field fire near Ravensdean in Bedfordshire. Samuel Kumar filmed as smoke drifted across the road, in front of motorists, not far from the village hall.  Drone footage shows of the aftermath of a field fire by Cheshunt Park that started yesterday Firefighters in Hertfordshire are attending several incidents - a combine harvester fire, a car crash, and several field fires. The service asks people calling 999 to be patient after a major incident was declared over the volume of calls it is receiving and responding to. People can help by following heatwave advice and staying safe over the next few hours, it adds. The fire that broke out in Wennington is still burning, and London Fire Brigade are still at the scene this evening. Residents were evacuated from their homes in the village, with the blaze igniting buildings and fields nearby. Around 100 firefighters have been working to bring it under control. But the BBC's Nick Johnson, who is in Wennington, says the situation has become more reassuring in the last half hour. He adds that it appears as if fire crews are starting to pack up and return to their engines after six hours of tackling the blaze. One firefighter helping to extinguish the blaze described the conditions as ""absolute hell"". Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Paris Here in Paris, itâs reached 41C. Walking around the city is
incredibly difficult, it almost feels like you're walking through soup. Most people are opting to take the cityâs metro but even then,
sitting on the train for more than a few stops is quite hard work - many people
have brought fans along with them. In the capitalâs famous Tulleries garden, people have been taking
shade under some of the parkâs trees, making use of all available seating.
Thankfully the water fountains are still working. Meanwhile
at Paris' Gare du Nord station this afternoon, queues of people were seen waiting
for trains. There appear to be quite a few delays - although itâs not clear if
this is weather related. A number of passengers have taken to Twitter claiming that they
have been stuck on trains outside the station. Many of them say the air
conditioning on their train is not working. I myself am on a Eurostar train to London that was delayed for almost two hours. It's just left the station. Images on TV news shows fire destroy homes in the east London village We've heard from some Wennington residents who were evacuated due to the fires in their village. Some have gone to a rescue centre set up in the nearby Premier Inn, including Riminta Maceikaite, 38, and her 13-year-old son Nikas. Riminta saw the devastation unfold on the TV, watching images shot from a helicopter. She says their neighbours' homes have burnt down, but it appears their home is saved. ""When it shows you from the sky it just freaks you out,"" says Riminta. ""Our house is on the news"", says Nikas, ""it's the only house that hasn't been burned so far."" Janet Hickey, 70, and her husband Patrick, 71, had to evacuate their home quickly. 

Janet, who has terminal pancreatic cancer, had to leave all her medicines in the fridge. ""We had to leave everything"", says Patrick. ""We're hoping against hope that our house is still there."" Georgina RannardBBC News Are the fires breaking out in the UK a sign of what is to come? Guillermo Rein, Professor of Fire Science at Imperial College London, told me he expects that more powerful wildfires will gradually take place in the UK due to warmer
and drier vegetation. They will be hotter, with larger flames, and will spread faster, he suggests. ""These
make wildfires more dangerous to people, homes and the environment,"" he adds. The risk inthe south and east of England,externalis particularly expected to increase. To reduce the risk, fire services are asking the public not to light barbecues, campfires or bonfires in the open and to get rid of cigarettes and rubbish, including glass bottles, responsibly. Stephen RyanBBC News Greek
authorities have instructed people in four areas to the east of Athens near
Penteli to evacuate due to forest fires. The 112
emergency service sent mobile phone alerts to people in the areas of Drafi,
Anthousa, Dioni and Dasmari to evacuate. Thick plumes of
smoke and smouldering fires are currently visible to the east of Athens. The fire
service says firefighters in the Attica region, which
includes Athens, are on general alert. In 2018, at
least 100 people died in a massive wildfire in Mati, 18 miles east of the Greek
capital. Hertfordshire Fire Service has declared a major incident. ""The service has received a very high volume of 999 calls, leading to crews attending more than 240 emergency incidents so far today, in part due to the extreme weather. ""These incidents include crop fires, field fires, and road traffic collisions on major roads.
Firefighters have continued to work hard in very difficult conditions,"" it says. Paul KirbyDigital Europe editor The ferocious heatwave that has gripped Western Europe has shifted north and temperatures have climbed towards 40C in several areas. Parishas hit 40C today for only the third time on record.Germanyis having its hottest day of the year so far, and theNetherlandshas recorded its hottest 19 July ever, with 38.9C in Maastricht. One of the big supermarkets has halted home deliveries. The forest fires further south are still burning in France, Spain and Portugal, though. A BBC team has visited one of the five campsites that have burned down in the southwestern Gironde region and you can see what little is left. This video can not be played Heatwave: Surveying the damage after French fires InSpain, which has seen some of the highest temperatures on the continent, more than 60,000 hectares of land have burned in just a week. A fire also broke out in the dunes at theBelgiancoastal resort of De Haan on Tuesday, setting several vehicles alight. Italianforecasters are warning of temperatures as high as 40 to 42C between Wednesday and Friday. Experts at Italy's IlMeteo say new crevasses are opening up on Alpine peaks and ice is melting even on top of Western Europe's highest mountain, Mont Blanc. Todayâs extreme heat has certainly taken its toll on travel, with Network
Rail saying todayâs passenger train numbers are around 40% lower than this time
last week. There have been severe disruptions with all services to and from London
Euston suspended because of a lineside fire caused by overhead electric
cables brought down in Harrow. Similar problems with overhead lines meant trains were trapped on
the tracks in Rugby, Birmingham and Carlisle, resulting in the emergency
evacuations of passengers. As weâve been reporting, there were no rail services into or out
of Kingâs Cross today, and no Thameslink or Great Northern services running north
of London. Over 34 locations exceeded the UK's previous temperature record today, the Met Office says in a Tweet. The national record of 38.7C (101.6F) was topped in places such as Coningsby in Lincolnshire, and Gringley on the Hill, Nottinghamshire. Allow Twitter content?

We've now heard from his niece that the police have gone in to rescue him. Elsewhere in the village, a number of residents are worried about their pets, and there's concern for the livestock in a couple of nearby farms. There's a sense of the village being encircled by flames â it is boiling hot and tinder dry. But remarkably, villagers are very good-spirited, perhaps because there's a sense they really helped each other out in their moment of need. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Blaenau Gwent estate agent Jeanne Fry-Thomas says the situation is ""bonkers"" Average house prices in Wales have risen above Â£240,000 for the first time, the Principality Building Society has said. Prices grew by an average of 11.5% in the second quarter of 2022, compared with the previous year. Blaenau Gwent saw the highest price rise of any local authority, where they climbed by 20.6%. Ebbw Vale estate agent Jeanne Fry Thomas said the housing market was ""bonkers"". ThePrincipality Building Society's house price index,externalcovers transactions from April to June 2022. Wales' house prices rise more than rest of UK Buying a home an 'unachievable dream' for many As well as an 11.5% annual increase in prices, there was also a 9% increase in the number of sales. ""Wales continues to see some of the strongest house price increases across the UK,"" said Shaun Middleton, Principality Building Society's head of distribution. Semi-detached properties have seen the largest increase in prices, closely followed by terraced properties. The average house price of Â£240,635 is the highest on record in Wales and the rise of 11.5% means the price has climbed by about Â£25,000 compared with a year ago. Wales's highest house prices are in Monmouthshire where an average home sold for Â£368,621 in the second quarter of this year. Prices in the county were up 11.4% on a year ago, but were down by 0.2% on the previous quarter. Shaun Middleton says the market remains ""strong and buoyant"" in Wales Although prices increased by more than a fifth in Blaenau Gwent, the average house price in the area, Â£150,284, remains the lowest in Wales. Only Denbighshire recorded a fall in average prices compared with a year ago, though they increased compared with the previous quarter. ""The market remains quite strong and buoyant in Wales,"" Mr Middleton said, but he warned it was not necessarily good news for everyone. ""If you are living in a property and you are thinking of downsizing, rising prices are great. ""Having said that, there are first-time buyers who are struggling to get on the housing market. They are seeing the cost of that property they want to buy increase, which means a bigger deposit and a bigger mortgage."" Mr Middleton said owners looking at moving to a bigger property also faced higher prices. Wales worst part of UK for energy debt - charity Landlords fear crisis for renters over housing law ""When you add in the rising cost of mortgages, the increasing interest rate and the rising cost of utility bills and fuel, it is putting more and more pressure on not just first-time buyers but families in general."" Estate agents in Blaenau Gwent have experienced a surge in demand for houses, which has contributed to the area having Wales's highest annual growth in house prices. ""It's bonkers. I am sure that's not the right term, really, but it is mad. We can't get over it,"" said Ms Fry Thomas, a director of Bidmead Cook estate agents. Properties are selling quickly at their offices in Ebbw Vale and Brynmawr. ""We put something up for sale and within a day or two we have got more than one buyer - we have got several buyers waiting to see it and make offers on it. [Buyers] are not hanging about,"" Ms Fry Thomas said. Buyers were interested in ""all prices, all types of property, all areas,"" and Ms Fry Thomas said they were coming from outside the area, too. Average house prices in Wales have risen to over Â£240,000 Improvements to public transport and the redevelopment of Ebbw Vale's former steelworks site meant ""it suddenly seems to have all fallen into place like a jigsaw, and people are coming from everywhere,"" she added. Mr Middleton said he anticipated ""steady"" growth in spite of pressure on homeowners from the increasing cost of living. ""At the present time there is no sign that we are facing a reduction in property prices, or a crash, or anything like that. The market has definitely slowed a little bit, it seems a lot more steady,"" he reflected. ""I think whilst there is still confidence in the jobs market, and whilst there is still more demand for properties than supply, we will probably continue to see these steady increases.""

"Yusuf Zahab pictured before he left Australia at age 11 An Australian teenager taken to Syria as a child is feared dead after languishing in an adult prison for three years. Yusuf Zahab was 11 years old when he was taken to Syria in 2015 by relatives who had been radicalised. He was imprisoned without charge in 2019. His Sydney-based family say they are ""heartbroken and angry"" because the 17-year-old had begged for help for years. Australia has previously said it is too dangerous to repatriate its citizens. It is unclear exactly when or how Yusuf is suspected to have died. Rights groups say he was injured in January when the Islamic State group attacked a prison in Syria's Kurdish-controlled north-east in a bid to free its fighters. Kurdish-led forces, with US support, battled the militants for a week, leaving more than 180 people dead. Kurdish-led forces retake Syrian jail seized by IS Hundreds of children held by IS in besieged prison The children of IS: 'It's a disaster we cannot deal with' At the time, Yusuf told family in voice recordings he was scared he ""might die at any time"" as fighting intensified. ""I lost a lot of blood... There's no doctors here, there's no one who can help me,"" he said. Yusuf was among around 850 children who had been detained at the prison after the fall of IS in 2019 in case they posed a risk, the UN children's charity Unicef said. His family described him as a happy and compassionate child who loved sport, school and playing with his cousins. ""Even in the final messages we received from Yusuf, he asked us to tell his mum that he loved and missed her,"" they said in a statement. ""Yusuf didn't need to die."" They said Australia's previous government ""knew about Yusuf's predicament for more than three years"" before being leaving office in May, adding: ""We are unaware of any efforts to support, care or inquire about him."" The family and advocacy groups Human Rights Watch and Save the Children have pleaded for Australia to repatriate women and children who remain in Syria. Australia evacuated eight orphans in 2019, but at least 63 Australians remain stuck in Syria. Of them, up to 40 are children, the groups say. ""We have to remember these children were brought there against their will or were born over there,"" Human Rights Watch's Sophie McNeill told the ABC. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it is working to confirm that Yusuf has been killed, but his family has been offered consular assistance. The government remains ""deeply concerned"" about Australians in northeast Syria but its assistance is ""extremely limited"" due to security dangers, the department said in a statement.

"Amazon's online grocery shop is price matching hundreds of Tesco products as supermarkets battle for customers amid the soaring cost of living. Amazon Fresh is starting its Tesco Clubcard Price Match on items such as fruit, vegetables, meat and fish.

Supermarkets are competing on price and boosting value ranges as families hit by cost of living rises shop around. UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 40-year high of 9.1% with food costs, particularly forbread, cereal and meat, climbing. But the Bank of England has warned it might exceed 11% later this year fuel and food prices squeeze household budgets. Russell Jones, director of Amazon Fresh, said he hoped the pricing campaign would ""show how good our value is compared with competitors"".

"Starbucks is reportedly exploring a potential sale of its UK business as it faces increasingly tough competition and changing customer habits. The world's biggest coffee chain has been hit hard by lockdown measures around the world. Starbucks said it was ""not in a formal sale process for the UK business"". The firm will continue to ""evaluate strategic options"" for its company-owned international operations,according to the Times.,external The newspaper said Starbucks had taken on advisers Houlihan Lokey to explore possible options for the business.

Starbucks to quit Russia but pay six months' wages Starbucks fires organisers as union movement grows US Starbucks store votes for labour union Starbucks has been in the UK since 1998 and has about 1,000 outlets, of which about 70% are franchises while the remainder are owned by the firm. Like much of the food and drinks takeaway industry, the chain was hit hard by measures to slow the spread of Covid-19. Along with its rivals, it is also dealing with rising costs as well as having to adapt to customers' changing habits as many people shift to hybrid work from home schedules. The company is also facing increased competition in the UK from rival coffee chains including Costa, Pret A Manger and Tim Hortons. However, the BBC understands Starbucks is committed to the UK for the long-term, and continues to invest in new store openings, staff, new formats and digital sales channels. Last year, while it closed five company-operated stores, it opened 14 new ones, targeted at drive-through locations. It says its company-operated openings will focus on key city and drive-through outlets. Internationally the group is in the process of searching for a new permanent chief executive, following the retirement of Kevin Johnson earlier this year. Since April the role has been filled on a temporary basis by former chief executive Howard Schultz. In the US, the company has also been dealing with recent efforts by some of its workers to unionise. In May, Starbucks said it would leave Russia after 15 years in the country due to the war in Ukraine. The firm said that it would retreat entirely from the Russian market, after suspending trading there in March.

which has been gaining traction on social media. The image above, designed to downplay the heatwave and cast
doubt on climate change, spread on groups and accounts including some that post
debunked weather conspiracy theories. But the comparison is misleading. For one thing, the map on
the left appears to be an older BBC map which did not use colour zones for
temperatures. However, Met Office maps did include colours, even before a recent

incredibly difficult, it almost feels like you're walking through soup. Most people are opting to take the cityâs metro but even then,
sitting on the train for more than a few stops is quite hard work - many people

for trains. There appear to be quite a few delays - although itâs not clear if
this is weather related. A number of passengers have taken to Twitter claiming that they
have been stuck on trains outside the station. Many of them say the air
conditioning on their train is not working. I myself am on a Eurostar train to London that was delayed for almost two hours. It's just left the station. Images on TV news shows fire destroy homes in the east London village We've heard from some Wennington residents who were evacuated due to the fires in their village. Some have gone to a rescue centre set up in the nearby Premier Inn, including Riminta Maceikaite, 38, and her 13-year-old son Nikas. Riminta saw the devastation unfold on the TV, watching images shot from a helicopter. She says their neighbours' homes have burnt down, but it appears their home is saved. ""When it shows you from the sky it just freaks you out,"" says Riminta. ""Our house is on the news"", says Nikas, ""it's the only house that hasn't been burned so far."" Janet Hickey, 70, and her husband Patrick, 71, had to evacuate their home quickly. 

Janet, who has terminal pancreatic cancer, had to leave all her medicines in the fridge. ""We had to leave everything"", says Patrick. ""We're hoping against hope that our house is still there."" Georgina RannardBBC News Are the fires breaking out in the UK a sign of what is to come? Guillermo Rein, Professor of Fire Science at Imperial College London, told me he expects that more powerful wildfires will gradually take place in the UK due to warmer
and drier vegetation. They will be hotter, with larger flames, and will spread faster, he suggests. ""These
make wildfires more dangerous to people, homes and the environment,"" he adds. The risk inthe south and east of England,externalis particularly expected to increase. To reduce the risk, fire services are asking the public not to light barbecues, campfires or bonfires in the open and to get rid of cigarettes and rubbish, including glass bottles, responsibly. Stephen RyanBBC News Greek
authorities have instructed people in four areas to the east of Athens near
Penteli to evacuate due to forest fires. The 112
emergency service sent mobile phone alerts to people in the areas of Drafi,
Anthousa, Dioni and Dasmari to evacuate. Thick plumes of
smoke and smouldering fires are currently visible to the east of Athens. The fire
service says firefighters in the Attica region, which
includes Athens, are on general alert. In 2018, at
least 100 people died in a massive wildfire in Mati, 18 miles east of the Greek
capital. Hertfordshire Fire Service has declared a major incident. ""The service has received a very high volume of 999 calls, leading to crews attending more than 240 emergency incidents so far today, in part due to the extreme weather. ""These incidents include crop fires, field fires, and road traffic collisions on major roads.
Firefighters have continued to work hard in very difficult conditions,"" it says. Paul KirbyDigital Europe editor The ferocious heatwave that has gripped Western Europe has shifted north and temperatures have climbed towards 40C in several areas. Parishas hit 40C today for only the third time on record.Germanyis having its hottest day of the year so far, and theNetherlandshas recorded its hottest 19 July ever, with 38.9C in Maastricht. One of the big supermarkets has halted home deliveries. The forest fires further south are still burning in France, Spain and Portugal, though. A BBC team has visited one of the five campsites that have burned down in the southwestern Gironde region and you can see what little is left. This video can not be played Heatwave: Surveying the damage after French fires InSpain, which has seen some of the highest temperatures on the continent, more than 60,000 hectares of land have burned in just a week. A fire also broke out in the dunes at theBelgiancoastal resort of De Haan on Tuesday, setting several vehicles alight. Italianforecasters are warning of temperatures as high as 40 to 42C between Wednesday and Friday. Experts at Italy's IlMeteo say new crevasses are opening up on Alpine peaks and ice is melting even on top of Western Europe's highest mountain, Mont Blanc. Todayâs extreme heat has certainly taken its toll on travel, with Network
Rail saying todayâs passenger train numbers are around 40% lower than this time
last week. There have been severe disruptions with all services to and from London
Euston suspended because of a lineside fire caused by overhead electric
cables brought down in Harrow. Similar problems with overhead lines meant trains were trapped on
the tracks in Rugby, Birmingham and Carlisle, resulting in the emergency
evacuations of passengers. As weâve been reporting, there were no rail services into or out
of Kingâs Cross today, and no Thameslink or Great Northern services running north
of London. Over 34 locations exceeded the UK's previous temperature record today, the Met Office says in a Tweet. The national record of 38.7C (101.6F) was topped in places such as Coningsby in Lincolnshire, and Gringley on the Hill, Nottinghamshire. Allow Twitter content?

We've now heard from his niece that the police have gone in to rescue him. Elsewhere in the village, a number of residents are worried about their pets, and there's concern for the livestock in a couple of nearby farms. There's a sense of the village being encircled by flames â it is boiling hot and tinder dry. But remarkably, villagers are very good-spirited, perhaps because there's a sense they really helped each other out in their moment of need. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Marks & Spencer is taking ""best before"" dates off more than 300 fruit and vegetable items to tackle food waste. They will be replaced by a code that M&S staff can use to check freshness and quality. Tesco, Morrisons and Co-op are among supermarkets that have scrapped ""use by"" dates on some of their products. Waste & Resources Action Programme (Wrap) said 70% of the UK's food waste is binned in homes, mounting up to4.5 million tonnes of edible food a year.,external Catherine David, director of collaboration and change at the charity, added: ""We urge more supermarkets to get ahead on food waste by axing date labels from fresh produce, allowing people to use their own judgment."" Morrisons scraps 'use by' date on milk in favour of sniff test Co-op supermarket scraps yoghurt use-by dates in bid to cut food waste Tesco ditches 'best before' dates on more fruit and veg Use by labels are the dates until which perishable food can be cooked and consumed safely. Best before guidance, meanwhile, is for when the product should be consumed to get the best quality, taste and texture. The Food Standards Agency says it isup to manufacturers to decide whether to apply a use by or best before date,externalon their products. It will depend on factors such as how the food is made and how risky it is, it said. The move away from best before dates could also help supermarket profits as they battle to keep the cost of everyday essentials down as food prices soar. Tesco scrapped best before dates on more than100 fruit and vegetable products in 2018. In January this year, Morrisons announced its plan to remove use by dates from 90% of its own brand milk and encouraged customers to use a ""sniff test"" instead before throwing products away. And in April the Co-op announced plans to ditch use by dates on its own-brand yoghurtin favour of a best before date as guidance. M&S has committed to halve food waste by 2030 as part of its sustainability roadmap, with all of its edible surplus to be redistributed by 2025. Andrew Clappen, director of food technology at M&S, said it needed to ""do all we can to make sure none of it gets thrown away"" and encouraged customers to ""get creative with leftovers"".

The Met Office's amber extreme heat alerts, which cover the whole of Wales, will also run until Tuesday night. Aiden McGivern, Met Office meteorologist said an ""extraordinary area of very hot air"" moved in from Spain and Portugal. ""It has peaked across Wales, I think overnight it starts to cool from the west while other parts of UK turn even hotter from Tuesday,"" he said. ""People struggle to cool down but overnight it's also a problem, it will be very warm tonight and it could be Wales' warmest night on record."" In Hawarden mum Emma Hughes, from Ewloe, Flintshire, was out with 15-month-old daughter Poppy, five-year-old son Leo, and her mother Liz Fenlon.

Welsh government health officials said the Met Office's amber extreme heat warning ""needed to be taken seriously"" as it could be mean a danger to life or potential serious illness from the scorching temperatures. An aerial view during low tide in the Carew River which runs alongside Carew Castle Wales' deputy chief medical officer Chris Jones toldBBC Radio Walespeople may need to ""change some of their plans"" in the coming days. Health officials have told schools that children should avoid vigorous physical activity in extreme heat and ""maximise shade and ventilation"" while pupils should wear loose, light-coloured clothing if possible, wear hats outdoors and drink plenty of water. People who may be temped to cool off in rivers and lakes are beingwarned to be careful of the dangers of open water,externalwhile burn specialists have stressed the importance of usingsunscreenthat has been bought this year. The Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery in Swansea are already seeing an increase in children being treated or refereed to the specialist unit at Morriston Hospital with severe sunburn. ""Burning your skin causes increases your risk of skin cancer later on in life,"" said paediatric specialist nurse Louise Scannell. ""And once you've reached the age of 18, if you've had a significant sunburn then the damage is done and could increase your risk of skin cancer in later life. So it's really important to apply sun cream."" She also warned sunscreen is less effective if it was opened last year and was beyond its best before date. How does sunscreen work? Sunburn warning as Wales prepares for extreme heat Why sunscreen is not enough to prevent sunburns ""People are bringing out sun creams from last year which, once they are opened, should be disposed of and not used the following year,"" added Ms Scannell.

The Royal Welsh Show is a significant date in Wales' cultural calendar The Royal Welsh's chief vet Dafydd Jones admitted the forecast for the show near Builth Wells in Powys was ""worrying"". ""Animals suffer like people - if not worse - in extreme heat and with so many animals there, it is very worrying that animals will find it difficult to cope with the heat,"" he toldBBC Radio Cymru. Organisers have spent more than Â£50,000 on extra fans and ventilation in livestock sheds to keep the approximate 8,000 animals as cool as possible while extra water will be available. This video can not be played The Royal Welsh Show finds ways to keep animals safe during the heatwave Head of operations Mared Jones said organisers had ""risen to the occasion"" in tackling the expected heat, adding: ""Please come prepared, and wear appropriate clothing, that would be my message to visitors.

""Pigs don't let out the heat as well as other animals so it is difficult to keep them cool,"" said the 45-year-old who has a farm near Pwllheli in Gwynedd. ""We put cold wet towels over them but we need to be careful that the heat doesn't dry the towels too quickly so it can reheat them. ""So we'll be keeping them in the shade as much as possible and keeping the fans on them as much as we can."" Geraint and Sue Richards are expecting their ice creams to be in high demand Sue and Geraint Richards, who run Basil and Rusty's ice cream parlour in Machen, Caerphilly, are hoping to keep people cool at the show. ""After three years away (because of Covid), it feels like you're coming home again, it's massively important, the show is one big family,"" Mr Richards toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast.

Chief executive Steve Hughson hasasked people,externalto ""be careful, wear sun cream and hats and use the shade"" when visiting the 150-acre Llanelwedd site. Animal charity RSPCA warned pet-owners to take extra precautions tokeep their animals safe in the hot weather, having access to fresh water, ventilation and shade from direct sunlight. Ice in hats, ventilated suits - keeping cool at work What does hot weather do to the body? Is the UK getting hotter? British Veterinary Association President Justine Shotton said owners need to stop their pets overheating, including ""making sure pets aren't walked or exercised in the middle of a hot day or left inside a hot car or conservatory for even a little while, as not long can prove fatal"". The Met Office said the hot weather is being caused by high pressure over the UK and hot air flowing from southern Europe and a heatwave spreading across Europe has fuelledwildfires in Portugal, France and Spain. Commuters have been been advised to only use public transport unless absolutely necessary during the extreme heat warnings. The speed limit on lines across Wales and England has been reduced, with trains mostly limited to 90mph (145km/h), where it would usually be up to 125mph (200km/h), meaning journeys will take longer. Transport for Wales (TfW) has even cancelled trains on routes within the areas covered by the Met Office red weather warning. This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool Services between Shrewsbury and Birmingham, Chester and Liverpool, Chester and Manchester, Chester and Crewe, Crewe and Manchester and the Conwy Valley Line will be cancelled. TfW has warned services to Wales' coastal resorts, along the Heart of Wales Line to the Royal Welsh Show and in south Wales due to university graduations in Cardiff and Swansea ""will be very busy"". The train operator has said ""conditions onboard are likely to be very uncomfortable in the extreme weather"" but are ""working to provide additional capacity to avoid overcrowding"". Network Rail said the need for speed restrictions and longer journey times was because steel rails absorb heat easily and ""tend to be around 20 degrees above air temperature"". ""When steel becomes very hot it expands and rails can bend, flex and, in serious cases, buckle,"" it said.
