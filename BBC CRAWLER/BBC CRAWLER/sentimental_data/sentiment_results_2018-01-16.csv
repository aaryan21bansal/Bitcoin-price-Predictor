"Steve Bannon (centre) attended a House Intelligence Committee closed door meeting on Tuesday Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to US President Donald Trump, has been summoned to testify before a grand jury, US media report. He was reportedly subpoenaed by former FBI director Robert Mueller, who is leading an inquiry into alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election campaign. Mr Bannon appeared separately on Tuesday before a Congressional panel. Congress is holding its own inquiry into the allegations. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The dates that define Steve Bannon's sharp rise and fall US grand juries explained Mr Bannon was subpoenaed last week, the New York Times reports,external, quoting an unnamed person with direct knowledge of the matter. However the summons could be a negotiating tactic by Mr Mueller to persuade Mr Bannon to agree to be questioned by investigators in the less formal setting of the special counsel's offices in Washington, the paper's source added. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington As prosecutors hunt for criminal misdeeds, they have a number of arrows in their quiver. One of the more powerful is the grand jury subpoena. Putting witnesses in the glare of the courtroom spotlight, in front of a panel of jurors, with every word noted and every answer compelled, can be quite revelatory. Steve Bannon could become the first member of the Trump inner circle to get this treatment. That he received his court summons just days after news broke that the former Trump campaign head told author Michael Wolff he thought the presidential family could be implicated in money-laundering and treasonous actions may cause some sleepless nights in the White House. Other top Trump staffers - including former chief-of-staff Reince Priebus, press secretary Sean Spicer and White House counsel Don McGrath - have had informal interviews with the special counsel team. Bannon's subpoena may just be a means of encouraging him to be more co-operative - or a sign that Mr Mueller's investigation has a particular interest in what he has to say. At the very least, this latest bit of news is a sign that, surely to the dismay of the president, the Russia investigation is far from winding down. He was appointed by the US justice department in May of last year to oversee an investigation into possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams have been accused of colluding with Russian agents to influence the US election in the Republican candidate's favour. US intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA, concluded with ""high confidence"" in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to thumb the scale of the US election for Mr Trump. Both the Russian and US presidents have poured scorn on suggestions of collusion, with Mr Trump calling it ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". He helped shape Mr Trump's ""America First"" election campaign message and served as one of his closest aides before being sacked in August. But he recently fell out with Mr Trump publicly after reportedly making comments about the president and his family in a newly-published book, Fire and Fury, by Michael Wolff. He was quoted as calling a meeting in June 2016 between Mr Trump's son Donald Jr and a group of Russians ""treasonous"". It took place at Trump Tower in New York and also involved Mr Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, his then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. A Russian intermediary had contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would ""incriminate"" Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump Jr later defended the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya had offered only ""inane nonsense"" but he also said he ""probably would have done things a little differently"" in retrospect. Four people have been charged: Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, his former business associate, pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering unrelated to the 2016 election George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, admitted lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to the Trump administration, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI over meetings he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak The House Intelligence Committee is also investigating the allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Its proceedings on Tuesday were not open to the public. This is one of four investigations being conducted by Congress into the alleged collusion, with others launched by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee.

"From L-R: Umar Ahmed Haque, Abuthaher Mamun and Nadeem Patel were present in court Big Ben and Heathrow Airport were among landmarks targeted by a British man who was ""fascinated"" by the so-called Islamic State, a court has heard. Umar Ahmed Haque, 25, from east London, denies preparing acts of terrorism. He is on trial at the Old Bailey in London alongside three other men, aged between 19 and 27. Mark Heywood QC, opening the case, said Mr Haque had decided to ""carry out one or more violent attacks"" in the UK and had ""identified methods and targets"". The court heard his other intended targets included the Queen's Guard, the courts, Transport for London, Shia Muslims, Westfield shopping centres, banks in the City of London, Parliament, the English Defence League or Britain First, foreign embassies and media stations. Mr Heywood said the defendant was ""fascinated"" by the ""warped and extreme ideology"" of the banned Islamic State group, and that after arrest he told police that ""he was their loyal follower"". Mr Haque, a religious teacher, allegedly enlisted the help and support of others at a mosque on Ripple Road in Barking - where he is accused of grooming children with ""role play"" and extremist videos. He allegedly showed pupils as young as 11 videos of beheadings in a bid to ""foster and encourage"" them into adopting his extreme ideology at the Islamic school where he worked, the court heard. Mr Haque and Abuthaher Mamun, 19, are both charged with preparing acts of terrorism between 25 March and 18 May 2017. Mr Haque is further charged with preparing terrorist acts by leading exercises with children at the mosque and disseminating terrorist publications at the Lantern of Knowledge secondary school in London. He taught at the Islamic boys' school in Leyton, east London, between September 2015 and September 2016, the court heard. Muhammad Abid, 27, who was not present in court, is charged with failing to tell the authorities about the alleged plans, while Nadeem Patel, 26, is accused of conspiring with Mr Haque to possess a firearm or imitation firearm with the intention of causing fear of violence. All four deny the charges. In a bugged conversation with one of the other men, recorded days after last year's Westminster Bridge attack, Mr Haque allegedly said: ""So what I want to personally [do] is launch different attacks in all the different areas. ""One in Westminster, one in Stratford, one in Forest Gate, one... In so many different areas, yeah,"" he allegedly said. Mr Haque has admitted charges of collection of terrorist information and dissemination of a terrorist publication at the mosque, while Mr Patel admitted possessing a prohibited weapon. The trial continues.

"Cars and lorries were tailed back on the M74 southbound Heavy snowfalls have been causing disruption as wintry conditions sweep across large swathes of Scotland. Traffic between Scotland and England has been affected, with closures on the M74 in both directions. Traffic Scotland said gritters were working to make the motorway safe enough to fully reopen. Police Scotland has advised motorists to avoid the area. Some drivers complained of being stuck in traffic for several hours. On the Isle of Skye, the main road - the A87- was blocked for several hours in both directions by a jack-knifed lorry. The closure meant two school buses with pupils who had been stuck for hours had to return to Portree High. The school said they would be put in temporary accommodation for the night. The Met Office has issued an amber alert for south west Scotland, extending to parts of the central belt, lasting until Wednesday morning. Thundersnow was also forecast in the west. A lorry jack-knifed on the A87 in Skye Earlier on Tuesday evening, all three lanes on the M74 southbound at J12 Millbank were closed. One lane later re-opened but traffic was again halted as conditions worsened. Police advised drivers to follow the gritters and said the delays would take some time to clear. A subsequent accident at J15 Beattock led to closure of the northbound carriageway. Traffic Scotland apologised to those stuck in the queues. Motorist Nigel Cliff, who was heading south, told BBC Scotland at about 19:00 that he had been stationary on the motorway for about an hour and a half. ""It's pretty rough,"" he said. ""It's snowing again now so it is probably only going to get worse. There are cars and lorries just sitting here - nothing moving."" Mr Cliff said he was prepared for the conditions: ""I've got food. I've got big thick coats, big thick socks. My wife always makes sure I've got everything in the car."" The M74 was closed between Millbank and Abington due to the wintry conditions Transport Minister Humza Yousaf tweeted that a number of HGVs had ""lost traction with challenging weather impacting on M74"". He added: ""Necessary to close the junction to get additional gritters and equipment to the scene."" Live updates on heavy snowfall Have you seen Sir Andy Flurry? Your pictures of snowy scenes What is thundersnow? Snow disruption in Northern Ireland Police Scotland said anyone taking to the roads in the worst affected areas was ""highly likely"" to experience disruption, and urged drivers to consider carefully if the journey was necessary. A Multi Agency Response Team (Mart) is now operational to monitor conditions. The deputy first minister and transport minister also chaired a meeting of the Scottish government's resilience operation to receive an update on the situation. Allow Twitter content?

Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said: ""The Met Office has upgraded its snow warning for parts of south west and central Scotland, with the areas affected by the amber warning set to see heavier snowfalls and greater disruption to transport. ""The snow and ice is likely to lead to difficult driving conditions, so I'd urge all travellers to take extra time and plan their journeys in advance. The high winds forecast for later in the week may also see some bridge restrictions."" Conditions were also poor on the M74 northbound at Abington A car ended up well and truly stuck in the south of Edinburgh The gritter came too late for this driver on the Isle of Skye Can you spot it? A crashed car is buried by snow beside this road in County Antrim The Met Office amber ""be prepared"" warning - which means transport and power supplies may be disrupted with a potential risk to lives and property -  was issued from 15:00 on Tuesday until 08:00 on Wednesday and also extends across much of Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said crews had attended 12 crashes as a direct result of the poor conditionsand at least 13 schools were closed. Some high ground was likely to see 15-25 cm (6-10 inches) of snow building up, especially above 200-300m, with 5-10 cm (2-4 inches) more typical at low levels throughout the warning area. Yellow warnings of snow are likely to remain in place across most of the country until late on Friday. Snow depths across Scotland at 17:00 on Tuesday Western Isles Council cancelled all bus services to and from Stornoway from 19:00 due to risk from snow and ice. Across Scotland more than 100 schools and nurseries were closed on Tuesday, with more than 10,000 pupils missing classes. In the Highland council area, the weather affected 13 secondary schools, 53 primaries, two special schools and 26 nurseries. About 8,900 pupils had an unexpected day off classes. Dumfries and Galloway Councilsaid 20 schools were closed due to weather problems or heating failures,external.  Some schools also closed in theEast Ayrshire,externalandStirling Council,externalareas.

South Lanarkshire Council closed 18 schools and nurseries throughout the day. A number of airports were affected by the wintry conditions, with Inverness airport closed for most of the morning. Flights in an out of Aberdeen were also disrupted and Glasgow airport was briefly closed while the runway, taxi and passenger routes were cleared. Police Scotland urged drivers of heavy goods vehicles to exercise extreme caution, and warned they may be asked to park up by officers. The snow led to tricky driving conditions near Inverness A BBC Weather Watcher sent this image of a snowy marina at Ratho, near Edinburgh Head of road policing, Ch Supt Stewart Carle, said: ""Winter driving is a question of common sense and drivers should ask themselves if they really need to travel when conditions are poor. ""No-one should ever place themselves at risk on the road and it may be worth considering postponing your journey or making alternative arrangements such as delaying travel until conditions improve or using public transport. ""If you are travelling on the roads you should ensure you and your vehicle are adequately prepared for the conditions, making sure you have sufficient fuel and supplies such as warm clothing, food and water in the event you are delayed for several hours.

"This video can not be played Police chief: 'I would call that torture' Police say 13 siblings who were found malnourished, some of them shackled, in a California home were torture victims. Riverside County Sheriff's office said the mother was ""perplexed"" when officers came to rescue the siblings, who are aged two to 29. Investigators said they had had no previous contacts with the couple, David and Louise Turpin. Their 17-year-old daughter escaped the home in Perris from a window on Sunday and alerted police. The 'happy family' charged with torture Can anyone open a school at home in California? The teenager was so emaciated that officials said she looked just 10 years old. Investigators said the unnamed girl had called 911 with a de-activated mobile phone. She showed officers photos of conditions in the suburban property, 59 miles (95km) south-east of Los Angeles. Police chief Captain Gregg Fellows told a news conference on Tuesday that three of the children were found shackled inside the home during the raid. ""Some of our staff described that there was a very foul smell inside the residence,"" Capt Fellows said. ""It was extremely dirty and as we reported previously many of the children were malnourished."" Mr Turpin, 57, and Mrs Turpin, 49, have been held on charges of torture and child endangerment. Bail was set at $9m (Â£6.5m) each. This video can not be played A neighbour said the children were always accompanied by the parents Asked to say more about the torture allegation, Capt Fellows said: ""If you can imagine being 17 years old and appearing to be a 10 year old, being chained to a bed and being malnourished and injuries associated with that I would call that torture."" He said investigators have found no evidence of sexual abuse or mental illness at this stage, but added the inquiry was just beginning. ""I can't get into the specific details of the conversation, but it seemed that the mother was perplexed as to why we were at that residence,"" Capt Fellows told reporters. The couple's Facebook page contains numerous family photos The Turpins moved into the property in 2014 and apparently schooled their children at home. Public records show the house is listed in a California education department directory as the location of ""Sandcastle Day School"", with Mr Turpin named as principal. It was described in official records as a non-religious and co-ed institution with six students enrolled. The rescued siblings were taken to local hospitals for treatment. Mark Uffer, from the Corona Regional Medical Center, told reporters that of the seven adults found, ""it's very clear they're suffering malnutrition"". ""They are very friendly, very co-operative and they are hopeful that life will get better for them after this event."" Ivan Trahan, a former lawyer for the couple in a 2011 bankruptcy case,told the Los Angeles Times,externalthat Mr Turpin had been well paid as an engineer at defence contractor Northrop Grumman. According to the newspaper, bankruptcy files show Mr Turpin earned more than $140,000 in 2011, but expenses for his large family exceeded his wages by more than $1,000 a month. Distraught neighbours said that they barely ever saw the family in public, and that they never spoke to nearby residents. ""Why don't we ever see the kids?"" neighbour Kimberly Milligan asked. ""In hindsight, we would have never thought this, but there were red flags. You never don't hear or see nine kids."" The children's grandparents said that they had not seen the family for four or five years. James and Betty Turpin told ABC they were considered a good Christian family in their community and that ""God called on them"" to have so many children. The family's Facebook page shows numerous photos and videos of them, apparently happy and smiling. Many posts contain comments from family or friends. They appear to have renewed their wedding vows several times in recent years, often with their children present. In a YouTube video, the couple are seen at the Elvis Chapel in Las Vegas. Repeating after an Elvis impersonator, Mr Turpin tells his wife: ""I offer you this ring as a symbol of my love, baby, baby."" The children laugh along with the impersonator, and clap as the couple kisses.

"This video can not be played The Carillion collapse: What does it mean? The government has ordered a fast-track investigation into directors at the failed construction firm Carillion. The UK's second biggest construction firm went into liquidation on Monday, after running up losses on contracts and struggling with heavy debts. The business secretary has asked for an investigation by the Official Receiver to be broadened and fast-tracked. The conduct of directors in charge at the time of the company's failure and previous directors will be examined. Carillion's business is now in the hands of the official receiver, which is reviewing all of Carillion's contracts. The company employed 43,000 people worldwide, 20,000 in the UK, and had 450 contracts with the UK government. The government has said that staff and contractors working on public sector service contracts will continue to be paid. But there is concern that big projects, including the construction of hospitals and roads, will be delayed while the details are worked out. There are also big worries for an estimated 30,000 smaller firms which have been working on Carillion projects in the private sector. Many are owed money and face a wait to find out if they will get any of it back. 'Sites are silent and deserted' 'They've literally locked the gate' Watershed moment for privatisation? Carillion: Not alone in hitting problems On Monday the government said that firms working on Carillion's private contracts would be paid for another 48 hours. Butthe latest statement from the Insolvency Service,externalindicates there might be more flexibility. It says that the Liquidator is talking to Carillion's private sector clients about which services will continue; however contracts will be ended if the client no longer wants to pay for them. ""No one has been dismissed at this point and staff will continue to be paid for the work they perform,"" a spokesperson for the Insolvency Service said. Andy Bradley is the managing director of Flora-tec, which is owed Â£800,000 by Carillion for landscaping services. ""The government actively encouraged businesses like mine... to get involved in public sector contracts, to make sure the little guy got a slice of the pie. ""When Carillion started to get into trouble last year we were considering that we would scale back our involvement with them. ""However... the government continued to give them billion-pound contract after billion-pound contract and that said to me, as a small supplier, that the government had done their due diligence. ""We were following the government lead... only to be given a sucker punch. ""I had to make 10 people redundant yesterday. That's 10 people with mortgages, car loans, all that stuff. It's an absolute disgrace."" Carillion was hit by cost overruns on big projects, problems with contracts in the Middle East and a large deficit in the company pension scheme. In particular three building projects in the UK had resulted in hefty losses: The Â£350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Sandwell: opening delayed to 2019 due to construction problems The Â£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital: completion date repeatedly pushed back amid reports of cracks in the building The Â£745m Aberdeen bypass: delayed because of slow progress in completing initial earthworks Chief executive Richard Howson stepped down in Julylast year after a profit warning. He had been in charge since the end of 2011. Keith Cochrane was appointed as interim chief executive. There has been much criticism over the size of Mr Howson's pay award in 2016 which, including bonuses, totalled about Â£1.5m. He is also due to receive a salary until October this year. Finance director Richard Adam, who retired in December 2016 after nine years at Carillion received almost Â£1.1m in salary and bonuses in 2016. As well as the conduct of directors, the role of Carillion's auditor KPMG will be examined by the Financial Reporting Council. ""It is important we quickly get the full picture of the events which caused Carillion to enter liquidation,"" said Business Secretary, Greg Clark, in a statement. ""Any evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously,"" he said. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the government had become ""too close"" to Carillion. ""We need full transparency on meetings and discussions that took place between government ministers, civil servants and representatives of Carillion and what warnings were given to ministers and what actions recommended implemented or not,"" he said. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss described his comments as ""cheap political shots"". Where did it go wrong for Carillion?

"Lightning seems to strike the same place remarkably often in Britain's construction and support services sectors. For some, Carillion's demise will seem like a bolt from the blue. But look back 20 years and you find a surprising number of companies which struck similar problems, although not always with fatal consequences. Amey, Jarvis, Connaught, Rok, G4S, Balfour Beatty, Serco, Mitie - and many others - have had to own up to accounts that were, to use a euphemism, optimistic. Most lived to fight another day. Carillion did not. Talk to executives in the industry and they easily find the common thread. Companies that are built up quickly through acquisitions - as Carillion was from the combination of parts of Tarmac, Wimpey, Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine - have an extra struggle first to understand then to integrate their disparate activities. Industry experts spoken to by the BBC also think that Carillion overpaid for its acquisitions, leaving it with less financial fat to fall back on when the going got tough. All the companies above were hurt by what turned out to be aggressive accounting. When a construction company wins a contract, it cannot be precisely sure that it has bid the correct amount - there are always the vagaries of ground conditions, technical challenges, even weather. Carillion: Small firms count the cost The company entrenched in public life Where did it go wrong? Bid too keenly and you wipe out your profits. And there is danger in taking profits as you progress - this football stadium, for example, is half-built, so why should my company not book half the estimated profit from the deal this year? A more prudent approach might be to wait for the final reckoning, and when the tricky final stages of the construction process have been sorted out. But shareholders and the board want results now, so waiting until the end of the contract might make you quite unpopular. That same problem of revenue recognition, and the taking of profits too early, applies also to long-term services contracts. When you sign a 10-year-deal to run a prison, do you take all the profits up front? You might, and your auditor, might, in the past, have let you. But the underlying truth is that you will almost certainly lose money in the first few years, and make all the profit - if it comes to that - in the final years of the deal, well after executive team that won the contract have moved on. In a recent interview with the BBC, Leo Quinn, the chief executive of the construction and services group Balfour Beatty - brought in to sort out the mess after it had its own Carillion-style series of profit warnings and accounts restatements - said that in the end it all came down to culture. If staff were given incentives to achieve sales growth regardless of the long-term consequences, then problems would be stored up through bad acquisitions and contracts bid at the wrong price. As Mr Quinn put it, culture is ""what does it take to get me noticed around here?"" It will be interesting to see what investigators find out about what it took to get noticed at Carillion.

"This video can not be played The Carillion collapse: What does it mean? Carillion was in talks with the government since October as part of a desperate bid to stave off collapse, according to the chief executive. Keith Cochrane says the construction giant was left with just Â£29m in cash by the time it went bust on Monday. Until the last moments, directors still believed a rescue was possible, but banks became more demanding, he said. The details are included in a document Mr Cochrane has prepared as part of the insolvency process. His statement sets out attempts to save Britain's second-biggest construction company after three profits warnings and a collapse in the share price. Efforts to sell off parts of the business failed and Carillion's banks became more demanding, only agreeing fresh funding under tight new conditions that the company was unable to meet, the statement discloses. There had been regular meetings with the government and its advisers in the final few months of 2017, Mr Cochrane says. But on 31 December a ""formal request"" was made for support from the government. Are you a Carillion employee or contractor? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. ''Sites are silent and virtually deserted' Carillion apprentices given notice 'They've literally locked the gate' Watershed moment for privatisation? Carillion: Not alone in hitting problems Even as late as last weekend, directors believed that ""a constructive dialogue"" was underway with banks and the government about providing short-term funding. Directors wanted the government to ""guarantee"" more funding for four months while Carillion continued its restructuring, and be allowed to defer tax payments. Both requests were refused, according to Mr Cochrane. But his document adds that ""certain of the group's lenders took unilateral action which in the company's view undermined the group's efforts to conserve cash"". He singles out Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) as one of the banks that wanted to impose tough new lending conditions. RBS said in a statement to the BBC that it had ""provided considerable support and forbearance to Carillion over many months"". ""The judgement of the bank was that the restructuring plan put forward by the company was not viable and therefore we took the difficult decision not to extend further funding and increase our exposure to the business."" Running out of cash and owing more than Â£1.3bn to its banks, Carillion declared itself insolvent on Monday. Rather than attempt an orderly administration of Carillion in the hope of salvaging something from the business, the Official Receiver was appointed to liquidate the business. Accountants EY and PwC both rejected requests to become administrators because there was no money left to keep the company ticking over, Mr Cochrane says. Meanwhile, Treasury minister Liz Truss told the Commons on Tuesday that ""it would be completely wrong for a public company that got itself in this state to be bailed out by the state"". Business Secretary Greg Clark has asked for an investigation by the Official Receiver to be broadened and fast-tracked. The conduct of directors in charge at the time of the company's failure and previous directors will be examined. ""It is important we quickly get the full picture of the events which caused Carillion to enter liquidation,"" said Mr Clark. ""Any evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously."" At the same time, the role of Carillion's auditor, KPMG, will be examined by the Financial Reporting Council. The company employed 43,000 people worldwide, 20,000 in the UK, and had 450 contracts with the UK government. The government has said that staff and contractors working on public sector service contracts will continue to be paid. But there is concern that big projects, including the construction of hospitals and roads, will be delayed while the details are worked out. There are also big worries for an estimated 30,000 smaller firms which have been working on Carillion projects in the private sector. Many are owed money and are waiting to find out if they will get any of it back. Andy Bradley is the managing director of Flora-tec, which is owed Â£800,000 by Carillion for landscaping services. ""The government actively encouraged businesses like mine... to get involved in public sector contracts, to make sure the little guy got a slice of the pie. ""When Carillion started to get into trouble last year we were considering that we would scale back our involvement with them. ""However... the government continued to give them billion-pound contract after billion-pound contract and that said to me, as a small supplier, that the government had done their due diligence. ""We were following the government lead... only to be given a sucker punch. ""I had to make 10 people redundant yesterday. That's 10 people with mortgages, car loans, all that stuff. It's an absolute disgrace."" On Monday, the government said that firms working on Carillion's private contracts would be paid for another 48 hours. Butthe latest statement from the Insolvency Service,externalindicates there might be more flexibility. It says that the liquidator is talking to Carillion's private sector clients about which services will continue; however contracts will be ended if the client no longer wants to pay for them. ""No one has been dismissed at this point and staff will continue to be paid for the work they perform,"" a spokesperson for the Insolvency Service said. Carillion was hit by cost overruns on big projects, problems with contracts in the Middle East and a large deficit in the company pension scheme. Chief executive Richard Howson stepped down in Julylast year after a profit warning. There has been much criticism over the size of Mr Howson's pay award in 2016 which, including bonuses, totalled about Â£1.5m. Finance director Richard Adam, who retired in December 2016 after nine years at Carillion, received almost Â£1.1m in salary and bonuses in 2016. Are you a Carillion employee or contractor?

"BBC News presenter Emily Maitlis met Edward Vines when they were students at Cambridge University A former friend of Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, who harassed her for two decades, has been jailed for contacting her from prison. Edward Vines, 47, breached a restraining order by writing to the BBC journalist while he was behind bars and later out on licence, a court heard. Judge Peter Ross, who sentenced Vines to 45 months, said the repeated contact amounted to ""psychological torture"". Ms Maitlis said she had been left ""jumpy around strangers"". The presenter first met Vines, of Clarkes Row, Oxford, when they were students at Cambridge University. He was first convicted of harassment in 2002. He was issued with an indefinite restraining order in 2009,which he was convicted of twice breaching last year. As well as contacting her while in prison for those offences, Vines wrote again while living in a bail hostel and subject of licence conditions. Judge Ross described this as ""wholly unsatisfactory"" and gave the Probation Service and the governor at HMP Bullingdon 10 days for a written explanation. In a statement read to Oxford Crown Court, Ms Maitlis said she had felt ""scared and let down"" after she heard Vines had breached the restraining order ""even from within the prison system"". She said it had affected her relationship with her husband, and scared her children, ""who thought the threats had gone away... while he was behind bars"". ""It has affected my ability to do my work, what time I feel able to come home at night (I work late nights often). It also makes me jumpy around strangers for no reason as I fear any advance might be him,"" she wrote. ""Altogether the breach has been a reminder for me that this man remains a constant threat in my life and my family's life and that my ability to do my work, hang out with my children and lead a normal family life without constant sense of suspicion and fear has been badly damaged."" Ms Maitlis said her husband had been left ""frustrated that we cannot get to the bottom of this problem even though we have been tackling it through the CPS and the court for over 20 years"". Vines's sentencing was delayed after his application to alter his plea was refused by the court. At the time, his lawyer, Michael Gould, told the court he could no longer represent his client as he had been ""professionally embarrassed"".

"This video can not be played A neighbour said the children were always accompanied by the parents A California couple have been arrested after police found their 13 children allegedly held captive at home, some ""shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks"". David Allen Turpin, 57, and Louise Anna Turpin, 49, were held on charges of torture and child endangerment. The couple's children - aged two to 29 - lived in Perris, 59 miles (95km) south-east of Los Angeles. Officers were alerted by one of the victims, a 17-year-old girl. The teenager - who appeared to be ""only 10 years old and slightly emaciated"" - on Sunday managed to escape and call the emergency number using a mobile phone found inside the house,the Riverside Sheriff's Department said in a statement,external. The 'happy family' at centre of allegations Police officers later found ""several children shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings"". Pictures show the Turpins in uniform and happy The officers were ""shocked"" to discover that seven of them were actually adults aged between 18 and 29. ""The victims appeared to be malnourished and very dirty,"" the police said. They are now being treated in local hospitals. The head of one of the hospitals, Mark Uffer, told Reuters news agency: ""It's actually heartbreaking for the staff and it's unbelievable what you see."" Mr and Mrs Turpin are now being held in jail with bail set at $9m (Â£6.5m) each. This video can not be played Police chief: 'I would call that torture' James Cook, BBC News, Perris On Muir Woods Road there is no hint of the horror inside number 160. This is a smart suburban home with three cars and a people carrier gleaming in the driveway. The curtains are drawn but a decorative Christmas star can be seen hanging in one window. The estate is neat and the houses on the road are spacious but they are close together. It is difficult to imagine how a family could hide such an enormous dark secret here. And yet that is exactly what seems to have happened. Neighbours are now engaged in soul-searching about whether they should have spotted that something was awry. No-one seems to know how long the siblings may have been held captive and, of course, no-one can answer the hardest question of all - why? According to public records, the couple lived in Texas for many years before moving to California in 2010. Mr Turpin has twice been declared bankrupt. At the time of his second bankruptcy he is said to have had a relatively well-paid job as an engineer at aeronautics and defence technology company Northrop Grumman. The couple's Facebook page contains numerous family photos However, with so many children and his wife not working, records suggest his expenses exceeded his income. The children's grandparents said that they had not seen the family for four or five years. James and Betty Turpin told ABC they were considered a good Christian family in their community and that ""God called on them"" to have so many children. The family's Facebook page shows numerous photos and videos of them, apparently happy and smiling. Many posts contain comments from family or friends. They appear to have renewed their wedding vows several times in recent years, often with their children present. In a YouTube video, the couple are seen renewing their vows at the Elvis Chapel in Las Vegas. Repeating after an Elvis impersonator, Mr Turpin tells his wife: ""I offer you this ring as a symbol of my love, baby, baby."" The children laugh along with the impersonator, and clap as the couple kisses. The grandparents said their grandchildren were home-schooled, but it is not entirely clear what that means. On the California Department of Education website,Mr Turpin is listed as the principal of Sandcastle Day School,external-  a private school operated out of his home. The school was opened in March 2011, the website says. Six pupils were enrolled there, all in different grades. In California, private schools operate outside the jurisdiction of the education department and most regulations. They are directly accountable to students and their parents or guardians, and the state has no authority to monitor or evaluate them. Teachers at private schools in California also do not need to hold a valid state teaching qualification. One neighbour told Reuters that the Turpin family ""were the type that you didn't really get to know anything about them"". Neighbours said the Turpins rarely emerged from their home ""Why don't we ever see the kids?"" neighbour Kimberly Milligan asked. ""In hindsight, we would have never thought this, but there were red flags. You never don't hear or see nine kids."" She recalled on one occasion saying hello to the children as they erected a Christmas nativity scene. But she said they stopped to stand frozen still, as if by doing so they would become invisible. She described them looking at her ""like a child who wants to make themselves invisible"".

"This video can not be played Police chief: 'I would call that torture' Police say 13 siblings who were found malnourished, some of them shackled, in a California home were torture victims. Riverside County Sheriff's office said the mother was ""perplexed"" when officers came to rescue the siblings, who are aged two to 29. Investigators said they had had no previous contacts with the couple, David and Louise Turpin. Their 17-year-old daughter escaped the home in Perris from a window on Sunday and alerted police. The 'happy family' charged with torture Can anyone open a school at home in California? The teenager was so emaciated that officials said she looked just 10 years old. Investigators said the unnamed girl had called 911 with a de-activated mobile phone. She showed officers photos of conditions in the suburban property, 59 miles (95km) south-east of Los Angeles. Police chief Captain Gregg Fellows told a news conference on Tuesday that three of the children were found shackled inside the home during the raid. ""Some of our staff described that there was a very foul smell inside the residence,"" Capt Fellows said. ""It was extremely dirty and as we reported previously many of the children were malnourished."" Mr Turpin, 57, and Mrs Turpin, 49, have been held on charges of torture and child endangerment. Bail was set at $9m (Â£6.5m) each.

He said investigators have found no evidence of sexual abuse or mental illness at this stage, but added the inquiry was just beginning. ""I can't get into the specific details of the conversation, but it seemed that the mother was perplexed as to why we were at that residence,"" Capt Fellows told reporters. The couple's Facebook page contains numerous family photos The Turpins moved into the property in 2014 and apparently schooled their children at home. Public records show the house is listed in a California education department directory as the location of ""Sandcastle Day School"", with Mr Turpin named as principal. It was described in official records as a non-religious and co-ed institution with six students enrolled. The rescued siblings were taken to local hospitals for treatment. Mark Uffer, from the Corona Regional Medical Center, told reporters that of the seven adults found, ""it's very clear they're suffering malnutrition"". ""They are very friendly, very co-operative and they are hopeful that life will get better for them after this event."" Ivan Trahan, a former lawyer for the couple in a 2011 bankruptcy case,told the Los Angeles Times,externalthat Mr Turpin had been well paid as an engineer at defence contractor Northrop Grumman. According to the newspaper, bankruptcy files show Mr Turpin earned more than $140,000 in 2011, but expenses for his large family exceeded his wages by more than $1,000 a month. Distraught neighbours said that they barely ever saw the family in public, and that they never spoke to nearby residents. ""Why don't we ever see the kids?"" neighbour Kimberly Milligan asked.

"Rapist John Worboys was denied a move to a lower security open prison before he was granted parole, it has emerged. The Parole Board denied his request in 2015 to be moved from high-security Wakefield Prison, after reading files and reports about him. The ex-London black-cab driver was granted release in November last year, but ministers are considering a judicial review of the decision. Worboys, 60, was convicted in 2009 of 19 offences against 12 women. He was given an indeterminate sentence andordered to serve at least eight years in jail,external. Why was Worboys released now? Cabbie who preyed on young women The Parole Board has now confirmed that he requested to be moved to an open prison, also known as a Category D jail, where prisoners are allowed to spend part of their day studying or visiting relatives to prepare for release. This request was turned down in 2015, but three Parole Board members concluded it was safe for him to be released in 2017. Parole Board Chairman Nick Hardwick said there should be an independent investigation into claims that Worboys' victims were not consulted about his release, which was reported by the media in January. He added: ""The anguish of his victims should be heard."" It has also emerged that the panel which granted Worboys' release heard from Dr Jackie Craissati, a clinical and forensic psychologist who has worked with a number of high-risk offenders. She was instructed by lawyers for Worboys and was among four psychologists who gave evidence. Two probation officers and three members of prison staff also appeared at the hearing. If the release goes ahead, it means Worboys, who changed his name by deed poll some time ago to John Radford, will be let out directly from the high-security Category A Wakefield Prison, in West Yorkshire. Altogether, he has spent 10 years in custody including a period on remand. It has also been confirmed that Worboys had been challenging his convictions as recently as 2015. He had applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in April 2013 claiming he had been been wrongfully convicted. The CCRC began assessing his application until Worboys withdrew it in May 2015, four months before his request for a transfer to an open prison was dealt with. Justice Secretary David Gauke has asked for legal adviceon whether November's decision to free Worboys can be contested in a judicial review. If a judge finds the Parole Board did not follow the correct process or reached its decision on the wrong basis, the move would be quashed and Worboys would have to make a fresh application for parole. The Parole Board has said ""correct procedures were followed"" in the case and are ""confident"" he would not reoffend. Mr Hardwick added that the board's decision ""should be open to legal challenge"" but warned against ""political interference"". In astatement,external, he said: ""It would be a bad day for us all if people's rightful abhorrence of Worboys' crimes or concern about a Parole Board decision allowed these basic principles of justice to be overturned.""

"Author Margaret Atwood Author Margaret Atwood has sparked a Twitter storm after a provocative column on the Me Too anti-sexual harassment movement. Her op-edpublished in the Globe and Mail newspaper,externalquestioned the impact of the movement against inappropriate sexual behaviour. Ms Atwood called the movement a ""symptom"" of a broken legal system. She also defended her support for due process in the case of a male writer accused of sexual harassment. Ms Atwood, the Canadian author of the dystopian novel The Handmaid's Tale, is the latest in a number of celebrities to face a backlash after weighing in on the movement sparked by the Harvey Weinstein scandal. French actress Catherine Deneuve recently apologised to sexual assault victims after signing on to a letter that argued the campaign against sexual harassment had gone too far.

"This video can not be played A neighbour said the children were always accompanied by the parents A California couple have been arrested after police found their 13 children allegedly held captive at home, some ""shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks"". David Allen Turpin, 57, and Louise Anna Turpin, 49, were held on charges of torture and child endangerment. The couple's children - aged two to 29 - lived in Perris, 59 miles (95km) south-east of Los Angeles. Officers were alerted by one of the victims, a 17-year-old girl. The teenager - who appeared to be ""only 10 years old and slightly emaciated"" - on Sunday managed to escape and call the emergency number using a mobile phone found inside the house,the Riverside Sheriff's Department said in a statement,external. The 'happy family' at centre of allegations Police officers later found ""several children shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings"". Pictures show the Turpins in uniform and happy The officers were ""shocked"" to discover that seven of them were actually adults aged between 18 and 29. ""The victims appeared to be malnourished and very dirty,"" the police said. They are now being treated in local hospitals. The head of one of the hospitals, Mark Uffer, told Reuters news agency: ""It's actually heartbreaking for the staff and it's unbelievable what you see."" Mr and Mrs Turpin are now being held in jail with bail set at $9m (Â£6.5m) each. This video can not be played Police chief: 'I would call that torture' James Cook, BBC News, Perris On Muir Woods Road there is no hint of the horror inside number 160. This is a smart suburban home with three cars and a people carrier gleaming in the driveway. The curtains are drawn but a decorative Christmas star can be seen hanging in one window. The estate is neat and the houses on the road are spacious but they are close together. It is difficult to imagine how a family could hide such an enormous dark secret here. And yet that is exactly what seems to have happened. Neighbours are now engaged in soul-searching about whether they should have spotted that something was awry. No-one seems to know how long the siblings may have been held captive and, of course, no-one can answer the hardest question of all - why? According to public records, the couple lived in Texas for many years before moving to California in 2010. Mr Turpin has twice been declared bankrupt. At the time of his second bankruptcy he is said to have had a relatively well-paid job as an engineer at aeronautics and defence technology company Northrop Grumman. The couple's Facebook page contains numerous family photos However, with so many children and his wife not working, records suggest his expenses exceeded his income. The children's grandparents said that they had not seen the family for four or five years. James and Betty Turpin told ABC they were considered a good Christian family in their community and that ""God called on them"" to have so many children. The family's Facebook page shows numerous photos and videos of them, apparently happy and smiling. Many posts contain comments from family or friends. They appear to have renewed their wedding vows several times in recent years, often with their children present. In a YouTube video, the couple are seen renewing their vows at the Elvis Chapel in Las Vegas. Repeating after an Elvis impersonator, Mr Turpin tells his wife: ""I offer you this ring as a symbol of my love, baby, baby."" The children laugh along with the impersonator, and clap as the couple kisses. The grandparents said their grandchildren were home-schooled, but it is not entirely clear what that means. On the California Department of Education website,Mr Turpin is listed as the principal of Sandcastle Day School,external-  a private school operated out of his home. The school was opened in March 2011, the website says. Six pupils were enrolled there, all in different grades. In California, private schools operate outside the jurisdiction of the education department and most regulations. They are directly accountable to students and their parents or guardians, and the state has no authority to monitor or evaluate them. Teachers at private schools in California also do not need to hold a valid state teaching qualification. One neighbour told Reuters that the Turpin family ""were the type that you didn't really get to know anything about them"". Neighbours said the Turpins rarely emerged from their home ""Why don't we ever see the kids?"" neighbour Kimberly Milligan asked. ""In hindsight, we would have never thought this, but there were red flags. You never don't hear or see nine kids."" She recalled on one occasion saying hello to the children as they erected a Christmas nativity scene. But she said they stopped to stand frozen still, as if by doing so they would become invisible. She described them looking at her ""like a child who wants to make themselves invisible"".

"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: ""Our hearts are still open to you"" The UK would be welcome to stay in the EU if it changed its mind about Brexit, Donald Tusk has suggested. The European Council President told MEPs that the UK would leave the bloc unless it had a ""change of heart"". ""We haven't had a change of heart. Our hearts are still open for you."" The comments were welcomed by MPs who want a referendum on the final Brexit deal but Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the British public had voted in record numbers to leave the EU. ""We have a great future outside the European Union and we should be embracing that,"" he said. The government has said there will be no second vote ahead of the UK's exit in March 2019. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also dismissed the idea while insisting that MPs have a ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament on the terms of the withdrawal agreement. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said the prospect of a second vote cannot be ruled out, although he was confident it would return a larger margin for Leave than in 2016 - when 17.4 million people voted for Brexit. The EU, he told BBC World Service, was intent on ""putting something on the table so unattractive to Britain that Parliament will vote for us to have a second referendum"". EU 'tightens terms of Brexit transition' Â£350m Brexit claim was 'too low' - Johnson Macron to tell UK: Do more over migrants As it stands, the UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019. The two sides reached a deal on so-called ""divorce issues"", including money and citizens' rights, in December and talks are now moving onto transitional arrangements and future co-operation. Revised draft EU guidelines obtained by several UK newspapers suggest the EU is toughening its stance on what changes the UK can make on immigration, trade and fishing during a roughly two year transition period. Speaking in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Tusk said he believed the other 27 EU members would maintain their unity when the talks resumed in March. ""The hardest work is still ahead of us, and time is limited,"" he said. ""If the UK government sticks to its decision to leave, Brexit will become a reality - with all its negative consequences - in March next year. Unless there is a change of heart among our British friends. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But Leave Means Leave, which grew out of the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 referendum, said Brussels had a history of not listening to the views of voters.

""I [am] a sell out to them, I [am] an embarrassment to the black and African-American people. I sold my son for money,"" she told BBC Outside Source. The family have moved out of their house in Stockholm following ""security concerns"" Mrs Mango added. Though she did not elaborate on the safety reasons, Mrs Mango said the attacks on H&M stores in and around Johannesburg were one reason for the move.

"Carillion apprentice Kyle Fitzsimmons is weeks away from achieving a higher level carpentry qualification ""I'm really worried I might lose access to all my work,"" says Kyle Fitzsimmons, who until Tuesday morning was studying for a higher level carpentry apprenticeship with Carillion in Liverpool. He and the rest of his class were getting on with their work at the training centre when their tutor was suddenly called to a meeting. When he came back, the tutor told the group they had to leave and that the electricity was about to be turned off. Someone would be in touch, the tutor told the apprentices. ""It all happened really quickly,"" says Kyle. Some members of the group found they could no longer access their work online. Kyle says he still can and is trying to print it off in case it disappears. He has just weeks to go before he qualifies and is desperate to get his certificate as he is hoping to travel to Australia to work as a carpenter there. This video can not be played Carillion apprentices 'sent home with no explanation' He joined Carillion straight out of school three years ago and has completed level one and two apprenticeships in carpentry and joinery - but the higher, level three qualification, is the one he really needs to get better paid work. The trainees work five days a week with local work-experience providers and then do block release courses in college for periods of up to eight weeks to improve their skills. Kyle says the whole experience has been frustrating, with tutors sometimes not turning up to teach the courses - but he persevered and has now all but achieved his goal. He says he has already been in touch with a local college and has a meeting to talk about completing his qualification there. Another apprentice, trainee bricklayer Jay Smith, told the BBC that nobody knew what to believe at his training centre in Birmingham. ""What I've been told is the centre has two weeks to come up with the money to pay its debts otherwise it's going to be sold or closed,"" he said. ""If it's sold, we're moved to a different training centre or another area -  but if it's closed, we lose the apprenticeships. ""Yesterday we saw people leaving, the man in charge of stock just left, he was the first to go. ""Then, we saw people high up in the office with their bags packed leaving. ""I saw another man going, and more people just with their bags packed going."" The Construction Industries Training Board estimates that Carillion has about 1,400 apprentices. CITB says it is working to secure the future of the apprentices and hopes a package of grants and transfer incentives it is putting together will ""encourage construction employers to enable these apprentices to join their existing workforce"". ""CITB's priority is to do all it can to ensure that Carillion apprentices can continue their training so their skills are not lost,"" said chief executive Sarah Beale. The Department for Education said the transfer of the training of Carillion apprentices to the CITB would help protect them. ""We will continue to work closely with the CITB to support apprentices to remain in existing placements or to find new employment with other local organisations so they can complete their training,"" an official said. Carillion apprentices can contact CITB on carillion.apprenticeshipsupport@citb.co.uk or 0344 994 4010.

"Construction and services company Carillionhas collapsed, putting thousands of jobs and pensions at risk. The firm isinvolved in major public projectssuch as the HS2 high-speed rail line and manages public service contracts including schools and prisons. Employees and sub-contractors alike have reacted to the news, worried about their wages, pensions and hundreds of thousand of pounds owed in contracts. Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Carillion collapse: What next? Oxfordshire firefighters on standby to deliver meals ""I work on a project in Birmingham on Midland Metropolitan Hospital, which is work subcontracted from Carillion. ""We turned up this morning and were told they've gone into liquidation and that's it. The site was closed. ""There was 20 of us working for my company, and on the whole site there was 520 people for different companies. ""Everyone on the site got told: 'That's it, go home.' My company said, 'You've been laid off.' ""People were just grabbing their stuff and leaving, not knowing what they'd be doing tomorrow morning. ""They've literally locked the gate. They've told us we can get our personal tools off the site if they're small, but that's it. ""There were kids on there doing their apprenticeships with college, they're gone too. ""I just don't know what to do with myself. I've registered with a few agencies since this morning but I don't know what I'm going to do for rent. ""I'm due wages from my company I don't know if I'm going to be getting. When I asked my boss, he said the company is owed money for wages. Well, if they're not getting it, we're not getting it."" ""The pension is one of the things I was intending to withdraw. ""It was estimated at Â£43,000, which may be small to some people but it's a lot for me. ""We haven't even contacted Carillion with regards to withdrawing it. I think I'd be lucky to even speak to anyone, it was bad enough when I was just getting my estimates. ""It's a big disaster. I heard recently they were struggling but I didn't know it was that bad. Their ability to repay the money and what it might have done to the share value, I don't know. ""I had my money from another company transferred to the Carillion pension fund as well. It looks as though it was a really bad decision. There's no way I could have known. ""This pension was all I had to fall back on, now it's in doubt. I haven't a clue what I'll do if it doesn't come."" ""We're a supplier who do work for Carillion. We provide support services in commercial finance. ""We've invoiced them for Â£240,000, going back to September last year. I don't think we'll get this money back. ""For us, it's a bad day, it'll impact us for the year. We're a large company and therefore we will survive. But it's just survival. There's smaller contractors who will be impacted worse. ""I guess government contracts will be protected, but we will probably be going directly to the end customers to try to take on those contracts so that we can survive. ""Obviously, we won't be able to recover what's been lost. Looking at the size of the debt they seem to have, I don't see a lot of hope of anybody getting anything back.

"The timetables of big UK building projects have been thrown into doubt by the collapse of Carillion. Major new hospitals in Liverpool and the West Midlands face further delays after the liquidation of the UK's second biggest construction firm. Work has yet to restart on those sites, causing uncertainty among workers and contractors about the next steps. Other firms will also need to step in to finish road and rail projects spanning the UK. Carillion leaves behind major transport projects in places including Aberdeen and Yorkshire after its collapse on Monday. But the biggest concerns are for the new Royal Liverpool Hospital and the Midland Metropolitan Hospital. Carillion directors to be investigated Apprentices given notice after collapse 'Not alone in hitting problems' Toby Lewis, chief executive of the Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, said local healthcare partners were ""anxious to re-establish timescale clarity"" for the Midland Metropolitan Hospital. The overdue 669-bed hospital is ""two-thirds built"" and ministers have reassured staff that it remains a priority, he said. The Liverpool hospital is closer to completion and will be finished, but its opening date is unclear after it was pushed back again by Carillion in December, according to the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust. It looks all quiet at the site of the new Â£335m Royal Hospital in Liverpool. Despite all the lights being on in the building, there appeared to be no work taking place. One person on site, who did not want to be identified, said there were 100 staff there - both Carillion and subcontractors. He said they had been told that another company would come in to oversee the work on the new hospital and that work would start again next week. Workers and subcontractors were briefed today and ""reassured that any work that they undertake going forward will be paid for"", according to the local hospital trust. But the statement makes no mention of any back pay. Looking at defaced signs to be found around the outside of site, this seems to be a major concern. The new Midlands Metropolitan Hospital is two thirds complete Normally buzzing with workers and activity, the 16-acre site where a new hospital is being built in Smethwick, near Birmingham, is nearly deserted. A Carillion worker, who did not want to be named, said there were normally some 500 sub-contractors on site, but today there were about 20 people in total. ""It's quiet here because most of the sub contractors have not come because they are worried about the job,"" they said. The worker, who said he learned the firm had gone into liquidation from its Facebook page, added he will get paid for this week and next but after that did not know what would happen. The man, and another worker who had been with Carillion for more than 10 years, hope the project will continue and keep them on. Pressure is mounting on a number of other Carillion construction contracts. In South Yorkshire, there is concern about the tram-train project between Rotherham and Sheffield, which was already over budget and behind schedule. Labour MP Sarah Champion said: ""We're already two years over time, we're already 400% over budget, and I just don't want the government to see this as an excuse - with Carillion going who are the main deliverer - to actually can it."" Some of Carillion's other contracts in England and Wales include: A contract for widening the A14 in Cambridgeshire Regeneration of a former brewery in Sunderland, which has ceased with immediate effect Removing roundabouts on the A55 in North Wales The Scottish government has sought to reassure drivers that a major roads project in Aberdeen will not necessarily be delayed by Carillion's demise. Economy Secretary Keith Brown said Carillion's partners were committed to filling the shortfall in the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) project.

"Steve Bannon (centre) attended a House Intelligence Committee closed door meeting on Tuesday Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to US President Donald Trump, has been summoned to testify before a grand jury, US media report. He was reportedly subpoenaed by former FBI director Robert Mueller, who is leading an inquiry into alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election campaign. Mr Bannon appeared separately on Tuesday before a Congressional panel. Congress is holding its own inquiry into the allegations. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The dates that define Steve Bannon's sharp rise and fall US grand juries explained Mr Bannon was subpoenaed last week, the New York Times reports,external, quoting an unnamed person with direct knowledge of the matter. However the summons could be a negotiating tactic by Mr Mueller to persuade Mr Bannon to agree to be questioned by investigators in the less formal setting of the special counsel's offices in Washington, the paper's source added. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington As prosecutors hunt for criminal misdeeds, they have a number of arrows in their quiver. One of the more powerful is the grand jury subpoena. Putting witnesses in the glare of the courtroom spotlight, in front of a panel of jurors, with every word noted and every answer compelled, can be quite revelatory. Steve Bannon could become the first member of the Trump inner circle to get this treatment. That he received his court summons just days after news broke that the former Trump campaign head told author Michael Wolff he thought the presidential family could be implicated in money-laundering and treasonous actions may cause some sleepless nights in the White House. Other top Trump staffers - including former chief-of-staff Reince Priebus, press secretary Sean Spicer and White House counsel Don McGrath - have had informal interviews with the special counsel team. Bannon's subpoena may just be a means of encouraging him to be more co-operative - or a sign that Mr Mueller's investigation has a particular interest in what he has to say. At the very least, this latest bit of news is a sign that, surely to the dismay of the president, the Russia investigation is far from winding down. He was appointed by the US justice department in May of last year to oversee an investigation into possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams have been accused of colluding with Russian agents to influence the US election in the Republican candidate's favour. US intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA, concluded with ""high confidence"" in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to thumb the scale of the US election for Mr Trump. Both the Russian and US presidents have poured scorn on suggestions of collusion, with Mr Trump calling it ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". He helped shape Mr Trump's ""America First"" election campaign message and served as one of his closest aides before being sacked in August. But he recently fell out with Mr Trump publicly after reportedly making comments about the president and his family in a newly-published book, Fire and Fury, by Michael Wolff. He was quoted as calling a meeting in June 2016 between Mr Trump's son Donald Jr and a group of Russians ""treasonous"". It took place at Trump Tower in New York and also involved Mr Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, his then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. A Russian intermediary had contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would ""incriminate"" Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump Jr later defended the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya had offered only ""inane nonsense"" but he also said he ""probably would have done things a little differently"" in retrospect. Four people have been charged: Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, his former business associate, pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering unrelated to the 2016 election George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, admitted lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to the Trump administration, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI over meetings he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak The House Intelligence Committee is also investigating the allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Its proceedings on Tuesday were not open to the public. This is one of four investigations being conducted by Congress into the alleged collusion, with others launched by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee.

Michelle shared the messages from the driver and Just Eat's response on Twitter.,external The messages appear to show the delivery driver started a conversation with Michelle over WhatsApp after delivering her takeaway. He asked whether Michelle, who lives in Gloucestershire, had a boyfriend - saying he didn't want to ""make problems"". The messages were signed off with ""good night bby [sic] see you next time when I get your meal"".

"Ministers are feeling the pressure of awkward questions today. Carillion is not the first big public contractor to run into trouble under successive governments and surely won't be the last. But why was so much expensive business and responsibility heaped onto a single company - and a company many felt for months could be heading for trouble? Away from Whitehall - where day-to-day decisions on public projects are taken - Oxfordshire Council say they've noticed the warning signs for some time. Now, the sight of that local authority putting fire fighters on standby to provide school meals may provide enormous fun for the children, but it also symbolically reinforces the impression of a shock to the system and all hands to the pumps, like the convening of the emergency Whitehall committee, Cobra, later on Monday. Carillion collapse raises job fears Carillion collapse: What next? Firefighters on standby to deliver meals Other questions being raised today run deeper. Far deeper. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington says there can be no question of asking taxpayers to bail out a private company, along with its shareholders. Few are arguing with that. Free marketeers can argue lucrative contracts come with risks attached in private business, and the same risks should be borne, and prudently guarded against, when it comes to public projects.  On the left, there's scorn for the idea that profits should be privatised and losses nationalised. But the Carillion collapse may also be the spur for an ideological debate as fundamental as any seen since Margaret Thatcher began to roll back the frontiers of the state in the 1980s. A senior member of Team Corbyn, one not usually prone to public displays of emotion, told me he believed the Carillion affair would turn out to be a political ""watershed"". The party hierarchy is preparing to reel out statements and push lines of attack challenging the role of private business in the public sphere on multiple fronts. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has already pledged to consider taking a range of Private Finance Initiative schemes back into public ownership or control or both. This week, Labour shadow ministers will challenge the fundamental case for private sector involvement in prisons, schools, hospitals. Attacks will be seasoned by the suggestion that some of those responsible for handing out contracts have too easily ended up taking well paid jobs with the recipients. Just a couple of years BC (before Corbyn) the case in principle for significant private sector involvement in public services seemed to go virtually unchallenged. Now the settled political consensus has been opened to question again. The case for private enterprise in the public sphere is far from being lost. But the fact that ministers are having to make it again, afresh, speaks volumes about the new polarisation of view which has taken hold at Westminster, and on which the next general election will be fought.

"The Turpin family with an Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas, where parents David and Louise renewed their vows They lived in a smart suburban home, owned nice cars and posed together on family holidays. Outwardly, the California couple accused of torturing, imprisoning and endangering their 13 children presided over a happy American family. But when police entered their home on Sunday, they found a very different reality from the one that David and Louise Turpin posted to Facebook. Prosecutors say they found the couple's 13 children, aged from two to 29, in a state of severe malnutrition. The couple have denied all the charges against them. Prosecutors have painted a disturbing picture of a couple who ""punished"" their children over a period of years by tying them to their beds for weeks or months, first with ropes and later - after one escaped - with chains and padlocks. Punishments also took the form of beatings or strangulations. District Attorney Mike Hestrin said the children were forced to live nocturnally, and were allowed to shower only once a year. There was evidence they were not freed from their shackles to go to the bathroom, he said. The Turpins on a family trip to Disneyland - it was apparently a favourite destination He said they were only allowed to eat one meal a day but their parents would taunt them with food. ""The parents would apparently buy food for themselves and not allow the children to eat it,"" Mr Hestrin told reporters. ""They would buy food... apple pies, pumpkin pies, leave it on the counter, let the children look at it but not eat the food."" Some of the children were suffering from brain and nerve damage caused by the prolonged abuse, Mr Hestrin  said. They had not visited a doctor in more than four years and had never seen a dentist, he added. Despite being ""home-schooled"" they lacked even basic knowledge of the outside world and did not know what a police officer was, he also said. They were however allowed to write in journals, and hundreds were recovered from the home. The alarm was raised when a 17-year-old girl called police saying she had escaped the house by climbing out of a window. Mr Hestrin said the girl and her siblings had planned the escape for two years. He said another of the siblings had escaped with the teenager but became afraid and returned to the house. Riverside County Sheriff's Capt Greg Fellows, speaking alongside Mr Hestrin, said the girl had photographs to back up her story. When police arrived at the house one of the couple's children was still chained to a bed and two others may have just been released, Mr Hestrin said. David Turpin's parents, James and Betty Turpin, told ABC News they were ""surprised and shocked"" at the allegations made against the couple, describing them as ""the sweetest family"". They said their grandchildren were home-schooled, and that they had not seen their son and daughter-in-law in several years, although they had spoken by phone. Referring to David and Louise, they said ""God called on them"" to have as many children as they did. They also said the children were given ""very strict"" home-schooling and they had to memorise long passages of the Bible. Some of the children were aiming to learn it in its entirety, they said. Despite this, the school listed at their address is on public records as ""non-religious"". The house where 'children were chained to beds' Shackled siblings found in California home When the grandparents last visited the family, four or five years ago, they noticed the children ""looked thin"", they said, but they seemed like a ""happy family"". The sister of Louise Turpin, Elizabeth Flores, told ABC's Good Morning America programme that she had never felt comfortable around her brother-in-law,external, and accused him of watching her in the shower when she briefly lived with the couple. ""I thought they were really strict, but I didn't see any abuse,"" Ms Flores said. The couple's Facebook page contains numerous family photos Another sister, Teresa Robinette, said she was ""hurt and shocked"" by the revelations,externalabout the children's alleged treatment. ""I always made comments to Louise when I did talk to her, about, 'Gosh, they're so skinny.' And she would laugh it off: 'Well David's so tall and lanky. They're going to be like him',"" she told NBC's Today programme. Residents in California have struggled to comprehend the discovery at the spacious Turpin family home located on Muir Woods Road in Perris, some 59 miles (95km) south-east of Los Angeles. ""I can't believe this. I can't believe this. It's so sad,"" neighbour Jennifer Luna told CBS News. Andrew Santillan, who lives nearby, told the network: ""I had no idea this was going on. I didn't know there were kids in the house."" Nicole Gooding, who has lived in the neighbourhood for three years, told Reuters news agency the first time she saw the family was two months ago when the mother and children were cleaning the garden. ""I had never seen them at all until that day,"" she said. Other neighbours expressed concern about the appearance of the children and said they rarely saw them playing outside. Neighbours stand outside the Turpin's home in Perris, California The couple had lived at their current California address since 2014, and moved to the state from Texas in 2010. A family who say they bought their old home outside Fort Worth in 1999 shared photographs of its condition with a local CBS news affiliate on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content?

A neighbour at another Texas address, Shelly Vinyard, told CBS that she used to describe their house as like a ""religious compound"". She said she remembered asking one of the girls her name, but the girl responded that she wasn't allowed to tell people it. As with what happened inside their home, the family kept any serious financial troubles hidden from public view. This video can not be played A neighbour said the children were always accompanied by the parents Mr Turpin is said to have had a relatively well-paid job as an engineer at aeronautics and defence technology company Northrop Grumman. Mrs Turpin is listed in public records as a housewife, with no income. With many children and only one earner, public records suggest the family's expenses exceeded their income. Bankruptcy documents show Mr Turpin earned more than $140,000 (Â£124,000) in 2011, but that the family's expenses exceeded his take-home pay by more than $1,000 a month. A lawyer who represented the couple when they filed for bankruptcy for a second time in 2011, Ivan Trahan, told the Los Angeles Times: ""To me and my wife, Nancy, who was with me during the interviews, we always thought of them as very nice people who spoke highly of their children.""

"Cars and lorries were tailed back on the M74 southbound Heavy snowfalls have been causing disruption as wintry conditions sweep across large swathes of Scotland. Traffic between Scotland and England has been affected, with closures on the M74 in both directions. Traffic Scotland said gritters were working to make the motorway safe enough to fully reopen. Police Scotland has advised motorists to avoid the area. Some drivers complained of being stuck in traffic for several hours. On the Isle of Skye, the main road - the A87- was blocked for several hours in both directions by a jack-knifed lorry. The closure meant two school buses with pupils who had been stuck for hours had to return to Portree High. The school said they would be put in temporary accommodation for the night. The Met Office has issued an amber alert for south west Scotland, extending to parts of the central belt, lasting until Wednesday morning. Thundersnow was also forecast in the west. A lorry jack-knifed on the A87 in Skye Earlier on Tuesday evening, all three lanes on the M74 southbound at J12 Millbank were closed. One lane later re-opened but traffic was again halted as conditions worsened. Police advised drivers to follow the gritters and said the delays would take some time to clear. A subsequent accident at J15 Beattock led to closure of the northbound carriageway. Traffic Scotland apologised to those stuck in the queues. Motorist Nigel Cliff, who was heading south, told BBC Scotland at about 19:00 that he had been stationary on the motorway for about an hour and a half. ""It's pretty rough,"" he said. ""It's snowing again now so it is probably only going to get worse. There are cars and lorries just sitting here - nothing moving."" Mr Cliff said he was prepared for the conditions: ""I've got food. I've got big thick coats, big thick socks. My wife always makes sure I've got everything in the car."" The M74 was closed between Millbank and Abington due to the wintry conditions Transport Minister Humza Yousaf tweeted that a number of HGVs had ""lost traction with challenging weather impacting on M74"".

"Thomas Hord's family fought for seven years to win a six-figure payout for his life-long care needs NHS medical blunders dating back more than two decades are still costing millions of pounds a year in compensation, it has emerged. The negligence bill for mistakes made before 1995 - mainly maternity failings - has begun to rise for the first time in five years. A patients' charity said the figures showed just how long some families have to wait for payouts. The NHS said it had taken steps to speed up the process. This video can not be played What does NHS compensation pay for? Medical mistakes left youngster Thomas Hord, now eight years old, with cerebral palsy affecting all four limbs. He is unable to speak or walk. Thomas was starved of oxygen at birth after midwives failed to place a foetal heart rate monitor in the right position. But although Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust quickly admitted mistakes had been made shortly after his birth in 2009, the family had to wait a further seven years for compensation. They secured a Â£2.5m lump sum and will also get annual payments for Thomas's care. Thomas's father Chris, 44, of Crawley, West Sussex, said it can take lawyers years to work out the extent of the damage to a child. ""A lot of it is to do with the fact you can't tell how affected they are going to be until a child starts going through their development,"" he said. The bill for medical negligence claims in England has risen four-fold in the past decade, to Â£1.6 billion last year. But the NHS in England also has a separate Government-funded scheme to deal with negligence claims for events before April 1995. Its payouts rose by 13% last year to Â£27.7m, the BBC's analysis of official data shows. It is thought increased life expectancy and rising care costs may be behind the rise. Patients' charity Action Against Medical Accidents said the growing size of the historical bill demonstrated the tragic, long-term human cost of often basic maternity errors. Chief executive Peter Walsh said: ""We, as a charity, have been going for 35 years and we still see the same mistakes, the same avoidable errors causing injury now as we did 35 years ago."" Mr Walsh called for more consistency in NHS training for midwives and doctors, saying examples of good practice seen in some hospitals should be rolled out across the country. Daniel Spencer was left severely disabled by failings in care during his birth Sixteen-year-old Daniel Spencer, from Malvern, Worcestershire, was left severely disabled after being starved of oxygen shortly before birth. Daniel requires round-the-clock care, uses a wheelchair and struggles to communicate, after failings in care during labour at Worcestershire Royal Hospital in 2001 left him with cerebral palsy. His family's fight for justice took nearly 14 years. Father Olly said it took 12 years for the NHS trust to admit partial liability for his son's condition. The family had to fund Daniel's care themselves during that time, with mum Susan giving up work to look after him. He said: ""Any parent who has gone through what we have been through knows there is an element of post-traumatic stress. ""I have had lots of sleepless nights from it and a lot of things like money worries, while we try and fight the case and try and deal with everyday life."" In 2015, the courts awarded Daniel a Â£2.7m lump sum, with extra annual payments for ongoing care. At the time, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said it ""sincerely regrets"" the injury Daniel suffered. The money is now helping to pay for specialist equipment, which Olly said was often ""stupidly expensive"", as well as home alterations and physiotherapy. More than two thirds of historical claims relate to mistakes during birth There are a number of reasons why many years might elapse between a medical mistake and a negligence payout. Complex legal cases can take a long time to resolve and often involve extensive medical assessments. Sometimes, assessments about a child's care needs can only be made when they are older. In other cases, families don't realise until years later that they might have a claim. Critics also say that too often the NHS refuses to admit responsibility, meaning the court process takes longer and costs more. Mr Walsh said: ""We have seen claims that have taken over 10 years to resolve. ""Things have improved, but not enough has been done to speed up the process."" NHS Resolution, which handles negligence claims on behalf of English hospitals, said it was still receiving new claims under the historical scheme. A spokesman said the cost of those claims was also rising because of factors such as increasing life expectancy and a recent change to the way lump-sum payments were calculated. Negligence claims are still being received for errors made in maternity units more than 20 years ago He said: ""NHS Resolution is now involved right from the start in order to improve the support for families and the healthcare staff involved in these rare but tragic incidents and to speed up resolution."" From next year, NHS Resolution will also offer cash incentives to hospital trusts which take steps to make maternity services safer. Lapses lead to mistake every five births Litigation 'threatening NHS finances' Birth problems twice as common in some trusts It forms part of a Government plan to halve the rate of neonatal deaths, stillbirths, maternal deaths and brain injuries caused during or shortly after labour by 2025. The Department of Health, which foots the historical negligence bill, said the plan would ""help to reduce traumatic and costly safety failings in the NHS"". Legal costs made up more than a third of the overall NHS negligence bill in the past five years. The Department of Health has set out plans to cap the fees that lawyers can recoup from the taxpayer when they win negligence cases for their clients. A spokesman said: ""We're ensuring taxpayers' money is spent effectively by taking action against law firms creaming off excessive legal costs that dwarf the damages recovered - but we're also clear we want to ensure patients continue to access justice at a reasonable cost."" But Mr Walsh said this plan ""risks denying access to justice and the opportunity for the NHS to learn much-needed lessons"". The hospital trust responsible for the biggest historical negligence bill, at Â£8.4 million over the past five years, was Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The trust declined to comment. The trust with the second-largest bill, Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said its historical negligence costs had dropped by nearly half since 2013/14, reflecting its ""improvement journey"". Third-place University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust said its historical negligence bill related to 12 cases dating back to before 1995. A spokesman said: ""Nine of those relate to children who underwent heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the 1990s, prior to the public inquiry, which resulted in wide-scale changes in clinical governance across the NHS."" In general, trusts which run larger hospitals would be expected to have larger historical negligence bills. Payouts for historical negligence cases in Northern Ireland nearly trebled last year, to Â£4.1m. A spokesman for Northern Ireland's Department of Health said most of this cost related to just two cases. Historical cases - defined as those before 1993 in Northern Ireland - accounted for 15% of its entire litigation bill over the past three years, a much higher proportion than in England. The NHS in Scotland has no separate scheme for historical negligence cases, but around Â£4.5m was paid out last year for mistakes made before 1998. However, the proportion of claims arising from mistakes in maternity wards has halved in the past decade. The Scottish Government said its NHS had a commitment to ""learning lessons when something goes wrong"". In Wales, health trusts paid more than Â£160,000 last year for medical mistakes made more than 20 years ago, although not all trusts responded to requests for information.

"Rapist John Worboys was denied a move to a lower security open prison before he was granted parole, it has emerged. The Parole Board denied his request in 2015 to be moved from high-security Wakefield Prison, after reading files and reports about him. The ex-London black-cab driver was granted release in November last year, but ministers are considering a judicial review of the decision. Worboys, 60, was convicted in 2009 of 19 offences against 12 women. He was given an indeterminate sentence andordered to serve at least eight years in jail,external. Why was Worboys released now? Cabbie who preyed on young women The Parole Board has now confirmed that he requested to be moved to an open prison, also known as a Category D jail, where prisoners are allowed to spend part of their day studying or visiting relatives to prepare for release. This request was turned down in 2015, but three Parole Board members concluded it was safe for him to be released in 2017. Parole Board Chairman Nick Hardwick said there should be an independent investigation into claims that Worboys' victims were not consulted about his release, which was reported by the media in January. He added: ""The anguish of his victims should be heard."" It has also emerged that the panel which granted Worboys' release heard from Dr Jackie Craissati, a clinical and forensic psychologist who has worked with a number of high-risk offenders. She was instructed by lawyers for Worboys and was among four psychologists who gave evidence. Two probation officers and three members of prison staff also appeared at the hearing. If the release goes ahead, it means Worboys, who changed his name by deed poll some time ago to John Radford, will be let out directly from the high-security Category A Wakefield Prison, in West Yorkshire. Altogether, he has spent 10 years in custody including a period on remand. It has also been confirmed that Worboys had been challenging his convictions as recently as 2015. He had applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in April 2013 claiming he had been been wrongfully convicted. The CCRC began assessing his application until Worboys withdrew it in May 2015, four months before his request for a transfer to an open prison was dealt with. Justice Secretary David Gauke has asked for legal adviceon whether November's decision to free Worboys can be contested in a judicial review. If a judge finds the Parole Board did not follow the correct process or reached its decision on the wrong basis, the move would be quashed and Worboys would have to make a fresh application for parole. The Parole Board has said ""correct procedures were followed"" in the case and are ""confident"" he would not reoffend. Mr Hardwick added that the board's decision ""should be open to legal challenge"" but warned against ""political interference"". In astatement,external, he said: ""It would be a bad day for us all if people's rightful abhorrence of Worboys' crimes or concern about a Parole Board decision allowed these basic principles of justice to be overturned.""

"Cars and lorries were tailed back on the M74 southbound Heavy snowfalls have been causing disruption as wintry conditions sweep across large swathes of Scotland. Traffic between Scotland and England has been affected, with closures on the M74 in both directions. Traffic Scotland said gritters were working to make the motorway safe enough to fully reopen. Police Scotland has advised motorists to avoid the area. Some drivers complained of being stuck in traffic for several hours. On the Isle of Skye, the main road - the A87- was blocked for several hours in both directions by a jack-knifed lorry. The closure meant two school buses with pupils who had been stuck for hours had to return to Portree High. The school said they would be put in temporary accommodation for the night. The Met Office has issued an amber alert for south west Scotland, extending to parts of the central belt, lasting until Wednesday morning. Thundersnow was also forecast in the west. A lorry jack-knifed on the A87 in Skye Earlier on Tuesday evening, all three lanes on the M74 southbound at J12 Millbank were closed. One lane later re-opened but traffic was again halted as conditions worsened. Police advised drivers to follow the gritters and said the delays would take some time to clear. A subsequent accident at J15 Beattock led to closure of the northbound carriageway. Traffic Scotland apologised to those stuck in the queues. Motorist Nigel Cliff, who was heading south, told BBC Scotland at about 19:00 that he had been stationary on the motorway for about an hour and a half. ""It's pretty rough,"" he said. ""It's snowing again now so it is probably only going to get worse. There are cars and lorries just sitting here - nothing moving."" Mr Cliff said he was prepared for the conditions: ""I've got food. I've got big thick coats, big thick socks. My wife always makes sure I've got everything in the car."" The M74 was closed between Millbank and Abington due to the wintry conditions Transport Minister Humza Yousaf tweeted that a number of HGVs had ""lost traction with challenging weather impacting on M74"". He added: ""Necessary to close the junction to get additional gritters and equipment to the scene."" Live updates on heavy snowfall Have you seen Sir Andy Flurry? Your pictures of snowy scenes What is thundersnow? Snow disruption in Northern Ireland Police Scotland said anyone taking to the roads in the worst affected areas was ""highly likely"" to experience disruption, and urged drivers to consider carefully if the journey was necessary. A Multi Agency Response Team (Mart) is now operational to monitor conditions. The deputy first minister and transport minister also chaired a meeting of the Scottish government's resilience operation to receive an update on the situation. Allow Twitter content?

Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said: ""The Met Office has upgraded its snow warning for parts of south west and central Scotland, with the areas affected by the amber warning set to see heavier snowfalls and greater disruption to transport. ""The snow and ice is likely to lead to difficult driving conditions, so I'd urge all travellers to take extra time and plan their journeys in advance. The high winds forecast for later in the week may also see some bridge restrictions."" Conditions were also poor on the M74 northbound at Abington A car ended up well and truly stuck in the south of Edinburgh The gritter came too late for this driver on the Isle of Skye Can you spot it? A crashed car is buried by snow beside this road in County Antrim The Met Office amber ""be prepared"" warning - which means transport and power supplies may be disrupted with a potential risk to lives and property -  was issued from 15:00 on Tuesday until 08:00 on Wednesday and also extends across much of Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said crews had attended 12 crashes as a direct result of the poor conditionsand at least 13 schools were closed. Some high ground was likely to see 15-25 cm (6-10 inches) of snow building up, especially above 200-300m, with 5-10 cm (2-4 inches) more typical at low levels throughout the warning area. Yellow warnings of snow are likely to remain in place across most of the country until late on Friday. Snow depths across Scotland at 17:00 on Tuesday Western Isles Council cancelled all bus services to and from Stornoway from 19:00 due to risk from snow and ice. Across Scotland more than 100 schools and nurseries were closed on Tuesday, with more than 10,000 pupils missing classes. In the Highland council area, the weather affected 13 secondary schools, 53 primaries, two special schools and 26 nurseries. About 8,900 pupils had an unexpected day off classes. Dumfries and Galloway Councilsaid 20 schools were closed due to weather problems or heating failures,external.  Some schools also closed in theEast Ayrshire,externalandStirling Council,externalareas. This video can not be played Snowy conditions have led to school closures and some travel disruption Frustrated drivers faced long delays in Carluke on Tuesday evening In North Lanarkshire, all prelim exams for secondary pupils were postponed due to transport problems and all cafes in council leisure and culture buildings were shut. South Lanarkshire Council closed 18 schools and nurseries throughout the day. A number of airports were affected by the wintry conditions, with Inverness airport closed for most of the morning. Flights in an out of Aberdeen were also disrupted and Glasgow airport was briefly closed while the runway, taxi and passenger routes were cleared. Police Scotland urged drivers of heavy goods vehicles to exercise extreme caution, and warned they may be asked to park up by officers. The snow led to tricky driving conditions near Inverness A BBC Weather Watcher sent this image of a snowy marina at Ratho, near Edinburgh Head of road policing, Ch Supt Stewart Carle, said: ""Winter driving is a question of common sense and drivers should ask themselves if they really need to travel when conditions are poor. ""No-one should ever place themselves at risk on the road and it may be worth considering postponing your journey or making alternative arrangements such as delaying travel until conditions improve or using public transport. ""If you are travelling on the roads you should ensure you and your vehicle are adequately prepared for the conditions, making sure you have sufficient fuel and supplies such as warm clothing, food and water in the event you are delayed for several hours.

"Tesco has made changes to its Clubcard loyalty scheme - dropping the value of some rewards and raising some others. Shoppers collect points for money spent with the supermarket giant and these then become vouchers which can be used for things such as restaurant meals. Some could be used for four times or two times their value, but to ""make things easier"" Tesco said most are changing to three times their value. But the move provoked an angry response from customers on social media. Tesco emailed customers on Monday to tell them of the change, which was introduced immediately. On its website, it said it was ""simplifying"" the rewards available so people did not ""have to keep checking whether you're getting two times or four times the value depending on which reward you're claiming"". A spokesperson added: ""This builds on the work we did last year to further help customers, when we introduced the new contactless Clubcard and made significant improvements to the Tesco Clubcard app."" While the retailer said any orders already placed for vouchers would be honoured, it did not give any time for customers to cash in vouchers which they had been saving. Some of the rewards dropping in value are for popular restaurant chains and days out. One shopper said he had in effect lost Â£100 as a result of the change. Allow Twitter content?

""The vast majority of Clubcard customers redeem their vouchers at face value, rather than use the rewards scheme, so this change will only affect a small minority of total Clubcard customers,"" a spokesman told the BBC. But Anika Newjoto, editor of the Shopper Points loyalty points website, said: ""Making these changes with no notice stinks. ""Tesco Clubcard vouchers have a two-year expiry date. Many shoppers collect them over a longer period to pay for a large transaction. ""Loyalty schemes are meant to work two ways, not one way. If a shopper gives their business to a store based on the promise of certain rewards, it is totally unfair for those rewards to be taken away or reduced in value with absolutely no notice."" Tesco aims to make dough out of fashion for veganism Tesco says turnaround is on track as sales rise again The couple who helped transform the way we shop Martin Lewis, founder of the Money Saving Expert website, called on Tesco to rethink its decision, especially its immediate introduction. Calling the move ""a slap in the face to hundreds of thousands of loyal customers"", he said: ""This is a terrible policy implementation by Tesco. ""I call on it to urgently review its policy to give a window of opportunity to those who've already saved substantial points, and will lose out by these changes, to still redeem at the prior value."" Tesco is not the first supermarket to cut back on the benefits of its reward scheme. It introduced Clubcard in 1995 and within a year, customers were spending 28% more in its stores and 16% less with its closest rival Sainsbury's, which by then had introduced its own Reward card. Sainsbury's moved over to the Nectar card scheme, in conjunction with other companies, in 2002 andin 2015 it halved the reward points available to its card holders. Annich McIntosh, editor of Loyalty Magazine, told the BBC that loyalty schemes were ""at an eight-way interchange"". ""So many different things are happening in loyalty schemes and the supermarkets are in competition with online companies,"" she said. ""Amazon do things with Prime that is really loyalty but don't call it loyalty. They are very clever and tie the customer in to such an extent that they think they can't do without it because of all the things they are getting. ""Customer loyalty is at the basis of all business and that isn't going to change. It's how people persuade you to be loyal that is up for major change and this could be a very exciting year for the sector."" She added: ""Any change to these programmes causes a row. When Avios changed a few years ago, there was a furore online but then later I heard people saying it was actually better for them.""

"The UK's inflation rate has fallen for the first time since June, mainly because of the impact of air fares. The inflation rate dipped to 3% in December, down from November's rate of 3.1% - a six-year high. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalthat while air fares rose last month, it had a smaller impact than at the same point in 2016. It added that a drop in the price of toys and games also contributed to December's fall. The ONS said it was too early to say whether this was the start of a longer-term reduction in the rate of inflation. The Bank of England has said it thinks inflation peaked at the end of 2017 and will fall back to its target of 2% this year. The rate had been rising over the past year, partly due to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote which has pushed up the cost of imported goods. In November, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its key interest rate for the first time in more than a decade from 0.25% to 0.5%. But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The continued weakness of underlying price pressures means that the MPC has little need to rush the next rate hike."" Midlands sees biggest house price rises UK manufacturing output best for 10 years Aberdeen Standard Investments chief economist Lucy O'Carroll agreed there was no need for another quick rise in interest rates, but said: ""What matters most for the long-term health of the UK economy is improving its productivity performance. ""If we can do that then the Bank of England may be able to keep rates low for a lot longer. But on recent experience, improving productivity is much easier said than done."" What a difference a 10th of a percentage point makes. Inflation in the year to December was 3%, rather than the previous 3.1%, naturally generating predictions that it has now peaked. One of the biggest factors driving inflation has been the inflated price of imports following the Brexit vote feeding through to the shops. Yes, the vote and the devaluation of the pound following it was more than a year-and-a-half ago. But because many retailers buy their stock a year or two ahead, they have only felt the impact of costlier imports in the last few months. For the same reason the recent rally in sterling, which if it lasts should bring down the cost of imports, isn't yet benefiting consumers. In fact, taking goods prices separately from services, inflation at 3.4% is higher than it's been for more than five years. Even if inflation more broadly has peaked, the Bank of England has to bring it down over the next two to three years closer to its 2% target. On that basis trading in the City currently forecasts the next interest rate rise will take place in August. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the drop in inflation was not enough to ""significantly ease the pressure on UK household spending"" because wages were still rising by less than the rate of inflation. However, he said that if that situation changed then ""a sustained trend of falling inflation and better wage growth could spell happier times for the UK consumer, and the UK economy"". Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""We suspect that relatively lacklustre economic growth will continue to limit domestic price pressures. ""Earnings growth seems likely to pick up only gradually as some firms remain keen to limit their total costs in a challenging and uncertain environment. ""Fragile consumer confidence may also deter some workers from pushing hard for increased pay rises, despite recent higher inflation and a tight labour market."" The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, rose to 4.1% last month from 3.9% in November. The ONS's preferred measure of inflation, CPIH, which includes owner-occupiers' housing costs, fell to 2.7% in December, down from 2.8% the month before.

"Mr Macron visited a migrant centre as part of a visit to northern France President Emmanuel Macron says France will not allow a new migrant camp to be set up in Calais, on a visit to the port where many gather hoping to get to the UK. Up to 700 migrants are in the area, despite the camp known as the ""Jungle"" having been dismantled in 2016. He also defended his immigration plans that have been heavily criticised. On a visit to Britain on Thursday, he is expected to demand the UK government do more to help. On his first official visit to Calais, Mr Macron met migrants and groups working with them, as well as residents and local authorities who have called for more measures to prevent another large camp from emerging. Two groups refused to meet the president in protest at strict measures used by the French police against migrants. Mr Macron defended the security forces from accusations of brutality made by some activists, but vowed to punish officers involved in violence against migrants What next after the Jungle? This video can not be played The migrants living where the Calais Jungle once stood The Calais ""Jungle"" became the French symbol of the European migrant crisis, and some 7,000 people - most from the Middle East and Africa - were living there before the area was cleared. ""In no case will we allow another Jungle here,"" Mr Macron said on Tuesday, adding that the illegal occupation of public spaces would not be tolerated. France received a record 100,000 asylum claims in 2017, making it one of the main destinations in Europe. The president is expected to unveil a new migrant policy next month, which will include speeding up the application process for asylum seekers and faster removal of those who fail to be accepted. But charities and even some of his allies have accused the government of taking a hard line on immigration. During last year's French election campaign, Mr Macron said he wanted to renegotiate or scrap the 2003 Le Touquet agreement, which established French border controls in Britain and UK controls in Calais. As a result, undocumented migrants barred from entering the UK stay in France -many in makeshift camps. By Paul Adams, BBC News, Calais President Macron is facing an immigration challenge. His government is about to unveil a new immigration law with some tough provisions that have caused anger among human rights organisations and some disquiet even among the ranks of Mr Macron's own En Marche deputies. He says the right of asylum in France is not under threat, but as he promises never to allow another ""Jungle"" camp in Calais, he is looking to the UK to help resolve this region's long-running migrant crisis. He wants more money and a British willingness to take more migrants, especially unaccompanied minors. Strictly speaking, tweaking the terms of the 2003 Le Touquet treaty has nothing to do with Brexit. But Mr Macron knows that Theresa May needs all the help she can get from sympathetic European leaders in the coming months. That, he may be thinking, gives him some leverage when it comes to fixing the problem of Calais. Mr Macron will demand the UK do more to help ease the migrant burden when he meets British Prime Minister Theresa May, French officials say. He will ask the UK to allow in unaccompanied children and adults with family members already in the country and more money to help with border security. A spokesman for Mrs May said: ""We've taken a significant number of unaccompanied asylum seeking children from the area around and in Calais already."" Could Calais Jungle grow back?

"Fast food giant McDonald's has said all its packaging worldwide will come from sustainable sources by 2025. The restaurant chain will aim to get all items like bags, straws, wrappers and cups from recycled or renewable materials, up from half currently. McDonald's also wants 100% of its restaurants to recycle packaging by then, compared with only 10% now. It comes as UK supermarket Iceland has promised to drastically reduce its plastic packaging by the end of 2023. Both companies said there was an overwhelming demand from customers to make packaging more environmentally friendly. Francesca DeBiase, McDonald's chief supply chain and sustainability officer, said it was customers' number one request ""to use less packaging, sourced responsibly and designed to be taken care of after use"". In the UK, sites no longer use foam packaging and more than 1,000 restaurants have recycling bins for plastics and paper cups. However, the world's biggest restaurant chain, which has 37,000 sites worldwide, said some restaurants might struggle to recycle packaging by 2025. That is because infrastructure, regulations and customer behaviour vary around the world, but McDonald's ""plans to be part of the solution"". Friends of the Earth welcomed the news, but said ""speedier action in some countries, such as the UK is surely possible"". McDonald's is already aiming for all its paper and card packaging, such as burger boxes or paper bags, to come from recycled or certified sources where no deforestation occurs by 2020. How good a recycler are you? Cup waste: What are coffee chains doing? How much plastic do we send to China? Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem In the UK, retailers have faced outcries over the packaging of coconuts and cauliflower ""steaks"", and shoppers have reacted to vivid images of plastic pollution in Sir David Attenborough's Blue Planet programme. Iceland is aiming to remove plastic from the packaging of more than 1,000 own-brand products within the next five years wherever feasible. New ranges will be packaged using a paper-based tray, rather than plastic. Nigel Broadhurst, joint managing director of Iceland, explained the typical ready meal was packaged in a particularly bad way. ""It is currently in a black plastic tray. That black plastic is the worst possible option in terms of toxins going into the ground and the ability to recycle that product,"" he told the BBC.

"This video can not be played What's the menopause really like? Employers need to do more to ""normalise conversations"" about the menopause in the workplace, say experts. The comments came after a BBC survey found 70% of respondents did not tell their bosses they were experiencing symptoms. Some firms have brought in menopause-specific policies but experts said for many it was still a taboo subject. GP and menopause expert Louise Newson,externalsaid it was a ""silent issue for too many organisations"". The menopause is when a woman stops having periods and is no longer able to get pregnant naturally as oestrogen levels decline. It usually affects women between the ages of 45 and 55 and includes symptoms such as poor sleep, hot flushes, anxiety, and poor memory. Experts said employers did not necessarily have to make costly adjustments, but changes such as flexible working or having a desk fan could be helpful. Professor Amanda Griffiths, a psychologist specialising in mid-life and older people's health and wellbeing at work, said: ""Employers can help by communicating to their workforce that health-related problems such as the menopause are normal. ""I have heard of cases where women have not admitted the cause of their problems until matters have reached disciplinary stages at work."" She said organisations could accessonline guidance and advice on the issue,externalfrom the Faculty of Occupational Medicine and also from trade unions. The BBC survey asked 1,009 women aged 50 to 60 how their experience of the menopause had affected their work and relationships and what their symptoms and treatment were. The poll, by Comres for BBC Radio Sheffield and Radio 4's Woman's Hour, found 70% of women did not make their employer aware they were experiencing symptoms, while nearly a third said they had not visited their GP. Nearly half of respondents said the menopause had affected their mental health, while a quarter said it made them want to stay at home. Sue's story Former Nottingham Police chief constable Sue Fish was responsible for introducing the force's menopause policy. ""I was horrified to find out women were leaving early because of the severity of their symptoms. ""Some had been rebuffed by line managers or they'd chosen not to talk about what they were going through. ""It was such a waste of all that talent and experience that these women had in serving the public. ""Bringing in a policy was absolutely the right thing to do. Talking about it helped build a culture of openness. ""I also had my own experiences of the menopause to draw on and I talked about it very candidly. ""There was me, at the top of an organisation making difficult decisions, and I didn't want anyone blaming those decisions on irrationality. It was quite a challenge to overcome."" Ms Newson works with West Midlands Police and the fire service to give advice and support on the menopause and its impact on work. She said: ""Is enough being done to address it in the workplace? No. It's still a silent issue for too many organisations. ""We don't talk about the menopause. We don't get taught it at school and it's not standard to learn about it in medical training either."" She added: ""Things are improving but there needs to be much more openness and understanding not just from employers but doctors as well."" An ageing population and an increasing number of women in the workforce means in the future there will be a higher proportion of working women at menopausal age. Asimilar study is being carried out at Kings College London,externalin collaboration with the University of Nottingham, looking to improve the menopausal experience for working women. Dr Claire Hardy is the lead author. She said: ""It might be possible to make some adjustments at work, things like having a desk fan, or moving to a desk that is near a window that can be opened to cool down. ""Or even having some flexible working. The woman might have been having difficulty sleeping so having a later start to work might be feasible for some women, or just to miss the rush hour as well."" Employment lawyer Jenny Arrowsmith from Irwin Mitchell said greater openness in the workplace would help women feel supported. She said: ""Just as many employers now have a stress policy, some employers have brought in a menopause specific policy which provides guidance for managers and reassurance for employees on how menopause related issues will be managed and what support is available."" Professor Jo Brewis, who authored agovernment report on the issue,external, said: ""I feel like we're 30 years behind where we should be. ""The menopause needs to be normalised in the same way that it is standard to talk about pregnancy. ""Every woman will experience it differently so there is no one-size-fits-all solution. ""Not all women will want to talk about it at work and that is fine. The main thing they need is understanding and flexibility and an awareness that the support is there if needed.""

"The controversial claim that the UK sends Â£350m a week to the EU was a ""gross underestimate"", Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said. He told the Guardian the UK's contribution was already Â£362m a week,externaland would rise to Â£438m by the end of the post-Brexit transition period. Vote Leave's claim that Â£350m could go to the NHS instead was hotly disputed during the EU referendum. Tory MP Anna Soubry said Mr Johnson had to ""man up"" and stop ""conning people"". Labour accused Mr Johnson of returning ""to the scene of his previous crimes"". A campaign bus used by Vote Leave, including Mr Johnson himself, during the referendum campaign was emblazoned with the slogan: ""We send the EU Â£350 million a week - let's fund our NHS instead."" It was widely criticised because Â£350m per week is an approximate sum for the UK's ""gross contribution"" to Brussels. It doesn't take account of the country's rebate of Â£75m a week which means that the true amount leaving the Treasury's coffers is significantly lower. Does the Â£350m claim stack up? We want our Â£350m, says NHS boss Mr Johnson told the Guardian ""there was an error on the side of the bus."" ""We grossly underestimated the sum over which we would be able to take back control."" This video can not be played Anna Soubry on new Boris Johnson Brexit bus NHS claims The paper said the foreign secretary ""conceded that the leave campaign had used a gross figure"", but he said about half of the total eventually saved could be redirected to fund public services. ""As and when the cash becomes available - and it won't until we leave - the NHS should be at the very top of the list,"" he added. Among those to criticise Mr Johnson's use of the figure was thehead of the UK's statistics watchdog, Sir David Norgrove, who called it ""a clear misuse of official statistics"". Reacting to Mr Johnson's latest remarks, Labour's Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer accused him of having ""no shame"". And Ms Soubry, a pro-EU ex-minister who has rebelled against the government several times over Brexit, said she was ""surprised and disappointed"" the foreign secretary had chosen to resurrect the claims. This video can not be played Paul Flynn v Michael Gove on Â£350m figure ""What I do know is that this is not going to be additional funds that will go to the NHS - and that was an important part of the trick that was played on the British people,"" she told the BBC's Daily Politics. ""Boris is being irresponsible to continue to con people in this way. He should be honest about the challenges that Brexit poses to our country. ""This is grown up, this is proper stuff, he's got to man up to the position he holds."" Meanwhile, Eloise Todd, from the anti-Brexit campaign Best For Britain, said: ""This is a yet another untruth from Boris, a man who has become so obsessed with the lie he slapped on the side of the bus."" Mr Johnson was speaking after fellow Leave campaignerNigel Farage last week suggestedhe was ""warming"" to the idea of holding a second referendum in order to ""kill off"" the Remain campaign for a generation. However, the foreign secretary rejected the idea, saying the first referendum had caused ""an awful lot of heartache and soul-searching"". ""I'm not convinced that the public is absolutely gagging for another Brexit referendum,"" he added. Mr Johnson said he believed the result of any second vote would be ""pretty much the same"" or a heavier victory for Leave.

"Cars and lorries were tailed back on the M74 southbound Heavy snowfalls have been causing disruption as wintry conditions sweep across large swathes of Scotland. Traffic between Scotland and England has been affected, with closures on the M74 in both directions. Traffic Scotland said gritters were working to make the motorway safe enough to fully reopen. Police Scotland has advised motorists to avoid the area. Some drivers complained of being stuck in traffic for several hours. On the Isle of Skye, the main road - the A87- was blocked for several hours in both directions by a jack-knifed lorry. The closure meant two school buses with pupils who had been stuck for hours had to return to Portree High. The school said they would be put in temporary accommodation for the night. The Met Office has issued an amber alert for south west Scotland, extending to parts of the central belt, lasting until Wednesday morning. Thundersnow was also forecast in the west. A lorry jack-knifed on the A87 in Skye Earlier on Tuesday evening, all three lanes on the M74 southbound at J12 Millbank were closed. One lane later re-opened but traffic was again halted as conditions worsened. Police advised drivers to follow the gritters and said the delays would take some time to clear. A subsequent accident at J15 Beattock led to closure of the northbound carriageway. Traffic Scotland apologised to those stuck in the queues. Motorist Nigel Cliff, who was heading south, told BBC Scotland at about 19:00 that he had been stationary on the motorway for about an hour and a half. ""It's pretty rough,"" he said. ""It's snowing again now so it is probably only going to get worse. There are cars and lorries just sitting here - nothing moving."" Mr Cliff said he was prepared for the conditions: ""I've got food. I've got big thick coats, big thick socks. My wife always makes sure I've got everything in the car."" The M74 was closed between Millbank and Abington due to the wintry conditions Transport Minister Humza Yousaf tweeted that a number of HGVs had ""lost traction with challenging weather impacting on M74"". He added: ""Necessary to close the junction to get additional gritters and equipment to the scene."" Live updates on heavy snowfall Have you seen Sir Andy Flurry?

The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said crews had attended 12 crashes as a direct result of the poor conditionsand at least 13 schools were closed. Some high ground was likely to see 15-25 cm (6-10 inches) of snow building up, especially above 200-300m, with 5-10 cm (2-4 inches) more typical at low levels throughout the warning area.

Across Scotland more than 100 schools and nurseries were closed on Tuesday, with more than 10,000 pupils missing classes. In the Highland council area, the weather affected 13 secondary schools, 53 primaries, two special schools and 26 nurseries. About 8,900 pupils had an unexpected day off classes.

"Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya are living in refugee camps in Bangladesh Bangladesh and Myanmar have agreed a timeframe for repatriating hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled crackdowns from the military. Myanmar has agreed to accept 1,500 Rohingya each week, Bangladesh says, adding that it aims to return all of them to Myanmar within two years. More than 740,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh amid violence in Rakhine state in 2016 and 2017. Aid agencies have raised concerns about forcibly repatriating them. Bangladesh says it aims to repatriate families together, as well as orphans and ""children born out of unwarranted incidence"" - meaning children conceived as a result of rape. However, displaced Rohingya in Bangladesh have expressed concerns about returning to Myanmar. Bangladesh upholds Rohingya marriage ban Seeing through the official story in Myanmar What you need to know about the crisis Sirajul Mostofa, a community leader in a camp in Cox's Bazaar, told the BBC: ""We are still not clear about what agreement was signed. ""Our first priority is, they have to grant us citizenship as Rohingyas. Secondly, they have to give back our lands. Thirdly, our security must be ensured internationally. Otherwise, this is not good for us."" Bangladeshi foreign secretary Shahidul Haque told BBC Bangla that the government had wanted to repatriate the Rohingya more quickly. ""We asked them to take back 15,000 every week. But they said they will take back 300 people every day, so that makes 1,500 every week. ""So we compromised that we will start by sending 300 people each day, but there will be a review in three months' time and the number will be increased."" Jonathan Head, BBC Southeast Asia correspondent At 1,500 refugees a week it would take almost 10 years to bring back all 740,000 who have left since October 2016. Bangladesh hopes that flow can be increased. But as matters stand it is difficult to see how. Both countries have agreed the repatriation will be voluntary. And most refugees say they will only return if their safety can be assured, their homes rebuilt, and if they are no longer subjected to official discrimination. None of these conditions is in place. Myanmar has started rebuilding, but mostly for non-Muslims. It is preparing two transit camps, the first able to accommodate 30,000 people. Beyond that not much has changed. More than 350 villages, nearly all of them Rohingya, have been burned down, some recently. The military, which is accused of terrible human rights abuses, still runs northern Rakhine state. It has denied the abuses, denied access to independent investigators, and strictly limits access for aid agencies. There is talk of closing the camps in which 130,000 Rohingyas are still confined, but not yet of ending restrictions on Rohingya movements. And nothing is yet happening to reduce the mistrust and fear of Rohingyas felt by the non-Muslim population, some of whom have vowed to fight against any large-scale refugee return. Myanmar's foreign secretary U Myint Thu told BBC Burmese: ""The repatriation process will commence on 23 January."" He said three more transit camps were ""under construction"", and there were plans to ""build new villages"".

A spokesperson from the UN High Commission for Refugees urged Myanmar to address the underlying causes of the crisis and said that refugees should only return when they feel it is safe for them to go back.

Those attacks triggered a military crackdown that led to widespread allegations of killings, rape and torture of Rohingya. The agreement does not cover Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh prior to October 2016, under previous crackdowns and bouts of communal violence. When the initial repatriation deal was signed in November, Amnesty International said it doubted there could be safe or dignified returns ""while a system of apartheid remains"" and added that it ""hoped those who do not want to go home are not forced to do so"".

"The man had been trapped for 30 hours by the time he was rescued An Australian teenager has been found alive in a car wreck after his father made an intuitive decision to search for him in a helicopter. Samuel Lethbridge, 17, was trapped for 30 hours after his car left a New South Wales highway on Sunday, police said. His family had become concerned and alerted police when he failed to arrive at a friend's house that day. Tony Lethbridge then decided to hire a helicopter after recalling a local car accident from ""about five years ago"". ""Unfortunately that bloke passed away because nobody found him within five days, and I wasn't going to let that happen [to Samuel],"" he told local network Channel Seven. Mr Lethbridge said he suspected his son was in trouble,externalbecause his disappearance was out of character. ""So we went and hired the helicopter straight away and found him within 10 minutes,"" he said. The woman who chose a bull over marriage 'I became a mother aged 14' I found my baby's father on Craigslist The family spotted the wreckage about 20m (65ft) off a road in Crangan Bay, 100km (62 miles) north of Sydney. Emergency crews took more than an hour to remove the teenager from the car, where he had been trapped under the dashboard. The teenager was taken to hospital with multiple fractures and remains in a serious condition, authorities said. ""He is very lucky to be alive,"" said Inspector Jeff Atkins, from New South Wales Ambulance. Police said they were investigating the crash.

"Stifling a sneeze by clamping your nose and mouth shut can cause serious physical damage, doctors are warning. Medics in Leicester treated a 34-year-old man who ruptured his throat while trying to stop a high-force sneeze. With nowhere to escape, the pressure ripped through the soft tissue, and although rare and unusual, they say others should be aware of the danger. Trapping a sneeze could also damage the ears or even rupture a brain aneurysm, they warn in journalBMJ Case Reports,external. The man said he felt a ""popping"" sensation in his neck when it happened and then immediately experienced pain and difficulty swallowing and speaking. When the doctors checked him over they found he had swelling and tenderness around his throat and neck. The black arrow points to the air streaks (in black) in the soft tissue area An X-ray revealed air escaping from his windpipe into the soft tissue of his neck through the rupture. The man had to be fed by a tube for the next seven days to allow time for the tissues to heal. After spending a week in hospital, the man was sent home and made a full recovery. Capturing the fluid flow of sneezes Sneezing into a trombone Why deaf people sneeze silently Doctors from the ear, nose, throat department at Leicester Royal Infirmary, where the man was treated, said: ""Halting a sneeze via blocking nostrils and mouth is a dangerous manoeuvre and should be avoided."" Sneezes can spread diseases, so although it is good to ""let them out"", make sure you catch them in a tissue, say experts. With flu season in full swing, children and adults should be encouraged to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough and sneeze and then throw the tissues away in a bin and wash their hands to stop the spread of germs, says Public Health England.

Jonathan Ball, three, and Tim Parry, 12, died after the IRA bombing ""Only yesterday did I discover that her group, or she herself, had composed the song in memory of the event in Warrington,"" he said. ""I was completely unaware what it was about. ""My wife came home from the police centre where she worked yesterday and told me the news.

""The event at Warrington, like the many events that happened all over Ireland and Great Britain, affected families in a very real way and many people have become immune to the pain and suffering that so many people experienced during that armed campaign. ""To read the words written by an Irish band in such compelling way was very, very powerful. ""I likened it to the enormous amount of mail expressing huge sympathy that we received in the days, weeks and months following our loss.

"Supermarket chain Iceland has said it will eliminate or drastically reduce plastic packaging of all its own-label products by the end of 2023. Iceland says the move will affect more than a thousand own-label products. New ranges will be packaged using a paper-based tray, rather than plastic. It follows recent outcries over the packaging of cauliflower ""steaks"" and coconuts, and Sir David Attenborough's Blue Planet programme, which showed vivid images of plastic pollution. Prime Minister Theresa May has called plastic waste ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"". TheUK uses 3.7 million tonnes of plastic a year, according to trade organisation Plastics Europe, and recent changes in China have made it more difficult to process. What is your chosen supermarket doing to fight plastic? Test yourself with our recycling quiz Reality Check: Where does the 5p plastic bag charge go? May defends 'long-term' green plan Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Nigel Broadhurst, joint managing director of Iceland, explained the typical ready meal was packaged in a particularly bad way. ""It is currently in a black plastic tray. That black plastic is the worst possible option in terms of toxins going into the ground and the ability to recycle that product,"" Mr Broadhurst said. He said there could be changes to other packaging in future: ""Take oranges, they come in a net; apples come in a plastic bag. It doesn't take a lot of shift to expect that you could put an orange net round an apple."" The company says it is aiming to complete the change to its own-brand packaging within the next five years, removing plastics wherever feasible. Iceland also said its research found that 80% of shoppers would endorse a supermarket's move to go plastic free. The chain has also earlier supported the idea of a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles. Mrs May has pledged to ban all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042. In an attempt to tackle the problem, the PM has called on supermarkets to introduce ""plastic-free"" aisles, and to consider taxes and charges on single-use plastic items such as food containers.

"BBC News presenter Emily Maitlis met Edward Vines when they were students at Cambridge University A former friend of Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, who harassed her for two decades, has been jailed for contacting her from prison. Edward Vines, 47, breached a restraining order by writing to the BBC journalist while he was behind bars and later out on licence, a court heard. Judge Peter Ross, who sentenced Vines to 45 months, said the repeated contact amounted to ""psychological torture"". Ms Maitlis said she had been left ""jumpy around strangers"". The presenter first met Vines, of Clarkes Row, Oxford, when they were students at Cambridge University. He was first convicted of harassment in 2002. He was issued with an indefinite restraining order in 2009,which he was convicted of twice breaching last year. As well as contacting her while in prison for those offences, Vines wrote again while living in a bail hostel and subject of licence conditions. Judge Ross described this as ""wholly unsatisfactory"" and gave the Probation Service and the governor at HMP Bullingdon 10 days for a written explanation. In a statement read to Oxford Crown Court, Ms Maitlis said she had felt ""scared and let down"" after she heard Vines had breached the restraining order ""even from within the prison system"". She said it had affected her relationship with her husband, and scared her children, ""who thought the threats had gone away... while he was behind bars"". ""It has affected my ability to do my work, what time I feel able to come home at night (I work late nights often). It also makes me jumpy around strangers for no reason as I fear any advance might be him,"" she wrote. ""Altogether the breach has been a reminder for me that this man remains a constant threat in my life and my family's life and that my ability to do my work, hang out with my children and lead a normal family life without constant sense of suspicion and fear has been badly damaged."" Ms Maitlis said her husband had been left ""frustrated that we cannot get to the bottom of this problem even though we have been tackling it through the CPS and the court for over 20 years"". Vines's sentencing was delayed after his application to alter his plea was refused by the court. At the time, his lawyer, Michael Gould, told the court he could no longer represent his client as he had been ""professionally embarrassed"".

"The Turpin family with an Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas, where parents David and Louise renewed their vows They lived in a smart suburban home, owned nice cars and posed together on family holidays. Outwardly, the California couple accused of torturing, imprisoning and endangering their 13 children presided over a happy American family. But when police entered their home on Sunday, they found a very different reality from the one that David and Louise Turpin posted to Facebook. Prosecutors say they found the couple's 13 children, aged from two to 29, in a state of severe malnutrition. The couple have denied all the charges against them. Prosecutors have painted a disturbing picture of a couple who ""punished"" their children over a period of years by tying them to their beds for weeks or months, first with ropes and later - after one escaped - with chains and padlocks. Punishments also took the form of beatings or strangulations. District Attorney Mike Hestrin said the children were forced to live nocturnally, and were allowed to shower only once a year. There was evidence they were not freed from their shackles to go to the bathroom, he said. The Turpins on a family trip to Disneyland - it was apparently a favourite destination He said they were only allowed to eat one meal a day but their parents would taunt them with food. ""The parents would apparently buy food for themselves and not allow the children to eat it,"" Mr Hestrin told reporters. ""They would buy food... apple pies, pumpkin pies, leave it on the counter, let the children look at it but not eat the food."" Some of the children were suffering from brain and nerve damage caused by the prolonged abuse, Mr Hestrin  said. They had not visited a doctor in more than four years and had never seen a dentist, he added. Despite being ""home-schooled"" they lacked even basic knowledge of the outside world and did not know what a police officer was, he also said. They were however allowed to write in journals, and hundreds were recovered from the home. The alarm was raised when a 17-year-old girl called police saying she had escaped the house by climbing out of a window. Mr Hestrin said the girl and her siblings had planned the escape for two years. He said another of the siblings had escaped with the teenager but became afraid and returned to the house. Riverside County Sheriff's Capt Greg Fellows, speaking alongside Mr Hestrin, said the girl had photographs to back up her story. When police arrived at the house one of the couple's children was still chained to a bed and two others may have just been released, Mr Hestrin said. David Turpin's parents, James and Betty Turpin, told ABC News they were ""surprised and shocked"" at the allegations made against the couple, describing them as ""the sweetest family"". They said their grandchildren were home-schooled, and that they had not seen their son and daughter-in-law in several years, although they had spoken by phone. Referring to David and Louise, they said ""God called on them"" to have as many children as they did. They also said the children were given ""very strict"" home-schooling and they had to memorise long passages of the Bible. Some of the children were aiming to learn it in its entirety, they said. Despite this, the school listed at their address is on public records as ""non-religious"". The house where 'children were chained to beds' Shackled siblings found in California home When the grandparents last visited the family, four or five years ago, they noticed the children ""looked thin"", they said, but they seemed like a ""happy family"". The sister of Louise Turpin, Elizabeth Flores, told ABC's Good Morning America programme that she had never felt comfortable around her brother-in-law,external, and accused him of watching her in the shower when she briefly lived with the couple. ""I thought they were really strict, but I didn't see any abuse,"" Ms Flores said. The couple's Facebook page contains numerous family photos Another sister, Teresa Robinette, said she was ""hurt and shocked"" by the revelations,externalabout the children's alleged treatment. ""I always made comments to Louise when I did talk to her, about, 'Gosh, they're so skinny.' And she would laugh it off: 'Well David's so tall and lanky. They're going to be like him',"" she told NBC's Today programme. Residents in California have struggled to comprehend the discovery at the spacious Turpin family home located on Muir Woods Road in Perris, some 59 miles (95km) south-east of Los Angeles. ""I can't believe this. I can't believe this. It's so sad,"" neighbour Jennifer Luna told CBS News. Andrew Santillan, who lives nearby, told the network: ""I had no idea this was going on. I didn't know there were kids in the house."" Nicole Gooding, who has lived in the neighbourhood for three years, told Reuters news agency the first time she saw the family was two months ago when the mother and children were cleaning the garden. ""I had never seen them at all until that day,"" she said. Other neighbours expressed concern about the appearance of the children and said they rarely saw them playing outside. Neighbours stand outside the Turpin's home in Perris, California The couple had lived at their current California address since 2014, and moved to the state from Texas in 2010. A family who say they bought their old home outside Fort Worth in 1999 shared photographs of its condition with a local CBS news affiliate on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content?

A neighbour at another Texas address, Shelly Vinyard, told CBS that she used to describe their house as like a ""religious compound"". She said she remembered asking one of the girls her name, but the girl responded that she wasn't allowed to tell people it. As with what happened inside their home, the family kept any serious financial troubles hidden from public view.

Mrs Turpin is listed in public records as a housewife, with no income. With many children and only one earner, public records suggest the family's expenses exceeded their income. Bankruptcy documents show Mr Turpin earned more than $140,000 (Â£124,000) in 2011, but that the family's expenses exceeded his take-home pay by more than $1,000 a month. A lawyer who represented the couple when they filed for bankruptcy for a second time in 2011, Ivan Trahan, told the Los Angeles Times: ""To me and my wife, Nancy, who was with me during the interviews, we always thought of them as very nice people who spoke highly of their children.""

"The man had been trapped for 30 hours by the time he was rescued An Australian teenager has been found alive in a car wreck after his father made an intuitive decision to search for him in a helicopter. Samuel Lethbridge, 17, was trapped for 30 hours after his car left a New South Wales highway on Sunday, police said. His family had become concerned and alerted police when he failed to arrive at a friend's house that day. Tony Lethbridge then decided to hire a helicopter after recalling a local car accident from ""about five years ago"". ""Unfortunately that bloke passed away because nobody found him within five days, and I wasn't going to let that happen [to Samuel],"" he told local network Channel Seven. Mr Lethbridge said he suspected his son was in trouble,externalbecause his disappearance was out of character. ""So we went and hired the helicopter straight away and found him within 10 minutes,"" he said. The woman who chose a bull over marriage 'I became a mother aged 14' I found my baby's father on Craigslist The family spotted the wreckage about 20m (65ft) off a road in Crangan Bay, 100km (62 miles) north of Sydney. Emergency crews took more than an hour to remove the teenager from the car, where he had been trapped under the dashboard. The teenager was taken to hospital with multiple fractures and remains in a serious condition, authorities said. ""He is very lucky to be alive,"" said Inspector Jeff Atkins, from New South Wales Ambulance. Police said they were investigating the crash.

"The Edwin Hawkins Singers were pioneers of contemporary gospel music The American gospel music star Edwin Hawkins has died at his home in California, at the age of 74. The Grammy-winning singer had been suffering from pancreatic cancer, his publicist said. Hawkins was regarded as a pioneer of urban gospel music, blending gospel hymns with secular sound. He is best-known for the 1969 hit Oh Happy Day. The following year the Edwin Hawkins Singers backed Melanie on her top 10 hit Lay Down (Candles in the Rain). By Peter Bowes, BBC News Los Angeles Edwin Hawkins came from a musical family. His father played the Hawaiian steel guitar while his mother was a pianist. It was while Edwin was studying interior design in the late 60s that he unexpectedly got his big break. He co-founded the Northern California State Youth Choir. Their first album merged gospel and rhythm-and-blues, and included Oh Happy Day. The catchy song caught the ear of a local DJ and became hugely popular on local radio.  It was released as a single, became a crossover hit, sold seven million copies and changed the young musician's life.

"A BBC reporter was offered a degree from the fake Nixon University for $3,600 (Â£2,600) Thousands of UK nationals have bought fake degrees from a multi-million pound ""diploma mill"" in Pakistan, a BBC Radio 4's File on Four programme investigation has found. Buyers include NHS consultants, nurses and a large defence contractor. One British buyer spent almost Â£500,000 on bogus documents. The Department for Education said it was taking ""decisive action to crack down on degree fraud"" that ""cheats genuine learners"". Axact, which claims to be the ""world's largest IT company"", operates a network of hundreds of fake online universities run by agents from a Karachi call centre. With names such as Brooklyn Park University and Nixon University, they feature stock images of smiling students and even fake news articles singing the institution's praises. According to documents seen byBBC Radio 4's File on Four programme, more than 3,000 fake Axact qualifications were sold to UK-based buyers in 2013 and 2014, including master's degrees, doctorates and PhDs. Many of Axact's online universities - such as Baychester University - share the same format and use stock photographs A trawl through the list of Axact UK buyers, seen by the BBC, reveals various NHS clinical staff, including an ophthalmologist, nurses, a psychologist, and numerous consultants also bought fake degrees. A consultant at a London teaching hospital bought a degree in internal medicine from the fake Belford University in 2007. The doctor - who had previously been disciplined by the General Medical Council (GMC) for failing to report a criminal conviction - told the BBC he had not used the certificates because they ""had not been authenticated"". An anaesthetist who bought a degree in ""hospital management"" said he had not used the qualification in the UK. And a consultant in paediatric emergency medicine, who bought a ""master of science in health care technology"", claimed it was an ""utter surprise"" when the BBC told him it was fake. There is no suggestion any of these clinicians do not hold appropriate original medical qualifications. The General Medical Council (GMC) said it was up to employers to verify any qualifications additional to medical degrees. But Higher Education Degree Datacheck (HEDD) chief executive Jayne Rowley said only 20% of UK employers ran proper checks on applicants' qualifications. And while purchasing a fake diploma was not illegal in the UK, using one to apply for employment constituted fraud by misrepresentation and could result in a 10-year prison sentence. ""[The GMC] are correct in that [doctors] are licensed to practice medicine if they have a legitimate medical degree. But [by buying a fake degree], they have still committed fraud and could still be prosecuted,"" she said. Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said all NHS trusts operated rigorous primary checks. Verification was ""achieved through a variety of channels"" and fraudulent activity would be reported to police, he said. The fake degree certificate offered to a BBC reporter In 2015, Axact sold more than 215,000 fake qualifications globally, through approximately 350 fictitious high schools and universities, making $51m (Â£37.5m) that year alone. Former FBI agent Allen Ezell, who has been investigating diploma mills since the 1980s, said: ""We live in a credential conscious society around the world. ""So as long as paper has a value, there's going to be somebody that counterfeits it and prints it and sells it. ""Employers are not doing their due diligence in checking out the papers, so it makes it work. It's the damnedest thing we've ever seen."" Defence contractor FB Heliservices bought fake Axact degrees for seven employees, including two helicopter pilots, between 2013 and 2015. One of these employees, speaking anonymously to the BBC, said soon after he had been given a contract to work on the Caribbean island of Curacao, the local government decided all those working in the territory had to have a degree. ""We looked into distance learning, and contact was made with this online university. It was just something that needed to be done to keep working in the country. ""Everyone knew they were not bona fide. But no-one had a problem with it."" Parent-company Cobham held an internal investigation into the incident, but decided the purchase was a ""historic issue"" that ""had no impact upon the safety of any of its operations or the training of any individuals in the UK or elsewhere"". ""Procedural and disciplinary actions have been taken to address all the issues raised,"" it added. But MP James Frith, a member of the Education Select Committee, said the decision was a ""very serious issue"". ""I am amazed that a business would put itself and its very existence at risk by having fraudulent qualifications to, by the sounds of it, get into a new market."" Former FBI officer Allen Ezell has written a book about ""fake diploma mills"" such as Brooklyn Park University Following a New York Times expose in 2015, Axact's chief executive was arrested and an investigation launched by the Pakistani authorities. Senior manager Umair Hamid was sentenced to 21 months in a US prison in August 2017 for his part in Axact's fraud. Yet the Pakistani investigation has ground to a halt amid claims of government corruption. Allan Ezell said Axact continued to launch new online universities all the time - and had now branched out into extortion and blackmail. ""It's a whole new game,"" he said. ""Normally a diploma mill is finished with you by the time you get your degree. That's just the beginning now. ""You get a telephone call that looks like it's coming from your embassy or local law enforcement, threatening to arrest or deport you unless you get some additional documents to help support the phony diploma you already have. We've never seen that before."" Cecil Horner, a British engineer based in Saudi Arabia, was still getting threatening calls from Axact agents after paying nearly Â£500,000 for fake documents. Mr Horner's son Malcolm said he believed his father, who died in 2015, had bought the qualifications because of the fear of losing his job. ""It makes me so angry,"" he said. ""It's unfathomable these websites still exist and they can't be shut down."" Action Fraud, the UK's national cybercrime reporting centre, said it did not have the power to close fake Axact websites but instead had to provide evidence to domain registries and registrars, which could take months. A degree certificate from Axact-run Neil Wilson University MP James Frith said he was ""staggered"" by the ""aggressive tactics"" used by Axact and would ask the Education Selection Committee to look into the issue. The Department of Education said HEDD was taking a proactive approach. ""Degree fraud cheats both genuine learners and employers, so we've taken decisive action to crack down on those seeking to profit from it,"" a spokesman said. Axact did not respond to a request for an interview from the BBC. File on 4: Degrees of Deceptionis on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 16 January at 20:00 GMTand on the iPlayer.

"This video can not be played The flypast finished with a flight along the River Thames The British Army has bid farewell to the Lynx helicopter with a commemorative flight. The aircraft has been decommissioned after almost 40 years in service. Four remaining Mk9 Lynx left from RAF Odiham in Hampshire shortly after 09:00 GMT on an aerial tour, taking in military bases and locations associated with the helicopter. The flight culminated in a V-shaped ""air procession"" along the River Thames in central London shortly before 16:00. The flypast is due to head west from RAF Odiham in Hampshire and will end in London Commanding Officer of 657 Squadron, Maj James Peycke said the army was saying ""farewell to the iconic machine"". ""It is hugely emotional saying goodbye to the Lynx after six years of flying, and it carves out a big chunk of your heart."" Maj Peycke, who was flying in the lead Lynx, called the aircraft ""hugely manoeuvrable"". There is ""never a dull day when you are flying"", he added. Four remaining Mk9 Lynx went on an aerial tour, taking in military bases and locations associated with the helicopter Described as a primary battlefield utility helicopter, over the decades the Lynx has also destroyed tanks, evacuated wounded personnel, gathered intelligence and provided humanitarian support. The British-made aircraft entered service in 1978 and has been used during military deployments to Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Kuwait, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone. It is set to be replaced within the British Army by the Wildcat, which has more powerful engines and can operate at a higher altitude.

"The bite of rat-borne fleas infected with the bubonic plague has been blamed for disease transmission during the medieval pandemic Rats were not to blame for the spread of plague during the Black Death, according to a study. The rodents and their fleas were thought to have spread a series of outbreaks in 14th-19th Century Europe. But a team from the universities of Oslo and Ferrara now says the first, the Black Death, can be ""largely ascribed to human fleas and body lice"". The study,in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science,external, uses records of its pattern and scale. The Black Death claimed an estimated 25 million lives, more than a third of Europe's population, between 1347 and 1351. Has the black rat (Rattus rattus) been falsely blamed for spreading plague during the Black Death? ""We have good mortality data from outbreaks in nine cities in Europe,"" Prof Nils Stenseth, from the University of Oslo, told BBC News. ""So we could construct models of the disease dynamics [there]."" He and his colleagues then simulated disease outbreaks in each of these cities, creating three models where the disease was spread by: rats airborne transmission fleas and lice that live on humans and their clothes In seven out of the nine cities studied, the ""human parasite model"" was a much better match for the pattern of the outbreak. It mirrored how quickly it spread and how many people it affected. ""The conclusion was very clear,"" said Prof Stenseth. ""The lice model fits best."" ""It would be unlikely to spread as fast as it did if it was transmitted by rats. ""It would have to go through this extra loop of the rats, rather than being spread from person to person."" Prof Stenseth said the study was primarily of historical interest - using modern understanding of disease to unpick what had happened during one of the most devastating pandemics in human history. But, he pointed out, ""understanding as much as possible about what goes on during an epidemic is always good if you are to reduce mortality [in the future]"". Plague is still endemic in some countries of Asia, Africa and the Americas, where it persists in ""reservoirs"" of infected rodents. According to the World Health Organization, from 2010 to 2015 there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths.,external And, in 2001, astudy that decoded the plague genome used a bacterium that had come from a vet in the US who had died in 1992 after a plague-infested cat sneezed on him as he had been trying to rescue it from underneath a house.,external ""Our study suggests that to prevent future spread hygiene is most important,"" said Prof Stenseth. ""It also suggests that if you're ill, you shouldn't come into contact with too many people. So if you're sick, stay at home.""

"This video can not be played Is your tumble dryer at risk? The saga over millions of fire-risk tumble dryers has exposed a wider failure in the UK's product safety system, according to MPs. Whirlpool's response to the defect affecting 5.3 million machines had been ""woeful"", the Business Committee said. It was unacceptable that more than one million potentially dangerous dryers were still being used in people's homes, the committee added. The company said its repair campaign had been comparatively successful. Truth, fires and tumble dryers - are our home appliances safe? Owners told not to use dangerous tumble dryers after all The defect in tumble dryers sold under the Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit brands, owned by Whirlpool, was discovered in 2015 and has led to at least 750 fires since 2004, the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee said. The dryers had been sold over the course of 11 years in the UK. Rachel Reeves, who chairs the committee, said: ""Whirlpool's woeful response to the defect in its tumble dryers has caused huge worry to people with these appliances in their homes. ""Their delayed and dismissive response to correcting these defects has been inadequate and we call on Whirlpool to resolve issues urgently."" Hotpoint - online checker,external Indesit - online checker,external Appliance register - the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Appliances,external A spokesman for the company said: ""Whirlpool's extensive ongoing tumble dryer modification campaign has achieved a resolution rate more than three times the industry average for a product recall."" He said 1.7 million affected tumble dryers had been replaced or repaired, four million customers had been contacted directly, and the number of people contacting the company after the two-year awareness campaign had now fallen sharply. ""We continue to urge consumers to contact us immediately if they believe they still own an affected appliance. We can assure consumers that if they contact us now, they can receive a resolution within one week,"" he added. Doug McTavish and Bernard Hender died in the fire at the flat in Llanrwst A separate electrical fault with the door switch on a Whirlpool dryer ""on the balance of probabilities"" caused a fire that that killed two men in north Wales. The coroner inthe inquestsinto the deaths of Doug McTavish and Bernard Hender in Llanrwst, north Wales, described evidence presented at the inquest by Whirlpool as ""defensive and dismissive"" and said the company's approach was an ""obstacle"" to finding steps to prevent future fires. The committee considered this, and other high-profile fires such as Grenfell Tower, and concluded that there were wider issues over product safety. In spite of improving technology and evolving regulation, the number of fires involving faulty electrical appliances and leads in England has stayed fairly constant, at between 4,300 and 5,000 a year, it found. It said that there appeared to be significant risks associated with plastic-backed fridge freezers, owing to the number of fires associated with them. The damage caused to the seventh floor flat in Shepherd's Bush Ms Reeves also said that there was ""a strong case for a single national product safety agency"". ""These problems go deeper than just one firm. Whirlpool's response has highlighted flaws in the UK's product safety regime which is fragmented and poorly resourced,"" she said. She suggested that there had been ""painfully slow"" progress from the government in responding to an independent review two years ago by Lynn Faulds-Wood, which had suggested a national agency. Ms Faulds-Woodtold the BBC last yearthat she felt her report had been ignored by the government, The Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy, said it would ""respond shortly"" to the recommendation of a national product safety authority. ""We have already taken a number of steps to improve our product safety regime, including upgrading the government's recalls website to make it clear to the public which white goods are safe to use,"" a spokesman said. But Alex Neill, from consumer group Which?, said: ""Despite hundreds of reported fires and numerous reviews, the UK's product safety system is still broken and potentially threatening the lives of millions of consumers."" Martyn Allen, of charity Electrical Safety First, said: ""Given the low success rate of product recalls, and that only 10% to 20% of faulty goods are ever returned or repaired, there are potentially millions of dangerous electrical goods still in people's homes. ""Without a centralised, publically available database that lists all UK product recalls, it is extremely difficult for consumers to actually know if the products they are using are safe.""

"Thomas Hord's family fought for seven years to win a six-figure payout for his life-long care needs NHS medical blunders dating back more than two decades are still costing millions of pounds a year in compensation, it has emerged. The negligence bill for mistakes made before 1995 - mainly maternity failings - has begun to rise for the first time in five years. A patients' charity said the figures showed just how long some families have to wait for payouts. The NHS said it had taken steps to speed up the process. This video can not be played What does NHS compensation pay for? Medical mistakes left youngster Thomas Hord, now eight years old, with cerebral palsy affecting all four limbs. He is unable to speak or walk. Thomas was starved of oxygen at birth after midwives failed to place a foetal heart rate monitor in the right position. But although Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust quickly admitted mistakes had been made shortly after his birth in 2009, the family had to wait a further seven years for compensation. They secured a Â£2.5m lump sum and will also get annual payments for Thomas's care. Thomas's father Chris, 44, of Crawley, West Sussex, said it can take lawyers years to work out the extent of the damage to a child. ""A lot of it is to do with the fact you can't tell how affected they are going to be until a child starts going through their development,"" he said. The bill for medical negligence claims in England has risen four-fold in the past decade, to Â£1.6 billion last year. But the NHS in England also has a separate Government-funded scheme to deal with negligence claims for events before April 1995. Its payouts rose by 13% last year to Â£27.7m, the BBC's analysis of official data shows. It is thought increased life expectancy and rising care costs may be behind the rise. Patients' charity Action Against Medical Accidents said the growing size of the historical bill demonstrated the tragic, long-term human cost of often basic maternity errors. Chief executive Peter Walsh said: ""We, as a charity, have been going for 35 years and we still see the same mistakes, the same avoidable errors causing injury now as we did 35 years ago."" Mr Walsh called for more consistency in NHS training for midwives and doctors, saying examples of good practice seen in some hospitals should be rolled out across the country. Daniel Spencer was left severely disabled by failings in care during his birth Sixteen-year-old Daniel Spencer, from Malvern, Worcestershire, was left severely disabled after being starved of oxygen shortly before birth. Daniel requires round-the-clock care, uses a wheelchair and struggles to communicate, after failings in care during labour at Worcestershire Royal Hospital in 2001 left him with cerebral palsy. His family's fight for justice took nearly 14 years. Father Olly said it took 12 years for the NHS trust to admit partial liability for his son's condition. The family had to fund Daniel's care themselves during that time, with mum Susan giving up work to look after him. He said: ""Any parent who has gone through what we have been through knows there is an element of post-traumatic stress. ""I have had lots of sleepless nights from it and a lot of things like money worries, while we try and fight the case and try and deal with everyday life."" In 2015, the courts awarded Daniel a Â£2.7m lump sum, with extra annual payments for ongoing care. At the time, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said it ""sincerely regrets"" the injury Daniel suffered. The money is now helping to pay for specialist equipment, which Olly said was often ""stupidly expensive"", as well as home alterations and physiotherapy. More than two thirds of historical claims relate to mistakes during birth There are a number of reasons why many years might elapse between a medical mistake and a negligence payout. Complex legal cases can take a long time to resolve and often involve extensive medical assessments. Sometimes, assessments about a child's care needs can only be made when they are older. In other cases, families don't realise until years later that they might have a claim. Critics also say that too often the NHS refuses to admit responsibility, meaning the court process takes longer and costs more. Mr Walsh said: ""We have seen claims that have taken over 10 years to resolve. ""Things have improved, but not enough has been done to speed up the process."" NHS Resolution, which handles negligence claims on behalf of English hospitals, said it was still receiving new claims under the historical scheme. A spokesman said the cost of those claims was also rising because of factors such as increasing life expectancy and a recent change to the way lump-sum payments were calculated. Negligence claims are still being received for errors made in maternity units more than 20 years ago He said: ""NHS Resolution is now involved right from the start in order to improve the support for families and the healthcare staff involved in these rare but tragic incidents and to speed up resolution."" From next year, NHS Resolution will also offer cash incentives to hospital trusts which take steps to make maternity services safer. Lapses lead to mistake every five births Litigation 'threatening NHS finances' Birth problems twice as common in some trusts It forms part of a Government plan to halve the rate of neonatal deaths, stillbirths, maternal deaths and brain injuries caused during or shortly after labour by 2025. The Department of Health, which foots the historical negligence bill, said the plan would ""help to reduce traumatic and costly safety failings in the NHS"". Legal costs made up more than a third of the overall NHS negligence bill in the past five years. The Department of Health has set out plans to cap the fees that lawyers can recoup from the taxpayer when they win negligence cases for their clients. A spokesman said: ""We're ensuring taxpayers' money is spent effectively by taking action against law firms creaming off excessive legal costs that dwarf the damages recovered - but we're also clear we want to ensure patients continue to access justice at a reasonable cost."" But Mr Walsh said this plan ""risks denying access to justice and the opportunity for the NHS to learn much-needed lessons"". The hospital trust responsible for the biggest historical negligence bill, at Â£8.4 million over the past five years, was Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The trust declined to comment. The trust with the second-largest bill, Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said its historical negligence costs had dropped by nearly half since 2013/14, reflecting its ""improvement journey"". Third-place University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust said its historical negligence bill related to 12 cases dating back to before 1995. A spokesman said: ""Nine of those relate to children who underwent heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the 1990s, prior to the public inquiry, which resulted in wide-scale changes in clinical governance across the NHS."" In general, trusts which run larger hospitals would be expected to have larger historical negligence bills. Payouts for historical negligence cases in Northern Ireland nearly trebled last year, to Â£4.1m. A spokesman for Northern Ireland's Department of Health said most of this cost related to just two cases. Historical cases - defined as those before 1993 in Northern Ireland - accounted for 15% of its entire litigation bill over the past three years, a much higher proportion than in England. The NHS in Scotland has no separate scheme for historical negligence cases, but around Â£4.5m was paid out last year for mistakes made before 1998. However, the proportion of claims arising from mistakes in maternity wards has halved in the past decade. The Scottish Government said its NHS had a commitment to ""learning lessons when something goes wrong"". In Wales, health trusts paid more than Â£160,000 last year for medical mistakes made more than 20 years ago, although not all trusts responded to requests for information.

"This video can not be played Trump voters grade president's first year President Donald Trump has said he was ""totally misrepresented"" by those saying he used the term ""shithole"" to describe African nations last week. Mr Trump also said the allegation was hurting efforts to strike a deal to protect so-called Dreamer immigrants. The president was responding to a claim by Democratic Senator Dick Durbin that he used ""vile and racist"" language during a meeting on immigration reform. The alleged remarks sparked global outrage and demands that he apologise. ""There is no other word one can use but racist,"" said a UN spokesman. On Monday, two senators who said he did indeed use the disparaging remark stood by their account of what took place. Was Trump's alleged slur actually racist? The row broke out after Republican and Democratic lawmakers visited the president in the Oval Office on Thursday to work on a proposal for an immigration deal. A key issue they need to agree on is what to do with an Obama-era scheme that protects some 800,000 young people who entered the US illegally as children - known as the Dreamers. But the alleged slur was uttered during another topic for discussion - the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) given to a number of nationalities currently living in the country. In recent weeks the Trump administration has made a series of announcements that have brought that status to an end. This video can not be played The countries with Temporary Protected Status that Trump could be talking about Hours after the meeting, reports emerged that Mr Trump had asked: ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" The US should be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, he is reported to have said. Accounts suggest that when Mr Trump was told that the largest groups of immigrants with that status were from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, the president responded: ""Haitians? Do we need more Haitians?"" On Friday, Mr Durbin said: ""I cannot believe that in the history of the White House, in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday. ""President Trump said things that were hate-filled, vile, and racist. He used those words repeatedly."" This video can not be played Trump's alleged remarks 'a punch in guts' Mr Trump responded by saying his language was ""tough"" but not the language used in the news reports. He also denied he was a racist. And on Monday he tweeted that Mr Durbin had ""totally misrepresented what was said"". He also blamed the Democratic senator for the apparent impasse over negotiations to reach a solution on the Dreamers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Thousands of Rohingya have been forced to live in camps MPs have raised ""grave concern"" about the plight of thousands of Rohingya people being returned to Myanmar. The Commons International Development Committee said it was ""clear"" that rape and sexual violence remain weapons of war used by the Burmese military. And it warned of the ""chilling prospect"" of the area becoming a ""powder keg of radicalisation"". The Rohingya are a stateless minority who have long experienced persecution in Myanmar, also known as Burma. More than 650,000 have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since deadly Rohingya attacks on police posts prompted a military crackdown in Rakhine state in late August. The crisis has been called ethnic cleansing by the UN and the US. Myanmar's military has denied targeting civilians, and insists it is fighting only Rohingya militants. Who will help Myanmar's Rohingya? What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis In a new report, the International Development Committee said a ""huge human tragedy"" had unfolded. ""Burma's actions have imposed human suffering on hundreds of thousands of people and presented the world with a huge bill for humanitarian relief estimated to amount to a billion pounds per year,"" it said. ""There is also the chilling prospect of yet another long-term, politically intractable, cross-border displacement where the prospects of it becoming a powder keg of radicalisation seem very real."" It welcomed the UK government's ""five-point plan"" for the international community to tackle the crisis. This involves ending violence by the Burmese security forces, securing full humanitarian access, allowing refugees to return in a ""voluntary, safe and dignified manner"", implementing the recommendations of areport by former UN chief Kofi Annan, and full access and co-operation with the UN's fact-finding mission. ""However, our evidence indicates there is little by way of international consensus and activity behind the plan,"" the MPs said, warning of ""substantial challenges"" in each part of the list. ""It strikes the right notes but the conditions needed to underpin each strand appear to be out of reach in the current circumstances,"" they said. The report said Bangladesh was ""proceeding apace"" with the return of a first tranche of Rohingya. ""We recognise that traditional leadership structures across the displaced Rohingya communities have been massively disrupted, but the lack of evidence of consultation or involvement of the Rohingya concerns us,"" it warned. ""There are previous episodes of displacement and return of the Rohingya, and other ethnic minorities, in Burma over the last 20 years which do not inspire confidence."" This video can not be played UK medics have been sent to vaccinate Rohingya against diphtheria It was unclear whether the reported list of 100,000 Rohingya are volunteers, what their final destination is and how they will be protected, the MPs said. ""As it stands, this is a matter of grave concern to us."" Long term, the report said there was a need to find ways for the Rohingya people to ""develop livelihoods and become more self-reliant"". It praised the UK government for ""committing to a substantial sum"" - Â£59 million - at an early stage, acknowledging that the UK was ""one player within a complex multilateral environment"". Committee chairman Stephen Twigg said: ""We are going to have to work much harder to protect populations from threats and humanitarian crises. ""For decades, the Rohingya people in Rakhine State endured discrimination, marginalisation and abuse. The Rohingya have paid a heavy price for the lack of consensus amongst the international community on how and when to decide to act effectively. We cannot fail them again.""

"Poppi Worthington was blue and not breathing when she was taken to hospital Toddler Poppi Worthington was sexually assaulted by her father before she died, a coroner has ruled, finding her death was caused by asphyxia. Coroner David Roberts said Paul Worthington assaulted his daughter in his bed, laid a cover over her and went to sleep. He said she died because her ability to breathe was compromised as a result of ""an unsafe sleeping environment."" Mr Roberts said her father's account of events did not ""stand up to scrutiny"". 'Why did you hurt your daughter?' Latest updates as the coroner delivers his inquest findings Key dates in the Poppi investigation The inquest: Review of evidence, findings and conclusion,external During the three-week inquest at Kendal Coroner's Court, Poppi's father declined to answer 252 questions relating to the circumstances surrounding her death on 12 December 2012. However, Mr Worthington did tell the hearing he had gone to get Poppi a fresh nappy and a few minutes later he reached over and found her limp. He said he rushed downstairs and Poppi's mother, who was asleep there, called an ambulance. Paul Worthington's evidence did not ""stand up to scrutiny"", the coroner found The 13-month-old was pronounced dead at Furness General Hospital shortly after. Having heard contradictory evidence from expert medical witnesses, Mr Roberts said he believed Mr Worthington sexually assaulted Poppi, probably with a finger, and the assault stopped when the youngster cried out in pain. He said a conclusion of unlawful killing was not available to him as he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Poppi died from an act of murder or manslaughter. He said: ""Although I have found, on the balance of probabilities, that Poppi was anally penetrated prior to her death, I have also found that she did not die in the course of or immediately following the penetration and the penetration did not cause her death."" Mr Roberts added Poppi was suffering from an upper respiratory tract infection which, along with being placed in her father's bed, compromised her ability to breathe. A ""short-form accidental death"" verdict was also considered but ruled out as inappropriate as he did not conclude the death had resulted from an ""unintended act or omission or is the unintended consequence of a deliberate act or omission"". Lawyers acting for Mr Worthington, 50, said he was ""considering his options"". In January 2016 - as part of family court proceedings - a judge revealed in his findings that Mr Worthington ""probably"" sexually assaulted his daughter shortly before her death. Mr Worthington has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any offence, with the Crown Prosecution Service saying there is insufficient evidence. During the inquest Mr Worthington declined to answer more than 250 questions, citing his right under rule 22 of the Coroners and Justice Act not to incriminate himself. His sister, Tracey Worthington, said she ""didn't blame"" him for refusing to answer. She said: ""He's gone through all this process over the last four years, five years.  And everything that's been dumped on him. No, go with the solicitor's advice. ""I don't have to be convinced he's done nothing. I know."" Mr Worthington was escorted in and out of the inquest by police In a statement read by her solicitors, Poppi's mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, described the five years since the youngster's death as a ""complete nightmare"". She added she was ""disappointed"" Mr Worthington refused to give evidence and ""considers he should have given the coroner the crucial evidence on Poppi's last few hours"". The inquest was told an investigation by Cumbria Police was so botched vital evidence was lost and Jerry Graham, Chief Constable of the force, apologised for ""deficiencies"" in its handling of the case. He said: ""It is clear the initial investigation into Poppi's death launched in 2012 has done little to assist the coroner in coming to a conclusion on how Poppi died. I greatly regret this."" This video can not be played Fiona McGhie, solicitor for Poppi's mother: ""The last five years have been a complete nightmare"" Mr Graham said he would speak to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to ""determine possible courses of action"". However, a CPS spokesman said there were ""no plans"" to review charging decisions in relation to the case but ""we would of course consider any referral from the coroner"". Calling on the Home Secretary to launch a public inquiry, Labour MP for Barrow John Woodcock, said: ""That little girl will probably never get justice because of grotesque failings into the police investigation into her death. ""But we owe it to her to campaign for a public inquiry that can expose all that is rotten in the system that has led us to this terrible day."" An earlier inquest into Poppi's death proved inconclusive Lead detective on the inquiry Det Insp Amanda Sadler was subjected to a disciplinary hearing last year where gross incompetency was proven and she was demoted in rank. She has since retired along with her boss, former Det Ch Insp Mike Forrester. No further action was taken against either. In 2015, the Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded both Mrs Sadler and Mr Forrester had cases to answer for gross misconduct. The inquest was the second hearing into Poppi's death. The first, in 2014 with a different coroner, lasted less than eight minutes and concluded the cause of her death was ""unascertained"".

"This video can not be played The Carillion collapse: What does it mean? Firms working for failed construction giant Carillion on purely private sector deals will only have two days of government support, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington has warned. Carillion spent Â£952m with local suppliers in 2016 and used an extensive network of small firms, who are now waiting to learn if they will be paid. One industry group estimates that up to 30,000 firms are owed money by Carillion. Critics want a review into the crisis. Britain's second largest construction firm, which employs 20,000 people in the UK,went bust on Monday with debts of about Â£1.5bn. Carillion's work stretched from the HS2 rail project and military contracts to maintaining hospitals, schools, and prisons. On Monday, Mr Lidington said there would be government support for public sector contracts. Carillion had previously said it used a wide range of small companies because it was ""committed to generating regional economic growth and development"". Are you a Carillion contractor? Are you going to work today? Contact us athaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. But the head of the Federation of Small Businesses said thousands of jobs and livelihoods were now at risk because those firms would be at the back of the queue for payment. Mike Cherry said it was a situation made worse because Carillion extended its payment schedule to suppliers last year. ""These unpaid bills may well go back several months,"" he continued. ""I wrote to Carillion back in July last year to express concern after hearing from FSB members that the company was making small suppliers wait 120 days to be paid."" 'They've literally locked the gate' Watershed moment for privatisation? Carillion: Not alone in hitting problems Trade body Build UK estimates that between 25,000 and 30,000 businesses are owed money by Carillion. It said that in the past, when other big contractors have failed, around 18% of businesses who were creditors did not survive the next five years. A partner at one accountancy firm, who asked not to be named, said small firms were looking at total losses stretching into hundreds of millions of pounds. ""Asset sales won't even raise enough to cover the debts of senior bank creditors, so many small firms won't see a bean,"" he said. Rudi Klein, head of Specialist Engineering Contractor, an umbrella group representing suppliers to the construction industry, said Carillion outsourced virtually all its work. He said the government knew of Carillion's reliance on sub-contractors, but continued to award the company lucrative work despite growing concerns about its finances. ""It's that supply chain who is going to bear the massive loss,"" he said. ""There could be a large number of firms that will experience substantial financial distress."" Carillion was one of the contractors working on HS2 - the high-speed rail network, which will run from London to Birmingham and to Manchester and Leeds. Sir David Higgins, chairman of the HS2 project, said that he was ""hopeful"" that Carillion's failure would not delay the project. He said that HS2 only has a ""very minor"" exposure to Carillion as other big firms working on HS2 will pick up its work. Andy Bradley is the managing director of Flora-tec, which is owed Â£800,000 by Carillion for landscaping services. ""The government actively encouraged businesses like mine... to get involved in public sector contracts, to make sure the little guy got a slice of the pie. ""When Carillion started to get into trouble last year we were considering that we would scale back our involvement with them. ""However... the government continued to give them billion-pound contract after billion-pound contract and that said to me, as a small supplier, that the government had done their due diligence. ""We were following the government lead... only to be given a sucker punch. ""I had to make 10 people redundant yesterday. That's 10 people with mortgages, car loans, all that stuff. It's an absolute disgrace."" Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Soldiers to schools - Carillion in UK public life Carillion collapse: What next? On Monday, Mr Lidington said the government was stepping in to pay employees and small businesses working on Carillion's public contracts and assess the distribution of work among other companies. However, companies working on private projects will get no such support. Accountancy firm PwC, which is overseeing Carillion's liquidation, said in a statement,external: ""Unless told otherwise, all employees, agents and sub-contractors are being asked to continue to work as normal and they will be paid for the work they do during the liquidations."" But there were anecdotal reports that work had stopped on many projects. A bricklayer on the new Â£350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital building, Philip Ellis, told the BBC that when workers turned up on Monday they were told to go home. He said: ""About 20 of us working for our sub-contractor were told we could go on-site to collect equipment, but that was it.... I spent the day phoning recruitment agencies looking for work - but was told everyone's doing that."" There is also mounting criticism of the pay packages enjoyed by directors in the run-up to Carillion's crisis. Former chief executive Richard Howson, in charge until last year when Carillion issued the first of three shock profit warnings, will continue to be paid until October. Mr Lidington told the Commons on Monday that the official receiver had the power to impose penalties if it uncovered any misconduct. Are you a Carillion contractor? Are you going to work today?

"A rape case has collapsed after images emerged of the accused and his alleged victim ""cuddling"" in bed together. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) offered no evidence against Samson Makele at Snaresbrook Crown Court, 17 months after he was arrested. The photos were discovered on his phone by a defence expert but had not been disclosed by police or prosecutors. The CPS said it was not a failure of disclosure and it stopped the prosecution once the pictures emerged. Lawyers for Mr Makele said at least four photos taken on the day of the alleged rape showed the pair together, apparently naked under bedsheets. In July 2017, the 28-year-old ,who is originally from Eritrea, was charged with raping the woman after the Notting Hill Carnival in west London in August 2016. According to his lawyers, the CPS said after he had been charged that apart from text messages between the pair, there was nothing else of relevance on the phone. The defence commissioned its own expert to examine the device and a report containing details of the images was sent to the CPS on 5 January. Earlier in court prosecutors offered ""no evidence"" against Mr Makele, a fortnight before his trial was due to begin. The Metropolitan Police said it was ""the responsibility of the investigating officer to pursue all reasonable lines of enquiry in an investigation"" which ""involves making complex decisions based on the evidence available and disclosures made"". It added: ""In this case it is apparent that the police investigation did not find the images."" A spokesperson for the CPS said they had received ""material we were not previously aware of"" from the defence. ""The case was reviewed and it was concluded there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. We made the decision to offer no evidence and did so at a hearing today.""

"This video can not be played A neighbour said the children were always accompanied by the parents A California couple have been arrested after police found their 13 children allegedly held captive at home, some ""shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks"". David Allen Turpin, 57, and Louise Anna Turpin, 49, were held on charges of torture and child endangerment. The couple's children - aged two to 29 - lived in Perris, 59 miles (95km) south-east of Los Angeles. Officers were alerted by one of the victims, a 17-year-old girl. The teenager - who appeared to be ""only 10 years old and slightly emaciated"" - on Sunday managed to escape and call the emergency number using a mobile phone found inside the house,the Riverside Sheriff's Department said in a statement,external. The 'happy family' at centre of allegations Police officers later found ""several children shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings"". Pictures show the Turpins in uniform and happy The officers were ""shocked"" to discover that seven of them were actually adults aged between 18 and 29. ""The victims appeared to be malnourished and very dirty,"" the police said. They are now being treated in local hospitals. The head of one of the hospitals, Mark Uffer, told Reuters news agency: ""It's actually heartbreaking for the staff and it's unbelievable what you see."" Mr and Mrs Turpin are now being held in jail with bail set at $9m (Â£6.5m) each. This video can not be played Police chief: 'I would call that torture' James Cook, BBC News, Perris On Muir Woods Road there is no hint of the horror inside number 160. This is a smart suburban home with three cars and a people carrier gleaming in the driveway. The curtains are drawn but a decorative Christmas star can be seen hanging in one window. The estate is neat and the houses on the road are spacious but they are close together. It is difficult to imagine how a family could hide such an enormous dark secret here. And yet that is exactly what seems to have happened. Neighbours are now engaged in soul-searching about whether they should have spotted that something was awry. No-one seems to know how long the siblings may have been held captive and, of course, no-one can answer the hardest question of all - why? According to public records, the couple lived in Texas for many years before moving to California in 2010. Mr Turpin has twice been declared bankrupt. At the time of his second bankruptcy he is said to have had a relatively well-paid job as an engineer at aeronautics and defence technology company Northrop Grumman. The couple's Facebook page contains numerous family photos However, with so many children and his wife not working, records suggest his expenses exceeded his income. The children's grandparents said that they had not seen the family for four or five years. James and Betty Turpin told ABC they were considered a good Christian family in their community and that ""God called on them"" to have so many children. The family's Facebook page shows numerous photos and videos of them, apparently happy and smiling. Many posts contain comments from family or friends. They appear to have renewed their wedding vows several times in recent years, often with their children present. In a YouTube video, the couple are seen renewing their vows at the Elvis Chapel in Las Vegas. Repeating after an Elvis impersonator, Mr Turpin tells his wife: ""I offer you this ring as a symbol of my love, baby, baby."" The children laugh along with the impersonator, and clap as the couple kisses. The grandparents said their grandchildren were home-schooled, but it is not entirely clear what that means. On the California Department of Education website,Mr Turpin is listed as the principal of Sandcastle Day School,external-  a private school operated out of his home. The school was opened in March 2011, the website says. Six pupils were enrolled there, all in different grades. In California, private schools operate outside the jurisdiction of the education department and most regulations. They are directly accountable to students and their parents or guardians, and the state has no authority to monitor or evaluate them. Teachers at private schools in California also do not need to hold a valid state teaching qualification. One neighbour told Reuters that the Turpin family ""were the type that you didn't really get to know anything about them"". Neighbours said the Turpins rarely emerged from their home ""Why don't we ever see the kids?"" neighbour Kimberly Milligan asked. ""In hindsight, we would have never thought this, but there were red flags. You never don't hear or see nine kids."" She recalled on one occasion saying hello to the children as they erected a Christmas nativity scene. But she said they stopped to stand frozen still, as if by doing so they would become invisible. She described them looking at her ""like a child who wants to make themselves invisible"".

"Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Carillion files for voluntary liquidation Cobra committee meets Pension schemes go into rescue fund Government defends Carillion contracts MPs call for inquiry into collapse Chris Johnston That's all for the first livepage of the week. We usually finish with a look at Wall Street's closing prices. But markets are closed for a US public holiday - Martin Luther King day. Join us again tomorrow from 6am. Peter Kitson, Partner at law firm Russell-Cooke, says the procurement rules that govern public sector
procurement are the key to understanding what has gone wrong at Carillion. Almost all Carillion contracts have been competitively tendered under those procurement rules. The rules require public sector clients to investigate and possibly to exclude any tenderer whose bid is 'abnormally low'. One contributory factor here may be that Carillion has tendered at very low margins, possibly unsustainably low, in order to win these huge volumes of work. If such bids have succeeded, that can only mean either than the regulations themselves are ineffective or that public sector clients lack the confidence or the expertise properly to enforce those rules.

Britain's second biggest construction company has collapsed. What does it mean for the projects it worked on, and the schools and hospitals it worked for? Ministers have now ended the Cobra meeting on the demise of Carillion. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington (pictured) says day one had gone ""pretty well"" as ""people were turning up to work, we have not had any reports of serious interruption to service delivery."" He says PWC, which is working with the official receivers, took ministers through the advice it is giving to employees and contractors at the meeting. It was also an ""opportunity for ministers to test what sort of concerns are being expressed and decide how we should best address them and provide the reassurance that people want"", Mr Lidington adds. Spot of other corporate news for a moment. The engineering giant GKN, already under pressure to begin takeover talks with Melrose, is facing another threat. It has emerged that US activist investor Elliott has a 1.7% stake in the company, which last weekrejected a Â£7bn bid from Melrose. Elliott, a hedge fund with a track record of intervening in takeovers, said it held the stake in GKN through contracts-for-difference (CfDs). A person familiar with the situation said that while Elliott believed the current offer from Melrose was too low, GKN should open discussions to ""find the right price and the right structure"".

 workers on private sector contracts for 48 hours after the company's collapse, but will not offer them the same protection as those in the public sector, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said. While the government is paying the salaries of Carillion's workers, he said those private companies employing Carillion would have just two days of government support. ""The position of private sector employees is that they will not be getting the same protection that we're offering to public sector employees, beyond a 48-hour period of grace,"" Mr Lidington told MPs. ""I think that is a reasonable gesture towards private sector employees,"" he added. Chancellor Philip Hammond and ministers including Nick Gibb, Stephen Barclay, Michael Ellis, Tobias Elwood and Jake Berry have arrived in Whitehall for a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee on the collapse of Carillion. The collapse of Carillion is a âwatershed
momentâ, says Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. ""Across the public
sector, the outsource-first dogma has wreaked havoc. Often it is the same
companies that have gone from service to service, creaming off profits and
failing to deliver the quality of service our people deserve. ""Labour will end the PFI rip-off, put an end the
private-profit-is-best dogma and run our public services for the benefit of the
many, not the profits of the few.â Mick Lynch, assistant general secretary of the RMT union, calls the Carillion collapse a disaster. ""There are thousands of sub-contractors, agency labour, there are suppliers who won't get paid. We're already being told that people aren't being paid,"" he says. ""The thing is collapsing around us and the government seems to have this laissez-faire attitude and they've got to take steps that assure people of their futures."" Times deputy political editor Sam Coates has been reading the leaders in today's edition of the Evening Standard, which is edited, of course, by one George Osborne. Allow Twitter content?

Former chancellor Lord Lawson has called for an independent inquiry into the private finance initiative (PFI) process following the Carillion collapse. He told the House of Lords he ""refused to have anything to do with it"" when in office in the 1980s even though Treasury officials were keen on it. Subsequent chancellors, especially Gordon Brown, were ""enthusiastically in favour"" because it enabled ministers to ""dress up"" considerable amounts of public spending off the public sector balance sheet. He said this was not a good reason for something which did not give good value for money for the taxpayer and introduced ""a degree of moral hazard which we see very much in the Carillion affair"". Lord Lawson said it was important to ""take stock and decide whether the whole PFI initiative should be proceeded with any further"" because there was enough evidence to show it was not good value for money or sensible for taxpayers.

She asks for a change to the rules so that ""companies cannot siphon off money to the detriment of suppliers, workers and ultimately the taxpayer"". Cabinet Office minister David Lidington says the official receiver will consider the potential detriment to those receiving pensions as well as employers and may impose penalties on individuals ""if there is evidence they have abused their responsibilities"". House of CommonsParliament Conservative chair of the Treasury Committee, Nicky Morgan, highlights the role of small and medium-sized businesses in the supply chain. She says they are ""concerned about meeting liabilities"" and asks what can be done so they do not feel ""pressure to keep paying the taxman"".

Very quick update on the London market: theFTSE 100ended the day down about 10 points at 7,769. But more interestingly, sterling has hit$1.38 against the US dollar. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital says the pound has now made up more than 60% of its losses since the Brexit referendum vote, when the currency fell below $1.20. ""Ultimately
this is a dollar story as much as anything else, and the greenback â while
rocking - looks oversold and may be poised to bounce back, which could prevent
sterling from breaking out just yet,"" he adds. Frank Field, chair of the
Work and Pensions select committee, comments: âCarillion took on mega
borrowings while its pension deficit ballooned. We called over a year ago for the Pensions Regulator to have mandatory clearance powers for corporate activities like these that
put pension schemes at risk, and powers to impose truly deterrent fines that
would focus boardroom minds. âIf government had acted
then, the brakes might have been put on Carillionâs massive ramping-up of debt
and it never would have fallen into this sorry crisis."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.1349701
"This video can not be played Trump voters grade president's first year President Donald Trump has said he was ""totally misrepresented"" by those saying he used the term ""shithole"" to describe African nations last week. Mr Trump also said the allegation was hurting efforts to strike a deal to protect so-called Dreamer immigrants. The president was responding to a claim by Democratic Senator Dick Durbin that he used ""vile and racist"" language during a meeting on immigration reform. The alleged remarks sparked global outrage and demands that he apologise. ""There is no other word one can use but racist,"" said a UN spokesman. On Monday, two senators who said he did indeed use the disparaging remark stood by their account of what took place. Was Trump's alleged slur actually racist? The row broke out after Republican and Democratic lawmakers visited the president in the Oval Office on Thursday to work on a proposal for an immigration deal. A key issue they need to agree on is what to do with an Obama-era scheme that protects some 800,000 young people who entered the US illegally as children - known as the Dreamers. But the alleged slur was uttered during another topic for discussion - the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) given to a number of nationalities currently living in the country. In recent weeks the Trump administration has made a series of announcements that have brought that status to an end. This video can not be played The countries with Temporary Protected Status that Trump could be talking about Hours after the meeting, reports emerged that Mr Trump had asked: ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" The US should be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, he is reported to have said. Accounts suggest that when Mr Trump was told that the largest groups of immigrants with that status were from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, the president responded: ""Haitians? Do we need more Haitians?"" On Friday, Mr Durbin said: ""I cannot believe that in the history of the White House, in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday. ""President Trump said things that were hate-filled, vile, and racist. He used those words repeatedly."" This video can not be played Trump's alleged remarks 'a punch in guts' Mr Trump responded by saying his language was ""tough"" but not the language used in the news reports. He also denied he was a racist. And on Monday he tweeted that Mr Durbin had ""totally misrepresented what was said"". He also blamed the Democratic senator for the apparent impasse over negotiations to reach a solution on the Dreamers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The two sides in the row became more entrenched on Monday, with Mr Graham appearing to challenge colleagues Perdue and Cotton by saying his memory had not ""evolved"".

"This video can not be played Baby M death: Police search for two people seen on CCTV Police investigating the murder of a newborn girl whose body was discovered in a park have released CCTV footage of two people they want to speak to. Baby M was found dead in Manor Park, Aldershot, on 19 May. It is thought she was born about three days earlier. The two people in the footage walked up and down nearby Ash Road 10 times in an hour on 15 May, police said. A post-mortem examination revealed the child died from ""deliberately inflicted"" head injuries, police said. She suffered multiple blunt force injuries to the head, with other minor injuries to her body, and died within six hours of being born. It is thought the birth took place under this tree in Manor Park The body of the baby was discovered in Manor Park, Aldershot, in May Det Ch Insp Dave Storey, of Hampshire Constabulary, said analysis by the National History Museum found the birth would most likely have happened under a tree in the park between 18:00 BST on 15 May and 08:00 the following day. He added a DNA profile taken from the baby, whose body was discovered at the edge of the park by a council worker, showed that both she and her mother, and probably the child's father, were of east Asian ethnicity. ""This remains a particularly sad case in which, despite extensive investigation, we are still are nowhere nearer to identifying the newborn baby Baby M, nor her mother,"" he said. ""We have a baby who is unnamed and, at this stage, is still not buried and we would like some assistance in order to identify the mother and obtain some justice for Baby M."" He added the force was still trying to identify the mother and offer support ""because it takes an awful lot for a mother to give birth to a child to then either kill the baby or have the baby taken away from her and killed immediately afterwards"".

Constituency branches were able to nominate three eligible candidates each. Anyone who had been a Labour member since 19 November was able to cast a vote.
