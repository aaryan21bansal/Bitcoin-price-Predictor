"This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: 'Kensington community is frustrated and angry' The Grenfell Tower fire was a ""preventable accident"" caused by ""years of neglect"" by the local council and successive governments, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said. After attending a service for victims, Mr Khan said the fire was a national disaster requiring a national response. Kensington and Chelsea Council's leader said officials had been working ""around the clock"" since the fire on Wednesday. The government says all those who lost their homes are to receive Â£5,500. Each household will receive at least Â£500 in cash and Â£5,000 paid into an account as part of a Â£5m emergency fund first announced on Friday. At least 58 people are believed to have died after the fire ripped through the 24-storey block in North Kensington in the early hours of Wednesday. Police are expected to announce an increase in that number on Monday. The BBC understands about 70 may have died. Eighteen people remain in hospital, nine in critical care. Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said: ""I must consider the fact that there may be others in the building who, for whatever reason, have not been reported to us. ""There is also a real possibility that there may be people in the building that no one knows are missing."" Police have released images from inside the building to show the scale of the challenge they face. Cdr Cundy said: ""The conditions due to the fire damage verge on indescribable, which is why this will be such a lengthy operation taking weeks to complete."" Police have released new images of properties where everyone has been accounted for Kensington and Chelsea Council has faced widespread criticism for its handling of the disaster, with residents complaining that officials had provided little support or information. A group who met Prime Minister Theresa May at Downing Street have criticised the borough's tenant management organisation for being ""invisible in the aftermath of the tragedy"". ""We explained to the prime minister the anger of all residents towards the management of the estate over a long period of time, paving the way to this tragedy,"" they said. What we know so far Who are the victims? Mr Khan echoed their point, saying: ""People are angry, not simply at the poor response in the days afterwards from the council and the government, but at the years of neglect from the council. ""There's a feeling that the council and government don't understand their concerns and don't care."" A police photo shows a burned-out corridor in Grenfell Tower He added: ""People in this community are sick to death of platitudes from politicians."" Kensington and Chelsea Council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown said he understood residents' anger and that the authority itself wanted to know why the fire had started and spread so quickly. He added that the disaster was too big for one authority to handle alone and it was inaccurate to suggest his council was not present on the ground or working with other authorities. This video can not be played Council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown says the council has a ""very well organised"" operation in place. The government has sent in a team of civil servants to bolster the relief effort. They were spotted in high-visibility jackets in the area on Sunday afternoon. Boy, 6, donates pocket money Father's day cards among fire tributes Stars gather for charity single Details of how the government's Â£5m emergency fund have been outlined, including: Funding will be made available for people staying in temporary accommodation A discretionary fund is available to help meet funeral costs There will also be funding for legal representation for residents involved in the public inquiry An extra Â£1.5m will pay for mental health support for the emergency services Mrs May said: ""My government will continue to do absolutely everything possible to help all of those affected through the difficult days, weeks, months and years ahead."" A newly-established ""Grenfell Fire Response Team"" has been set up to lead the relief effort, which will include a 24-hour operation at the Westway Sports Centre. The new team is made up of local and central government, the Red Cross, the Metropolitan Police and the London Fire Brigade. This video can not be played Grenfell Tower community applauded firefighters as they drove past Eleanor Kelly, chief executive of Southwark Council, said speeding up the rehousing process would be the main priority. The Red Cross has been asked to increase its role and and its staff will be part of teams allocated to every household affected by the fire, as well as meeting bereaved relatives as they arrive at airports. The charity's helpline - 0800 4589472 - is now the central point of contact for all people affected. Mrs Kelly added in a statement: ""There is nothing we can say that will blunt the feeling of loss and anger. ""But I hope the new team and this package of support will start to get those affected by this tragedy the urgent assistance from the authorities they need."" This police picture shows an entrance to the tower Earlier,writing in the Observer,external, Mr Khan had suggested that high-rise tower blocks dating from the 1960s and 1970s could be torn down in the wake of the fire, which he said may well be the ""defining outcome of this tragedy"". Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC's Andrew Marr Show that a criminal investigation would examine whether building regulations had been breached when the block was refurbished. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told ITV's Peston on Sunday that the council had seemed to ""lack the resources to deal with a crisis of this magnitude"", despite being the country's ""wealthiest borough"". A Father's Day card is left among bouquets of flowers in North Kensington Meanwhile, Labour MP David Lammy, whose friend Khadija Saye is among the dead, has called for all documents relating to the refurbishment and management of Grenfell Tower to be protected. Questions continue to be asked about why the fire spread so quickly, amid suggestions new cladding fitted during a recent overhaul could have been to blame. The prime minister has come in for a barrage of criticism over her response to the disaster. She was jeered on a visit to the North Kensington estate on Friday, and protesters marching on Friday and Saturday called for her resignation.

"This video can not be played A fire burns in the forest surrounding the resort Five people were killed when gunmen stormed a tourist resort in Mali on Sunday, officials say. The EU said a Portuguese soldier and a Malian woman who worked for the bloc's mission in Mali were among the dead. A Malian soldier and two other civilians, one Chinese and the other Gabonese, were also killed. An al-Qaeda-linked group said it carried out the attack near the capital Bamako. Mali has been fighting a jihadist insurgency for years. Islamist fighters are roaming the West African country's north and centre. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories World's most dangerous peacekeeping mission ""It is a jihadist attack. Malian special forces intervened and hostages have been released,"" Mali Security Minister Salif Traore told AFP news agency after Sunday's attack. Four assailants were killed by security forces and four others were arrested, he said. ""We have recovered the bodies of two attackers who were killed,"" he said, adding that they were searching for the bodies of two others. One of them left behind a machine gun and bottles filled with ""explosive substances"", he said. The ministry said another two people had been injured. A security ministry spokesman told Reuters news agency that 32 guests had been rescued from the Le Campement Kangaba resort, east of Bamako. Malian special forces intervened, backed by UN soldiers and troops from a French counter-terrorism force. The eco-lodge complex near Bamako is a popular attraction Witness Boubacar Sangare was just outside the compound as the attack unfolded. ""Westerners were fleeing the encampment while two plainclothes police exchanged fire with the assailants,"" he said. ""There were four national police vehicles and French soldiers in armoured vehicles on the scene."" He added that a helicopter was circling overhead. The European Union training mission in Mali, EUTM Mali, tweeted that it was aware of the attack and was supporting Malian security forces and assessing the situation. Earlier this month, the US embassy had warned of ""possible future attacks on Western diplomatic missions, other locations in Bamako that Westerners frequent"". French soldiers stand around a UN vehicle following the attack on Le Campement Kangaba resort BBC correspondent Alex Duval Smith says many expats and wealthy Malians go to Kangaba at weekends, to enjoy the pools, cocktail bar, canoeing facilities and activities for children. A spokesman for the Portuguese armed forces, Helder Antonio da Silva Perdigao, said that the location is used by soldiers in the EUTM Mali as a place to relax between operations. He added that soldiers from several countries were there at the time of the attack. The Portuguese soldier who died was part of the EUTM Mali, he said. In November 2015, at least 20 people were killed whengunmen took guests and staff hostageat the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako. Al-Qaeda's North African arm,Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), said it was behind that siege. Mali has been in a state of emergency since the Radisson Blu attack. It was extended for a further six months in April. The country's security has gradually worsened since 2013, when French forces repelled allied Islamist and Tuareg rebel fighters who had seized control of much of the north. French troops and a 10,000-strong force of UN peacekeepers have been battling to stabilise the former French colony.

"A Lib Dem MP tipped to become the party's next leader has ruled herself out of the race. Jo Swinson, who regained her East Dunbartonshire seat at the general election, had been the bookies' favourite to replace Tim Farron. But she said she would seek to become deputy leader instead. Mr Farron quit last week, saying he was ""torn between living as a faithful Christian and serving as a political leader"". Lib Dem leadership runners and riders In a blogpost, Ms Swinson, a former equalities minister,said she had been,external""overwhelmed"" by messages urging her to stand as his replacement. ""Being the leader of a political party is a unique and all-encompassing job, even more than the roles of MP and minister that I have undertaken before,"" she said. ""It should not be done simply to achieve status, to make a point, or to please others."" Ms Swinson said her ""reflections and conversations about a range of factors"" had persuaded her to go for the deputy leadership instead. She wrote: ""Feminist that I am, I have of course wondered what a bloke in my position would do.  It's obvious. ""Most blokes in my shoes would run for leader like a shot. ""It's true that my many years of encouraging women to have the confidence to go for that exciting new role have taught me that women often don't go for things when they should."" But she added: ""Just because a man would do it, doesn't make it the right thing to do.""

"This video can not be played Gareth Roberts: 'You could hear the roar of the fire coming... we just sat and waited to die' Portugal has declared three days of mourning for the 62 victims of one of the country's deadliest forest fires. Four children are among the victims, many of whom were found dead inside their cars as they tried to flee the central forested region of PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande. Hundreds of firefighters are continuing to tackle the blaze on several fronts. Prime Minister Antonio Costa called it ""the greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years in terms of forest fires"". He said it was thought to have been sparked by a lightning strike. Portugal fire survivor: 'I should have died' In pictures: Portugal forest fire Four firefighters are among the 54 people injured in the fire, which is raging in several parts of a mountainous area some 200km north-east of the capital Lisbon. This video can not be played Residents watch on as their homes blaze in Pedrogao Grande The wildfires spread fast on Saturday, and across several fronts There are fears the death toll could rise, as a number of people are still missing. The period of national mourning ends on Tuesday. Emergency service workers were battling 156 fires across the country on Sunday, Prime Minister Costa said, adding that most of the victims had died in just one of them. Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes said that most had died from smoke inhalation and burns, while two were killed in a road accident related to the fires. Thirty bodies were found inside cars, with another 17 next to the vehicles, on one road leading on to the IC8 motorway. Another 11 died in a village next to the motorway. Some of the hundreds of firefighters tackling the blaze were injured More than 50 people were injured More than 1,600 firefighters are fighting five of the main fires, supported by about 400 vehicles and 18 aircraft, Portugal's PÃºblico reports. According to the prime minister, just 11 fires are still active but he said the authorities were ""particularly worried about two of them"". They have sent two army battalions to help the emergency services. As the power went off, the flames hit hard, a fiery red tornado passed the windows. We crouched on the floor for a good hour, trying to breathe, praying, crying. I am not ashamed to say it: I was praying, we were all praying. I am not religious, but at that time, you couldn't do anything else. I said: ""It can't end like this."" I just started crying and got emotional - I was no use to anyone for 20 minutes. Eventually the fire passed and we emerged to see the smouldering remains of the village. Miraculously, our house and the one next door did not burn. The devastation was indescribable. People, bewildered, remains of homes burning uncontrollably, concrete posts exploding over roads. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. After the fire passed, it should still have been bright, but it was dark. There was a strange film over everyone's eyes. You could hear gas canisters exploding, see blue flashes going off. There was just a strange silence. There was a lull, a strange feeling. It then turned to relief, there was crying. Read more from Gareth Roberts, a Brit who survived the fires France has offered three firefighting planes, while Spain has already sent two water-bombing aircraft to help tackle the fires. The European Union has also promised to provide firefighting aircraft. Dozens of people who fled their homes have been taken in by residents of the nearby municipality of Ansiao. Pope Francis, who visited Portugal last month, mentioned the victims in his weekly address: ""I express my closeness to the beloved people of Portugal following the devastating fire."" French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: ""Solidarity with Portugal, hit by terrible fires. Our thoughts are with victims. France makes its aid available to Portugal."" Firefighters pause as the wildfire continues behind them The fires began on Saturday during an intense heatwave and rainless thunderstorms, with temperatures of more than 40C (104F) in some areas. Police say lightning striking a tree may have caused the fire. ""This is a region that has had fires because of its forests, but we cannot remember a tragedy of these proportions,"" Valdemar Alves, the mayor of PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press agency.

"Jeremy Corbyn visited people seeking news of missing loved ones Jeremy Corbyn has reiterated his suggestion that people left homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire could be housed in empty flats, saying the government has the means to seize property. ""Occupy it, compulsory purchase it, requisition it,"" the Labour leader told ITV's Peston on Sunday. At least 58 people are believed to have died and many more are homeless after fire engulfed a London tower block. The government says its staff have been drafted in to help the relief effort. The move comes after the prime minister said the initial official response had ""not been good enough"". Tower tragedy caused by 'years of neglect' Latest updates as fire recovery continuess 'Where is the council?' Mr Corbyn has alreadycalled for the government to requisition properties.Speaking earlier in the week, he said: ""It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and luxury flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live."" And in an interview on ITV on Sunday, Mr Corbyn said the flats could be requisitioned by the government or bought using compulsory purchase orders. ""Occupy it, compulsory purchase it, requisition it - there's a lot of things you can do. ""But can't we as a society just think, it's all very well putting our arms around people during the crisis but homelessness is rising, the housing crisis is getting worse and my point was quite a simple one. ""In an emergency, you have to bring all assets to the table in order to deal with that crisis and that's what I think we should be doing in this case."" He also defended Theresa May, who has been criticised for her own personal response to the fire. ""I think everybody cares to an extent, some to a deeper extent and some show empathy in a different way to others,"" he said. ""But the real issue is not about what we as individuals feel - Theresa May, me, anybody else - it's what those people are going through."" The government says it has embedded a team of civil servants into the council office following widespread criticism of the local council's performance. Other measures outlined by the prime minister following a meeting with residents on Saturday, included more staff covering phone lines and ground staff wearing high-visibility clothing so they could be easily found. Mr Corbyn questioned why it had taken so long for the authorities to help the victims. ""Every day at Heathrow, planes get delayed. Hundreds of people get stranded at airports all over the world,"" he said. ""Hotels are found for them immediately, they are sorted out. Four-hundred-or-so people, still most of them have not got somewhere decent, safe or secure to stay in. ""Somehow or other, it seems to be beyond the wit of the public services to deal with the crisis facing a relatively small number of people in a country of 65 million.""

"Relief efforts at Grenfell Tower ""descended into chaos"" amid reports survivors were being rehoused hundreds of miles away and had failed to receive more than Â£20 from the government's emergency fund, the Times reports. The paper says criticism of ministers' response to the disaster forced them to publish detailed plans about the Â£5m relief fund. The Daily Mail is one of a number of papers to feature an image showing the devastation inside a flat in Grenfell Tower on its front page. The paper quotes a police chief as saying the conditions inside the tower ""verged on the indescribable"". The Metro's front page also has a photo of the gutted remains of a flat inside Grenfell Tower. Under the headline ""Inside hell tower"", it says the images show the flames consumed nearly everything in their path. ""Inside hell"" is the headline on the front of the Daily Mirror, with the paper reporting that the death toll is set to rise. The Financial Times is one of several papers to lead on the Brexit negotiations that begin on Monday, reporting that Philip Hammond is to campaign to put business concerns at the heart of talks. It reports that the chancellor will say the country must leave the EU ""via a slope, not a cliff-edge"", but the paper notes he will also confirm the UK is leaving both the single market and customs union - contrary to the hopes of some business leaders and MPs. European leaders fear the UK could end up with a ""brutal Brexit"" because of the fragility of Theresa May's minority government, the Guardian reports. The leaders are said by the paper to be worried that the government will be unable to negotiate ""viable terms"" on the UK's exit from the EU and maintain a position that does not ""fall apart"". The Daily Express strikes a more upbeat tone, saying ""confidence is high"" ahead of Brexit Secretary David Davis arriving in Brussels for the talks. Meanwhile, Mr Davis has emerged as a ""unity candidate"" to succeed Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party, according to the Daily Telegraph. The paper says he was tipped for the post by allies of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, after Mrs May's position as prime minister was further destabilised when several cabinet ministers failed to offer her long-term support. TV presenter Ant McPartlin is not being allowed to have his phone or receive visitors while in rehab, the Sun reports. McPartlin has checked himself into rehab for a prescription drug and alcohol problem, according to the paper. Declan Donnelly thanked fans for sending message of support to his friend and co-host Ant McPartlin, after it emerged McPartlin had checked himself into rehab, the Daily Star reports.

The personal trainer told the BBC when she announced her pregnancy that her partner is ""just the sweetest and most outgoing person I've ever known"". In May, Miss Oliverposted a black and white image of her holding her bumpand a pair of boots, like the ones Mr Mckeague was wearing when he went missing, alongside a message on Facebook. Miss Oliver and Mr Mckeague dated for five months before he went missing on a night out with friends ""Your daddy would be proud of you my little one and would love you as much as I do,"" she wrote. Mr Mckeague had been out with friends in September when he went missing and was last seen entering a bin loading bay known as the ""horseshoe"" at about 03:25 BST. A waste disposal lorry collected a bin from that area less than an hour after Mr Mckeague was spotted on CCTV. Specialist officers began sifting through waste in March at the landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire, where they believe his body may be. The search so far has cost more than Â£1m. Police initially estimated the search of the vast landfill site could take 10 weeks.

"This video can not be played Brexit Secretary David Davis ""determined optimist"" after day one The EU's chief negotiator said there would be ""substantial"" consequences from Brexit after the first round of talks with the UK. Michel Barnier said he was ""not in the frame of mind to make concessions or ask for concessions"". UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said talks got off to a ""promising start"". The UK appears to have conceded to the EU's preferred order for the talks which will mean trade negotiations do not begin immediately. Brexit: Everything you need to know The key issues in EU/UK talks Business call for market access after Brexit Mr Davis and Mr Barnier gave a joint press conference after day one of the talks in Brussels. The initial focus will be on expat rights, a financial settlement and ""other separation issues"". Discussions aimed at preserving the Good Friday Agreement and common travel area in Ireland will also begin, although Mr Davis suggested these issues may not be settled until the end of the process, when the UK's trade relationship with the EU is settled. The UK had wanted talks on its future relationship with the EU to be considered from the outset, but Mr Barnier said this would only happen once the European Council decided ""sufficient progress has been made"" on the other issues. Mr Davis - who had predicted this would be the ""row of the summer"" - denied suggestions the agreed timetable showed Britain's ""weakness"" and insisted it was ""completely consistent"" with the government's aim of parallel trade and exit talks. ""It's not when it starts it's how it finishes that matters,"" he said. This video can not be played The clock counts down on Brexit negotiations Asked whether he had made any concessions to the UK in return, Mr Barnier said the UK had decided to leave the EU - not the other way around, and each side had to ""assume our responsibility and the consequences of our decisions"". ""I am not in a frame of mind to make concessions, or ask for concessions,"" he said. ""It's not about punishment, it is not about revenge. ""Basically, we are implementing the decision taken by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and unravel 43 years of patiently-built relations. ""I will do all I can to put emotion to one side and stick to the facts, the figures, and the legal basis, and work with the United Kingdom to find an agreement in that frame of mind."" Laura Kuennsberg, BBC political editor It's often compared to a divorce - the UK wanted to talk about who gets the house and the CD collection at the same time as settling who pays for the kids' weddings in 20 years' time. The EU on the other hand have been firm all along that the future arrangements could only be discussed once the terms of the initial split have been agreed. The debate was called ""parallelism versus sequentialism"" and from this afternoon's press conference and the announcement of the procedure it is clear that the UK has lost. Ministers believed they would be able to persuade the EU - the failure to do so has been described as a ""total cave-in"". The discussion was even predicted by Mr Davis as likely to be the ""row of the summer"". The row won't happen because it seems the UK has already given in. Read more from Laura Mr Barnier said a ""fair deal"" was possible ""and far better than no deal"". He promised to work with, not against, the UK. ""We must lift the uncertainty caused by Brexit,"" he said. The two men - who exchanged gifts at the start of the talks - set out the structure for the initial negotiations. There will be one week of negotiations every month. Working groups of ""senior experts"" will be set up to focus on the three main areas. On citizens' rights, which the UK has said should be an immediate priority, Mr Davis said there was ""much common ground"". The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote. Prior to the start of talks, Mr Davis gave his counterpart a first edition of a mountaineering book - a French-language version of Regards vers Annapurna - while Mr Barnier reciprocated with a traditional, hand-carved walking stick from Savoie, complete with leather wrist strap. Who's who in the UK delegation? David Davis: Secretary of State for Exiting The EU Tim Barrow: UK permanent representative to the EU Oliver Robbins: permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting The EU Glynn Williams: director general at the Home Office Mark Bowman: director general, international finance at HM Treasury Simon Case: director general, UK-EU partnership team Alex Ellis: director general at the Department for Exiting the EU Christian Jones: press officer to David Davis The chief negotiators exchanged gifts reflecting their shared passion for hill walking and mountaineering The people who will negotiate Brexit What are the different Brexit options? Scots should be at EU talks says Tory MEP This video can not be played Former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson on Brexit negotiation deals This video can not be played Michael Gove tells Today there is support across the Conservative Party for Theresa May After holding talks with Theresa May in Downing Street, new Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said there must be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and economic borders must be ""invisible"". While he said he regretted Mrs May's decision to leave the single market and customs union, he said the two had a shared objective to minimise disruption to trade after the UK's exit. Earlier former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose, who chaired the Stronger In campaign last year, toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmethat he was reassured that economic considerations were ""top of the pile"" but ministers needed to be realistic with the public. Speaking on the same programme, JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin - one of the leading pro-Leave business voices - said negotiators had to be open to possible compromises but also prepared to walk away and to default to World Trade Organization rules if necessary. ""I don't think many people feel that staying in the single market and customs union and being subject to EU laws is Brexit. ""I think Brexit is parliamentary sovereignty and an assertion of democracy. Outside that, I think there is a quite a lot of scope,"" Mr Martin said. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""real confusion"" about the government's mandate after the general election result.

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond says he was unhappy with the low-key role he was given during the campaign Chancellor Philip Hammond has criticised the way the Conservatives fought the general election campaign, saying there should have been more focus on the economy. Mr Hammond said he was unhappy with the low-key role he was given and that the Tories should have put more effort into ""dismantling"" Labour's plans. He also said the government ""heard a message"" in the election that people were ""weary"" of spending cuts. ""We are not deaf,"" he told the BBC. 10 ways the PM blew her majority Osborne: Don't change course on austerity The chancellor, who has been calling for Brexit talks to prioritise the economy, also warned that leaving the EU without a deal would be ""a very, very bad outcome"". But a deal designed to ""punish"" the UK would be even worse, he said on BBC One's Andrew Marr show. Despite being one of the most senior members of Theresa May's government, Mr Hammond did not play a leading role in the general election campaign, and it was reported that he faced being replaced. ""It's true that my role [in the campaign] was not the one I would have liked it to be,"" he said. He did not comment on his conversations with Mrs May after the election, in which the Conservatives lost their Commons majority. Mr Hammond said the Tories should have focused more on their record of running Britain's finances. ""The end result is that, in my judgement, we did not talk about the economy as much as we should have done."" Asked how long Mrs May had left in Number 10, Mr Hammond replied: ""I think what the country needs now is a period of calm while we get on with the job at hand."" There have been calls for a change in economic strategy since the election, which Labour fought on an anti-austerity platform. The Tories are now relying for support on the Democratic Unionist Party, which is committed to lobbying for extra cash for public services in Northern Ireland. The chancellor said he had already ""created more flexibility"" by loosening George Osborne's deficit-reduction target. He said he understood people were tired of the ""long slog"" of spending cuts, but added: ""We have to live within our means, and more borrowing... is not the solution."" He said ""we have never said we won't raise some taxes"", but added that overall the government wanted to keep them low. The government's plan remained to clear the deficit by the middle of the next Parliament ""in a way that's sensitive to the needs of the economy"", he added. On the eve of the start of formal Brexit negotiations, Mr Hammond gave a strong warning about the implications of the UK leaving the EU without a deal in place. Mrs May has refused to rule out this scenario, saying repeatedly that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". Mr Hammond said having no deal would be ""a very, very bad outcome for Britain"" but added that he would not agree to one that aimed to ""suck the lifeblood out of our economy over a period of time"". Businesses have warned of damaging tariffs being imposed on their products unless new trade arrangements are agreed. Mr Hammond also said the UK would definitely be leaving both the EU single market and the customs union, but must avoid ""cliff edges"". ""It's a statement of common sense that if we are going to radically change the way we work together, we need to get there via a slope, not a cliff edge."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""I think that should be left on the table"" The government has previously said it will not stay in the EU-wide single market, as this would mean accepting the free movement of workers, and it wants a free trade deal to be agreed instead. It also plans to replace its membership of the customs union, which enables tariff-free trading within the EU, with a new arrangement that lets it strike trade deals with the rest of the world. Customs union and single market - what's the difference? Also appearing on the Andrew Marr Show, Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said Britain could not remain a full member of the single market after leaving the EU but argued for keeping customs union membership ""on the table"". He added: ""I think the prime minister has got us into a complete mess. ""She's got no mandate here and she's got no authority abroad and the negotiation starts tomorrow."" If you're in the business of reading tea leaves, you'll have your work cut out in trying to decipher what Philip Hammond actually said today. On the one hand he said that Britain will definitely be quitting the customs union, which will dismay business lobby groups, but the chancellor also hinted that the UK might then want to automatically opt back into Europe's tariff-free trading block. He said that British exporters should experience trade with the EU ""which feels as close as possible to the way it feels now"". Certainly since the general election, employers see a chance for a ""softer"" Brexit than that outlined in the Lancaster House speech in January by Theresa May. For the first time in recent memory all five of the biggest business groups (CBI, BCC, IoD, EEF and FSB) haveco-signed a letterto Business Secretary Greg Clark in effect pushing for all the benefits of EU membership without being a member. Squaring that circle might be the political challenge of our generation.

"Jeremy Corbyn visited people seeking news of missing loved ones Jeremy Corbyn has reiterated his suggestion that people left homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire could be housed in empty flats, saying the government has the means to seize property. ""Occupy it, compulsory purchase it, requisition it,"" the Labour leader told ITV's Peston on Sunday. At least 58 people are believed to have died and many more are homeless after fire engulfed a London tower block. The government says its staff have been drafted in to help the relief effort. The move comes after the prime minister said the initial official response had ""not been good enough"". Tower tragedy caused by 'years of neglect' Latest updates as fire recovery continuess 'Where is the council?' Mr Corbyn has alreadycalled for the government to requisition properties.Speaking earlier in the week, he said: ""It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and luxury flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live."" And in an interview on ITV on Sunday, Mr Corbyn said the flats could be requisitioned by the government or bought using compulsory purchase orders. ""Occupy it, compulsory purchase it, requisition it - there's a lot of things you can do. ""But can't we as a society just think, it's all very well putting our arms around people during the crisis but homelessness is rising, the housing crisis is getting worse and my point was quite a simple one. ""In an emergency, you have to bring all assets to the table in order to deal with that crisis and that's what I think we should be doing in this case."" He also defended Theresa May, who has been criticised for her own personal response to the fire. ""I think everybody cares to an extent, some to a deeper extent and some show empathy in a different way to others,"" he said. ""But the real issue is not about what we as individuals feel - Theresa May, me, anybody else - it's what those people are going through."" The government says it has embedded a team of civil servants into the council office following widespread criticism of the local council's performance. Other measures outlined by the prime minister following a meeting with residents on Saturday, included more staff covering phone lines and ground staff wearing high-visibility clothing so they could be easily found. Mr Corbyn questioned why it had taken so long for the authorities to help the victims. ""Every day at Heathrow, planes get delayed. Hundreds of people get stranded at airports all over the world,"" he said. ""Hotels are found for them immediately, they are sorted out. Four-hundred-or-so people, still most of them have not got somewhere decent, safe or secure to stay in. ""Somehow or other, it seems to be beyond the wit of the public services to deal with the crisis facing a relatively small number of people in a country of 65 million.""

"This video can not be played A fire burns in the forest surrounding the resort Five people were killed when gunmen stormed a tourist resort in Mali on Sunday, officials say. The EU said a Portuguese soldier and a Malian woman who worked for the bloc's mission in Mali were among the dead. A Malian soldier and two other civilians, one Chinese and the other Gabonese, were also killed. An al-Qaeda-linked group said it carried out the attack near the capital Bamako. Mali has been fighting a jihadist insurgency for years. Islamist fighters are roaming the West African country's north and centre. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories World's most dangerous peacekeeping mission ""It is a jihadist attack. Malian special forces intervened and hostages have been released,"" Mali Security Minister Salif Traore told AFP news agency after Sunday's attack. Four assailants were killed by security forces and four others were arrested, he said. ""We have recovered the bodies of two attackers who were killed,"" he said, adding that they were searching for the bodies of two others. One of them left behind a machine gun and bottles filled with ""explosive substances"", he said. The ministry said another two people had been injured. A security ministry spokesman told Reuters news agency that 32 guests had been rescued from the Le Campement Kangaba resort, east of Bamako. Malian special forces intervened, backed by UN soldiers and troops from a French counter-terrorism force. The eco-lodge complex near Bamako is a popular attraction Witness Boubacar Sangare was just outside the compound as the attack unfolded. ""Westerners were fleeing the encampment while two plainclothes police exchanged fire with the assailants,"" he said. ""There were four national police vehicles and French soldiers in armoured vehicles on the scene."" He added that a helicopter was circling overhead. The European Union training mission in Mali, EUTM Mali, tweeted that it was aware of the attack and was supporting Malian security forces and assessing the situation. Earlier this month, the US embassy had warned of ""possible future attacks on Western diplomatic missions, other locations in Bamako that Westerners frequent"". French soldiers stand around a UN vehicle following the attack on Le Campement Kangaba resort BBC correspondent Alex Duval Smith says many expats and wealthy Malians go to Kangaba at weekends, to enjoy the pools, cocktail bar, canoeing facilities and activities for children. A spokesman for the Portuguese armed forces, Helder Antonio da Silva Perdigao, said that the location is used by soldiers in the EUTM Mali as a place to relax between operations. He added that soldiers from several countries were there at the time of the attack. The Portuguese soldier who died was part of the EUTM Mali, he said. In November 2015, at least 20 people were killed whengunmen took guests and staff hostageat the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako. Al-Qaeda's North African arm,Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), said it was behind that siege. Mali has been in a state of emergency since the Radisson Blu attack. It was extended for a further six months in April. The country's security has gradually worsened since 2013, when French forces repelled allied Islamist and Tuareg rebel fighters who had seized control of much of the north.

"The alleged incident took place at John F Kennedy Airport in New York North Korea has accused the US authorities of ""literally mugging"" its diplomats at a New York airport. A spokesman for the secretive state said its officials had been ""robbed"" of a diplomatic package at John F Kennedy Airport on Friday. North Korea's state news agency KCNA said the incident proved the US was a ""lawless gangster state"". The White House - which considers ""solving"" the North Korea crisis a priority - has yet to comment. How did North Korea holiday end in jail, and a coma? What's changed between the US and North Korea? Rodman returns for more 'basketball diplomacy' The North Korean diplomats were reportedly returning from a UN conference on disability rights when the incident - branded by KCNA as an ""illegal and heinous act of provocation"" - took place. ""The international community needs to seriously reconsider whether or not New York, where such an outrageous mugging is rampant, is fit to serve as the venue for international meetings,"" KCNA said. This alleged incident marks the latest addition to a catalogue of increasingly strained tensions between the two countries. Last week, North Korea returned US university studentOtto Warmbierto his family, more than a year after he had been sentenced to 15 years' hard labour. Mr Warmbier was in a coma, showed no understanding of language, and had extensive brain tissue loss. Pyongyang said Mr Warmbier's coma was caused by botulism and a sleeping pill he took after his trial last year. However, US doctors disputed this, while Mr Warmbier's father said: ""Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we don't - there's no excuse for a civilised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care."" North Korea had accused Mr Warmbier - who had been on a tour of the country - of stealing a propaganda sign, claims disputed by those who were with him on the trip.

"The Queen's Speech was last cancelled under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2011 There will be no Queen's Speech next year to give MPs more time to deal with Brexit laws, the government says. Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom said the next parliamentary session was being doubled in length to two years. The unusual move would allow MPs to scrutinise ""substantial amounts of legislation"", she said. This year's Queen's Speech was due on Monday buthas been put off until Wednesdayas Theresa May's minority government seeksa deal with the DUP. The Queen's Speech traditionally takes place during the ceremonial State Opening Of Parliament, setting out the government's proposed legal programme for the coming year. The last time it was cancelled was in 2011 by the then Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. That decision, the first time it had been taken since 1949, was criticised at the time by Labour as an ""abuse of power"" aimed solely at easing the passage of controversial legislation. Announcing the scrapping of the 2018 event, Mrs Leadsom said the European Union exit legislation would begin with the ""Great Repeal Bill"". Andrea Leadsom said a heavy legislative workload meant that the next parliamentary session would last two years, rather than one She said: ""We will build the broadest possible consensus for our Brexit plans, and that means giving Parliament the maximum amount of time to scrutinise these bills by holding a two-year session of Parliament. ""It will mean we can work together to deliver a successful Brexit deal and a strong social legislative programme that delivers justice and opportunity to everyone."" The government also wanted to pass ""a domestic agenda which aims to tackle the social injustices in our country"", she added. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics, she insisted the move was not motivated by fears the 2018 Queen's Speech could have been defeated by MPs. ""That is absolutely not the reason for doing this,"" she said. ""The issue is that we have an enormous job to do to make a success of Brexit."" At the heart of the legislation needed for Brexit is the so-called Great Repeal Bill, which will convert existing EU law into UK legislation. Ministers will then decide which parts to keep, and have promised that all existing workplace protections will be maintained. Following the general election, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the bill would now become ""history"" - and that there would be ""something different"" in a few weeks' time. But asked whether Labour would support the bill in the Commons, Sir Keir Starmer, Labour's Brexit spokesman, told the Andrew Marr Show: ""We haven't seen it yet. The principle of entrenching EU rights and freedoms is one that we would support.""

"This video can not be played Gareth Roberts: 'You could hear the roar of the fire coming... we just sat and waited to die' A wildfire in central Portugal, apparently started by a lightning strike in dry conditions, has claimed dozens of lives. One of those lucky to survive was Gareth Roberts, 36, who is originally from Colne in Lancashire but who has lived in central Portugal for the past four years. He told the BBC his story. We were driving back from holiday in Cadiz in Spain and were about 50 minutes from home - we'd known about the fire for a few hours, we could see the plume of smoke. We'd driven through a thunderstorm and when that cleared, you could see the smoke. I thought it looked quite bad, but I had no idea until we got nearer. We found ourselves stranded in a village called MÃ³ Grande, just off of the IC8 motorway; ourselves and others were directed there by an officer from the IC8. As we drove up the mountain road you could see the flames jumping across from one side of the valley to the other. The accompanying wind threw branches at the car but you couldn't stop, you could feel the heat. Gareth Roberts praised ""the most amazing acts of humanity"" by strangers Gareth Roberts captured this image of fire looming over Portugal as he sought shelter Eventually we reached the small village at a crossroads surrounded by fire. Locals and ourselves were crying, overwhelmed by the heat and speed of the fire. It was dark, so dark, among the flames. A man shouted for us to come and take refuge in his home, along with his mother. Several of us did. His mum had an annex flat downstairs, where it was cooler and out of the way of the fire. During the time there, more people were arriving, knocking on the door, people just congregated where there were signs of life. The guy's mum poured us wine, and it would have been pleasant if it wasn't for the circumstances. When I had got to the village I messaged my parents to tell them: ""I am in a village, fire is all around, this is the end."" But when I got to the house, there was no network, so I thought: ""The last thing I told my parents was that I was dying."" In pictures: Portugal forest fire Most of the victims died in or near their cars around Pedrogao Grande As the power went off, the flames hit hard, a fiery red tornado passed the windows. We crouched on the floor for a good hour, trying to breathe, praying, crying. I am not ashamed to say it: I was praying, we were all praying. I am not religious, but at that time, you couldn't do anything else. I said: ""It can't end like this."" I just started crying and got emotional - I was no use to anyone for 20 minutes. Eventually the fire passed and we emerged to see the smouldering remains of the village. Miraculously, our house and the one next door did not burn. The devastation was indescribable. People, bewildered, remains of homes burning uncontrollably, concrete posts exploding over roads. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. After the fire passed, it should still have been bright, but it was dark. There was a strange film over everyone's eyes. You could hear gas canisters exploding, see blue flashes going off. There was just a strange silence. There was a lull, a strange feeling. It then turned to relief, there was crying. Three days of mourning in Portugal Efforts to fight the fire continued well into Sunday as the death toll rose The prime minister called it ""the greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years"" At this point, there hadn't been help from anyone with the authorities. All the help was from the locals, without phone calls being made and without internet, just the way it had always been done. If those people hadn't shown their generosity, we would not be here today. There have been so many examples of the most amazing acts of humanity. I said thank you to them for saving my life. But a small 'thank you' is nowhere near enough. We could have died. We should have died. A random act of kindness last night saved our lives and now all we can do is pray for Portugal. After the fire, Gareth travelled to the town of Tomar, where he remains in a hotel. The fire has prevented him from travelling home, but he hopes to return in the coming days. He also hopes to return to Mo Grande to thank the family that saved his life.

"The latest incident comes a week after a hole was found in the engine of this China Eastern Airlines plane At least 26 people were injured, four seriously, when turbulence hit a China Eastern Airlines flight from Paris on Sunday, state media reports. The turbulence struck as flight MU774 was on its way to Kunming, in the southern Yunnan province. Passengers suffered broken bones, cuts to the scalp and soft tissue injuries, the Xinhua state news agency reported. China Eastern Airlines later said it was crucial passengers wear seatbelts as flights descend. ""I was on the flight, and I felt like I would not survive,"" the Hong Kong- based South China Morning Post quoted one passenger as saying on the Weibo microblogging site. ""Many people were injured, and among them, many had not buckled up."" Xinhua said (in Chinese),externalthat two violent bumps and many small bumps occurred over about 10 minutes. It said that during the turbulence, several passengers' heads and shoulders collided with the luggage racks, some luggage racks broke from the impact, and some luggage fell off the racks and hit customers. The airline said on itsWeibo account (in Chinese),externalthat the Airbus A330, that had taken off from Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, landed safely in Kunming.

"This video can not be played Residents watch on as their homes blaze in Pedrogao Grande A catastrophic forest fire in Portugal has claimed at least 62 lives, including four children, officials say. Most died while trying to flee the PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande area, 50 km (30 miles) south-east of Coimbra, in their cars, according to the government. Hundreds of firefighters are continuing to tackle the blaze, which has spread across several fronts. Prime Minister Antonio Costa called it ""the greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years in terms of forest fires"". The death toll could rise further as many people remain missing, he warned. The authorities have declared three days of national mourning, starting on Sunday. Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes said that the majority of the victims died from smoke inhalation and burns, while two died in a road accident related to the fires. He earlier said 30 bodies were found inside cars, with another 17 next to the vehicles, on one road leading on to the IC8 motorway. Another 11 died in a village next to the motorway. Media in Portugal say the fire is no closer to being contained despite hundreds of firefighters and 300 vehicles working to put it out. Among the dozens of people injured was an eight-year-old girl with burns found wandering alone close to the fire, the Correio do ManhÃ£ newspaper reported. In pictures: Portugal forest fire Six firefighters are seriously wounded, national broadcaster RTP said, and two who went missing overnight turned up injured. The Correio do ManhÃ£ warned that many areas hit by the fire had not yet been reached by authorities, so the death toll was likely to increase. A number of houses near PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande have been destroyed The search for victims of the fire has continued into Sunday About 60 forest fires broke out across the country overnight, with close to 1,700 firefighters battling them across Portugal. The flames spread ""with great violence"" on four fronts near PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, Mr Gomes said. Spain has sent two water-bombing planes to help tackle the fires, and the European Union is co-ordinating an international firefighting and relief effort. It is not yet known what caused the fire, however Mr Costa said thunderstorms could have been one possible cause. Firefighters pause as the wildfire continues behind them Portugal has been experiencing a heatwave, with temperatures of more than 40C (104F) in some areas. ""This is a region that has had fires because of its forests, but we cannot remember a tragedy of these proportions,"" Valdemar Alves, the mayor of PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press agency. ""I am completely stunned by the number of deaths."" We have had large-scale fires before over the past couple of decades - this year is not unusual in that respect - but it is certainly unusual to have so many fatalities in one place. Portuguese officials are visibly shocked. There were very particular circumstances with the lightning strikes here - this fire started with a dry lightning strike. There has been rainfall elsewhere but there was no rain there, and this is a heavily-forested area. Getting it under control depends not only on temperatures, which do seem as though they will be high, but on the wind above all. It is very much in the hands of Mother Nature.

"Fandino, pictured here in Seville in 2015, had been injured by a bull before A Spanish bullfighter has died after being gored during a festival in southwest France. Ivan Fandino, 36, caught his feet in his cloak and fell to the floor, where he was gored by the bull. He suffered a lung injury and died on his way to hospital from a heart attack on Saturday, French media say. Fandino, who was taking part in the Aire-sur-l'Adour bullfighting festival near Pau, is reportedly the first matador to die in France in a century. The Basque-born matador had already taken part in a competition earlier in the day before he was injured. Photographs showed he was conscious, but bleeding heavily, as he was led away from the ring. Last July, bullfighter Victor Barrio, 29, became the first matador to die in Spain in 30 yearsafter he was goredduring an event being aired live on television. France's Sud-Ouest newspaper said the last matador fatality in France was in 1921, when Isidoro Mari Fernando died in the arena in BÃ©ziers. Fandino was thrown in the air by a bull in Pamplona in 2015 Fandino had been injured at least twice in previous events - once in 2015, when thrown into the air by a bull in Pamplona, Spain, but more seriously the year before when he was knocked unconscious in Bayonne, France. Opponents describe the blood-soaked pageants as barbaric, while fans say the tradition is an ancient art form deeply rooted in national history. Bullfighting was declared legal in France in 2012 after the Constitutional Council rejected a plea from animal rights campaigners to ban the practice. More than 1,000 bulls are killed annually in French bullfights, the AFP news agency reported at the time. Although bullfighting originated in neighbouring Spain, it took root in France a century and a half ago. Fights - known as corridas in Spain - are especially popular in the Nimes and Arles areas.

"Government staff have been drafted in to bolster the official response to the Grenfell Tower disaster in west London. The move follows widespread criticism of the local council's performance. Residents condemned the relief effort as ""absolute chaos"" and complained that Kensington and Chelsea Council had provided little support or information. Councils across London are now involved in the operation, with humanitarian assistance being provided by the west London borough of Ealing. Kensington and Chelsea Council said it would cooperate ""in full"" with the government's inquiry into the fire, in which at least 58 people are believed to have died. Latest updates as fire recovery continues 'Where is the council?' 'Outrageous' lack of help for victims What we know so far Who are the victims?

The BBC understands the death toll could rise to about 70 people in total. As part of the new move by the government, a team of civil servants has been embedded into the council office. Other measures outlined by the prime minister following a meeting with residents on Saturday, included more staff covering phone lines and ground staff wearing high-visibility clothing so they could be easily found. The residents here are now telling us the volunteers are at breaking point. There are expected to be government civil servants down here, on the ground, helping out. Whether they are in hi-vis jackets or whether they are meant to be replacing the volunteers, there has been no sign of them so far. I've been speaking to residents, speaking to people who've been here all morning, I've been speaking to the police and they haven't noticed a change yet. The Home Office said it wasmaking arrangementsfor the family of civil engineeringMohammed Alhajali, who died in the fire, to travel from Syria to the UK for his funeral. Questions continue to be asked about why the fire spread so quickly, with some suggesting new cladding fitted during a recent refurbishment could have been to blame. Chancellor Philip Hammond said a criminal investigation would examine whether building regulations had been breached when the block was overhauled. The public inquiry set up by the government following the tragedy would also examine if rules had been broken, he told BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mohammed Alhajali became separated from his brother as they tried to escape Asked whether the government had revised building regulations, as recommended by a coroner, following another deadly fire in south London tower block in 2009, Mr Hammond said thegovernment had responded""correctly and appropriately"" to the recommendations. He said if the public inquiry found something needed to be done to make buildings safe, it would be done, he added. Asked about his council's poor response, leader Nicholas Paget-Brown said staff were ""working closely"" with the government, charities, volunteer and resident groups and the emergency services to help re-house and assist those affected. ""People rightly have questions about the causes of the fire and why it spread so quickly and these will be answered,"" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told ITV's Peston on Sunday that the council seemed to ""lack the resources to deal with a crisis of this magnitude"", despite being the country's ""wealthiest borough"". Meanwhile, Labour MP David Lammy, whose friend Khadija Saye is among the dead, has called for urgent action to make sure all documents relating to the refurbishment and management of the Grenfell Tower fire are protected. After speaking to residents, he said: ""Suspicion of a cover-up is rising. ""We need to make sure that the emails, minutes of meetings, correspondence with contractors, safety assessments, specifications and reports are not destroyed,"" he added. Theresa May has also come in for a barrage of criticism over her own response to the disaster. On Friday, she was jeered on a visit to the North Kensington estate, and protesters marching on Friday and Saturday called for her resignation. First Secretary of State Damian Green defended the prime minister, saying she was as ""distraught as we all are"".

It tore through all floors of the building and took more than 200 firefighters 24 hours to bring under control. Two neighbouring Tube lines are partly suspended until 14:00 BST on Sunday amid safety concerns of debris falling on to the tracks. The Hammersmith and City Line has been suspended between Edgware Road and Hammersmith, and the Circle Line is also closed, Transport for London said.

"Diane Abbott made several stumbling performances during election interviews Diane Abbott has returned to her role of shadow home secretary after diabetes led to her missing the end of the general election campaign. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his close ally was back in the shadow cabinet after suffering ""a great deal"". Ms Abbott was briefly replaced by Lyn Brown and later revealed she had been diagnosed with the condition in 2015. Mr Corbyn told ITV'sPeston on Sunday,externalshe was ""getting all the support necessary"". During the election campaign, Ms Abbott faced criticism for her performance after she stumbled several times during interviews and appeared unable to give detailed answers. In one interview with LBC Radio, she mistakenly said plans to boost police numbers by 10,000 would cost Â£300,000. It led to a barrage of criticism from the Conservatives who said she could not ""add up"". She also pulled out of an interview with BBC's Woman's Hour with just a few minutes' notice as unconfirmed reports circulated that some in the party leadership had lost confidence in her. Just 48 hours before polling day, Labour said Ms Abbott was taking a period of sick leave and would be replaced ""indefinitely"" by Lyn Brown. Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn are close political allies After the election shetold the Guardian,externalher condition was ""out of control"" during the campaign. The Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP,who increased her majority in the June 8 election, said she struggled after facing six or seven interviews in a row without eating enough food - vital to managing her blood sugar levels. Mr Corbyn said: ""Diane suffers from type 2 diabetes and suffered a great deal during the latter part of the election campaign.

"Ken and Margaret Harris have two children, Alan and Ann One of Britain's longest married couples have been reunited to enjoy their 80th wedding anniversary. Ken Harris, 102, celebrated with wife Margaret, 99, after being parted for the first time since the war. Mr Harris feared he would never again see his beloved wife after he went into hospital with a broken hip. But the couple, who were married in 1937, have been reunited again at a nursing home in Llangynidr, near Crickhowell, in Powys. ""They hold hands every day now because of the memory of being separated in the war,"" said daughter-in-law Pat Harris, 75. Ken Harris has kept a wedding day picture of him and Margaret in his wallet Mr Harris, who has carried a photograph of their wedding day in his wallet since, was deployed to Burma in World War Two with the South Wales Borderers. The couple from Llanhilleth, near Newbridge, who have two children, Alan and Ann, have spent every day together since. That was until Mrs Harris was moved into a care home after being diagnosed with dementia. The former butcher was then admitted to hospital after breaking his hip in a fall just six weeks before their 80th anniversary and believed it would be the last time he would see his wife. Ken and Margaret Harris celebrated their oak anniversary at their Powys nursing home But after spending a month in hospital, Mr Harris was given the all clear to leave and was found a room in the same care home as his wife in the Brecon Beacons. ""Ken went to war and Margaret stayed home working as a doctor's secretary but he always had her photo in his wallet,"" added Mrs Harris. ""When Ken went into hospital he didn't think he would ever see her again. It is so fortunate that a room became available at Margaret's home. ""It has been a real battle trying to keep them together. Ken gave his life for his country and he deserves to be able to be with his wife.

"This video can not be played Residents watch on as their homes blaze in Pedrogao Grande A catastrophic forest fire in Portugal has claimed at least 62 lives, including four children, officials say. Most died while trying to flee the PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande area, 50 km (30 miles) south-east of Coimbra, in their cars, according to the government. Hundreds of firefighters are continuing to tackle the blaze, which has spread across several fronts. Prime Minister Antonio Costa called it ""the greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years in terms of forest fires"". The death toll could rise further as many people remain missing, he warned. The authorities have declared three days of national mourning, starting on Sunday. Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes said that the majority of the victims died from smoke inhalation and burns, while two died in a road accident related to the fires. He earlier said 30 bodies were found inside cars, with another 17 next to the vehicles, on one road leading on to the IC8 motorway. Another 11 died in a village next to the motorway. Media in Portugal say the fire is no closer to being contained despite hundreds of firefighters and 300 vehicles working to put it out. Among the dozens of people injured was an eight-year-old girl with burns found wandering alone close to the fire, the Correio do ManhÃ£ newspaper reported. In pictures: Portugal forest fire Six firefighters are seriously wounded, national broadcaster RTP said, and two who went missing overnight turned up injured. The Correio do ManhÃ£ warned that many areas hit by the fire had not yet been reached by authorities, so the death toll was likely to increase. A number of houses near PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande have been destroyed The search for victims of the fire has continued into Sunday About 60 forest fires broke out across the country overnight, with close to 1,700 firefighters battling them across Portugal. The flames spread ""with great violence"" on four fronts near PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, Mr Gomes said. Spain has sent two water-bombing planes to help tackle the fires, and the European Union is co-ordinating an international firefighting and relief effort. It is not yet known what caused the fire, however Mr Costa said thunderstorms could have been one possible cause. Firefighters pause as the wildfire continues behind them Portugal has been experiencing a heatwave, with temperatures of more than 40C (104F) in some areas. ""This is a region that has had fires because of its forests, but we cannot remember a tragedy of these proportions,"" Valdemar Alves, the mayor of PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press agency. ""I am completely stunned by the number of deaths."" We have had large-scale fires before over the past couple of decades - this year is not unusual in that respect - but it is certainly unusual to have so many fatalities in one place. Portuguese officials are visibly shocked. There were very particular circumstances with the lightning strikes here - this fire started with a dry lightning strike. There has been rainfall elsewhere but there was no rain there, and this is a heavily-forested area. Getting it under control depends not only on temperatures, which do seem as though they will be high, but on the wind above all. It is very much in the hands of Mother Nature.

"This video can not be played Victim's brother recounts final call: ""He said: 'Why did you leave me?'."" Arrangements will be made for the family of one of those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire to travel from Syria to the UK for his funeral, the Home Office has said. Mohammed Alhajali, who was 23, was the first victim to be named. The Syrian refugee came to the UK in 2014 and studied civil engineering. A total of 58 people are known to be dead or missing, presumed dead, after the fire. The BBC understands this could rise to about 70 people in total. Mr Alhajali's older brother Omar - who was with him in their flat on the 14th floor - survived after they were separated on the way out of the burning tower block. A friend of Mr Alhajali, Randa El-Daouk, told the Andrew Marr programme that her friend was ""loved by all of us"". Tower fire questions 'will be answered' Relative cites 'lack of co-ordination' 'Outrageous' lack of help for victims What we know so far Who are the victims? A petition for his parents to be allowed to come to the UK has more than 80,000 signatures. The petition was set up by family friend Mirna Suleiman, 26, who had been ringing around numerous hospitals, rest centres and the casualty helpline searching for Mr Alhajali, before discovering that he had died. ""My mum told me and I just burst in to tears. Even though I didn't know him it was so difficult to bear the news,"" she said. Ms Suleiman said she started the campaign because, as someone with Syrian family herself, she knew how difficult it was to obtain a visa for visits. The proportion of visa applications for visits to the UK from Syria that are rejected has risen since the country's civil war began in 2011. But the Home Office has suggested Mr Alhajali's family will be able to come to the UK on compassionate grounds. ""Mohammed undertook a dangerous journey to flee war and death in Syria, only to meet it here in the UK,  in his own home,"" the Syrian Solidarity Campaign said in a statement. ""His dream was to be able to go back home one day and rebuild Syria."" A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""We have established processes in place which allow us to consider visa applications outside the immigration rules on compassionate grounds. ""We are in contact with Mr Alhajali's family and will offer any assistance we can to help them obtain the necessary travel documents they will require in these terribly sad circumstances."" Ms Suleiman said she was happy with the outcome, but added: ""It shouldn't reach a point where people are dying [before] we can allow families to be reunited with one another.""

"This video can not be played USS Fitzgerald damaged by the crash Sailors missing after the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off Japan have been found dead, the US Navy and Japanese media says. Seven sailors were left missing and three injured after Saturday's collision, which the US Navy said almost sank the destroyer. The US Navy said rescue workers found the bodies on Sunday after gaining access to damaged parts of the ship. It said they will be taken to a Japanese hospital to be identified. The incident reportedly took place some 56 nautical miles (104km) south-west of the Japanese port city of Yokosuka, at about 02:30 local time on Saturday (17:30 GMT Friday). Japanese broadcaster NHK said the collision led to the flooding of the crew's sleeping quarters while they were asleep. USS Fitzgerald crash: In pictures ""The damage was significant,"" 7th Fleet commander Vice-Admiral Joseph P Aucoin said. ""There was a big gash under the water."" Repairs would take some time to complete, he said. At a press conference in Japan on Sunday, Vice Adm Aucoin would not confirm how many remains had been found so far. Families of the sailors are being notified, he said. ""This loss is something we all feel,"" he said. The collision left a huge gash down the right-hand side of the ship Marine traffic records suggest the ACX Crystal, a 222-metre (730ft) Filipino-flagged container ship, made a sudden U-turn roughly 25 minutes before the crash. It is not known why it changed course. Similar records for the USS Fitzgerald are not publicly available. The Navy ship's starboard side was heavily damaged in the collision, but the vessel later managed to slowly return to its base in Yokosuka, with the assistance of US navy tug boats. The ACX Crystal appeared to make a U-turn before the collision, before rapidly adjusting course and setting off to Tokyo Japan's coastguard said the ACX Crystal had a gross tonnage of just under 30,000, about three times that of the USS Fitzgerald. It sustained lighter damage to its port bow. The Associated Press agency said there were no injuries reported among the 20 Filipino crew members on board the ACX Crystal. It remains at port in Tokyo.

"Government staff have been drafted in to bolster the official response to the Grenfell Tower disaster in west London. The move follows widespread criticism of the local council's performance. Residents condemned the relief effort as ""absolute chaos"" and complained that Kensington and Chelsea Council had provided little support or information. Councils across London are now involved in the operation, with humanitarian assistance being provided by the west London borough of Ealing. Kensington and Chelsea Council said it would cooperate ""in full"" with the government's inquiry into the fire, in which at least 58 people are believed to have died. Latest updates as fire recovery continues 'Where is the council?' 'Outrageous' lack of help for victims What we know so far Who are the victims? Many have been left homeless by the massive fire that engulfed the 24-storey block of flats on Wednesday. Police fear the number of the dead could increase. The BBC understands the death toll could rise to about 70 people in total. As part of the new move by the government, a team of civil servants has been embedded into the council office. Other measures outlined by the prime minister following a meeting with residents on Saturday, included more staff covering phone lines and ground staff wearing high-visibility clothing so they could be easily found. The residents here are now telling us the volunteers are at breaking point. There are expected to be government civil servants down here, on the ground, helping out. Whether they are in hi-vis jackets or whether they are meant to be replacing the volunteers, there has been no sign of them so far. I've been speaking to residents, speaking to people who've been here all morning, I've been speaking to the police and they haven't noticed a change yet. The Home Office said it wasmaking arrangementsfor the family of civil engineeringMohammed Alhajali, who died in the fire, to travel from Syria to the UK for his funeral. Questions continue to be asked about why the fire spread so quickly, with some suggesting new cladding fitted during a recent refurbishment could have been to blame. Chancellor Philip Hammond said a criminal investigation would examine whether building regulations had been breached when the block was overhauled. The public inquiry set up by the government following the tragedy would also examine if rules had been broken, he told BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mohammed Alhajali became separated from his brother as they tried to escape Asked whether the government had revised building regulations, as recommended by a coroner, following another deadly fire in south London tower block in 2009, Mr Hammond said thegovernment had responded""correctly and appropriately"" to the recommendations. He said if the public inquiry found something needed to be done to make buildings safe, it would be done, he added. Asked about his council's poor response, leader Nicholas Paget-Brown said staff were ""working closely"" with the government, charities, volunteer and resident groups and the emergency services to help re-house and assist those affected. ""People rightly have questions about the causes of the fire and why it spread so quickly and these will be answered,"" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told ITV's Peston on Sunday that the council seemed to ""lack the resources to deal with a crisis of this magnitude"", despite being the country's ""wealthiest borough"". Meanwhile, Labour MP David Lammy, whose friend Khadija Saye is among the dead, has called for urgent action to make sure all documents relating to the refurbishment and management of the Grenfell Tower fire are protected. After speaking to residents, he said: ""Suspicion of a cover-up is rising. ""We need to make sure that the emails, minutes of meetings, correspondence with contractors, safety assessments, specifications and reports are not destroyed,"" he added. Theresa May has also come in for a barrage of criticism over her own response to the disaster.

"This video can not be played Residents watch on as their homes blaze in Pedrogao Grande A catastrophic forest fire in Portugal has claimed at least 62 lives, including four children, officials say. Most died while trying to flee the PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande area, 50 km (30 miles) south-east of Coimbra, in their cars, according to the government. Hundreds of firefighters are continuing to tackle the blaze, which has spread across several fronts. Prime Minister Antonio Costa called it ""the greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years in terms of forest fires"". The death toll could rise further as many people remain missing, he warned. The authorities have declared three days of national mourning, starting on Sunday. Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes said that the majority of the victims died from smoke inhalation and burns, while two died in a road accident related to the fires. He earlier said 30 bodies were found inside cars, with another 17 next to the vehicles, on one road leading on to the IC8 motorway. Another 11 died in a village next to the motorway. Media in Portugal say the fire is no closer to being contained despite hundreds of firefighters and 300 vehicles working to put it out. Among the dozens of people injured was an eight-year-old girl with burns found wandering alone close to the fire, the Correio do ManhÃ£ newspaper reported. In pictures: Portugal forest fire Six firefighters are seriously wounded, national broadcaster RTP said, and two who went missing overnight turned up injured. The Correio do ManhÃ£ warned that many areas hit by the fire had not yet been reached by authorities, so the death toll was likely to increase. A number of houses near PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande have been destroyed The search for victims of the fire has continued into Sunday About 60 forest fires broke out across the country overnight, with close to 1,700 firefighters battling them across Portugal. The flames spread ""with great violence"" on four fronts near PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, Mr Gomes said. Spain has sent two water-bombing planes to help tackle the fires, and the European Union is co-ordinating an international firefighting and relief effort. It is not yet known what caused the fire, however Mr Costa said thunderstorms could have been one possible cause. Firefighters pause as the wildfire continues behind them Portugal has been experiencing a heatwave, with temperatures of more than 40C (104F) in some areas. ""This is a region that has had fires because of its forests, but we cannot remember a tragedy of these proportions,"" Valdemar Alves, the mayor of PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press agency. ""I am completely stunned by the number of deaths."" We have had large-scale fires before over the past couple of decades - this year is not unusual in that respect - but it is certainly unusual to have so many fatalities in one place. Portuguese officials are visibly shocked. There were very particular circumstances with the lightning strikes here - this fire started with a dry lightning strike. There has been rainfall elsewhere but there was no rain there, and this is a heavily-forested area. Getting it under control depends not only on temperatures, which do seem as though they will be high, but on the wind above all. It is very much in the hands of Mother Nature.

"The Hokule'a was built in the 1970s A traditional Polynesian voyaging canoe has returned to Honolulu in Hawaii, completing the first-ever round-the-world trip by such a vessel. The boat, the Hokule'a, took three years to journey around the globe. Its crew navigated without modern instruments, using only the stars, wind and ocean swells as guides. They aimed to use the same techniques that brought the first Polynesian settlers to Hawaii hundreds of years ago. Hokule'a means Star of Gladness Hawaii celebrated the Hokule'a's homecoming on Honolulu's Magic Island peninsula on Saturday. Built in the 1970s, it has travelled around 40,000 nautical miles (74,000km) on this latest trip, known as the Malama Honua voyage, meaning ""to care for our Island Earth"". Its aim has been to spread a message about ocean conservation, sustainability and protecting indigenous culture. The boat had a crew of 12 or 13 people at a time ""Hokule'a has sparked a reawakening of Hawaiian culture, language, identity and revitalized voyaging and navigation traditions throughout the Pacific Ocean,"" said the voyage organisers ontheir website,external. Naalehu Anthony, crewmember and chief executive director of Hawaiian media company Oiwi TV which documented the trip, toldHawaii Public Radio,externalthat wherever they docked, people greeted them with a Hawaiian ""Aloha"" greeting. ""One of the things I really admire about the voyage, looking back on it, is that we always asked the first nations peoples from these different places for permission to come. We never said we are coming. We said, would it be OK for us to come and honour the native people of this place,"" he said. The voyage, he added, had been an ""opportunity to celebrate native knowledge and look at ways that we are more common than we are different"".

"Government staff have been drafted in to bolster the official response to the Grenfell Tower disaster in west London. The move follows widespread criticism of the local council's performance. Residents condemned the relief effort as ""absolute chaos"" and complained that Kensington and Chelsea Council had provided little support or information. Councils across London are now involved in the operation, with humanitarian assistance being provided by the west London borough of Ealing. Kensington and Chelsea Council said it would cooperate ""in full"" with the government's inquiry into the fire, in which at least 58 people are believed to have died. Latest updates as fire recovery continues 'Where is the council?' 'Outrageous' lack of help for victims What we know so far Who are the victims? Many have been left homeless by the massive fire that engulfed the 24-storey block of flats on Wednesday. Police fear the number of the dead could increase. The BBC understands the death toll could rise to about 70 people in total. As part of the new move by the government, a team of civil servants has been embedded into the council office. Other measures outlined by the prime minister following a meeting with residents on Saturday, included more staff covering phone lines and ground staff wearing high-visibility clothing so they could be easily found. The residents here are now telling us the volunteers are at breaking point. There are expected to be government civil servants down here, on the ground, helping out. Whether they are in hi-vis jackets or whether they are meant to be replacing the volunteers, there has been no sign of them so far. I've been speaking to residents, speaking to people who've been here all morning, I've been speaking to the police and they haven't noticed a change yet. The Home Office said it wasmaking arrangementsfor the family of civil engineeringMohammed Alhajali, who died in the fire, to travel from Syria to the UK for his funeral. Questions continue to be asked about why the fire spread so quickly, with some suggesting new cladding fitted during a recent refurbishment could have been to blame. Chancellor Philip Hammond said a criminal investigation would examine whether building regulations had been breached when the block was overhauled. The public inquiry set up by the government following the tragedy would also examine if rules had been broken, he told BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mohammed Alhajali became separated from his brother as they tried to escape Asked whether the government had revised building regulations, as recommended by a coroner, following another deadly fire in south London tower block in 2009, Mr Hammond said thegovernment had responded""correctly and appropriately"" to the recommendations. He said if the public inquiry found something needed to be done to make buildings safe, it would be done, he added. Asked about his council's poor response, leader Nicholas Paget-Brown said staff were ""working closely"" with the government, charities, volunteer and resident groups and the emergency services to help re-house and assist those affected. ""People rightly have questions about the causes of the fire and why it spread so quickly and these will be answered,"" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told ITV's Peston on Sunday that the council seemed to ""lack the resources to deal with a crisis of this magnitude"", despite being the country's ""wealthiest borough"". Meanwhile, Labour MP David Lammy, whose friend Khadija Saye is among the dead, has called for urgent action to make sure all documents relating to the refurbishment and management of the Grenfell Tower fire are protected. After speaking to residents, he said: ""Suspicion of a cover-up is rising. ""We need to make sure that the emails, minutes of meetings, correspondence with contractors, safety assessments, specifications and reports are not destroyed,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Residents watch on as their homes blaze in Pedrogao Grande A catastrophic forest fire in Portugal has claimed at least 62 lives, including four children, officials say. Most died while trying to flee the PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande area, 50 km (30 miles) south-east of Coimbra, in their cars, according to the government. Hundreds of firefighters are continuing to tackle the blaze, which has spread across several fronts. Prime Minister Antonio Costa called it ""the greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years in terms of forest fires"". The death toll could rise further as many people remain missing, he warned. The authorities have declared three days of national mourning, starting on Sunday. Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes said that the majority of the victims died from smoke inhalation and burns, while two died in a road accident related to the fires. He earlier said 30 bodies were found inside cars, with another 17 next to the vehicles, on one road leading on to the IC8 motorway. Another 11 died in a village next to the motorway. Media in Portugal say the fire is no closer to being contained despite hundreds of firefighters and 300 vehicles working to put it out. Among the dozens of people injured was an eight-year-old girl with burns found wandering alone close to the fire, the Correio do ManhÃ£ newspaper reported. In pictures: Portugal forest fire Six firefighters are seriously wounded, national broadcaster RTP said, and two who went missing overnight turned up injured. The Correio do ManhÃ£ warned that many areas hit by the fire had not yet been reached by authorities, so the death toll was likely to increase. A number of houses near PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande have been destroyed The search for victims of the fire has continued into Sunday About 60 forest fires broke out across the country overnight, with close to 1,700 firefighters battling them across Portugal. The flames spread ""with great violence"" on four fronts near PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, Mr Gomes said. Spain has sent two water-bombing planes to help tackle the fires, and the European Union is co-ordinating an international firefighting and relief effort. It is not yet known what caused the fire, however Mr Costa said thunderstorms could have been one possible cause. Firefighters pause as the wildfire continues behind them Portugal has been experiencing a heatwave, with temperatures of more than 40C (104F) in some areas. ""This is a region that has had fires because of its forests, but we cannot remember a tragedy of these proportions,"" Valdemar Alves, the mayor of PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press agency. ""I am completely stunned by the number of deaths."" We have had large-scale fires before over the past couple of decades - this year is not unusual in that respect - but it is certainly unusual to have so many fatalities in one place. Portuguese officials are visibly shocked. There were very particular circumstances with the lightning strikes here - this fire started with a dry lightning strike. There has been rainfall elsewhere but there was no rain there, and this is a heavily-forested area. Getting it under control depends not only on temperatures, which do seem as though they will be high, but on the wind above all. It is very much in the hands of Mother Nature.

"Craig and Charlie are celebrating 30 years since their first album was released Edinburgh twins Craig and Charlie Reid turned the pop world upside down with the release of The Proclaimers' first album - This is the Story - in 1987. At a time when image was king, they burst onto the scene in glasses and scruffy jackets, belting out acoustic tunes in a broad Scottish accent. A BBC Scotland documentary is looking back on their remarkable 30-year career.` This is the story of an enduring Scottish music phenomenon: Proclaimer Craig Reid says the twins saw Dexy's Midnight Runners in 1980, when they were 18. He says: ""They came on stage and it was not something we were expecting. It was like being hit by a truck. It was breathtaking how good they were and how unusual they were."" The band's charismatic frontman Kevin Rowland became a good friend of the twins. He says: ""They were very political. They were very vocal. You couldn't win an argument with them, because there were two of them."" Paul Heaton says The Proclaimers were brilliant live Kevin Rowland helped The Proclaimers make a demo which found its way to The Housemartins, another popular 80s band famous for being outside the pop orthodoxy. The Housemartins invited The Proclaimers to tour with them in 1986. Charlie Reid says: ""The first gig was in the Hummingbird in Birmingham. ""It was probably the most scared we have ever been in our lives. ""We had never played to more than 50 people before. That was a big venue. There were probably a couple of thousand people there."" Housemartins singer Paul Heaton, who later formed the Beautiful South, says: ""They were brilliant live and the next step was to make record that would convince the public."" Heaton put them in touch with record producer John Williams. Paula Yates introduced The Proclaimers on Channel Four's The Tube An appearance on Channel Four's hit TV music show The Tube was their breakthrough. Presenter Paula Yates introduced the boys by saying: ""Now it's time for something totally weird and unusual."" Craig and Charlie say she was not wrong. According to Charlie: ""We were always going to be fish out of water in everything we did."" He says: ""The Tube was a massive show at the time. ""We went to the football the next day and we were standing on the terracing at Easter Road and people were coming up as we were buying a pie and a coffee and saying ' saw you last night pal'."" In 1987, all the big Scottish bands - Simple Minds, Big Country, Hipsway - were adopting a mid-Atlantic singing style that was definitely not their real accent. Craig says The Proclaimers had encountered resistance to them singing in their own voices, especially by record companies in London. He says: ""I could not see the point of writing songs about stuff that we knew and had observed and then singing it in a mid-Atlantic accent."" Their first single was Throw the R Away, a song about having to change your accent to achieve success. It contains the lyric: ""I'm just going to have to learn to hesitate/To make sure my words/On your Saxon ears don't grate."" Craig says: ""It didn't get much play."" But Charlie says they were not deterred. ""It was a determination to do it our own way and accept the consequences,"" he says. Scottish musician Gerry Rafferty remixed Letter From America The first album - This is the Story - was recorded in London. Producer John Williams says it was kept intimate. ""Charlie and Craig recorded most of their takes in the control room,"" he says. But they knew that in order to get radio play for Letter From America it had to have a band behind it. They chose legendary Scottish musician Gerry Rafferty, famous for Baker Street and Stealers Wheel's Stuck in the Middle with You, to remix it. It was a big hit and introduced the world to Bathgate, Methil, Irvine and Linwood - all name-checked in the song as places devastated by the Tory government's industrial policy, which the twins compared to the infamous Highland Clearances. Scottish author Christopher Brookmyre tells the BBC documentary: ""Having two guys with acoustic guitars singing a song about the Highland Clearances was not something that was going to shock anybody because that's a familiar subject for folk music. ""Suddenly making it about steel plant closures, making it 'Methil no more', changed everything. ""There is an edge to it. It's immediately relevant and you understand what the song is all about at that point."" Nicola Sturgeon says Letter From America was very important to her Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who chose Letter From America in her Desert Island Discs, was about 17 when the song was released. She says: ""It came out at a time when I was getting really involved in politics so it wasn't just that my home town of Irvine was mentioned in it, which was quite a big thing, but it was also that it spoke about something about my country that was also motivating me to get involved in politics. ""That song for me is the anthem of my teenage years."" Craig says the song was written in 1984: ""It was basically rage at what was going on. ""Both of us were disgusted by the callous way that unemployment was used to break organised labour, to break the spirit of people."" Charlie and Craig Reid at the premiere of the film Sunshine on Leith Their second album Sunshine on Leith was released in 1988, just a year after the first. It featured their biggest hit I'm Gonna Be (500 miles). It was an international hit at the time but its success has continued for almost 30 years, providing them with their only No 1 hit when it was re-recorded for Comic Relief with comedian Peter Kay in 2007. Charlie says: ""500 miles is the reason we are able to keep making records. In terms of what it has brought in over the years it pays for new records, it pays for tours, it underpins everything we do."" They have had numerous other hits but they are not on the same scale, he says. ""I don't know what it is. It is indestructible that record."" ""We wouldn't get out alive if we played a gig without it."" Craig says he wrote the song in 45 minutes after a gig in Aberdeen. ""One of the quickest songs I've ever written,"" he says. ""It was just like it was writing itself."" 500 miles was The Proclaimers only hit in the US and has appeared in numerous movies including Benny and Joon and Pitch Perfect but some US radio stations took against it. The lyric of the song contains the Scottish word ""haver"". They didn't know what it meant but they assumed it must be subversive. It actually means to talk rubbish. ""I can't understand why you let someone else rule your land"", goes the lyric of Cap in Hand. The Proclaimers were never equivocal about their support for Scottish independence. Craig says: ""We are absolutely total believers that Scotland should be an independent country. ""I find it difficult when I meet people who have never given it a thought. I can't understand them."" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon says: ""Their songs over the past 30 years have in many respects been the soundtrack to Scotland's political journey and I think that has made the politics much more accessible at times to younger generations and brought politics alive. ""Really in very simple terms, in beautifully lyrical terms, telling Scotland's story. This video can not be played Hibs fans sing anthem Sunshine on Leith after derby win over Hearts The song Sunshine on Leith was released as a single in 1988 but failed to make the top 40. The song is a melancholic six-minute epic which the brothers refused to edit and it didn't make it on to radio playlists. Craig says:"" Sunshine on Leith is one of those songs that has got bigger down the years. ""When you play live shows that is probably the one that connects you to the audience, even more than 500 miles."" Stephen Greenhorn, the playwright who created the musical Sunshine on Leith, says: ""The writing on it is so pared down it feels like a really intimate song about a specific feeling between two people and yet it's the best football song you'll ever hear. ""10,000 people on the terraces can sing it and everybody is going to be in tears."" Hibernian FC, the club Craig and Charlie have passionately supported for years, have adopted it as their song and the fans belt it out whenever the occasion allows. Charlie says: ""That's when you know you have got something. ""Your own people sing your own song. Nobody is forcing them to do it. They do it because they feel it. It's very moving and it links you more to the club."" Edwyn Collins produced the 2003 album Born Innocent The success of the album Sunshine on Leith was eventually followed-up with Hit the Highway in 1994, which included Let's Get Married. The band then went quiet for seven years before returning with Persevere and then Born Innocent, which was produced by Scottish singer-songwriter Edwyn Collins Journalist Craig Mclean says it was ""two great Scottish institutions coming together"". Edwyn says they immediately had a ""bond"". According to Charlie ""it was probably the most enjoyable record that we have made over the years"". Edwyn Collins had a recording studio in London ""stuffed full of vintage kit"", according to Craig McLean. Collins' partner Grace Maxwell says the ""sheer power"" of the sound coming from the boys ""blew the capsule in the microphone"". ""It has always been an ambition of mine,"" says Craig. ""When you hear Little Richard records the vocals are so high they are distorting the microphones. ""Half of Edwyn's gear was from the 1920s or 30s, I think. It was a lot of old gear so if we broke his kit we'll accept that responsibility."" Craig (left) and Charlie (right) with actor David Tennant, a big fan, who presents a documentary about their career Doctor Who actor David Tennant, who presents the BBC Scotland programme, chose The Proclaimers song Over and Done With as one of hisDesert Island Discs. He says he has bought all their albums and seen them live countless times. Tennant even had ""Life With You"" played as he walked down the aisle at his wedding. In recent years, there has been new material and a successful stage musical and film based on their back catalogue - Sunshine on Leith. But touring is what The Proclaimers are about and they are as popular as ever. At 55 years old, and after more than 30 years, they are no stopping just yet. Craig says: We enjoy it as much, if not more, than we did.""

"The Hokule'a was built in the 1970s A traditional Polynesian voyaging canoe has returned to Honolulu in Hawaii, completing the first-ever round-the-world trip by such a vessel. The boat, the Hokule'a, took three years to journey around the globe. Its crew navigated without modern instruments, using only the stars, wind and ocean swells as guides. They aimed to use the same techniques that brought the first Polynesian settlers to Hawaii hundreds of years ago. Hokule'a means Star of Gladness Hawaii celebrated the Hokule'a's homecoming on Honolulu's Magic Island peninsula on Saturday. Built in the 1970s, it has travelled around 40,000 nautical miles (74,000km) on this latest trip, known as the Malama Honua voyage, meaning ""to care for our Island Earth"". Its aim has been to spread a message about ocean conservation, sustainability and protecting indigenous culture. The boat had a crew of 12 or 13 people at a time ""Hokule'a has sparked a reawakening of Hawaiian culture, language, identity and revitalized voyaging and navigation traditions throughout the Pacific Ocean,"" said the voyage organisers ontheir website,external. Naalehu Anthony, crewmember and chief executive director of Hawaiian media company Oiwi TV which documented the trip, toldHawaii Public Radio,externalthat wherever they docked, people greeted them with a Hawaiian ""Aloha"" greeting. ""One of the things I really admire about the voyage, looking back on it, is that we always asked the first nations peoples from these different places for permission to come. We never said we are coming. We said, would it be OK for us to come and honour the native people of this place,"" he said. The voyage, he added, had been an ""opportunity to celebrate native knowledge and look at ways that we are more common than we are different"".

"Donations piled up outside this church in Kensington People have flocked from near and far to help at the site of the Grenfell Tower fire, with the volunteer effort organised by faith groups, social media and word of mouth. The BBC's Nalina Eggert spoke to some of the helpers. In North Kensington, it is clear the response from ordinary people to the disaster has been overwhelming. Boxes are piled up outside community centres and handwritten signs hang on fences offering help. Among the police, NHS workers and community leaders on the streets are people who have given up their time to help. What we know so far A tale of two tower blocks Here are some of the volunteers' stories. ""I came down for the day to help out my friend and his mum, they've been down before. ""I've been here for four hours, handing out water, soft drinks and fruit . ""I had a bit of time off and decided to come down and help, keep people hydrated and keep the spirits up. ""What went on left me feeling a bit sick. I needed to help out. ""I came down not knowing what I'd be doing and how I'd be helping but became one of many hands."" ""What motivated me? Humanity. ""When they said no more donations, I thought I'm going to come down myself and help. I couldn't just sit and watch the news. ""I've been sorting things out at a church. They don't have storage space. They're turning donations away because there's no space. ""Personally I think it needs to be organised by somebody. ""I want to keep helping later on - in a month, when people have their replacement accommodation."" (L-R) Raabia Akhter, Shabnum Sadiq, Ammna Ahmed outside the Westway leisure centre Raabia, Shabnum and Ammna filled a van with shower gel, shampoo, nappies and sanitary towels through donations from people in Slough, and distributed the supplies to community centres in the area near the tower block. They organised it through Whatsapp and local schools, and contacted the recipients in advance, which is how they could keep making donations when most places had asked for no more items.

"This video can not be played USS Fitzgerald damaged by the crash Sailors missing after the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off Japan have been found dead, the US Navy and Japanese media says. Seven sailors were left missing and three injured after Saturday's collision, which the US Navy said almost sank the destroyer. The US Navy said rescue workers found the bodies on Sunday after gaining access to damaged parts of the ship. It said they will be taken to a Japanese hospital to be identified. The incident reportedly took place some 56 nautical miles (104km) south-west of the Japanese port city of Yokosuka, at about 02:30 local time on Saturday (17:30 GMT Friday). Japanese broadcaster NHK said the collision led to the flooding of the crew's sleeping quarters while they were asleep. USS Fitzgerald crash: In pictures ""The damage was significant,"" 7th Fleet commander Vice-Admiral Joseph P Aucoin said. ""There was a big gash under the water."" Repairs would take some time to complete, he said. At a press conference in Japan on Sunday, Vice Adm Aucoin would not confirm how many remains had been found so far. Families of the sailors are being notified, he said. ""This loss is something we all feel,"" he said. The collision left a huge gash down the right-hand side of the ship Marine traffic records suggest the ACX Crystal, a 222-metre (730ft) Filipino-flagged container ship, made a sudden U-turn roughly 25 minutes before the crash. It is not known why it changed course. Similar records for the USS Fitzgerald are not publicly available. The Navy ship's starboard side was heavily damaged in the collision, but the vessel later managed to slowly return to its base in Yokosuka, with the assistance of US navy tug boats. The ACX Crystal appeared to make a U-turn before the collision, before rapidly adjusting course and setting off to Tokyo Japan's coastguard said the ACX Crystal had a gross tonnage of just under 30,000, about three times that of the USS Fitzgerald. It sustained lighter damage to its port bow. The Associated Press agency said there were no injuries reported among the 20 Filipino crew members on board the ACX Crystal. It remains at port in Tokyo.

"An Afghan soldier opened fire at a base in the north. Pictured: Soldiers outside the base in April An Afghan soldier has attacked US troops at a military base, wounding seven. The US soldiers were evacuated after the ""insider attack"" in the northern Balkh province on Saturday, a spokesman for the US military command said. The Nato-led Resolute Support mission said one Afghan soldier was killed and another injured in the incident at Camp Shaheen, in Mazar-e Sharif city. But earlier reports of American soldiers being killed were dismissed. It is not clear whether the soldier killed was also the attacker. The Taliban have said the shooting was carried out by a man loyal to them, according to Reuters. Resolute Support said the attack, which took place at about 14:00 local time (09:30 GMT), was under investigation. It comes a week after an Afghan army commandoshot dead three US special forces soldiersin eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban claimed to be behind that attack. The Taliban also said they were behind another attack in Mazar-e Sharif in April, whenmore than 100 Afghan soldiers were killedor wounded at the base, home to the Afghan army's 209th Corps. The army said insurgents targeted those leaving Friday prayers at the base's mosque and others in a canteen.

The websiteposted,externala video compilation of her tweets since she joined in 2009 along with a message saying ""Today, we #WITNESS history"". Witness is the name of Perry's new album. The Canadian singer Justin Bieber has the second highest number of followers at 96.7m with Barack Obama in third place with almost 91m. The rest of the top 100 accounts are mostly made up of singers, sports stars, media companies and a few politicians, according to the website Twitter Counter. US president Donald Trump is the most-followed current leader, in 33rd place with 32.4m followers. Two places behind him - after the boy band One Direction - is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with 30.7m followers. The singer thanked Twitter after hitting the milestone However it is not clear how many of these accounts' followers are real people and how many may be fake accounts. Searches using the tool Twitter Audit - which analyses a sample of followers and calculates a score based on factors including the number of tweets they have sent - suggested that about two-thirds of both Perry's and Bieber's followers may not be real. For Mr Obama and Mr Trump the figure dropped to about a third.
