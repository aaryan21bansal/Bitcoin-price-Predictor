"Indie-Rose has Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy The mother of a girl with epilepsy said her child is at risk of ""becoming comatose"" after her medical cannabis oils were seized at a UK airport. Tannine Montgomery said Indie-Rose, 5, had seizures and panic attacks before starting to use the oils 14 months ago. Ms Montgomery, 30, said she was stopped at Stansted on Friday returning from the Netherlands, where she buys the oil with a prescription from her UK doctor. She urged Health Secretary Matt Hancock to ""sort this crisis out"". Campaigners claim just two NHS prescriptions for medical cannabis, which contains the psychoactive ingredient THC, have been issued since the government announced last year that doctors can prescribe such products. Although Ms Montgomery, from Clare, Suffolk, has a private UK prescription to treat Indie-Rose's Dravet syndrome, she says it is cheaper to travel abroad to stock up on the oils. ""To obtain a special import licence would cost us Â£4,500 per month as opposed to the Â£1,500 we pay for the drug at the moment,"" she said. ""Seizing this medicine is condemning my lovely daughter to becoming comatose, wracked by seizures and to be at high risk of an unnecessary death. ""For the love of God, this medicine is legal in the UK and I have a full lawful UK prescription for it."" Medical cannabis 'expectations unfairly raised' Cannabis meds: 'I risk criminal record to help my child' Doctors can prescribe medical cannabis in the UK Although it is illegal to import cannabis oils without a special licence, Ms Mongtomery said UK Border Force officials have in the past let her into the country with the drug. Ms Montgomery said of Mr Hancock: ""We know he has the report on his desk from the NHS setting out why the system for NHS prescriptions is blocked. ""Every day he doesn't act on it is a day of interminable suffering for mothers like me.

"More than 100 people, including 26 children, have died in air strikes on hospitals, schools, markets and bakeries in north-west Syria in the past 10 days, a top UN official says. Human rights chief Michelle Bachelet blamed the attacks in rebel-held areas on the government and its allies. But the attacks were met with ""apparent international indifference"", she said. Syria and its ally Russia have both denied targeting civilians in air strikes in the Idlib region. Who's in control of Idlib? Why does the battle for Idlib matter? Why is there a war in Syria? Speaking to reporters, Ms Bachelet criticised the ""failure of leadership by the world's most powerful nations"". The rising death toll in Idlib had been met with a ""collective shrug"" and the conflict had fallen off the international radar, while the UN Security Council was paralysed, she said. She said the civilian targets were unlikely to have been accidental and warned that those carrying out the attacks could be charged with war crimes. ""Intentional attacks against civilians are war crimes, and those who have ordered them or carried them out are criminally responsible for their actions,"" Ms Bachelet said. Idlib province, along with the north of Hama province and western Aleppo province, is one of the last opposition strongholds in Syria after eight years of civil war. It is supposedly covered by a truce brokered in September by Russia and opposition-backer Turkey that spared the 2.7 million civilians living there from a major government offensive. This video can not be played Dr Murhaf: 'We need to know more about surgery for war zone children' Last week, the UN said more than 350 civilians had been killed and 330,000 forced to flee their homes since fighting escalated on 29 April. But that figure has now been revised, adding 103 extra deaths in the past 10 days alone. The estimate for the number displaced stands at more than 400,000. The government - which is backed by the Russian air force - said the increase in attacks was due to repeated truce violations by jihadists linked to al-Qaeda who dominate the opposition stronghold. Russia has denied reports earlier this week that it carried out airstrikeson a market and residential areas which left at least 31 civilians dead. Even before the conflict began, many Syrians were complaining about high unemployment, corruption and a lack of political freedom under President Bashar al-Assad, who succeeded his father, Hafez, after he died in 2000. In March 2011, pro-democracy demonstrations erupted in the southern city of Deraa, inspired by the ""Arab Spring"" in neighbouring countries. When the government used deadly force to crush the dissent, protests demanding the president's resignation erupted nationwide. The unrest spread and the crackdown intensified. Opposition supporters took up arms, first to defend themselves and later to rid their areas of security forces. Mr Assad vowed to crush what he called ""foreign-backed terrorism"". The violence rapidly escalated and the country descended into civil war. Read more:Why is there a war in Syria?

"Sports Direct says it regrets rescuing House of Fraser inits much-delayed results,external, which revealed a â¬674m (Â£605m) tax bill from Belgian authorities. The firm, which bought the department store out of administration a year ago, said: ""If we had the gift of hindsight we might have made a different decision in August 2018."" It described problems at House of Fraser as ""nothing short of terminal"". It added it was in talks with Belgian officials to resolve the tax bill. The full-year results had been due to be published on 15 July but were delayed until 26 July, in part, because of uncertainty over the future trading performance of House of Fraser. How Mike Ashley built Sports Direct into a retail empire Mike Ashley: The saviour of the High Street? Mike Ashley tells Debenhams execs to take lie detector test Those results had been expected to be published on Friday morning, but were subject to continuous delays throughout the day. It has now emerged that Sports Direct, which is majority-owned and run by billionaire Mike Ashley, was hit by the tax bill by Belgian authorities on 25 July. The company said the request for back taxes is linked to the way its goods are moved throughout the European Union and are taxed in Belgium. Meanwhile, it also said that its chief financial officer of two years, Jon Kempster, is stepping down and will be succeeded by his deputy, Chris Wootton. Commenting on House of Fraser, Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: ""It's a House of horrors, more like."" He said Sports Direct had ""every reason to regret buying House of Fraser now"". ""It's such a shame as there were such high hopes,"" he added. Mr Ashley had vowed to turn House of Fraser into the ""Harrods of the High Street"" when he bought the department store chain out of administration for Â£90m last August. However, on Friday he said: ""In the short-term you can't justify it. It's like buying a broken down car at the roadside - you have to get it to the garage to fix it."" But he said: ""Long-term, we'd like to think we are hopeful of where we are going."" By Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance reporter With the benefit of hindsight, buying House of Fraser looks to Mike Ashley like buying a millstone and tying it around his own neck. He paid Â£90m to the administrators and has seen his Sports Direct profits reduced by Â£51m since then. That's been the cost of keeping House of Fraser going. Now a cull of the stores is about to start. There are still 54. Not many have gone while he tested which ones had a future. Some carried on losing money even after he had bullied the landlords into charging zero rent. Mr Ashley warned that there is going to be ""a lot of store closures"" in the coming months, with smaller outlets in smaller towns most at risk. When I asked him if that meant most House of Fraser stores would be shut down, he answered ""no"" but it is clear that thousands of jobs could be in danger. Before House of Fraser went into administration last year - it was planning to shut 31 of its 59 stores.  Sports Direct said it could close some stores - but didn't say how many. It said: ""There are still a number of stores which are currently paying zero rent and that are still unprofitable, and unfortunately this is not sustainable. ""We are continuing to review the longer-term portfolio and would expect the number of retained stores to reduce in the next 12 months."" Sports Direct said that it is working hard to turn House of Fraser around, but said ""it will not be easy"". ""On a scale out of five, with one being very bad and five being very good, House of Fraser is a one,"" the company added. For the year to 28 April, underlying profits at Sports Direct dropped by 6% to Â£287.8m. However, taking out House of Fraser, Sports Direct's income rose by 10.9%. Total full-year sales grew by 10.2% to Â£3.7bn.

"This video can not be played Mr Trump says he and Mr Johnson will create a ""substantial"" US-UK trade agreement US President Donald Trump has said talks about a ""very substantial"" trade deal with the UK are under way. He said a bilateral post-Brexit deal could lead to a ""three to four, five times"" increase in current trade. There are no details about how this would be achieved. After a phone call with Boris Johnson on Friday, Mr Trump said the new prime minister would be ""great"". He added US-UK trade had previously been ""impeded"" by Britain's membership of the EU. Once the UK leaves, he said, the UK can expect to do ""much more"" trade with the US, he said. Mr Johnson and Mr Trump said they would begin formal negotiations ""as soon as possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. While the UK is in the EU, it cannot sign its own trade deals. Brexit is due to happen on 31 October. Trade deals involve two or more countries agreeing a set of terms by which they buy and sell goods and services from each other. Deals are designed to increase trade by eliminating or reducing trade barriers. These barriers might include import or export taxes (tariffs), quotas, or differing regulations on things such as safety or labelling. In short, because the US and EU do not have one. The EU customs union forbids members negotiating trade agreements separately from the EU. Instead, trade agreements are negotiated collectively. In 2013, under President Barack Obama, the US and the EU launched a programme of negotiations known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP. That proposed trade agreement was put on hold by the US after Mr Trump was elected as president, but the EU has approved new talks. A trade deal between the EU and a bloc of South American countries, including Brazil, took 20 years to finalise The EU-Canada agreement - which removed 99% of tariffs - wasseven years in the making, while theEU-South America deal agreed in Junetook 20 years to negotiate. The EU and US have been having a stop-start conversation about trade for years but a fresh round of formal talks wereonly recently approved by the EU. So even though both Mr Trump and Mr Johnson seem keen to do a deal, it could still take years, although - in theory - it is easier to negotiate with one country than a multi-national bloc. Barack Obama said in 2016a UK-US trade deal could take 10 years to negotiate if the UK left the EU. The US is a major trade and investment partner for the UK - by some measures the biggest of all. According to the Office for National Statistics'latest available figures,external, the US (including Puerto Rico) is our top trading partner. The UK-US trade relationship in five charts UK says it won't cut food standards for US Total trade (imports and exports) between the UK and US was worth Â£183.2bn in 2017, which made up 14.6% of total UK trade. The Office of the United States Trade Representative estimated thetotal trade figure for 2018,externalat $262.3bn (Â£211.9bn). TheUS Chamber of Commerce,externalsays the UK is the US' seventh largest trading partner and the fourth largest export destination for American goods and services. The UK-Swiss agreement signed in February also applies to neighbouring Liechtenstein As a member of the EU, the UK is part of about 40 trade agreements the EU has with more than 70 countries. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would lose these trade deals immediately -worth about 11% of total UK trade,external. So far the UK has agreed ""continuity"" deals with 12 countries and regions:Central America,external,Andean countries,external,Norway and Iceland,external,Caribbean countries,external,Pacific Islands,external,Liechtenstein,external,Israel,external,Palestinian Authority,external,Switzerland,external,the Faroe Islands,external,Eastern and Southern Africa,externalandChile,external. These areas account for 64% of trade currently covered by EU agreements for which the UK is seeking continuity, the government says. The agreements mostly replicate EU trade deals. In addition, the UK has also announceda deal in principle with South Korea, which is ""expected to be signed shortly"".

"This video can not be played Mike Ashley's High Street empire There is confusion surrounding the release of results from Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, after the firm failed to publish them throughout Friday. In a statement, Sports Direct said it was ""still finalising"" the results, and would give a further update at 16:00. However, that deadline has now passed and the firm's share price has closed down 3.9%. It is extremely unusual for results to be delayed in this way - one analyst called events ""an utter shambles"". The full-year resultshave already been delayed once- originally they were due to be reported on 18 July. At the time, Sports Direct blamed the delay on uncertainty over the future trading performance of the House of Fraser chain, which it bought last year, as well as increased scrutiny of its auditor Grant Thornton. It also indicated that it might not achieve its profits forecast. UK-listed companies normally publish their results at 07:00, before the London markets open at 08:00. Sports Direct had also been due to give a presentation to investors and media at 09:00. However, after the results failed to arrive, the firm apologised for the delay and for cancelling the presentation at the last minute. At midday Sports Direct said it would provide an update at 14:00. Shortly after that time, the company issued a statement that said: ""We are still finalising our preliminary results and will update you again at 16:00."" Trading on the stock market closed at 16:30 without a further update or sign of Sports Direct's results. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said the events were ""a total and utter shambles"" that ""betrays a number of problems at the business after [Mr] Ashley embarked on his rather random acquisition spree."" ""Above all it betrays a total disregard for shareholders,"" he said. By Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance reporter Unprecedented, bizarre, shambolic - just some of the adjectives being used to describe the non-appearance of Sports Direct's annual results today. Stockmarket traders have been scratching their heads trying to remember any examples of a company which failed to deliver figures in such an exasperating fashion. First, a delay of more than a week. Then, today, a series of updates providing no update at all. The episode has caused concern, along with speculation about whether Sports Direct's auditor, Grant Thornton has continued to have problems approving the numbers. On the other hand, the shares have weathered the uncertainty better than might have been feared. They are down 3.9%. Sports Direct shares fell in early trading on the London stock market before recovering. Guardian journalist Rob Davies tweeted: Allow Twitter content?

"The UK has formally suspended trade talks with Canada despite nearly two years of negotiations, in a row over agricultural products including beef. Following Brexit and the departure from the EU's trading system in 2021, the UK has been trying to strike trade deals with countries around the world. This is the first time the UK has formally suspended talks with a potential trading partner since then. UK halts trade negotiations with Canada over hormones in beef ban It means tariffs - or taxes - may have to be paid on some UK exports to Canada such as cheese, of which the UK exported Â£18.7m worth in 2022,according to the Food and Drink Federation,external. The ability to strike free trade deals was cited by Brexit supporters as one of the benefits of leaving the EU. A free trade deal aims to encourage trade between countries by making it cheaper and simpler. It normally applies to the exchange of goods, but occasionally to services as well. Making trade cheaper is usually achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs. These are government taxes or charges for trading goods across borders and can help protect a country's manufacturers from cheap imports. A car importer might have to pay a 20% tariff on top of the vehicle's price, for example, to bring it into a country. Trade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs or food safety requirements. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be inspected. The UK-Japan deal was signed in October 2020 Since Brexit, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU. However, the majority of these are simply ""rollovers"" - meaning they copied the terms of deals the UK previously had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new trading arrangements. And some of them are with countries with which the UK does very little trade. A deal withJapanwas signed in October 2020. It was the first that differed from the existing EU trade deal. TheAustralia dealwas thefirst trade agreementnegotiated from scratch by the UK since it left the EU. UK farmerswarned they could be undercut by cheap imports, which could cost jobs. However, the UK government insists the deal contains protections for the sector. An agreement withNorway, Iceland and Liechtensteinwasannounced in June 2021and builds on the previous agreement the UK had with these countries. British farmers are worried about competing with cheap foreign imports, such as beef The UKsigned a new deal,externalwithNew Zealandon 28 February 2022. New Zealand is a small trading partner, accounting for less than 0.2% of total UK trade. While the deal is unlikely to boost the UK economy by much, it could lead to more New Zealand lamb being sold in the UK. The UK has also agreed to join an existing trade agreement between11 Pacific Rim nations. The governmentexpects to become a member,externalof the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in the second half of 2024. Talks withIndiabegan in early 2022, although no deal has been reached. And there has not been a deal agreed with theUS, although it had been set as a priority in the Conservative 2019 manifesto. Rishi Sunak said in June 2023that a full free trade agreement had not in fact been a priority for either country ""for a while now"", although a more limited economic agreement called the Atlantic Declaration was signed. After Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, the UK and EU needed to decide the rules for their future trading relationship. This was important because the EU was the UK's largest and closest trading partner. After months of negotiation - which went down to the wire - a UK-EU trade deal came into force on 1 January 2021. The deal prevented any tariffs and quotas being introduced, which would have made it more expensive to trade goods between the two partners. The UK-EU trade deal went down to the wire, with fishing proving to be one of the major sticking points But not everything is the same as it was before Brexit. As the UK no longer has to follow EU rules on product standards, new checks have been introduced. The deal also does not completely eliminate the possibility of tariffs in future. Both sides will need to stay close to shared rules in areas such as workers' rights and environmental protection. If either the UK or the EU shift their rules too far, the other side could introduce tariffs. What's in the UK-EU trade deal?

"Relations between the UK and the US are going to be ""sensational"" now Boris Johnson is in Downing Street, America's ambassador to the UK has said. Woody Johnson told the BBC the two had a lot in common in their leadership style and desire to ""get things done"". He played down the PM's criticism of Mr Trump when he was London mayor,when he called him ""stupefyingly ignorant"". And he said a no-deal Brexit would not affect the UK's ability to strike a trade deal with the US. The US president has welcomed Mr Johnson's rise to power, saying he would do a ""great job"" and even suggesting he was ""Britain Trump"". A supporter of Brexit, Mr Trump was critical of former Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiations with the EU. There have also been tensions over climate change and the US president's views on race and immigration, while a recent row over the leaking of British diplomatic cables led to the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch, the UK's ambassador in Washington. Six foreign policy issues the UK's new PM will face Trump: Johnson 'will do a great job as PM' Woody Johnson told Radio 4's Today his job was to focus on the ""things we agree on"". ""We're going to have bumps in the road, no question, but we are two great countries,"" he said. ""If we look forward optimistically between our two countries, we're going to lift all the people in this country - to independence and all the things you voted for in the referendum."" ""I think that's what the president wants and what your new prime minister wants too,"" he added. Woody Johnson said the UK would be ""front of the line"" for a trade deal with the US In 2015, Boris Johnson, as London Mayor, said Mr Trump's claim that parts of the city were ""no-go areas"" showed ""quite stupefying ignorance"" and made him unfit to be president. But Woody Johnson suggested Mr Trump was not bothered by the comments. ""The new relationship between your new prime minister and our president... it's going to be sensational,"" he said. ""Their leadership has a lot in common. Both have their own style but similarities - a clear vision of what they want to accomplish."" He said the UK would be at the ""front of the line"" for a trade deal once Brexit had happened and it was ""not imperative"" for the UK to leave the EU with an agreement to make progress. ""The president is going to try and move the ball forwards - the UK is our most important ally in security and prosperity. He knows that."" Most experts believe a free trade deal with the US will take years to complete and could be beset by difficulties over issues like food standards, environmental regulations and access to healthcare services for each other's companies. And one of the most powerful politicians in the US has said its Congress would not support any trade agreement which undermined the peace settlement in Northern Ireland. Angela Merkel has invited Boris Johnson to Berlin Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives,told the Irish Times,externalthere could be no return to physical border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, something Dublin has said would be inevitable if the UK left without a deal. ""We made it clear in our conversations with senior members of the Conservative Party earlier this year that there should be no return to a hard border on the island,"" she said. ""That position has not changed. Any trade deal between the US and Great Britain would have to be cognisant of that."" The new prime minister has not yet revealed when he will hold his first face-to-face leaders' meeting with Mr Trump. No 10 confirmed that Mr Johnson had spoken to the French President Emmanuel Macron over the phone on Thursday and they had discussed Brexit. A German government spokesperson also said the PM had discussed Brexit with Chancellor Angela Merkel during a phone call on Friday. ""The chancellor has invited the prime minister to visit Berlin for an early first visit,"" they added.

"If tariffs on cheddar go up, it's hard cheese for exporters ""There's a tariff of 20% on cars,"" is the shout at the front of the frenzied room near Westminster, where Trade Secretary Liam Fox and his chief trade negotiator Crawford Falconer look on at what they hope is a next generation of UK trade negotiators. The sixth-formers of the Harris Academy are used to meeting members of the cabinet: the sixth form is nestled among the ministries. They buzz around exchanging cardboard blue cars for red ones and for Monopoly money, mindful of the negative impact of Britain's terms of trade of a tax on UK exports of its cars. This is the return of an old dimension to Britain's statecraft and its economic levers. The hope of Mr Fox and his chief trade negotiator Mr Falconer is that such trade negotiation will offer a new career path for this generation to serve their nation. But it is not just the wheeling and dealing sixth-formers here who are on a steep learning curve. The Department was set up three years ago, carved out of a wing of what was then Boris Johnson's Foreign Office. Alongside David Davis at the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU), this was the signal of intent from the new administration of Theresa May, Brexit meant the ""Three Brexiteers"" in charge of ""global Britain's"" external political and economic diplomacy and negotiations. Now, in the last days of the May administration, it is only Mr Fox who has remained in post. He shows me his collection of international trade diplomacy memorabilia: a Stars and Stripes from the US Congress, digitally printed steel from an UK exporter of high-tech metals to India, various sets of cufflinks and his own centuries-old insignia - the flag of the president of the Board of Trade. Under a very old convention, the Navy are obliged to fly his flag when he is on board one of their vessels, he tells me, and they did in New York last autumn. But it is his framed copy of the 2016 EU referendum ballot paper that he appears to cherish the most. He picks it up, shows it to me and declares: ""To remind us all about our democratic duty to deliver Brexit - this is the spare,"" he tells me. And for many, the entire point of Brexit is what his department has been set up to do - negotiate new trade deals for the UK alone after regaining an independent trade policy. The record so far has not lived up to the confident predictions made during the referendum about the ease of such deals. On one level, this is simply down to not having left the EU. But it is also about the continuing uncertainty about the nature of our relationship going forward with the EU. And it isn't even just that. Liam Fox says his department's role is largely to promote exports When I ask Mr Fox about the rather mixed bag on trade deals, he points out that 80% of what his department does is about promoting exports and inward investment. And on that measure, Â£30.5bn extra exports and 50,000 jobs created or protected by his department's promotion of foreign direct investment shows it's value for money. But on trade policy? ""We have a whole range of frustrations, you're quite right. Every time we have to play Grand Old Duke of York once again and we have to march our trading partners up to the point of no deal and then it comes back down again. It frustrates them and it frustrates us. ""We aren't able to negotiate any new trade agreements until after we've left the EU, so we get ready for the point of exit and twice it hasn't come, so we're better prepared than we were, the country in general is better prepared than we were, but there are still legal hurdles we have to get over if we want to get new trade agreements,"" he tells me. But it isn't quite as simple as that. In lieu of the actual big new trade deals that have to wait until after Brexit, the department has focused on the important work of keeping the existing terms British businesses enjoy as part of the European Union, with 70 countries through 40 EU deals. Only 12 have been ""rolled over"". South Korea was an important success. It signed up partly to protect its car exports to the UK from the imposition of a 10% no deal tariff, but also to gain first-mover advantage on Japan. But this is trade whack-a-mole - the same publication of the no-deal tariffs in March also led the Canadians to calculate they simply did not need to accept the UK offer of a continuity deal at all. There is a separate but related ""Rules of Origin"" problem too. EU manufacturers have been told by their governments that UK parts will not count as ""made in the EU"". If they use too many UK parts, their products risk not qualifying for tariff-free treatment when exported to those same countries such as South Korea. Those supply chains, manufacturers say, are beginning to break. Even rollover deals can't really help here. The impact of all this can be seen at Combe Castle dairy exporters in Melksham, Wiltshire. ""It's a disaster,"" Peter Mitchell, the operations director tells me. Just under a third of its business is exporting cheese to Canada, zero-tariff under the EU-Canada Ceta deal. He points to a giant block of cheddar worth about Â£500 in sales, just about to be shipped to Toronto. The tariff under no-deal Brexit, now that the Canadians have turned down a rollover continuity deal, is an incredible Â£1,200 or 245%. Their cream products face an increase from 0% to 293%. This is literally what trading on WTO terms means for a business that has successfully exported globally for three-and-a-half decades. He questions whether cabinet ministers really understand the detail. The PM's trade envoy to Canada, Andrew Percy MP, resigned on Monday for other reasons. But he was known to be frustrated by the impact of no-deal tariffs on the rollover. One calculation is that it will lead to Â£800m in lost business for UK exporters. The trade secretary acknowledges that Canada did not need to do a deal, but warns them that a new UK administration could change the no-deal tariffs only recently announced. ""In the case of Canada, we set out what would be emergency Day 1 [no-deal] tariffs, which allow 87% of goods coming into the UK to be tariff-free,"" says Mr Fox. ""The Canadians not unreasonably said, why should we put even more resource into a trade agreements when we can get access to your markets for nothing. The point here is they are temporary, and we will have a new PM and a new cabinet and they may take a different view on that. ""My advice to my Canadian colleagues and others is, get the safety net in place. Your businesses will criticise you for being over-prepared, but they will criticise you for being under-prepared if the worst happens and we introduce trade frictions that wouldn't otherwise be there."" Changing the no-deal tariffs, however, risks setting off another round of whack-a-mole. Many retailers, importers and other trade partners have acted and planned on the basis of the numbers published in March. ""Of course they can change. We've made very clear from the outset that these were tariffs that would probably last six to 12 months before the government would review them. And therefore our advice was and is to our trading partners - don't take the risk of there being trading friction that you don't need to have, let's have a continuity agreement,"" Mr Fox told me. There has been something of a mystery around how the original no-deal tariffs emerged. They were considered by a cabinet sub-committee, and full cabinet, but there was a not a proper and full process of consultation with tens of thousands of affected businesses, nor a real debate about their impact in Parliament. Some Commonwealth allies pushed back against sharing out existing EU quotas, fearing a restriction on their exports of lamb and beef Mr Fox says they were designed to keep price rises down and protect some selected businesses from foreign competition. ""The no-deal tariffs we set out were designed to not produce an inflationary shock to the UK, because we had to ensure that people on lower pay would not find their wages bought less in the shops, so that was the main priority of the government,"" he says. ""And we wanted to ensure that these goods that come to the UK and then incorporated into our exports don't become more expensive and make us less competitive. Clearly there are some of our industries that need protecting - we've looked at ceramics and elements of farming that we will need to continue to give protection."" They have also tried to keep trade preferences for developing countries. But that has led to odd distortions, with retailers pondering why men's shirts will have a tariff of 12%, but women's blouses 0%. The department did make quick progress with the regularisation of the UK's membership of the World Trade Organisation. But then some countries, including Commonwealth allies, pushed back hard against the exercise to share out existing EU quotas, fearing a restriction on their exports of lamb and beef. Mr Fox says ""very few countries objected"" to the laying of the new UK goods schedule - the list of applicable tariffs - and that there are now ""some small details on access to quotas"" which are currently being dealt with at the WTO. One nation objected to the services schedule - Russia. ""It was hardly a big surprise to us. all these things happened within the predictable range."" Is this not the fundamental predictable outcome of trying to do trade deals with the whole world at the same time, at a time when they know the UK government is desperate to do so? Mr Fox says no, that in terms of the new trade deals, that can only get going after the UK has left the EU and its Common Commercial Policy, ""We are only going to do three - the US, Australia and New Zealand."" The government has also consulted on joining the rebranded Trans-Pacific Partnership, the CPTPP, but ""that's not possible to join because all the countries there have not yet ratified it"". The US deal is another story. But Mr Fox has sought to calm down the haste over a transatlantic deal, which he wants ""as soon as possible"". ASAP has ""a number of logistical wrinkles"", he says, principally that the US will be in the final year of a presidential term ""when it is notoriously difficult to get the attention of the Administration"". ""It's also the position now in the US that the Democrats have a majority in the House of Representatives and might not want to give the president a trade agreement this side of a presidential election. So there are a number of real-world problems."" He also acknowledged other geopolitical issues in the US-UK relationship. The role of Chinese telecoms provider Huawei, the UK tech tax, even the leaked cables from resigned former ambassador Sir Kim Darroch have all complicated the relationship. The Irish border is 310 miles long Mr Fox also revealed to BBC News that those Democrats in Congress had raised a specific and very thorny issue with him at a meeting in Washington DC this month. Asked whether the government was conscious that Democrats in the key committee were saying they could block a US-UK trade deal if there was any impact on the Irish border or Good Friday agreement, the Trade secretary replied: ""We need to be aware of it - I spoke to a number of the Democrat members of the Ways and Means committee [a key Congressional committee with oversight on trade deals] when I was in Washington two weeks ago and they did raise those issues with me, ""I was able to reassure them that both the UK government and Irish government do not want any hard border infrastructure at all to be in place, so I think they will wait and see."" A member of the US Congress confirmed to the BBC that several Democrats on the key committee raised the same point directly to the trade secretary that they would block a US-UK trade deal which saw any hardening of the Irish border. For many of the keenest advocates of junking the Irish border backstop, and leaving the customs union and single market, the entire point is to do a quick free trade deal with the US. So the clearly articulated prospect of a Congressional quagmire creates rather a paradox. All of this occurs against the backdrop of choppy global trade waters, with the US squaring up to China, and to some degree the EU too. The UK does not expect and is not getting favours. Trade deals are about brutal self-interest. Eventually they can and will be done. But there is little doubt that the ease, comfort and generosity of the rest of the world was oversold. Boris Johnson himself will remember necking some peach juice from Fukushima for his then counterpart the Japanese Foreign Minister's Twitter campaign to demonstrate safety of produce from the area of the nuclear power disaster. The UK, at the time seeking a Japanese deal, agreed to lobby the EU to lift its ban on produce from the area. There may be many more such examples to come. Does the Trade Secretary himself acknowledge it's been much harder to do these deals than sold? ""I'm not sure harder, but it's certainly more complex and it's also more interesting,"" he says. He says as the UK leaves the EU, it does so more confidently and optimistically than he could have imagined at the time of the referendum. ""But we have to do it with our eyes open and understand the problems as well as the opportunities that we might face."" The fledgling Department of International Trade certainly has had a number of wins. But it was never going to be easy to do even the basic rollover deals, and certainly not as easy as some of his political colleagues had claimed. Matters may not settle for a while yet, as the high-level trade-offs over trade policy become very high politics indeed. What trade deals has the UK done so far?

"Boris Johnson said the full details of the Leeds-Manchester route would be published in the autumn Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised a faster rail route between Leeds and Manchester, claiming the benefits would be ""colossal"". In a speech in Manchester he gave his backing to the trans-Pennine transport link to ""turbo-charge the economy"". Standing in front of Stephenson's Rocket he said mass transport systems enabled people to prosper. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said he wanted ""to see real action now to back up the prime minister's words"". Mr Johnson said the full details of the Leeds-Manchester route would be published in the autumn following the review into HS2. Businesses back 'Northern Crossrail' plan HS3 for northern England 'will happen' HS2 cost 'not worth it to create some jobs' An audience of about 100 people gathered at the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester to listen to Mr Johnson's speech. The prime minister set out the four ""ingredients"" for the success of the UK as liveability, connectivity, culture, and power and responsibility. He said this meant areas having great public services, enough affordable homes, safe streets, fast broadband, and more responsibility and accountability for local areas. HS2 would connect London, the Midlands and up to Wigan, Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds using trains capable of travelling at 250mph. The north-to-south rail line is budgeted to cost Â£56bn. The first segment - between London and Birmingham - is due to open in 2026, with the second - to Leeds and Manchester - expected to be completed by 2033. HS3 - a high-speed east-west rail link between Liverpool and Hull - and north to Newcastle was first announced by the government in 2014 but no firm commitments have been made since. In June 2019, the Department for Transport would not confirm when a decision on HS3 would be made, but estimated it could cost up to Â£39bn. He added: ""We are going to give greater powers to council leaders and communities. ""We are going to level up the powers offered to mayors so more people can benefit from the kind of local structures seen in London and here in Manchester."" Mr Johnson said young people growing up ""a few miles away"" from the centre of Manchester had felt ""hopelessness, or the hope that one day they will get out and never come back"". ""The crucial point is it certainly isn't really the fault of the places, and certainly isn't the fault of the people growing up there,"" he said. ""They haven't failed. It's we, us, the politicians, our politics has failed them."" This video can not be played The prime minister spoke of the need to ""inject some pace"" into rail plans The Northern Powerhouse rail project was part of Mr Johnson's wider commitment to deliver a high-speed railway link across the north of England, which would cost about Â£39bn. Mr Burnham said what he heard from the prime minister ""certainly sounded good"" but warned he heard ""something very similar in almost the same spot from [then Chancellor] George Osborne five years ago and, in those five years, rail services here have gone in reverse"". The mayor added: ""The focus on buses too and a London-style transport system for Greater Manchester sounded very good to me but we will have to see real action now to back up the prime minister's words. ""What about Liverpool, Sheffield, Newcastle? All of those places need a commitment. ""Commuting is a daily nightmare for people in large parts of the North - it costs Â£4 here for a single bus journey, Â£1.50 in London. How can that be right?"" Rail journeys between Leeds and Manchester are regarded as too slow and are often overcrowded National Infrastructure Commission chairman Sir John Armitt said: ""The PM's decision today must be integrated with plans for HS2, and matched with devolved funding and powers for city leaders in the North - as set out in our National Infrastructure Assessment."" Mr Johnson wore a badge saying ""Northern Powerhouse"" during the speech. Mr Johnson is backing the route between Manchester and Leeds Labour's shadow transport secretary Mr McDonald said the plans had been ""announced time and time again by the Conservatives"". He added: ""With Boris Johnson's staggering failure to build a bridge across the Thames and an estuary airport I'm not confident he'll be able to deliver better train services between Leeds and Manchester. ""What we really need is Labour's Crossrail for the North, from Liverpool to Hull and up to the North East to unleash the economic potential of the region. ""Just upgrading the rail between Leeds and Manchester - the same distance as the Central Line on the London Underground - won't achieve that."" By Spencer Stokes, BBC Look North transport correspondent Theresa May's government had said that it supported the idea of a new, fast rail route across the Pennines in principle - but it had not found the money to make it a reality. The new rail line has been claimed to have a significant impact on journey times. Leeds to Manchester could be cut from about 50 minutes to less than 30 minutes. Local authorities in the North have campaigned for extra funds for railways following years of investment in big transport projects in London such as Crossrail - and the rebuilding of several of the capital's rail stations. Attention will now turn to the precise route and if the HS2 experience is anything to go by that's when the difficulties of building a railway become apparent. Mr Johnson used the speech to state he is committed to ""rebalance power, growth and productivity across the UK"". He also said ""the unglamorous local services which people use every day"" -  such as buses - needed improving. The move could cut journey times on the trans-Pennine route between Manchester and Leeds from 50 minutes to less than 30 A survey by the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP) found companies believed the upgraded network would boost productivity and investment. NPP director Henri Murison said: ""This is a seminal moment for the North - the entire Northern Powerhouse concept is all about connecting the cities and towns of the north to boost productivity."" Leeds City Council leader Judith Blake said: ""Northern Powerhouse Rail is key to our vision for a modern, reliable transport network that delivers faster journey times, additional capacity and greater reliability and I hope the government will now work with us to accelerate delivery of this project."" The HS3 rail link would reduce journey times from Leeds to Manchester to 30 minutes PM pledge for Leeds to Manchester high-speed line.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump explains his preference for US wine US President Donald Trump has accused French President Emmanuel Macron of ""foolishness"" over a digital services tax, and hinted that he would tax French wine in retaliation. Mr Trump voiced his anger in a Tweet,externalon Friday, in response to French plans to tax multinational firms like Google. French authorities argue that the firms pay little or no corporate tax in countries where they are not based. The Trump administration has said the tax unfairly targets US tech giants. ""France just put a digital tax on our great American technology companies. If anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, the US,"" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter. ""We will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron's foolishness shortly. I've always said American wine is better than French wine!"" The French tech tax upsetting the US Facebook quizzed in court on EU-US data transfers Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained Asked about the issue in the Oval Office later, Mr Trump, who is teetotal, said: ""I've always liked American wines better than French wines. Even though I don't drink wine. I just like the way they look."" The US is the world's largest consumer of wine and the largest import market, with France consistently among the top origin countries for imported wine. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire responded on Friday by saying that France would stick to its digital tax plans. ""Universal taxation of digital operations is a challenge that affects us all,"" he said. President Macron and President Trump earlier on Friday discussed the need for an international agreement on taxing digital tech giants, the French president's office said. The French government argues that multinational firms such as Apple, which are headquartered outside the country, pay little or no tax on their sales in France. The digital sales tax was approved by the French senate on Thursday, a week after it was passed by the lower house, the National Assembly. This video can not be played The Californian trying to make wine like the French Any digital company with revenue of more than â¬750m ($850m; Â£670m) - of which at least â¬25m is generated in France - will now be subject to the tax, which will be retroactively applied from early 2019 and is expected to raise about â¬400m in revenue this year. Earlier on Friday, President Trump warned US tech giant Apple that it would not be given any tariff relief on parts made in China. ""Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!"" he wrote. At present, they are able to pay little or no corporate tax in countries where they do not have a large physical presence. They declare most of their profits where they are headquartered. The European Commission estimates that on average traditional businesses face a 23% tax rate on their profits within the EU, while internet companies typically pay 8% or 9%. France has long argued that taxes should be based on digital, not just physical presence.It announced its own tax on big technology firmslast year after EU-wide efforts stalled. An EU levy would require consensus among members, but Ireland, the Czech Republic, Sweden and Finland raised objections. France's new 3% tax will be based on sales made in the country, rather than on profits. This video can not be played French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire criticised US threats of retaliation Defending the new tax on Thursday, Mr Le Maire had said France was ""sovereign and decided its own tax rules"". ""I want to tell our American friends that this should be an incentive for them to accelerate even more our work to find an agreement on the international taxation of digital services,"" he said. About 30 companies will pay it - mostly US groups such as Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. Chinese, German, Spanish and British firms are also affected, as well as the French online advertising firm Criteo. The French government says the tax will end if a similar measure is agreed internationally. The big tech companies have argued they are complying with national and international tax laws. Prior to Mr Trump's tweet on Friday, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had announced an investigation into the French tax, arguing that France was ""unfairly targeting the tax at certain US-based technology companies"".

"This video can not be played Mr Trump says he and Mr Johnson will create a ""substantial"" US-UK trade agreement US President Donald Trump has said talks about a ""very substantial"" trade deal with the UK are under way. He said a bilateral post-Brexit deal could lead to a ""three to four, five times"" increase in current trade. There are no details about how this would be achieved. After a phone call with Boris Johnson on Friday, Mr Trump said the new prime minister would be ""great"". He added US-UK trade had previously been ""impeded"" by Britain's membership of the EU. Once the UK leaves, he said, the UK can expect to do ""much more"" trade with the US, he said. Mr Johnson and Mr Trump said they would begin formal negotiations ""as soon as possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. While the UK is in the EU, it cannot sign its own trade deals. Brexit is due to happen on 31 October. Trade deals involve two or more countries agreeing a set of terms by which they buy and sell goods and services from each other. Deals are designed to increase trade by eliminating or reducing trade barriers. These barriers might include import or export taxes (tariffs), quotas, or differing regulations on things such as safety or labelling. In short, because the US and EU do not have one. The EU customs union forbids members negotiating trade agreements separately from the EU. Instead, trade agreements are negotiated collectively. In 2013, under President Barack Obama, the US and the EU launched a programme of negotiations known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP. That proposed trade agreement was put on hold by the US after Mr Trump was elected as president, but the EU has approved new talks. A trade deal between the EU and a bloc of South American countries, including Brazil, took 20 years to finalise The EU-Canada agreement - which removed 99% of tariffs - wasseven years in the making, while theEU-South America deal agreed in Junetook 20 years to negotiate. The EU and US have been having a stop-start conversation about trade for years but a fresh round of formal talks wereonly recently approved by the EU. So even though both Mr Trump and Mr Johnson seem keen to do a deal, it could still take years, although - in theory - it is easier to negotiate with one country than a multi-national bloc. Barack Obama said in 2016a UK-US trade deal could take 10 years to negotiate if the UK left the EU. The US is a major trade and investment partner for the UK - by some measures the biggest of all. According to the Office for National Statistics'latest available figures,external, the US (including Puerto Rico) is our top trading partner. The UK-US trade relationship in five charts UK says it won't cut food standards for US Total trade (imports and exports) between the UK and US was worth Â£183.2bn in 2017, which made up 14.6% of total UK trade. The Office of the United States Trade Representative estimated thetotal trade figure for 2018,externalat $262.3bn (Â£211.9bn). TheUS Chamber of Commerce,externalsays the UK is the US' seventh largest trading partner and the fourth largest export destination for American goods and services. The UK-Swiss agreement signed in February also applies to neighbouring Liechtenstein As a member of the EU, the UK is part of about 40 trade agreements the EU has with more than 70 countries. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would lose these trade deals immediately -worth about 11% of total UK trade,external. So far the UK has agreed ""continuity"" deals with 12 countries and regions:Central America,external,Andean countries,external,Norway and Iceland,external,Caribbean countries,external,Pacific Islands,external,Liechtenstein,external,Israel,external,Palestinian Authority,external,Switzerland,external,the Faroe Islands,external,Eastern and Southern Africa,externalandChile,external. These areas account for 64% of trade currently covered by EU agreements for which the UK is seeking continuity, the government says. The agreements mostly replicate EU trade deals. In addition, the UK has also announceda deal in principle with South Korea, which is ""expected to be signed shortly"".

"Wildfires are ravaging parts of the Arctic, with areas of Siberia, Alaska, Greenland and Canada engulfed in flames and smoke. Satellite images show how the plumes of smoke from the fires, many caused by dry storms in hot weather, can be seen from space. While wildfires are common at this time of year, record-breaking summer temperatures and strong winds have made this year's fires particularly bad. They are now at""unprecedented levels"",external, says Mark Parrington, a wildfires expert at the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (Cams). Eastern Russia and Alaska, both within and outside the Arctic Circle, have been particularly badly affected. Russia's Federal Forestry Agency says more than2.7m hectares (6.7m acres) of remote forest are currently burning across six Siberian and eastern regions.,external However, Greenpeace Russia says as many as3.3m hectares are burning,external- an area bigger than Belgium. Smog has prompted several regions to declare states of emergency and smoke has blown across major cities like Novosibirsk, blotting out the sun and making it difficult for some people to breathe. The smoke from the Siberian fires has evenspread to Alaska and parts of the west coast of Canada.,external In Alaska, as of 31 July, 105 large fires had burned more than 0.7m hectares (1.78m acres). The majority of the blazes were caused by lightning strikes, according to theAlaska Interagency Coordination Center.,external Greenland is also battling a fire in Qeqqata Kommunia, close to the Arctic Circle Trail, popular with hikers. The area has been experiencing a heatwave, which has also meant thesea ice has been melting at a fast rate.,external Canada's Arctic is also suffering. One large wildfire in the Northwest Territories, inside the Arctic Circle,has burned at least 45,500 hectares (112,000 acres),externalaccording to the Northwest Territories Environment and Natural Resources agency, although the area is likely to be bigger. How wildfires start and how to stop them Why wildfires are breaking out in the 'wrong' countries New tactics in battle against wildfires The wildfires are not just having an impact on the ground. They release harmful pollutants and toxic gases into the atmosphere. Thick smoke is visible on satellite images and distinguishable from every-day clouds across vast areas of the Arctic. Nasa has traced the megatons of harmful particles in that smoke - and where they have gone. The satellite images on the left below show the fires as red dots. The globe on the right shows the concentration of black carbon particles - or soot - released by the fires. This soot can be harmful to humans and animals, entering the lungs and bloodstream. It also plays a role in global warming. Nasa scientists say the soot absorbs sunlight and warms the atmosphere. If it falls on ice or snow, it reduces reflectivity and can trap more heat, speeding up the melting process. The fires also contribute to the climate crisis by releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. They emitted an estimated 100 megatons of CO2 between 1 June and 21 July, almost the equivalent of the carbon output of Belgium in 2017, according to Cams. Although wildfires are common in the northern hemisphere between May and October, the location and intensity of these fires as well as the length of time they have been burning,has been particularly unusual,external, according to Cams. ""It is unusual to see fires of this scale and duration at such high latitudes in June,"" said Mr Parrington. ""But temperatures in the Arctic have been increasing at a much faster rate than the global average, and warmer conditions encourage fires to grow and persist once they have been ignited."" Extremely dry ground and hotter than average temperatures, combined with heat lightning and strong winds, have caused the fires to spread aggressively. The burning has been sustained by the forest ground, which consists of exposed, thawed, dried peat - a substance with high carbon content. Global satellites are now tracking a swathe of new and ongoing wildfires within the Arctic Circle. The conditions were laid in June, the hottest June for the planet yet observed in the instrumented era. The fires are releasing copious volumes of previously stored carbon dioxide and methane - carbon stocks that have in some cases been held in the ground for thousands of years. Scientists say what we're seeing is evidence of the kind of feedbacks we should expect in a warmer world, where increased concentrations of greenhouse gases drive more warming, which then begets the conditions that release yet more carbon into the atmosphere. A lot of the particulate matter from these fires will eventually come to settle on ice surfaces further north, darkening them and thus accelerating melting. It's all part of a process of amplification. Russian President Vladimir Putin hasordered the army to help tackle the firesraging in Siberia and other regions in the east. A state of emergency has been declared in parts of the republics of Buryatia and Sakha (Yakutia). Ten planes and 10 helicopters with firefighting equipment were being deployed in the regions. Many residents had been critical of the Russian authorities for not doing enough to tackle the fires. Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition calling for tougher action after Russian authorities said they were not planning to tackle wildfires in remote uninhabited areas because they were no direct threat to people. The hashtags #putouttheSiberianfires and #saveSiberianforests are currently trending on Twitter. Some argue thatthe Notre Dame fire in Parisreceived far more media attention than the forest fires. ""Remember how far the news about the Notre Dame fire spread? Now is the time to do the same about the Siberian forest fires,"" said one tweet. Another said: ""Let's not forget that nature is no less important than history. Numerous animals have lost their homes, and many of them are probably dead. Just thinking about this is painful.""

"Relations between the UK and the US are going to be ""sensational"" now Boris Johnson is in Downing Street, America's ambassador to the UK has said. Woody Johnson told the BBC the two had a lot in common in their leadership style and desire to ""get things done"". He played down the PM's criticism of Mr Trump when he was London mayor,when he called him ""stupefyingly ignorant"". And he said a no-deal Brexit would not affect the UK's ability to strike a trade deal with the US. The US president has welcomed Mr Johnson's rise to power, saying he would do a ""great job"" and even suggesting he was ""Britain Trump"". A supporter of Brexit, Mr Trump was critical of former Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiations with the EU. There have also been tensions over climate change and the US president's views on race and immigration, while a recent row over the leaking of British diplomatic cables led to the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch, the UK's ambassador in Washington. Six foreign policy issues the UK's new PM will face Trump: Johnson 'will do a great job as PM' Woody Johnson told Radio 4's Today his job was to focus on the ""things we agree on"". ""We're going to have bumps in the road, no question, but we are two great countries,"" he said. ""If we look forward optimistically between our two countries, we're going to lift all the people in this country - to independence and all the things you voted for in the referendum."" ""I think that's what the president wants and what your new prime minister wants too,"" he added. Woody Johnson said the UK would be ""front of the line"" for a trade deal with the US In 2015, Boris Johnson, as London Mayor, said Mr Trump's claim that parts of the city were ""no-go areas"" showed ""quite stupefying ignorance"" and made him unfit to be president. But Woody Johnson suggested Mr Trump was not bothered by the comments. ""The new relationship between your new prime minister and our president... it's going to be sensational,"" he said. ""Their leadership has a lot in common. Both have their own style but similarities - a clear vision of what they want to accomplish."" He said the UK would be at the ""front of the line"" for a trade deal once Brexit had happened and it was ""not imperative"" for the UK to leave the EU with an agreement to make progress. ""The president is going to try and move the ball forwards - the UK is our most important ally in security and prosperity. He knows that."" Most experts believe a free trade deal with the US will take years to complete and could be beset by difficulties over issues like food standards, environmental regulations and access to healthcare services for each other's companies. And one of the most powerful politicians in the US has said its Congress would not support any trade agreement which undermined the peace settlement in Northern Ireland. Angela Merkel has invited Boris Johnson to Berlin Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives,told the Irish Times,externalthere could be no return to physical border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, something Dublin has said would be inevitable if the UK left without a deal. ""We made it clear in our conversations with senior members of the Conservative Party earlier this year that there should be no return to a hard border on the island,"" she said. ""That position has not changed. Any trade deal between the US and Great Britain would have to be cognisant of that."" The new prime minister has not yet revealed when he will hold his first face-to-face leaders' meeting with Mr Trump. No 10 confirmed that Mr Johnson had spoken to the French President Emmanuel Macron over the phone on Thursday and they had discussed Brexit. A German government spokesperson also said the PM had discussed Brexit with Chancellor Angela Merkel during a phone call on Friday.

"The prime minster and Home Secretary Priti Patel visited Birmingham on Friday after announcing the recruitment drive The recruitment of 20,000 new police officers in England and Wales will begin within weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. The College of Policing welcomed the pledge but warned of ""logistical challenges"", partly because of concerns of a lack of instructors for training. It is ""not just getting people through the doors"", its chief executive said. Home Office figures show that forces in England and Wales lost 20,564 officers between March 2010 and March 2019. Mr Johnson said he wanted the recruitment - which will be overseen by a new national policing board - to be completed over the next three years. What's happened to police numbers? What does it take to be a police officer? Mr Johnson said: ""People want to see more officers in their neighbourhoods, protecting the public and cutting crime."" Downing Street said a recruitment campaign would begin in September, with forces held to account for meeting the target by a new board, bringing together police leaders and led by Home Secretary Priti Patel. Newly-appointed policing minister Kit Malthouse said the plans would cost around Â£500m in the first year, but said ""we still have to work out the exact number"". Asked about where the money for the new officers would come from, he said: ""In the end, that money is going to come from general taxation or indeed some of the headroom we've got fiscally on the borrowing. ""You deal with what the priority is and you make the rest fit,"" said Mr Malthouse. Forces in England and Wales lost more than 20,000 officers between 2009 and 2017 Home Office figures show the three largest forces lost the highest number of officers: the Metropolitan Police Service (2,932), West Midlands Police (2,131) and Greater Manchester Police (1,704). Cleveland Police lost the largest share of its total force - down 31% - while Surrey Police lost the smallest proportion at 0.4%. The College of Policing welcomed the recruitment pledge as a ""huge opportunity"", but warned that some forces were concerned they did not have enough training instructors and police stations to support a rapid expansion. What will 20,000 more officers cost? Fewer than one in 10 crimes solved by police Mike Cunningham, the college's chief executive, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There are a wide variety of logistical challenges that come with the recruitment process."" He said the plans could be a ""huge opportunity"" but said the new prime minister should consider ""the assessment process, the attraction, recruitment campaigns, the vetting"". ""And then of course training people, making sure they are fit for the responsibilities that they have."" Mr Malthouse told the Today programme he understood it was a ""really big target to hit"" and they were aware of the issues which may arise. He said: ""A surprising logistical issue that constrains the number of police officers is access to lockers. ""Modern police officers carry a lot of equipment and that all has to be stored somewhere overnight, as they travel to and from their home - so finding locker space is going to be the key."" The police recruitment plans will have wide appeal both for the public and the overstretched police service. But selecting, vetting, training and accommodating so many officers in a comparatively short period of time is a formidable challenge. New rules requiring candidates to have a degree or study for one on the job may restrict the number of potential applicants in some areas, while in others the competition for skilled workers is so fierce there are fears the target may not be reached. What's significant is that the recruitment campaign will be led by the Home Office and overseen by a new policing board. It suggests a return to a more centralised approach after years when ministers pursued a localism agenda, redirecting decision-making towards police and crime commissioners. Police recruitment on the scale and in the period now promised by Boris Johnson has never been done before in modern times. In the last 40 years there have been three major recruitment surges: Between 1978 and 1983 officer numbers went up by around 12,700 from 106,700 to 119,400. Between 1985 and 1991 they increased from 118,600 to 125,400, a rise of about 6,800. Between 2000 and 2005 officer numbers went up from 124,100 to 141,200, a rise of 17,100 - over five years. The National Police Chiefs' Council said a ""substantial"" growth in officer numbers would help cut crime, improve outcomes for victims and increase diversity in the workforce. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the rise in serious violence was ""deeply worrying"", and recruiting additional officers ""sends a clear message that we are committed to giving police the resources they need"". ""This is the start of a new relationship between the government and the police working even more closely together to protect the public,"" she added. But shadow policing minister, Louise Haigh, said the role of the modern officer had changed due to austerity and ""simply adding more officers"" to the beat would not change this. She added that the government must make sure they are not just replacing the officers which were cut. ""It is galling to see the very same politicians that have voted for every single cut over the past few years now admitting that they were wrong and reinvesting in the police,"" she said. Priti Patel will play a key role in the recruitment drive Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson welcomed the recruitment of extra officers but called for more investment in youth services and other solutions to tackle crime, such as the ""public health"" modelpioneered in Glasgow. ""Yes we do need more police, absolutely, but that on its own is not going to solve the problems we have with crime, in particular when you look at knife crime and the really heart-breaking surges in knife crime - young people dying on our streets, killing each other,"" she said. ""Instead, we have Boris Johnson setting out a huge increase in stop and search, which we know doesn't work."" Many police and crime commissioners - tasked with ensuring their police force is effective - have campaigned for extra resources in recent years. Responding to the recruitment drive announcement, Sussex commissioner Katy Bourne told BBC News it could help forces to bolster numbers on both the ""physical"" and ""digital"" beat. However, South Yorkshire's commissioner, Dr Alan Billings, questioned how the extra officers would be paid for - adding that council tax payers should not be asked to cover the costs. Mr Johnson first made the pledge for more police officers during his leadership campaign and included it in his first speech as prime minister outside Downing Street. The government said it would also review a pilot which makes it easier for officers to use stop and search powers, with a view to rolling it out across all forces. The change has been trialled byseven forces in England and Wales since April. What does it take to be a police officer? Have police numbers dropped? Do Boris Johnson's tax and spending plans add up?

"Mobile operator Three says it will offer 5G on all its new and existing tariffs at no extra cost, when it launches its next-generation service. Existing customers will be able to use 5G at no extra cost - if they have a compatible handset - while new contracts will include 5G as standard. One analyst said Three's pricing had ""undercut"" rivals Vodafone and EE. Both have already launched a 5G service in some major citiesbut Three will not launch its service until August. As well as faster download speeds, one of the benefits of 5G is increased network capacity. In theory, it should mean an end to network congestion in busy areas such as pop concerts or festivals. EE launched its 5G service in May.Currently its cheapest Sim-only 5G tariff costs Â£32 a month, but it comes with a 20GB data download cap. Vodafone offers a Sim-only tariff for Â£23 a month,but limits the download speed to 2 Mbps,making it slower than 4G. It charges Â£30 a month for true full-speed 5G. Three says it will offer unlimited data without a speed limit for Â£22 a month, the same price it currently charges for its 4G tariffs. The network told the BBC there was ""absolutely no throttling"". ""Our 5G is completely unrestricted and there no catches,"" a spokeswoman said. On Monday,Three was criticised after it refused callsfrom the industry regulator Ofcom to automatically cut its customers' monthly charge at the end of their contract's lock-in period.

While extreme weather events like heatwaves occur naturally, ""research shows that with climate change they are likely to become more common,perhaps occurring as regularly as every other year"",external, the Met Office says. It conducted a study last year that found that the UK was now 30 times more likely to experience heatwaves compared with the year 1750, because of ""the higher concentration of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) in the atmosphere"".

"The prime minster and Home Secretary Priti Patel visited Birmingham on Friday after announcing the recruitment drive The recruitment of 20,000 new police officers in England and Wales will begin within weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. The College of Policing welcomed the pledge but warned of ""logistical challenges"", partly because of concerns of a lack of instructors for training. It is ""not just getting people through the doors"", its chief executive said. Home Office figures show that forces in England and Wales lost 20,564 officers between March 2010 and March 2019. Mr Johnson said he wanted the recruitment - which will be overseen by a new national policing board - to be completed over the next three years. What's happened to police numbers? What does it take to be a police officer? Mr Johnson said: ""People want to see more officers in their neighbourhoods, protecting the public and cutting crime."" Downing Street said a recruitment campaign would begin in September, with forces held to account for meeting the target by a new board, bringing together police leaders and led by Home Secretary Priti Patel. Newly-appointed policing minister Kit Malthouse said the plans would cost around Â£500m in the first year, but said ""we still have to work out the exact number"". Asked about where the money for the new officers would come from, he said: ""In the end, that money is going to come from general taxation or indeed some of the headroom we've got fiscally on the borrowing. ""You deal with what the priority is and you make the rest fit,"" said Mr Malthouse. Forces in England and Wales lost more than 20,000 officers between 2009 and 2017 Home Office figures show the three largest forces lost the highest number of officers: the Metropolitan Police Service (2,932), West Midlands Police (2,131) and Greater Manchester Police (1,704). Cleveland Police lost the largest share of its total force - down 31% - while Surrey Police lost the smallest proportion at 0.4%. The College of Policing welcomed the recruitment pledge as a ""huge opportunity"", but warned that some forces were concerned they did not have enough training instructors and police stations to support a rapid expansion. What will 20,000 more officers cost? Fewer than one in 10 crimes solved by police Mike Cunningham, the college's chief executive, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There are a wide variety of logistical challenges that come with the recruitment process."" He said the plans could be a ""huge opportunity"" but said the new prime minister should consider ""the assessment process, the attraction, recruitment campaigns, the vetting"". ""And then of course training people, making sure they are fit for the responsibilities that they have."" Mr Malthouse told the Today programme he understood it was a ""really big target to hit"" and they were aware of the issues which may arise. He said: ""A surprising logistical issue that constrains the number of police officers is access to lockers. ""Modern police officers carry a lot of equipment and that all has to be stored somewhere overnight, as they travel to and from their home - so finding locker space is going to be the key."" The police recruitment plans will have wide appeal both for the public and the overstretched police service. But selecting, vetting, training and accommodating so many officers in a comparatively short period of time is a formidable challenge. New rules requiring candidates to have a degree or study for one on the job may restrict the number of potential applicants in some areas, while in others the competition for skilled workers is so fierce there are fears the target may not be reached. What's significant is that the recruitment campaign will be led by the Home Office and overseen by a new policing board. It suggests a return to a more centralised approach after years when ministers pursued a localism agenda, redirecting decision-making towards police and crime commissioners. Police recruitment on the scale and in the period now promised by Boris Johnson has never been done before in modern times. In the last 40 years there have been three major recruitment surges: Between 1978 and 1983 officer numbers went up by around 12,700 from 106,700 to 119,400. Between 1985 and 1991 they increased from 118,600 to 125,400, a rise of about 6,800. Between 2000 and 2005 officer numbers went up from 124,100 to 141,200, a rise of 17,100 - over five years. The National Police Chiefs' Council said a ""substantial"" growth in officer numbers would help cut crime, improve outcomes for victims and increase diversity in the workforce. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the rise in serious violence was ""deeply worrying"", and recruiting additional officers ""sends a clear message that we are committed to giving police the resources they need"". ""This is the start of a new relationship between the government and the police working even more closely together to protect the public,"" she added. But shadow policing minister, Louise Haigh, said the role of the modern officer had changed due to austerity and ""simply adding more officers"" to the beat would not change this. She added that the government must make sure they are not just replacing the officers which were cut. ""It is galling to see the very same politicians that have voted for every single cut over the past few years now admitting that they were wrong and reinvesting in the police,"" she said. Priti Patel will play a key role in the recruitment drive Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson welcomed the recruitment of extra officers but called for more investment in youth services and other solutions to tackle crime, such as the ""public health"" modelpioneered in Glasgow. ""Yes we do need more police, absolutely, but that on its own is not going to solve the problems we have with crime, in particular when you look at knife crime and the really heart-breaking surges in knife crime - young people dying on our streets, killing each other,"" she said. ""Instead, we have Boris Johnson setting out a huge increase in stop and search, which we know doesn't work."" Many police and crime commissioners - tasked with ensuring their police force is effective - have campaigned for extra resources in recent years. Responding to the recruitment drive announcement, Sussex commissioner Katy Bourne told BBC News it could help forces to bolster numbers on both the ""physical"" and ""digital"" beat. However, South Yorkshire's commissioner, Dr Alan Billings, questioned how the extra officers would be paid for - adding that council tax payers should not be asked to cover the costs. Mr Johnson first made the pledge for more police officers during his leadership campaign and included it in his first speech as prime minister outside Downing Street. The government said it would also review a pilot which makes it easier for officers to use stop and search powers, with a view to rolling it out across all forces. The change has been trialled byseven forces in England and Wales since April. What does it take to be a police officer? Have police numbers dropped? Do Boris Johnson's tax and spending plans add up?

"Wildfires are ravaging parts of the Arctic, with areas of Siberia, Alaska, Greenland and Canada engulfed in flames and smoke. Satellite images show how the plumes of smoke from the fires, many caused by dry storms in hot weather, can be seen from space. While wildfires are common at this time of year, record-breaking summer temperatures and strong winds have made this year's fires particularly bad. They are now at""unprecedented levels"",external, says Mark Parrington, a wildfires expert at the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (Cams). Eastern Russia and Alaska, both within and outside the Arctic Circle, have been particularly badly affected. Russia's Federal Forestry Agency says more than2.7m hectares (6.7m acres) of remote forest are currently burning across six Siberian and eastern regions.,external However, Greenpeace Russia says as many as3.3m hectares are burning,external- an area bigger than Belgium. Smog has prompted several regions to declare states of emergency and smoke has blown across major cities like Novosibirsk, blotting out the sun and making it difficult for some people to breathe. The smoke from the Siberian fires has evenspread to Alaska and parts of the west coast of Canada.,external In Alaska, as of 31 July, 105 large fires had burned more than 0.7m hectares (1.78m acres). The majority of the blazes were caused by lightning strikes, according to theAlaska Interagency Coordination Center.,external Greenland is also battling a fire in Qeqqata Kommunia, close to the Arctic Circle Trail, popular with hikers. The area has been experiencing a heatwave, which has also meant thesea ice has been melting at a fast rate.,external Canada's Arctic is also suffering. One large wildfire in the Northwest Territories, inside the Arctic Circle,has burned at least 45,500 hectares (112,000 acres),externalaccording to the Northwest Territories Environment and Natural Resources agency, although the area is likely to be bigger. How wildfires start and how to stop them Why wildfires are breaking out in the 'wrong' countries New tactics in battle against wildfires The wildfires are not just having an impact on the ground. They release harmful pollutants and toxic gases into the atmosphere. Thick smoke is visible on satellite images and distinguishable from every-day clouds across vast areas of the Arctic. Nasa has traced the megatons of harmful particles in that smoke - and where they have gone. The satellite images on the left below show the fires as red dots. The globe on the right shows the concentration of black carbon particles - or soot - released by the fires. This soot can be harmful to humans and animals, entering the lungs and bloodstream. It also plays a role in global warming. Nasa scientists say the soot absorbs sunlight and warms the atmosphere. If it falls on ice or snow, it reduces reflectivity and can trap more heat, speeding up the melting process. The fires also contribute to the climate crisis by releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. They emitted an estimated 100 megatons of CO2 between 1 June and 21 July, almost the equivalent of the carbon output of Belgium in 2017, according to Cams. Although wildfires are common in the northern hemisphere between May and October, the location and intensity of these fires as well as the length of time they have been burning,has been particularly unusual,external, according to Cams. ""It is unusual to see fires of this scale and duration at such high latitudes in June,"" said Mr Parrington. ""But temperatures in the Arctic have been increasing at a much faster rate than the global average, and warmer conditions encourage fires to grow and persist once they have been ignited."" Extremely dry ground and hotter than average temperatures, combined with heat lightning and strong winds, have caused the fires to spread aggressively. The burning has been sustained by the forest ground, which consists of exposed, thawed, dried peat - a substance with high carbon content. Global satellites are now tracking a swathe of new and ongoing wildfires within the Arctic Circle. The conditions were laid in June, the hottest June for the planet yet observed in the instrumented era. The fires are releasing copious volumes of previously stored carbon dioxide and methane - carbon stocks that have in some cases been held in the ground for thousands of years. Scientists say what we're seeing is evidence of the kind of feedbacks we should expect in a warmer world, where increased concentrations of greenhouse gases drive more warming, which then begets the conditions that release yet more carbon into the atmosphere. A lot of the particulate matter from these fires will eventually come to settle on ice surfaces further north, darkening them and thus accelerating melting. It's all part of a process of amplification. Russian President Vladimir Putin hasordered the army to help tackle the firesraging in Siberia and other regions in the east. A state of emergency has been declared in parts of the republics of Buryatia and Sakha (Yakutia). Ten planes and 10 helicopters with firefighting equipment were being deployed in the regions. Many residents had been critical of the Russian authorities for not doing enough to tackle the fires. Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition calling for tougher action after Russian authorities said they were not planning to tackle wildfires in remote uninhabited areas because they were no direct threat to people. The hashtags #putouttheSiberianfires and #saveSiberianforests are currently trending on Twitter. Some argue thatthe Notre Dame fire in Parisreceived far more media attention than the forest fires. ""Remember how far the news about the Notre Dame fire spread? Now is the time to do the same about the Siberian forest fires,"" said one tweet. Another said: ""Let's not forget that nature is no less important than history. Numerous animals have lost their homes, and many of them are probably dead. Just thinking about this is painful."" US President Donald Trump has since offered Mr Putin help in putting out the fires. By Rosie Blunt, Dominic Bailey and Lucy Rodgers. Design by Irene de la Torre Arenas and Debie Loizou.

"The UK has had its hottest July day on record - with temperatures reaching 38.1C in Cambridge on Thursday. The all-time record in the UK still stands at 38.5C recorded at Faversham, Kent, in 2003. So just how does the current hot spell compare? Only three of the top 10 hottest temperatures in the UK have been recorded in July, according to Met Office figures, the others were all in August. Records could also be broken elsewhere. Northern Ireland has the lowest record high temperature - 30.8C reached in June 1976 and again in July 1983, at Knockarevan, in County Fermanagh, and Shaw's Bridge, Belfast, respectively. Temperatures have also been high overnight, approaching the all-time record of 23.9C, set in August 1990. Met Office forecasters say temperatures overnight on Friday could hit a record-breaking 24C. The high temperatures have triggered thunderstorms - with the UK hit by more than 40,000 lightning strikes overnight on 23-24 July. More thunderstorms are expected from Thursday afternoon onwards - and a severe-weather warning has been issued for large parts of the UK. This summer still has a long way to go before it can be compared with the summer of 1976 - when the UK was sweltering under temperatures above 30C for 18 days running and on 15 of those days temperatures topped 32C. But heatwaves are becoming more common. Last year's blazing summer in the UK was said by the Met Office to have been made 30 times more likely because of climate change. Temperatures have also been soaring across Europe. After the hottest June on record, several European countries are expected to hit new highs in the next couple of days. The French city of Bordeaux has already hit its highest temperature since records began, registering 41.2C (106.1F) in the south-western city on Tuesday. More records are expected to be broken in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, when the mercury is expected to reach 40C. Summer 2018 in the UK was the equal-second warmest since 1910. Both June and July 2018 saw daytime temperatures well above average, with readings above 30C in various parts of the country, as well as more sunshine than usual. Last year also saw record high temperatures in many places across the world amid an unusually prolonged spell of hot weather.

"Mobile operator Three says it will offer 5G on all its new and existing tariffs at no extra cost, when it launches its next-generation service. Existing customers will be able to use 5G at no extra cost - if they have a compatible handset - while new contracts will include 5G as standard. One analyst said Three's pricing had ""undercut"" rivals Vodafone and EE. Both have already launched a 5G service in some major citiesbut Three will not launch its service until August. As well as faster download speeds, one of the benefits of 5G is increased network capacity. In theory, it should mean an end to network congestion in busy areas such as pop concerts or festivals. EE launched its 5G service in May.Currently its cheapest Sim-only 5G tariff costs Â£32 a month, but it comes with a 20GB data download cap. Vodafone offers a Sim-only tariff for Â£23 a month,but limits the download speed to 2 Mbps,making it slower than 4G. It charges Â£30 a month for true full-speed 5G. Three says it will offer unlimited data without a speed limit for Â£22 a month, the same price it currently charges for its 4G tariffs. The network told the BBC there was ""absolutely no throttling"". ""Our 5G is completely unrestricted and there no catches,"" a spokeswoman said. On Monday,Three was criticised after it refused callsfrom the industry regulator Ofcom to automatically cut its customers' monthly charge at the end of their contract's lock-in period. As a result, Ofcom said Three's subscribers would ""overpay"" unless they took action to change to another deal. Fact check: Does 5G pose health risks? US meteorologists worried over 5G roll-out ""The UK is rapidly becoming the most competitive market for 5G and Three's announcement raises the ante once again,"" said Kester Mann, an analyst at the CCS Insight consultancy. ""It is surely only a matter of time before all four UK operators offer unlimited 5G data."" Mr Mann said 5G was ""crucial"" for Three because it provided ""an opportunity to reinvigorate the brand, overcome a negative network perception [and] achieve the scale it has long-for craved"". But he warned that the price war made it ""increasingly challenging for operators to make a significant return on the huge investment required"". O2 will be the last of the major networks to launch a 5G service. It plans to switch on its offering in October.

Adapted by John Logan and directed by Alex Timbers - who's had recent success with Beetlejuice - the cast includes Les Miserables star Aaron Tveit as writer Christian (played in the film by Ewan McGregor), who falls in love with the beautiful courtesan Satine. She is played by Karen Olivo, a role which earned Nicole Kidman a best actress nomination at the 2000 Oscars. The film paired Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman as star-crossed lovers ""The genius of the movie was not its narrative,"" continued The Guardian's review. ""It was its lavish design... its deep knowledge that popular music unpacks our hearts and help us to feel our feelings. ""When Satine and Christian proclaim their love for each other by trading snippets of song, a set piece of the movie neatly rendered here, the effect is Shazam for the soul. Here, the original soundtrack - Lady Marmalade, Your Son - has been updated and enlarged with hits from Adele, BeyoncÃ© and, to introduce the duke, the Rolling Stones."" However, the paper had faint praise for the show's leading man Tveit adding ""a handsome face attached to a rich lyric tenor, has... all the sexual charisma of a baked potato. His scenes with Olivo seem friendly, nothing more."" So Fresh, So Clean - OutKast Never Gonna Give You Up - Rick Astley We Are Young -FUN Single Ladies - Beyonce Shut Up And Dance - Walk The Moon I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me - Whitney Houston Sympathy For The Devil/You Can't Always Get What You Want/Gimme Shelter -The Rolling Stones Don't Speak - No Doubt Bad Romance - Lady Gaga Seven Nation Army -  White Stripes Toxic - Britney Crazy - Gnarls Barkley Rolling in the Deep - Adele The stage show, which was first performed at the Emerson Colonial Theatre in Boston last year has added a number of new songs which were not in the original film. Tracks by Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Lorde, Gnarls Barkley and Adele are all referenced in the musical. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

The show has lost One Day I'll Fly Away - Kidman's impassioned torch song cover of Randy Crawford's song but retains the famous cover of Lady Marmalade, the number one hit for singers Christina Aguilera, MÃ½a, Pink and rapper Lil' Kim. ""Of course, 70 songs does not mean that they're all performed in full,""said Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos in her review,external. ""Most of the time, significant lines from the pop songs the show covers are used as operatic dialogue. This is where the show becomes disjointed: the mix of humour and earnestness meant to be elicited from the song references doesn't quite mesh and the lines between those prominent aren't properly drawn. The music magazine argued the production's stage setting means the ""fantasy is forced to be grounded in reality and loses some of the film's spectacular spectacular-ness in the process"". ""Drunk off its own accoutrements (specifically, the glossy roster of songs it packs in under three hours), the show loses touches of the emotion that made the film a modern classic in the first place."" The film's director Buz Luhrmann was in attendance at the opening night The sheer number of songs was also the main issue for the Financial Times reviewer, who accused the creators of having ""taken a large jukebox and pressed the shuffle button"". ""The film itself borrowed tracks from Elton John and Sting among others. This Moulin Rouge! reprises many of those hits while sampling dozens more, ranging from BeyoncÃ© and Lorde to The Rolling Stones and Eurythmics."" ""Unlike Luhrmann's flamboyantly shot film,"" it added, ""Alex Timbers's staging fails to conjure an arresting visual spectacle to make up for the story's paper-thin characterisation."" This musical aspires to recreate the heady blend of art and showbusiness that characterised the Moulin Rouge in its heyday. Instead it resembles the same cabaret today - tacky, expensive, full of tourists, and living off past glories. The movie, won two of its eight Oscar nominations in 2002, for  best art direction and costume design. The huge set at the Al Hirschfield theatre is built to resemble the famous Parisian attraction In an otherwise glowing four-star review,Time Out's Adam Feldman said,external: ""Like the film, John Logan's script trades in unvarnished melodrama. The characters function mostly on the level of archetype: They exist to flesh out the songs, which happily include many of the most memorable pop hits of our time. The production is reported to have cost in the region of $28m (Â£22.5m) and Time Out agreed Moulin Rouge ""looks and feels expensive"". ""It's a very fancy heart-shaped box of Valentine's Day chocolates, and though you know exactly what you're going to get, each bite is still a little surprise: sometimes gooey, sometimes nutty, sometimes fruity, sometimes sweet, sometimes stale but mostly delicious."" Some of the US's film publications and websites sent reviewers along to the first night. In a fairly lukewarm review,Deadline's Greg Evans said,external""certainly the track listing itself can be fun in a guess-what's-next, parlour-game sort of way, at least initially. Wears thin fast, though, certainly by the time we get to the end of the overlong first act"". However it conceded the ""something-for-everyone approach has its advantages - not least a steady stream of applause and recognition chuckles that make Moulin Rouge! feel like one of the liveliest shows on Broadway."" The reviewer from Variety's Marilyn Stasio agreed,external, praising the show's ability to live up to ""what Broadway actually can do for a beloved musical property: bring it to life."" No word yet on whether Moulin Rouge! will transfer to London's West End ""In the film,"" it said, ""the plot is yet another tragic story of mismatched lovers... I'm not sick of it, and nor should you be. Tales about true love transcending divergent social origins and personal destinies never go out of fashion."" Not to appear understated, The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney,externalsaid: ""The show is A LOT, in every sense, both intoxicating and exhausting in its unrelenting visual and sonic assault. But it virtually defies you not to be entertained."" Calling it a ""wildly extravagant production"", the trade papers said there is ""no mystery as to where its reported $28 million budget has been spent. Negotiating the music rights alone must have cost a small fortune, while the sumptuous design elements induce whiplash as you try to take them all in."" Moulin Rouge! The Musical, it concluded ""is definitely all about the emphatic exclamation point, rarely about the subtler moments, and it could just as easily play Vegas as Broadway. ""It's a postmodern La Boheme on hallucinogens."" Los Angeles mayor to give update on wildfires as more residents told to evacuate What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Mike Ashley's High Street empire There is confusion surrounding the release of results from Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, after the firm failed to publish them throughout Friday. In a statement, Sports Direct said it was ""still finalising"" the results, and would give a further update at 16:00. However, that deadline has now passed and the firm's share price has closed down 3.9%. It is extremely unusual for results to be delayed in this way - one analyst called events ""an utter shambles"". The full-year resultshave already been delayed once- originally they were due to be reported on 18 July. At the time, Sports Direct blamed the delay on uncertainty over the future trading performance of the House of Fraser chain, which it bought last year, as well as increased scrutiny of its auditor Grant Thornton. It also indicated that it might not achieve its profits forecast. UK-listed companies normally publish their results at 07:00, before the London markets open at 08:00. Sports Direct had also been due to give a presentation to investors and media at 09:00. However, after the results failed to arrive, the firm apologised for the delay and for cancelling the presentation at the last minute. At midday Sports Direct said it would provide an update at 14:00. Shortly after that time, the company issued a statement that said: ""We are still finalising our preliminary results and will update you again at 16:00."" Trading on the stock market closed at 16:30 without a further update or sign of Sports Direct's results. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said the events were ""a total and utter shambles"" that ""betrays a number of problems at the business after [Mr] Ashley embarked on his rather random acquisition spree."" ""Above all it betrays a total disregard for shareholders,"" he said. By Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance reporter Unprecedented, bizarre, shambolic - just some of the adjectives being used to describe the non-appearance of Sports Direct's annual results today. Stockmarket traders have been scratching their heads trying to remember any examples of a company which failed to deliver figures in such an exasperating fashion. First, a delay of more than a week. Then, today, a series of updates providing no update at all. The episode has caused concern, along with speculation about whether Sports Direct's auditor, Grant Thornton has continued to have problems approving the numbers. On the other hand, the shares have weathered the uncertainty better than might have been feared. They are down 3.9%.

"Boris Johnson has said he will ""absolutely"" not call a general election before the latest Brexit deadline of 31 October. Speaking during a visit in Birmingham, the prime minister said voters did not want another general election or a referendum. ""What they want us to do is deliver on their mandate to come out of the EU,"" he added. Mr Johnson's comments come as he continues to appoint new ministers. Asked whether he could provide an assurance an election would not take place before the end of October, Mr Johnson replied, ""absolutely"". ""We want to, and we are going to, deliver on the mandate of the people, which is to take the UK out of the EU whole and entire on 31 October,"" he said. Could there be an early general election? Sturgeon and Johnson hold telephone talks Johnson accused of setting UK on 'collision course' The new PM continues to make changes to lower-ranked jobs, following a radical overhaul of his cabinet on Wednesday. Among the changes announced on Friday, Nick Hurd becomes a Northern Ireland minister, George Freeman has been given a transport brief, and Michael Ellis becomes the new solicitor general. Tobias Ellwood lost his job as a defence minister, but said he would support Mr Johnson as a backbench MP and make the case for further defence spending. Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, who had been a junior housing minister and junior minister at the Wales Office, said he was quitting government over Mr Johnson's Brexit strategy. Heposted on Twitter,externalthat he had been asked to continue in both roles, but declined because ""I cannot accept a no deal on 31 October"". Mr Johnson also confirmed he would change his own official title to include ""Minister for the Union"" - a pledge he made during his leadership campaign. A Downing Street spokesperson said this was a ""statement of his commitment"" to strengthening ties between the constituent parts of the UK. Who is in charge of what?

Among a series of ministerial changesannounced on Thursday, long-time ally Kit Malthouse was given a role taking over policing at the Home Office, and George Eustice returned to an environment brief. Chloe Smith keeps her role at the Cabinet Office Choosing a team is a hard job for prime ministers, with the possibility that those sacked - and those overlooked for a role - will become embittered. On Thursday, former Brexit minister Steve Baker turned down a return to a junior job within the Department for Exiting the European Union.

As chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a senior ministerial role without a specific portfolio, he will chair a number of key committees and taskforces.

"This video can not be played Mike Ashley's High Street empire There is confusion surrounding the release of results from Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, after the firm failed to publish them throughout Friday. In a statement, Sports Direct said it was ""still finalising"" the results, and would give a further update at 16:00. However, that deadline has now passed and the firm's share price has closed down 3.9%. It is extremely unusual for results to be delayed in this way - one analyst called events ""an utter shambles"". The full-year resultshave already been delayed once- originally they were due to be reported on 18 July. At the time, Sports Direct blamed the delay on uncertainty over the future trading performance of the House of Fraser chain, which it bought last year, as well as increased scrutiny of its auditor Grant Thornton. It also indicated that it might not achieve its profits forecast. UK-listed companies normally publish their results at 07:00, before the London markets open at 08:00. Sports Direct had also been due to give a presentation to investors and media at 09:00. However, after the results failed to arrive, the firm apologised for the delay and for cancelling the presentation at the last minute. At midday Sports Direct said it would provide an update at 14:00. Shortly after that time, the company issued a statement that said: ""We are still finalising our preliminary results and will update you again at 16:00."" Trading on the stock market closed at 16:30 without a further update or sign of Sports Direct's results. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said the events were ""a total and utter shambles"" that ""betrays a number of problems at the business after [Mr] Ashley embarked on his rather random acquisition spree."" ""Above all it betrays a total disregard for shareholders,"" he said. By Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance reporter Unprecedented, bizarre, shambolic - just some of the adjectives being used to describe the non-appearance of Sports Direct's annual results today. Stockmarket traders have been scratching their heads trying to remember any examples of a company which failed to deliver figures in such an exasperating fashion. First, a delay of more than a week. Then, today, a series of updates providing no update at all. The episode has caused concern, along with speculation about whether Sports Direct's auditor, Grant Thornton has continued to have problems approving the numbers. On the other hand, the shares have weathered the uncertainty better than might have been feared. They are down 3.9%.

"Ransomware outbreaks can cost large businesses and organisations millions A free scheme to prevent cyber-attack victims paying ransom to hackers claims to have saved more than 200,000 victims at least $108m (Â£86m). The No More Ransom project,externaloffers advice and software to recover computer files encrypted in ransomware attacks. Founded by Europol, police in the Netherlands, and McAfee, it now has more than 150 global partners. With 14 new tools introduced in 2019 alone, Europol says it can now decrypt 109 different types of infection. ""When we take a close look at ransomware, we see how easy a device can be infected in a matter of seconds,"" says Steven Wilson, head of Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). ""A wrong click and databases, pictures and a life of memories can disappear forever. ""No More Ransom brings hope to the victims, a real window of opportunity, but also delivers a clear message to the criminals: the international community stands together with a common goal, operational successes are and will continue to bring the offenders to justice."" This video can not be played Technology explained: What is ransomware? Among the ransomware campaigns tackled by the project is GandCrab - one of the most aggressive in 2018. Since the release of the first GandCrab tool in February 2018, nearly 40,000 people have successfully decrypted their files, saving roughly $50m in ransom payments. In 2019, there has been a surge in ransomware attacks particularly aimed at large companies. One company, Norsk Hydro, has already spent well over Â£50m recovering from an attack in Marchthat halted production lines and locked staff out of their computers. In the US, multiple local government authorities have been hit with ransomware attacks, some choosing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to hackers. After South Korea, most web traffic to No More Ransom comes from the US. However, the US is not a partner in the project. The full partners consist of 36 law enforcement agencies from Europe, Asia and South America. The US should be doing more to help victims and tackle cyber-criminals, says Fabian Wosar, head of cyber-security company Emsisoft, which has donated more decryption tools to the project than anyone else. Mr Wosar told BBC News: ""Projects like No More Ransom have been crucial when it comes to fighting ransomware on a global level, with pretty much all major parties cooperating on a global and daily basis, sharing intel[igence] in real-time - except for the US. ""The US should consider the success of the No More Ransom Project to be a call to action. ""Better cooperation between the private sector and law enforcement could result in fewer ransom demands being paid. ""That would make cyber-crime less profitable and, consequently, reduce the financial incentive for groups to commit cyber-crime.""
