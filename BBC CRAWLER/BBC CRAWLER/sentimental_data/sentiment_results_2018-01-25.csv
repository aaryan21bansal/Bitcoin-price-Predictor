"Police and guards have been deployed to keep order Hardline Hindus angered by a Bollywood film have threatened cinema-goers and clashed with police in northern India. Reports say a cinema owner in Uttar Pradesh was attacked. Several other theatres in the state and in neighbouring Bihar were also targeted. Hardline Hindu groups allege the film Padmaavat is disrespectful of their culture by depicting a romance between a Hindu queen and a Muslim king. The producers deny this. The release was delayed for two months by protests. Many theatres across India have said that they will not screen the film, fearing further violence. But despite the threats, the film still opened in 5,000 cinemas in many parts of the country. Some cinema-goers in Delhi said there was nothing controversial in the movie. ""All the ruckus that is going on is uncalled for,"" one viewer told the BBC after watching the film. This video can not be played Deepika Padukone plays Queen Padmavati in the film The Supreme Court rejected a bid by four states that wanted the film banned for security reasons, saying it was their responsibility to ensure law and order. On Wednesday, footage of mobs attacking a bus carrying students in Gurgaon, near Delhi, caused outrage. It is unclear why the mob attacked the vehicle, which was clearly marked as a school bus.A video of the attack,externalshowed scared students ducking under the seat as the bus was pelted with stones. No children were injured in the incident, but protesters burned a number of other buses, and have also vandalised cinemas over the last few days. Bollywood stars Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh play the lead roles. The film tells the story of 14th Century Muslim emperor Alauddin Khilji's attack on a kingdom after he was smitten by the beauty of its queen, Padmavati, who belonged to the Hindu Rajput caste. Bollywood memoir kicks up storm about being gay in India Bollywood film accused of distorting history Why is Bollywood film PK controversial? Hindu groups and a Rajput caste organisation allege that the movie includes a scene in which the Muslim king dreams of becoming intimate with the Hindu queen. But director Sanjay Leela Bhansali has saidthe film does not feature such a ""dream sequence"" at all,external. But rumours of such a scene were enough to enrage right-wing Hindu groups. Divya Arya, Women Affairs, BBC World service, Delhi The film Padmaavat does not depict a romance between a Hindu queen and a Muslim king, as has been alleged by protesters over the last few months. Neither is there a dream sequence between the two, nor does the Hindu queen Padmavati dance in front of strangers or wear outfits that are revealing. In fact, the outrage against the film should be directed at the glamorised portrayal of mass self-immolation, or ""jauhar"", led by Padmavati. She and hundreds of women take their lives by jumping into a fire to escape being captured by the Muslim king. The women's desperate end is celebrated and glorified in a violent build-up to the film's climax, again emphasising the importance of the community and a husband's honour over the life of a woman. While Khilji is a historical figure, historians believe that Padmavati is fictional. The name of the queen, and the plot of the film, are believed to be based on an epic poem, Padmaavat, by 16th Century poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi. Some cinema owners are not screening the film as they fear more violence The film has sparked angry protests for months The poem extols the virtue of Padmavati who committed jauhar to protect her honour from Khilji who had killed her husband, the Rajput king, in a battle. Jauhar, the mass self-immolation by women to avoid enslavement and rape by foreign invaders, is believed to have originated some 700 years ago among the ruling class or Rajputs in India. Women in the community set themselves alight after their men were defeated in battles to avoid being taken by the victors. But it came to be seen as a measure of wifely devotion in later years.

"Growing concerns about a possible nuclear war and other global threats have pushed forward the symbolic Doomsday Clock by 30 seconds - to just two minutes before midnight. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) said it had acted because the world was becoming ""more dangerous"". The clock, created by the journal in 1947, is a metaphor for how close mankind is to destroying the Earth. It is now the closest to the apocalypse it has been since 1953. That was the year when the US and the Soviet Union tested hydrogen bombs. Last year,the clock was also moved forward by 30 seconds. Announcing the move in Washington DC on Thursday, the BAS said the decision ""wasn't easy"" and saidit was not based on a single factor,external. However, BAS President and CEO Rachel Bronson said that ""in this year's discussions, nuclear issues took centre stage once again"". The team of scientists singled out a series of nuclear tests by North Korea.They dramatically escalated tensions on the Korean peninsulaand led to a war of words between North Korea and the US. The BAS also referred to a new US nuclear strategy that was expected to call for more funding to expand the role of the country's nuclear arsenal. Rising tension between Russia and the West was also a contributing factor. The ""weakening of institutions"" around the world in dealing with major global threats - including climate change - was another major concern, the scientists said. They also mentioned US President Donald Trump's ""unpredictability"", pointing to his often controversial tweets and statements. Trump's year on Twitter: Who has he criticised and praised the most? The minute hand on the Doomsday Clock is a metaphor for how vulnerable to catastrophe the world is deemed to be. This video can not be played WATCH: Here's how the Doomsday Clock changed from 1947 up to last year. The symbolic device was created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1947. It was founded at the University of Chicago in 1945 by a group of scientists who helped develop the first atomic weapons. Today, the group includes physicists and environmental scientists from around the world, who decide whether to adjust the clock in consultation with the group's Board of Sponsors - which includes Nobel laureates. When it was created in 1947, the clock's hand stood at seven minutes to midnight. Since then it has changed more than 20 times, ranging from two minutes to midnight to 17 minutes before midnight in 1991. But during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis - considered by many analysts to be the closest the Cold War face-off between the US and the USSR came to escalating into a nuclear war - the Doomsday Clock stood still at seven minutes to midnight. The BAS says: ""The answers to this seeming anomaly are that the Doomsday Clock captures trends and takes into account the capacity of leaders and societies to respond to crises with reasoned actions to prevent nuclear holocaust. ""The Cuban Missile Crisis, for all its potential and ultimate destruction, only lasted a few weeks; however, the lessons were quickly apparent when the United States and the Soviet Union installed the first hotline between the two capitals to improve communications, and, of course, negotiated the 1963 test ban treaty, ending all atmospheric nuclear testing."" In fact, the Doomsday Clock was moved back to 12 minutes to midnight in 1963.

"The winter flu outbreak appears to be peaking, health officials say. Officials are hopeful the worst of the season may soon be over after a fall in the numbers being admitted to hospital. While the numbers still remain ""very high"" - around 4,000 in England last week - the rate of hospitalisation was lower than the week before. The numbers coming to see their GP have fallen in Scotland and Northern Ireland, although small rises have been seen in England and Wales. Public Health England's Richard Pebody said the fact flu rates had stabilised was a good sign and suggested ""flu activity is starting to peak"". NHS officials also welcomed the news, but warned the health service was still in the middle of a very difficult winter. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""There are still huge numbers of patients being seen in general practice with flu and other common winter conditions - and GPs and our teams are certainly feeling the pressure."" And Phillippa Hentsch of NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, said the system was working ""beyond its limits"" in some places, with hospitals overcrowded and ""struggling to cope with demand"".

"This video can not be played Goldman boss on Brexit point of no return The boss of Goldman Sachs has warned that the US bank's contingency planning is reaching the point of no return. The bank's chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, told the BBC some steps already taken to deal with Brexit were now very unlikely to be reversed. At some point the steps are ""not going to be undone"", Mr Blankfein said. For example, some contracts between Goldman Sachs UK and EU clients have been redrawn, or ""repapered"", to apply to Goldman Sachs Germany. ""Once we start to repaper - which is very cumbersome because it involves lots of lawyers on both sides and takes months - once we start that are we going to go back? Probably not,"" Mr Blankfein told the BBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""We've already done some and we have told our clients that more is coming,"" he said. When asked exactly when the final point of no return would arrive, he said it was not a binary thing but a gradual process. ""Every month, incremental steps are taken and at some point we do things that are not going to be undone."" The company has already taken 10 floors of a building in Frankfurt while still building a new HQ in London. Mr Blankfein has taken to Twitter to send a message to the UK government that first, he may not fill the UK headquarters and second, how much he likes Frankfurt. He added a little more context today. ""Look, I like Frankfurt because I have to like Frankfurt,"" he said. The Goldman boss' report on his lunchtime meeting with the prime minister in Davos was interesting. First, he said he was told there was no chance of a second referendum. That's interesting because it reflects the widely held belief in Davos that there is still a scenario in which the UK doesn't leave the EU. More from Davos on the BBC JP Morgan boss warns on Brexit job losses ""I asked whether there was anything that might come up that might make people reconsider this awesome and irreversible decision - but I'm told that's not on the cards,"" Mr Blankfein said. Second, he was told he may have to trust the government there will be a transition period, during which the status quo holds before the terms of that transition have been agreed. A position he didn't seem very happy about. The Goldman boss talked about Brexit with Theresa May in Davos ""We may have to rely on the promise of a transition, suspend our march [out of the UK] and yet not be entirely sure it gets accomplished. So we may have to make a leap of faith - which is a little dangerous for us,"" he said. Goldman Sachs does not expose itself to risk like that - particularly when dealing with a government which Mr Blankfein describes as ""feeling its way"" through these negotiations. The government, for its part, said both the EU and UK are in agreement to ""a time-limited implementation period which would be mutually beneficial"". During this period, the UK and the EU should continue to have access to one another's markets on current terms, a government spokesman said. The only thing Lloyd Blankfein seemed confident about is that whatever happens, a bank that has built a formidable reputation for execution - in English that means getting important stuff done right - will be ready for 1 April 2019, even if the UK government isn't.

"The teeth are in the upper size range of what's seen in modern humans Researchers have identified the remains of the earliest known modern humans to have left Africa. New dating of fossils from Israel indicates that our species (Homo sapiens) lived outside Africa around 185,000 years ago, some 80,000 years earlier than the previous evidence. Details appearin the journal Science.,external The co-lead researcher, Prof Israel Hershkovitz, told BBC News that the discovery would fundamentally alter ideas of recent human evolution. ""We have to rewrite the whole story of human evolution, not just for our own species but all the other species that lived outside of Africa at the time,"" the researcher, fromTel Aviv University,external, explained. Prof Chris Stringer ofLondon's Natural History Museum,external, who was not involved in the study, said: ""The find breaks the long-established 130,000-year-old limit on modern humans outside of Africa. Misliya Cave is located 90m above mean sea level ""The new dating hints that there could be even olderHomo sapiensfinds to come from the region of western Asia."" The new scientific dating evidence raises the possibility that modern humans interacted with other, now extinct, species of humans for tens of thousands of years. It also fits in with recent discoveries of remains and genetic studies that also indicate an earlier departure from Africa. The researchers analysed a fragment of a jawbone with eight teeth, found in Misliya cave in 2002. The jawbone looked as if it was from a modern human rather than from one of the other species of human that existed at the time. It is only now that an international research team has conclusively shown that the archaeologists' initial gut feelings were spot on. The researchers confirmed that the jawbone belonged to a modern human by carrying out computed tomography (CT) scans of it, building up a 3D virtual model and comparing it with archaic human fossils from Africa, Europe and Asia - as well as modern human remains. Separate scans also enabled the researchers to probe the tissue beneath the tooth crowns, which was found to be uniquely associated with modern humans. Three separate dating methods, conducted in three separate laboratories unaware of the others' results concluded that the fossilised remains were between 177,000 and 194,000 years old. Before that, the oldest evidence of humans outside Africa came from the Skhul and Qafzeh archaeological sites in Israel, and were dated to between 90,000 and 125,000 years ago. The researchers found ashy sediment from campfires, which were built repeatedly during the long occupation of the cave The Misliya remains were found in a layer containing stone tools that belong to the Levallois type, which was used in the region between 250,000 and 140,000 years ago. If Levallois tools are associated with the spread of modern humans into the area, it suggests that our species may have journeyed beyond Africa even earlier than the dates for the Misliya material. Until recently, early evidence for excursions outside Africa byHomo sapienswas limited to the Levant. But in the last few years, discoveries of modern human fossils fromDaoxian,externalandZhirendong,externalin China dated to between 80,000 and 120,000 years ago suggest early waves of migration pushed further into Eurasia than previously supposed. In addition, genetic studies have turned up signs of early interbreeding between African humans and our evolutionary relatives the Neanderthals. Last year, researchers published evidence from German Neanderthal remains ofmixing that occurred between 219,000 and 460,000 years ago,external. And in 2016, a team found signs that pioneer groups from Africainterbred with Neanderthals in the Altai region of Siberia,externalabout 100,000 years ago. ""We had so many new pieces of evidence and we didn't know where they fitted,"" said Prof Hershkovitz. ""Now with the new discovery, all the pieces fall into place - an exodus possibly as early as 250,000 years ago, which is the date of the tools found in the Misliya Cave."" However, the early excursions into Eurasia by AfricanHomo sapiensrepresented at Misliya are generally thought to have ended in extinction. Findings from genetics and archaeology suggest that present-day people living outside Africa trace their ancestry to an exodus just 60,000 years ago. Most DNA studies have failed to find evidence of these older migrations in our genes. Other discoveries have shed light on when humans in Africa evolved to become anatomically modern. Last year, a team announced that fossils thought to be early versions ofHomo sapiensin Morocco had been dated to about 315,000 years ago. This is much earlier than the generally accepted 200,000-year date for the origin of our species, which is based on genetic studies and fossil finds such as the 195,000-year-old Omo remains from Ethiopia. And it's possible that future discoveries might push the date back even further.

"A man who claims he was abused by former youth football coach Barry Bennell said he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The alleged victim told Liverpool Crown Court he stayed at Mr Bennell's house during school holidays, when he played as a schoolboy for Crewe Alexandra. He said since reporting the allegations to police he has experienced ""violent nightmares"" about 64-year-old Bennell. Mr Bennell denies offences against 11 complainants between 1979 and 1990. He said that there were three separate incidents involving Mr Bennell. But he said fellow youth footballers later told him he might have also been abused in his sleep. He said his peers witnessed Mr Bennell touching him while he was sleeping on the sofa. The man said Mr Bennell, now known as Richard Jones, first touched him when he was sitting next to him on the sofa watching Nightmare on Elm Street. He added that when he flinched, Mr Bennell stopped touching him and began watching the film again. He described two further incidents in a bunk bed. He told the court the coach left the room after he kicked out and tried to move away from him. He decided to go to the police after seeing media coverage of other former youth players alleging abuse by Mr Bennell in 2016. He told the court: ""I feel guilty because I never said anything. ""I now know the level of abuse that some of the others would have gone through for sustained periods and if I said something, and I know everyone else probably feels the same, but if I had said something maybe that could have stopped."" He said he was approached by police in the 1990s, but denied having been abused by Mr Bennell. ""I didn't want to open the box in my head, I just wanted to forget about it,"" he said. Defending counsel Eleanor Laws QC said: ""I suggest to you, you rather got swept up in these allegations and that what you have said Barry Bennell did to you is not the truth."" He replied: ""I totally disagree."" Mr Bennell denies 35 counts of indecent assault, 11 serious sexual assaults and two counts of attempted sexual assault, on boys aged between eight and 14.

"John Worboys was convicted of 19 offences in 2009 Sadiq Khan has lodged an application for a judicial review into the decision to release rapist John Worboys. The black cab driver is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. Two of his victims have also started proceedings against the decision. The London mayor said the ""astonishing and deeply concerning decision"" made by the Parole Board to release him ""simply cannot go unchallenged"". Worboys, 60, was jailed for a minimum term of eight years in 2009. He was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP) after being convicted of 19 offences at Croydon Crown Court. Reality Check: Could Worboys be banned from London? The cabbie who preyed on young women Fresh Worboys sex attack claim investigated After a hearing about his case in November, the Parole Board decided to approve his release with ""stringent"" licence conditions. Chairman Nick Hardwick has said the board was ""confident"" Worboys would not reoffend. However, the mayor of London said the decision ""must be properly scrutinised in the courts."" Sadiq Khan said the Parole Board's decision ""simply cannot go unchallenged"" Letters received by Worboys' victims following his conviction suggested the black cab driverhad received a life sentence""to all intents and purposes"". At his trial, jurors heard Worboys picked up his victims in London's West End and gave them champagne laced with sedatives, claiming he had won the lottery or had won money at casinos. A judicial review is where a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision made by a public body - in this case, the Parole Board. It is less about whether the decision was right or wrong, and more about challenging whether proper procedures were followed to reach the decision. He was convicted of one rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges. Harriet Wistrich, the women's solicitor, says she has been contacted by a number of other victims of Worboys and will be presenting a dossier of cases to police and the Crown Prosecution Service requesting they investigate further and prosecute. The dossier includes two previously unreported cases from 2002 and 2003 and two cases that were investigated by police that would pass the evidential threshold but have not been prosecuted. Scotland Yard is currently investigating a new sexual assault allegation made against Worboys which was reported to them this month. No arrests have been made.

"Police and guards have been deployed to keep order Hardline Hindus angered by a Bollywood film have threatened cinema-goers and clashed with police in northern India. Reports say a cinema owner in Uttar Pradesh was attacked. Several other theatres in the state and in neighbouring Bihar were also targeted. Hardline Hindu groups allege the film Padmaavat is disrespectful of their culture by depicting a romance between a Hindu queen and a Muslim king. The producers deny this. The release was delayed for two months by protests. Many theatres across India have said that they will not screen the film, fearing further violence. But despite the threats, the film still opened in 5,000 cinemas in many parts of the country. Some cinema-goers in Delhi said there was nothing controversial in the movie. ""All the ruckus that is going on is uncalled for,"" one viewer told the BBC after watching the film. This video can not be played Deepika Padukone plays Queen Padmavati in the film The Supreme Court rejected a bid by four states that wanted the film banned for security reasons, saying it was their responsibility to ensure law and order. On Wednesday, footage of mobs attacking a bus carrying students in Gurgaon, near Delhi, caused outrage. It is unclear why the mob attacked the vehicle, which was clearly marked as a school bus.A video of the attack,externalshowed scared students ducking under the seat as the bus was pelted with stones. No children were injured in the incident, but protesters burned a number of other buses, and have also vandalised cinemas over the last few days. Bollywood stars Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh play the lead roles. The film tells the story of 14th Century Muslim emperor Alauddin Khilji's attack on a kingdom after he was smitten by the beauty of its queen, Padmavati, who belonged to the Hindu Rajput caste. Bollywood memoir kicks up storm about being gay in India Bollywood film accused of distorting history Why is Bollywood film PK controversial? Hindu groups and a Rajput caste organisation allege that the movie includes a scene in which the Muslim king dreams of becoming intimate with the Hindu queen. But director Sanjay Leela Bhansali has saidthe film does not feature such a ""dream sequence"" at all,external. But rumours of such a scene were enough to enrage right-wing Hindu groups. Divya Arya, Women Affairs, BBC World service, Delhi The film Padmaavat does not depict a romance between a Hindu queen and a Muslim king, as has been alleged by protesters over the last few months. Neither is there a dream sequence between the two, nor does the Hindu queen Padmavati dance in front of strangers or wear outfits that are revealing. In fact, the outrage against the film should be directed at the glamorised portrayal of mass self-immolation, or ""jauhar"", led by Padmavati. She and hundreds of women take their lives by jumping into a fire to escape being captured by the Muslim king. The women's desperate end is celebrated and glorified in a violent build-up to the film's climax, again emphasising the importance of the community and a husband's honour over the life of a woman. While Khilji is a historical figure, historians believe that Padmavati is fictional. The name of the queen, and the plot of the film, are believed to be based on an epic poem, Padmaavat, by 16th Century poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi. Some cinema owners are not screening the film as they fear more violence The film has sparked angry protests for months The poem extols the virtue of Padmavati who committed jauhar to protect her honour from Khilji who had killed her husband, the Rajput king, in a battle. Jauhar, the mass self-immolation by women to avoid enslavement and rape by foreign invaders, is believed to have originated some 700 years ago among the ruling class or Rajputs in India. Women in the community set themselves alight after their men were defeated in battles to avoid being taken by the victors. But it came to be seen as a measure of wifely devotion in later years.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Mummy is distant ancestor Scientists in the Swiss city of Basel have solved a decades-old mystery over the identity of a mummified woman. Their research revealed a surprise: the woman is the great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother of UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. The body was uncovered in 1975 while renovations were being done on Basel's BarfÃ¼sser Church. She was buried right in front of the altar, clearly well fed, and wearing good quality clothes. This was obviously the body of a wealthy lady of Basel. But who was she exactly, and when did she die? There was no gravestone to indicate her identity, but initial testing of her wooden coffin suggested it dated from the 16th Century. Another clue: her body was riddled with mercury - a standard treatment for syphilis from the late 15th to the 19th Century. Highly toxic mercury treatment was more often a kill than a cure and it was this that preserved her body. But that still left open the question of who she was. Boris Johnson: A history of undiplomacy Johnson under pressure over jailed mum case Boris Johnson's dad in I'm A Celebrity Basel in the 16th and 17th Centuries was a wealthy trading city; its port on the river Rhine was a key hub for moving goods across Europe, and it remains so today. Local historians knew that members of Basel's wealthy families were buried in and around the BarfÃ¼sser Church. This video can not be played For centuries, BarfÃ¼sser Church held clues to the ancestral history of Boris Johnson's family. Some were clearly named in records, some had clearly marked gravestones. But not the mummy. It only became clear in 2017, in newly discovered archives, that the mummy had been uncovered once before, in 1843. Those records led historians to suspect the mummy was a member of a well-established Basel family, the Bischoffs. Using the most up to date methods, scientists were able to extract DNA material from the mummy's big toe. Scientists have used DNA testing to establish the mummy's identity This was compared, by scientists working independently from one another, with DNA taking from living descendants of the Bischoff family. The results were clear, showing a 99.8% probability that the descendants and the mummy were all from the same maternal line. Now the scientists and the historians were sure: the mummy was none other than Anna Catharina Bischoff. Born in Basel in 1719, she died there in 1787. Once her identity had been established, genealogists were able - with the help of the efficient records of births, marriages, and deaths which tend to be kept by the wealthier classes - to trace more of Anna Catharina's descendants. An artist's impression gives an idea of how researchers think Anna Catharina Bischoff might have looked She had seven children. Only two survived childhood, but one daughter, also Anna, married a certain Christian Hubert Baron Pfeffel von Kriegelstein. Five generations of von Pfeffels later, and we find Marie Luise von Pfeffel marrying one Stanley Fred Williams. Their daughter Yvonne married Osman Wilfred Johnson Kemalâ¦ and their son, Stanley Johnson, is British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's father. The five-star review that changed my life The protester who is a social media hero The church that thrives in a ghost town Boris Johnson had already been aware of the von Pfeffel connections, having once told theBBC programme Who Do You Think You Are?that they were ""posh toffs"". He was clearly delighted by the discovery of his ancestor. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After hearing of the find, Stanley Johnson told the BBC he thought it was ""most brilliant"" that scientists had managed to make the connection. ""I think she's rather nice,"" he said of his ancestor. But what of Anna Catharina herself? Did she, to borrow a phrase from her seven-times great grandson, live a life of blameless domesticity? In fact she seems to have. Many of Anna Catharina Bischoff's descendants - including Stanley Johnson (right) and Rachel Johnson - are in the public eye She married a church minister, and lived for much of her adult life in Strasbourg. There, it is believed, she may have contracted syphilis while caring for patients with the sexually transmitted disease. On the death of her husband she returned to her home town of Basel, and apparently underwent rigorous mercury treatment in the hope of a cure. It did not work: scientists believe Anna Catharina probably died from mercury poisoning. But the mercury also preserved her body - allowing today's researchers to find out exactly who she was, and who her descendants are.

"Growing concerns about a possible nuclear war and other global threats have pushed forward the symbolic Doomsday Clock by 30 seconds - to just two minutes before midnight. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) said it had acted because the world was becoming ""more dangerous"". The clock, created by the journal in 1947, is a metaphor for how close mankind is to destroying the Earth. It is now the closest to the apocalypse it has been since 1953. That was the year when the US and the Soviet Union tested hydrogen bombs. Last year,the clock was also moved forward by 30 seconds. Announcing the move in Washington DC on Thursday, the BAS said the decision ""wasn't easy"" and saidit was not based on a single factor,external. However, BAS President and CEO Rachel Bronson said that ""in this year's discussions, nuclear issues took centre stage once again"". The team of scientists singled out a series of nuclear tests by North Korea.They dramatically escalated tensions on the Korean peninsulaand led to a war of words between North Korea and the US. The BAS also referred to a new US nuclear strategy that was expected to call for more funding to expand the role of the country's nuclear arsenal. Rising tension between Russia and the West was also a contributing factor. The ""weakening of institutions"" around the world in dealing with major global threats - including climate change - was another major concern, the scientists said. They also mentioned US President Donald Trump's ""unpredictability"", pointing to his often controversial tweets and statements. Trump's year on Twitter: Who has he criticised and praised the most? The minute hand on the Doomsday Clock is a metaphor for how vulnerable to catastrophe the world is deemed to be. This video can not be played WATCH: Here's how the Doomsday Clock changed from 1947 up to last year. The symbolic device was created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1947. It was founded at the University of Chicago in 1945 by a group of scientists who helped develop the first atomic weapons. Today, the group includes physicists and environmental scientists from around the world, who decide whether to adjust the clock in consultation with the group's Board of Sponsors - which includes Nobel laureates. When it was created in 1947, the clock's hand stood at seven minutes to midnight. Since then it has changed more than 20 times, ranging from two minutes to midnight to 17 minutes before midnight in 1991. But during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis - considered by many analysts to be the closest the Cold War face-off between the US and the USSR came to escalating into a nuclear war - the Doomsday Clock stood still at seven minutes to midnight. The BAS says: ""The answers to this seeming anomaly are that the Doomsday Clock captures trends and takes into account the capacity of leaders and societies to respond to crises with reasoned actions to prevent nuclear holocaust. ""The Cuban Missile Crisis, for all its potential and ultimate destruction, only lasted a few weeks; however, the lessons were quickly apparent when the United States and the Soviet Union installed the first hotline between the two capitals to improve communications, and, of course, negotiated the 1963 test ban treaty, ending all atmospheric nuclear testing."" In fact, the Doomsday Clock was moved back to 12 minutes to midnight in 1963.

"This video can not be played What has Aung San Suu Kyi said about Rohingya Muslims? Veteran US diplomat Bill Richardson has resigned from an international panel set up by Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to advise on the Rohingya crisis. He claimed the panel was a ""whitewash"" and accused Ms Suu Kyi, his long-time friend, of lacking ""moral leadership"". Myanmar accused him of pursuing ""his own agenda"". More than 650,000 Rohingya people, from a mostly-Muslim minority in Buddhist Myanmar, fled to Bangladesh last year in the face of a military crackdown. Many are now living in refugee camps in the neighbouring country.Bangladesh has said they will all be returned to Myanmarwithin two years. Mr Richardson added that Ms Suu Kyi had been ""furious"" when he raised the case of two Reuters reporters on trial in Myanmar. Thejournalists have been charged with breaching the Official Secrets Actwhile working on coverage of the Rohingya crisis. Ms Suu Kyi ""exploded"" at Mr Richardson when he mentioned the journalists,external, he told the New York Times. ""Her face was quivering, and if she had been a little closer to me, she might have hit me, she was so furious,"" Mr Richardson said. How Suu Kyi sees the Rohingya crisis Bill Richardson, a former governor of New Mexico, has sharply criticised Aung San Suu Kyi Mr Richardson, a former adviser to the Clinton administration, has known Ms Suu Kyi for decades and visited the Nobel laureate while she was under house arrest in the 1990s. He told Reuters he was resigning from the advisory board because it was a ""whitewash"" and he did not want to be part of a ""cheerleading squad for the government"". He was ""alarmed by the lack of sincerity with which the critical issue of citizenship was discussed,"" he wrote in a statement. This video can not be played Watch: Who are the Rohingya? There were around one million Rohingya people in Myanmar at the start of 2017, where they have their own language and culture. But the government sees them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and denies them citizenship. In August last year, after Rohingya militants in Rakhine state attacked police posts, people started to flee across the border. Arriving in Bangladesh, they told repeated stories of troops, backed by local Buddhist mobs, burning villages and attacking and killing civilians. The military offensive has been described by the United Nations as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" - something Myanmar denies. What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis Could Aung San Suu Kyi face genocide charges? Seeing through the official story in Myanmar Mr Richardson went on to say he had been ""taken aback by the vigour"" with which Ms Suu Kyi had ""disparaged"" the media, the UN, human rights groups and the international community during three days of meetings. ""She's not getting good advice from her team,"" he said. ""I like her enormously and respect her. But she has not shown moral leadership on the Rakhine issue and the allegations made, and I regret that."" Myanmar's government said Mr Richardson was pursuing ""his own agenda"" and the government had decided his continued participation on the board was ""not in the best interest of all concerned"". The Advisory Board for the Committee for Implementation of the Recommendations on Rakhine State was set up by Ms Suu Kyi's government last year. BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head Rarely can such blistering criticism have come from a seasoned diplomat of a woman whose cause he once championed, and whom he considered a friend. Ms Suu Kyi's government has denied allegations of horrific human rights abuses and stubbornly resisted pressure to allow international organisations access to Rakhine state. Bill Richardson's fear that the board could be just a cheerleader for the government may be quietly shared by other members and his reservations will have surprised few. But strong and personal reproaches of Ms Suu Kyi's attitude may destroy a personal relationship going back more than two decades. She is known to be intolerant of such slights and strong-willed to the point of stubbornness. There is little likelihood that she will change her views because of his comments. More likely they will compound a sense, shared by her millions of supporters, that western governments and political leaders are treating her unfairly, and that she should look elsewhere for sympathy. Until Mr Richardson resigned, the board had 10 members, five of whom are from overseas. One of those, former South African Defence Minister Roelof Meyer, travelled with the board's remaining members to Rakhine state on Wednesday. He told Reuters the visit had been ""very constructive"", and said any suggestion the board was ""just a rubber stamp or a voice on behalf of the government... would be completely untrue, unfair. We haven't done any recommendations so far."" Another member of the board, Khin Nyo, told the BBC that Mr Richardson was asked not to urge for the release of the Reuters journalists in the meeting as it did not concern the board. ""The advisory board is independent and [the government] don't restrict anything on us,"" she said.

Several people were rescued from the wreckage of the carriages that derailed next to the Pioltello Limito station in the morning rush hour. The cause of the accident is not yet clear but a collapse of the rail track is under investigation. Witnesses said the train trembled for a few minutes before the accident. Firefighters are battling to free passengers from the debris The train derailed at Pioltello Limito station The Trenord train, carrying some 250 people, was heading to Milan's Porta Garibaldi station from Cremona when it derailed at about 07:00 local time (06:00 GMT). The train was travelling at normal speed when the accident happened, a spokesperson for Trenord told Reuters news agency. Services in the area were halted for hours. The identities of the victims have not been confirmed, but Italian media report that they are all women. ""A train can derail for only two reasons; either through a structural collapse of the track or a collapse of the train. This is the first thing that needs to be cleared up,"" said Raffaele Cattaneo, president of the regional council. RFI, which manages the rail network, said there was a rupture in the track but that it was unclear whether this was a cause or a consequence of the accident. ""The rail track collapse was detected 2.3km [1.4 miles] before the spot of the accident... but it is premature to establish the dynamics of the accident,"" said regional director Vincenzo Macello.

"John Worboys was convicted of 19 offences in 2009 Sadiq Khan has lodged an application for a judicial review into the decision to release rapist John Worboys. The black cab driver is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. Two of his victims have also started proceedings against the decision. The London mayor said the ""astonishing and deeply concerning decision"" made by the Parole Board to release him ""simply cannot go unchallenged"". Worboys, 60, was jailed for a minimum term of eight years in 2009. He was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP) after being convicted of 19 offences at Croydon Crown Court. Reality Check: Could Worboys be banned from London? The cabbie who preyed on young women Fresh Worboys sex attack claim investigated After a hearing about his case in November, the Parole Board decided to approve his release with ""stringent"" licence conditions. Chairman Nick Hardwick has said the board was ""confident"" Worboys would not reoffend. However, the mayor of London said the decision ""must be properly scrutinised in the courts."" Sadiq Khan said the Parole Board's decision ""simply cannot go unchallenged"" Letters received by Worboys' victims following his conviction suggested the black cab driverhad received a life sentence""to all intents and purposes"". At his trial, jurors heard Worboys picked up his victims in London's West End and gave them champagne laced with sedatives, claiming he had won the lottery or had won money at casinos. A judicial review is where a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision made by a public body - in this case, the Parole Board. It is less about whether the decision was right or wrong, and more about challenging whether proper procedures were followed to reach the decision. He was convicted of one rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges. Harriet Wistrich, the women's solicitor, says she has been contacted by a number of other victims of Worboys and will be presenting a dossier of cases to police and the Crown Prosecution Service requesting they investigate further and prosecute. The dossier includes two previously unreported cases from 2002 and 2003 and two cases that were investigated by police that would pass the evidential threshold but have not been prosecuted. Scotland Yard is currently investigating a new sexual assault allegation made against Worboys which was reported to them this month. No arrests have been made.

"This video can not be played What has Aung San Suu Kyi said about Rohingya Muslims? Veteran US diplomat Bill Richardson has resigned from an international panel set up by Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to advise on the Rohingya crisis. He claimed the panel was a ""whitewash"" and accused Ms Suu Kyi, his long-time friend, of lacking ""moral leadership"". Myanmar accused him of pursuing ""his own agenda"". More than 650,000 Rohingya people, from a mostly-Muslim minority in Buddhist Myanmar, fled to Bangladesh last year in the face of a military crackdown. Many are now living in refugee camps in the neighbouring country.Bangladesh has said they will all be returned to Myanmarwithin two years. Mr Richardson added that Ms Suu Kyi had been ""furious"" when he raised the case of two Reuters reporters on trial in Myanmar. Thejournalists have been charged with breaching the Official Secrets Actwhile working on coverage of the Rohingya crisis. Ms Suu Kyi ""exploded"" at Mr Richardson when he mentioned the journalists,external, he told the New York Times. ""Her face was quivering, and if she had been a little closer to me, she might have hit me, she was so furious,"" Mr Richardson said. How Suu Kyi sees the Rohingya crisis Bill Richardson, a former governor of New Mexico, has sharply criticised Aung San Suu Kyi Mr Richardson, a former adviser to the Clinton administration, has known Ms Suu Kyi for decades and visited the Nobel laureate while she was under house arrest in the 1990s. He told Reuters he was resigning from the advisory board because it was a ""whitewash"" and he did not want to be part of a ""cheerleading squad for the government"". He was ""alarmed by the lack of sincerity with which the critical issue of citizenship was discussed,"" he wrote in a statement. This video can not be played Watch: Who are the Rohingya? There were around one million Rohingya people in Myanmar at the start of 2017, where they have their own language and culture. But the government sees them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and denies them citizenship. In August last year, after Rohingya militants in Rakhine state attacked police posts, people started to flee across the border. Arriving in Bangladesh, they told repeated stories of troops, backed by local Buddhist mobs, burning villages and attacking and killing civilians. The military offensive has been described by the United Nations as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" - something Myanmar denies. What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis Could Aung San Suu Kyi face genocide charges? Seeing through the official story in Myanmar Mr Richardson went on to say he had been ""taken aback by the vigour"" with which Ms Suu Kyi had ""disparaged"" the media, the UN, human rights groups and the international community during three days of meetings. ""She's not getting good advice from her team,"" he said. ""I like her enormously and respect her. But she has not shown moral leadership on the Rakhine issue and the allegations made, and I regret that."" Myanmar's government said Mr Richardson was pursuing ""his own agenda"" and the government had decided his continued participation on the board was ""not in the best interest of all concerned"". The Advisory Board for the Committee for Implementation of the Recommendations on Rakhine State was set up by Ms Suu Kyi's government last year. BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head Rarely can such blistering criticism have come from a seasoned diplomat of a woman whose cause he once championed, and whom he considered a friend. Ms Suu Kyi's government has denied allegations of horrific human rights abuses and stubbornly resisted pressure to allow international organisations access to Rakhine state. Bill Richardson's fear that the board could be just a cheerleader for the government may be quietly shared by other members and his reservations will have surprised few. But strong and personal reproaches of Ms Suu Kyi's attitude may destroy a personal relationship going back more than two decades. She is known to be intolerant of such slights and strong-willed to the point of stubbornness. There is little likelihood that she will change her views because of his comments. More likely they will compound a sense, shared by her millions of supporters, that western governments and political leaders are treating her unfairly, and that she should look elsewhere for sympathy. Until Mr Richardson resigned, the board had 10 members, five of whom are from overseas. One of those, former South African Defence Minister Roelof Meyer, travelled with the board's remaining members to Rakhine state on Wednesday. He told Reuters the visit had been ""very constructive"", and said any suggestion the board was ""just a rubber stamp or a voice on behalf of the government... would be completely untrue, unfair. We haven't done any recommendations so far."" Another member of the board, Khin Nyo, told the BBC that Mr Richardson was asked not to urge for the release of the Reuters journalists in the meeting as it did not concern the board. ""The advisory board is independent and [the government] don't restrict anything on us,"" she said.

"One of Anthony Barnard's neighbours dialled 999 after seeing him ""obviously dead"" on the decking in the back garden A man thought to have frozen to death 16 hours after police voiced concerns about his welfare had recently been evicted from his home, it has emerged. Concerns about Anthony Barnard, 57, were first voiced after he was spotted sitting outside the property in Lowestoft on 27 December. The East of England Ambulance Service decided at that stage no ambulance was required. The following morning -19 hours after the first 999 call- he was found dead. Suffolk Police has confirmed it has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) - formerly known as the Independent Police Complaints Commission - over its handling of the incident. The ambulance service is currently investigating its handling of Mr Barnard's case but has previously told the BBC his death occurred during a very busy period. The BBC has now learned Mr Barnard was declared bankrupt in 2017 and that he had been evicted from his Priors Close home at the end of September. Two calls - including one from Suffolk Police - were made to the East of England Ambulance Service Andrew McTear, who was dealing with Mr Barnard's bankruptcy, said: ""He was made bankrupt and ultimately evicted from his property because he failed to deal with his affairs and didn't respond to any correspondence. ""At some point he lived with his mother. I was aware he was going back to the house. He wouldn't have been able to get back. ""He certainly would be breaching a court order to go back inside the house itself."" Neighbours say Mr Barnard had lived there for about 20 years and had on previous occasions been seen drinking outside the property. They said concerns had been voiced about the welfare of Mr Barnard but he had declined help. Neighbour Janice Wilcox said the night Mr Barnard died was ""very, very cold"" One neighbour, Janice Wilcox, said: ""He was very obviously a troubled man and he liked to keep that to himself. ""To think in this day and age somebody had died in their garden, possibly frozen to death. ""We don't yet know his cause of death but it was a very, very cold night. It was awful."" Weather records show temperatures on the night of Mr Barnard's death dipped below freezing. It is understood concerns about Mr Barnard were first raised with social services, who referred the call to the police. Officers then contacted the ambulance service. A force spokesman said: ""Suffolk Constabulary can confirm it has made a mandatory referral to the IOPC who will conduct an independent investigation."" Mr Barnard had lived in Priors Close for about 20 years, neighbours say Mr Barnard's case was one of 41 released to the BBC by an ambulance service whistleblower. On Wednesday,Prime Minister Theresa May voiced her concerns about the list of serious incidents at the ambulance trust. The ambulance service has confirmed the first call about Mr Barnard was made by Suffolk Police. But because he was breathing and conscious with ""no obvious injuries"", the service decided he did not need an ambulance. Prime Minister Theresa May has voiced her concerns about recent serious incidents at the East of England Ambulance Trust A second call was made about 16 hours later by one of Mr Barnard's neighbours, who described seeing him ""obviously dead"" on the decking of his rear garden. An ambulance arrived within eight minutes of that second call, the service said but when paramedics arrived Mr Barnard was dead.

"This video can not be played Former hostess: ""There were girls sat on people's laps being fondled and groped"" Theresa May has said she was ""appalled"" by reports women were groped at a men-only gala and was ""not happy"" that an event like that took place. The Prime Minister said she would continue to work to ensure women were ""accepted and respected as equals"". Mrs May will also consider whether any changes were needed to non-disclosure agreements, Downing Street said. The legal documents were signed by the hostesses who worked at last Thursday's Presidents Club event, it was reported. Non-disclosure agreements are legal documents signed between two parties to share confidential information. The Presidents Club said it was closing and would no longer hold eventsafter an undercover reporter for the Financial Times,externalrevealed hostesses were subject to groping and lewd comments at the dinner in London. Time up on men-only networking events? RAre charities allowed to return money? Scandal-hit club shuts amid groping claims 'Flirtatious and handsy': More women speak out Mrs May said that it wasn't just the event that worried her, but ""what it says about the wider issue in society - about attitudes to women"". ""I thought that sort of approach to women - that objectification of women - was something we were leaving behind,"" she said. ""We've made progress, but it's very clear that there's a lot more for us to do."" Meanwhile, the University of Bolton said its vice-chancellor George Holmes, who was a first-time guest at the dinner, ""was uncomfortable with the totally unexpected influx of hostess staff and certain auction lots"". After speaking to hostesses, Prof Holmes raised concerns with a staff team leader that some of her staff were uncomfortable, the university said. ""Although Prof Holmes did not witness any of the assaults subsequently alleged in the press, he chose to leave as soon as was politely possible at the end of the charity auction,"" a statement said. This video can not be played Theresa May said more work needed to be done for women ""to be accepted and respected as equals"". Earlier, children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi was reprimanded by No 10 for attending the event. The BBC understands Mr Zahawi was called to Downing Street on Wednesday to meet chief whip Julian Smith. He said he went to the fundraiser but left early. Mrs May said she accepted Mr Zahawi's explanation. The Metropolitan Police said it had not received any complaints about last Thursday's dinner. The dinner and auction - which has taken place annually for more than 30 years and raised Â£20m for children's charities - was held at the Dorchester Hotel in central London and attended by senior figures in business and finance. This video can not be played How The Presidents Club scandal unfolded The FT revealed the 130 hostesses were told to wear skimpy black outfits with matching underwear and high heels, and made to sign a non-disclosure agreement before starting work. Auction prizes included lunch with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a trip to a London strip club and plastic surgery ""to spice up your wife"". It is understood that Mr Johnson did not agree to support the event and will not take part in the lunch. The Presidents Club said it would distribute its remaining funds to children's charities, although some - including Great Ormond Street children's hospital - have said they will return any donations they have already received. The Charity Commission also said it was investigating the claims ""as a matter of urgency"". On Wednesday, Mr Zahawi, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, tweeted that he arrived at the event at 20:00 GMT and left at 21:35 GMT as he ""felt uncomfortable"", but said he did not see any of the ""horrific"" events reported. He also tweeted that he would never attend a men-only function again. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But she stood by Mr Zahawi and his claim of an early exit. This video can not be played Labour MP Jess Philips: 'Lads' culture has no place in country' But Labour's Sarah Jones said Mr Zahawi should resign if he did not report his concerns and had attended on previous occasions. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner also called for an investigation into his attendance. Earlier on Wednesday, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had confidence in Mr Zahawi and he was not being referred for investigation. Mrs May has said she accepted Mr Zahawi's explanation. Labour peer Lord Mendelsohn - whose spokesman said he attended ""part of the dinner"" as a president of a charity - said leader Jeremy Corbyn has asked him ""to step back from the front bench"". His spokesman added Lord Mendelsohn did not witness any ""appalling incidents described in reports"" and ""unreservedly condemned such behaviour"". Mr Corbyn's spokesman said: ""The reports about this appalling event were deeply shocking and there can be no excuse for anyone's attendance."" One of the organisers, David Meller, quit his non-executive role on the Department for Education board following the reports. On Thursday,the Meller Educational Trust said,externalMr Meller had also taken a leave of absence as one of it's trustees. ""We, as trustees, wish to express our sympathy to those women who have been so badly treated,"" a statement said. This video can not be played Financial Times journalist Madison Marriage: âI was groped several timesâ Madison Marriage, the reporter who worked at the event, said she and ""numerous other hostesses"" were groped at the dinner. She told BBC Newsnight: ""It's a hands up skirts, hands on bums but also hands on hips, hands on stomachs, arms going round your waist unexpectedly."" She said there were other women there ""who had absolutely no idea that was the kind of event it would be"". Before the fundraiser announced it was closing, a number of businesses said they would cut ties with the event - including WPP, the world's biggest advertising agency, and real estate investment business Frogmore. Comedian and children's author David Walliams, who is not the subject of any allegations, was the compere for the evening. He said he ""did not witness any of the kind of behaviour that allegedly occurred"", but added that he was ""absolutely appalled"" by the reports and he would be donating his fee to the Children's Trust. Channel 5 baseball show presenter Jonny Gould, who was the auctioneer at the dinner, said he had ""never witnessed any of the alleged behaviour of guests at this event nor in previous years"". He added: ""If I had, I would not have continued to work at the event."" The Dorchester said it was ""deeply concerned"" and was looking into the claims. A spokesman for the Artista agency, which recruited the hostesses, said: ""I was not aware of any claims of sexual harassment but the kind of behaviour alleged is completely unacceptable.

"Shops, cafes and businesses will offer free water refill points in every major city and town in England by 2021. Industry body Water UK says its scheme could cut disposable plastic bottle use by tens of millions a year. The move comes amid growing concern about the effect of plastic waste on the environment. Whitbread, which owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, is the first to sign up to the initiative and will provide water in all of its branches from March 2018. Refill stations and public fountains will be able to be found via an app or window signs pointing people in the direction of the nearest one. What are your free drinking water rights? Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Sea plastic to be recycled into kayaks This video can not be played A giant build-up of plastic was captured by underwater photographer Caroline Power The new scheme has been set up on the back of a previous initiative, the Refill campaign, which currently has more than 1,600 refill stations across the UK and operates in 13 towns and cities in England. Water companies already taking part in local schemes under Refill include Anglian Water in Norwich, Northumbrian Water in Durham, South West Water in Cornwall and Bristol Water in Bristol. In 2015, Bristol adopted the campaign and the city now has more than 200 points. It is estimated that if every city resident in Bristol refilled one bottle once a week, the city could cut the use of disposable bottles by 22.3 million a year. In December, London mayor Sadiq Khan pledged to create 20 new fountains and other bottle-refill points in the city. Water UK's chief executive, Michael Roberts, said the industry wants to tackle the problems caused by plastic bottle and ""help turn this harmful tide of plastic waste"". ""This country has some of the best drinking water in the world and we want everyone to benefit from it. ""This scheme will do that by making it easier for people to refill their bottles wherever they work, rest, shop or play."" The issue of plastic waste has also been highlighted by theBBC's Blue Planet II. Analysis by BBC Reality Check Making it easier for people to refill water bottles instead of buying single-use ones is squarely on the agenda, with support from Environment Secretary Michael Gove and the Mayor of London. But there are no figures to show how many working drinking fountains there are across the UK. Installing them is a local responsibility. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, says it doesn't hold data on the number of drinking fountains. Water UK, which will run the free water refill scheme, also could not provide figures. The Drinking Fountain Association, founded as the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association in 1959, owns 2,406 fountains in England, but the vast majority of these aren't working fountains - they are historic monuments. Hundreds of drinking fountains were installed in the Victorian times to promote public health - and as part of the temperance movement, with many being stationed outside pubs. The advent of bottled water in the 1980s among other things pushed the need for drinking fountains down council priority lists.

On a knife edge: Rising violence in London The latest police figures for the 12 months to September from 44 forces show: 68,968 robbery offences, up29% 138,045 sex offences, up23% 37,443 knife crime offences, up21% 1,291,405 violent crime offences, up20% There were 37,443 knife crimes and 6,694 gun crime offences recorded in the year to September. The number of offences involving a knife or a sharp instrument had been falling since 2011 but started rising again over the past three years, the ONS said. This contrasts with the Crime Survey which found that most crimes either fell or were at a similar level. However the ONS says higher-harm violent offences, such as knife crime occur in relatively low volumes, and also tend to be concentrated in cities and are therefore not ""well-measured"" by the Crime Survey. Excluding the Hillsborough stadium deaths and last year's terror attacks from the data, 57 more people were killed or murdered than the previous year - the highest total since 2008-9. The 96 cases of manslaughter from Hillsborough stadium in 1989 were only included in crime figures in 2016, after an inquest ruled that the football fans had been unlawfully killed. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Although there's likely to be a dispute about the accuracy of the police crime figures because they hinge, to some extent, on the way forces log offences, how pro-active they are and the willingness of victims to come forward, they clearly demonstrate a rapidly rising caseload. For example, recorded sexual offences and violent crimes have more than doubled in three years. At the same time, the number of police officers has continued to fall: in the 12 months to last September, down 930 to 121,929. The Home Office says that's the lowest figure since comparable records began in 1996. That combination - rising crime, declining police numbers - is creating enormous strain for forces. But it's unclear whether the smaller police workforce is contributing to the growth in violent crime, particularly what the ONS says are the ""genuine"" increases in knife crime and firearm offences. This video can not be played Knife crime was up by 26% year-on-year - an increasing number of teenagers in London are being injured by knives There were also increases in vehicle-related theft offences, which were up 18% to 443,577, and burglary, which rose by 8% to 433,110, police data showed. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the figures were ""truly shocking"" and should ""put an end to government complacency on crime"". ""The Tories are failing in a basic duty to protect the public,"" she added. The Police and Crime Commissioner for the West Midlands, David Jamieson, said his force had lost more than 2,000 uniformed officers since 2010 and his budget had been cut by 25%. ""Any sensible person can see if you take away a quarter of the budget, you can't carry on protecting the public in the same way,"" he told BBC News. He anticipates having to lose a further 150 officers this year. Police Federation of England and Wales General Secretary Andy Fittes said:  ""The reality is there are around 21,000 fewer officers than there were in 2010 and they are having to deal with an ever-increasing number of crimes."" ""To say crime has fallen is smoke and mirrors,"" he added. He added that police officers have ""numerous other roles"" not covered in today's statistics - such as counter-terrorism, sex offender management, policing football matches and missing person searches. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The independent Office for National Statistics is clear that overall, traditional crime is continuing to fall. ""It is now down by almost 40% since 2010."" Policing Minister Nick Hurd also said crime had fallen but added the government was ""very concerned"" about the ""uptick in the most serious violent crime"". He said the government would ""redouble efforts"" to bear down on the increased through legislation and tougher police enforcement. And also to try to steer young people away from ""a culture of violence"". Reality Check: Is there more crime?

"This video can not be played Trump: We're on the same wavelength President Donald Trump has predicted a ""tremendous increase"" in UK-US trade, after talks with Theresa May. He also said the US and UK were ""joined at the hip"" on military matters, while Mrs May said they stood ""shoulder to shoulder"" in facing shared threats. In a series of warm exchanges in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump also told the UK PM:  ""We love your country."" He also rejected ""false rumours"" of differences, saying that the two leaders ""like each other a lot"". And Downing Street said later that they had asked officials to work on ""finalising the details of a visit by the president to the UK later this year"". It was their first meeting since clashing over the US president's retweets of far-right videos in November. And earlier this month Mr Trump cancelled a visit to the UK, criticising the location of the new US embassy in London. But after their meeting, Mr Trump told Mrs May at their news conference: ""I have great respect for everything you are doing, we love your country, I think it's really great."" Pay attention to UK-US rapport, says Tillerson US revives post-Brexit trade deal hopes May calls for online terror crackdown Trump casts doubt on Middle East peace talks The two leaders met in Davos, at the World Economic Forum, with post-Brexit trade relations between the two countries high on the agenda. Mr Trump said: ""One thing that will be taking place over a number of years will be trade. Trade is going to increase many times. ""I look forward to that... the discussions... that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increases in trade between our two countries which is great for both in terms of jobs. We look forward to that and we are starting that process, pretty much as we speak."" He added the US would be ""there to fight for you - you know that"" and the two were ""joined at the hip when it comes to the military"". Mrs May replied that the ""really special relationship"" between the UK and US continued and they stood ""shoulder to shoulder because we are facing the same challenges across the world"". ""Alongside that working for a good trade relationship for the future which will be for both our benefits, so the UK and the US both do well out of this - and it's been great to see you today."" In response to reporters' questions, both leaders said they would ""talk about"" his state visit to the UK - offered by Mrs May when she visited him in Washington shortly after he became US president. No date has been set. Downing Street later confirmed that the visit officials were discussing this year would be a working, not a state, visit. But BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the British would be pleased with the press call. The mood music had been good and the Americans were talking positively about a trade deal. The UK prime minister also spoke about the need to put more pressure on tech giants to deal with extremist content A Downing Street spokesman said the two leaders had also discussed the Bombardier trade dispute and that Mrs May had ""reiterated"" the importance of the firm to Northern Ireland, Iran, Syria and Brexit negotiations. The UK prime minister had earlier addressed the World Economic Forum about the need to put more pressure on tech giants to deal with extremist content and tackle child abuse and modern slavery on social networks. She said shareholders should use their influence to ""ensure these issues are taken seriously"". ""No-one wants to be known as the terrorist platform, or the first-choice app for paedophiles,"" she said. She said some progress had been made but more must be done ""so that ultimately this content is removed automatically"". She acknowledged people's concerns about the impact of technology on jobs - pointing to Uber as an example of a company that had ""got things wrong along the way"". The ride-hailing firm should not be shut down but should address concerns about safety and workers' rights and enforce standards ""that can make this technology work for customers and employees alike"", she said. Mrs May said that employment law must keep pace with the way technology is changing jobs and while it must protect the ""flexibility"" companies valued, it must not be ""a one way street deal that can become exploitative."" The UK is in the process of leaving the European Union - the day set for Brexit is 29 March, 2019, so is expected to negotiate its own trade deals in future, rather than being part of the deals drawn up on behalf of  all EU member states.

"Whether crime is rising or falling is hugely important. It can affect how much is spent on policing and other related services, even how people vote. But working out what is happening is not an exact science. When we talk about crime rates in England and Wales we usually look at two things: crimes recorded by the police crimes reported in anannual survey,externalof 38,000 members of the public And those two sources often throw up quite different results. For example, in recent years police records have shown significant increases in crime while the survey has suggested crime is falling. Despite this difference, neither source is wrong - they just measure different things. The more difficult question is which best represents how much crime is actually being committed. We're talking about England and Wales only, because Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate criminal justice systems. According to the most recent survey, which is conducted face-to-face and asks individuals about their personal experiences, levels of crime in the year to September 2018 remained pretty stable compared with the year before. Crimes recorded by the survey have been falling for years, so this represents a slowing of improvements. There was no change in the overall number of violent offences - the only significant change was seen in the category of ""computer misuse"" (generally fraud and financial crimes), which went down by a third. On the other hand, police records suggest crime went up by 7% in the past year  and violent crime went up by 19%. Violence that actually resulted in injury or death went up by 7%. So which of these two very different pictures - one showing no change to the levels of violence people are experiencing and one showing it going up quite considerably - should we trust? The crime survey is generally considered a good measure of crime experienced by individuals because it is not affected by changes to how crime is recorded. It also includes crimes that have historically been under-reported to the police. However, it has some limitations. It does not cover crimes against businesses or people living in communal residences like care homes, prisons or student accommodation. It is also excludes crimes where there is no victim to interview, for example murders and drug possession or dealing offences. And there is a time-lag in the survey, so the figures are older than police figures. This means the survey is very good for looking at long-term trends but less good at spotting emerging ones. The trouble with police records is they can sometimes be a measure of police activity rather than of crime itself. They're by definition not good at capturing offences that people under-report to the police, such as petty theft or sexual offences. They are skewed by police priorities - that is, focused efforts from police to tackle certain crimes can also lead to higher levels being recorded. And police-recorded crime is sensitive to changes in recording practices, for example, the number of crimes described as ""violence against the person"" went up considerably in recent years, after two new harassment offences were added to the category. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said this didn't reflect a genuine increase in crime. Police recorded crime had its designation as a national statistic removed in 2014. But, that being said, police-recorded crime is very good measure of what's happening to well understood and well reported crimes such as burglary. Those figures suggest there have been genuine increases in less common but more serious crimes such as weapons offences over the past couple of years. Helen Ross from the ONS's centre for crime and justice, said: ""In recent decades, we've seen the overall level of crime falling - but in the last year, it remained level."" ""Burglary, shoplifting and computer misuse are decreasing but others, such as vehicle offences and robbery, are rising. ""We have also seen increases in some types of 'lower-volume, high-harm' violence, including offences involving knives or sharp instruments."" But, the statistical body says, this should be seen in the context of an overall fall in crime over the past decade, adding that the crime survey ""provides the best measure of trends for overall violent crime"". ""The survey covers crimes that are not reported to or recorded by the police and so tends to provide the better measure of more common but less harmful crimes."" Scotland has a similar survey on perceptions of crime that runs every two years. In the most recent survey, for 2016-17, crimes committed against adults were down 34% since 2008-09 and 16% since the previous survey, in 2012-13. Crimes recorded by the police in Scotland are at their lowest level since 1974.

"US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has reinvigorated talk of a free trade deal with the UK following Brexit. It follows worries that Britain's ""special relationship"" with the US had cooled. Mr Mnuchin said Britain would still be at the ""front of the queue"" for a bilateral free trade deal following the exit from the European Union. ""As soon as the UK is ready we will be prepared to negotiate an attractive trade deal,"" he told the BBC in Davos. I asked Mr Mnuchin if the relationship between the US and Britain had become strained after President Donald Trump cancelled a meeting to come to the UK to open the new US embassy in London. President Trump also criticised Prime Minister Theresa May on Twitter after clashing over his retweet of Britain First videos. Mr Mnuchin said that a positive economic future for Britain was very important to the US, and that America was maintaining full support for the UK over ""the Brexit issue"". He said the US administration was ""monitoring the discussions"", adding: ""We want to see a successful transition."" Mr Mnuchin met Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, on Wednesday to discuss Brexit, and he will meet Philip Hammond, the chancellor, later on Thursday. The US Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, said that he had met the British international trade secretary, Dr Liam Fox, to discuss stronger trade relationships. He said the UK would be following the US model of having ""commercial officers"" based in every embassy to boost economic and business ties.

"After falling for several years, knife crime in England and Wales is rising again. So what is happening? There were 43,516 knife crime offences in the 12 months ending March 2019. This is an 80% increase from the low-point in the year ending March 2014, when there were 23,945 offences, and is the highest number since comparable data was compiled. These statistics do not include those from Greater Manchester Police because of data recording issues. Out of the 44 police forces, 43 recorded a rise in knife crime since 2011. Police figures are prone to changes in counting rules and methods, but data for NHS hospitals in England over a similar period showed an 8% increase in admissions for assault by a sharp object, leading the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to conclude there had been a ""real change"" to the downward trend in knife crime. Doctors said the injuries they were treating were becoming more severe and the victims were getting younger, with increasing numbers of girls involved. All of the statistics here relate to England and Wales. Policing, criminal justice and sentencing are devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which also collect crime data in slightly different ways. In the latest figures, which include only selected knife offences, about half, 21,700, were assaults that caused an injury or where there was an intent to cause serious harm; a further 20,172 involved robberies. These figures focus on homicides, or killings, a category comprising cases of murder, manslaughter and infanticide. In about two out of every five killings, the victim was fatally assaulted with a sharp object or stabbed to death. The number of knife-related homicides went from 272 in 2007 to 186 in 2015.  Since then it's risen every year, with a steep increase in 2017-18, when there were 285 killings, the highest figure since 1946. One in four victims were men aged 18-24. The figures also show 25% of victims were black - the highest proportion since data was first collected in 1997. Although knife crime is on the increase, it should be seen in context. It's relatively unusual for a violent incident to involve a knife, and rarer still for someone to need hospital treatment. Most violence is caused by people hitting, kicking, shoving or slapping someone, sometimes during a fight and often when they're drunk; the police figures on violence also include crimes of harassment and stalking. The Crime Survey for England and Wales, which includes offences that aren't reported to police, indicates that overall levels of violence have fallen by about a quarter since 2013. However, the police-recorded statistics - which tend to pick up more ""high harm"" crimes - have indicated that the most serious violent crime is increasing. In the year to March 2019, 22,041 people were cautioned, reprimanded or convicted for carrying a knife in England and Wales, most of whom were adults. But one in five - 4,451 - was under the age of 18. Knife crime tends to be more prevalent in large cities, particularly in London. For every 100,000 people in the capital, there were 169 knife offences in 2018-19. In 2018, figures from the mayor's office showed that young black and minority ethnic teenage boys and men were disproportionately affected, as both victims and perpetrators. The Metropolitan Police Chief Commissioner Cressida Dick has said tackling violence in London is her ""priority"". Next highest was the North West, with 93 knife offences per 100,000 population, and Yorkshire and the Humber, 86. The explanations for rising knife crime have ranged from police budget cuts, to gang violence and disputes between drug dealers. Some have also cited the steep decline in the use by police of stop and search. The powers enable officers to search people on the street if they have reasonable grounds to suspect they may be carrying weapons, illegal drugs, stolen property or items to be used to commit a crime. People can also be searched without reasonable grounds if a senior officer believes there's a risk of serious violence in a particular area. From 2009, the number of stops fell sharply across England and Wales, especially in London, primarily because of concerns that the measures unfairly targeted young black men, wasted police resources and were ineffective at catching criminals. Theresa May, as home secretary, led efforts to drive down the number of stops, but there's anecdotal evidence from police that young people are now more inclined to carry knives because of growing confidence they won't be stopped. The statistical basis for that is far from clear - but Scotland Yard, with the mayor of London's support, has begun increasing the use of stop and search again. Since 2010, police numbers have decreased by almost 20,000. Prime Minister Theresa Mayhas said there is no ""direct correlation""between the rise in knife crime and a fall in police numbers, but the issue is contested. In 2018, a Home Affairs Committee reportsaid police forces were ""struggling to cope""amid falling staff numbers anda leaked Home Office documentsaid they had ""likely contributed"" to a rise in serious violent crime. The average prison term for those jailed for carrying a knife or other offensive weapon has gone up from almost five months to well over eight months, with 85% serving at least three months, compared with 53% only 10 years ago. Sentences for all kinds of violent crime have been getting tougher, particularly for knife crime. The Ministry of Justice tracks the penalties imposed for those caught carrying knives and other offensive weapons in England and Wales. In the year ending December 2018, 37% of those dealt with were jailed and a further 18% were given a suspended prison sentence. The figures for 2008, when the data was first compiled, were 20% and 9% respectively. Over the same period, there's been a steady decline in the use of community sentences, and a sharp drop in cautions, from 30% to 11%. Public anxiety about knife crime, legislative changes and firmer guidance for judges and magistrates have led to the stiffer sentences, although offenders under 18 are still more likely to be cautioned than locked up.

"More than one in eight secondary schools in England is below the standard deemed acceptable by ministers, league table data shows. The secondary school league tables have just been published, featuring the results of the first pupils to sit new, tougher GCSEs in English and maths. Some 365 schools, or 12%, were below the new tougher floor standard. In 2016 it was 282 schools or 9.3%. The tables allow parents and pupils to compare the local schools' results. Schools are judged by two new measures,Progress 8,externalandAttainment 8,external. The data shows how many schools have missed the government's floor standard of -0.5 in Progress 8 in last summer's GCSEs. There are significant regional variations, with London having the lowest proportion of under-performing schools at 6.9% and the North East the highest at 20.9%. The tables use raw GCSE results from last year and a raft of data from the Department for Education to evaluate how well pupils progress in a school. All you need to know about secondary school league tables Both Progress 8 and Attainment 8 focus on the results of a pupil's best eight GCSE results including English and maths. In schools where pupils failed to progress to the expected level (-0.5 or below in Progress 8), they were getting around half a GCSE grade worse than they could have done, based on end of primary school results. In total, 365 schools - with some 47,342 pupils sitting GCSEs last year  - did not make the required progress. Last summer, teenagers sat new, tougher GCSEs in English and maths, which were graded 9 to 1 (9 being the top grade). All other GCSEs are graded under the old-style alphabetical system. Pupils are considered to have passed the new exams if they achieved a grade 4 or above - equivalent to the old C, but schools are judged on a grade 5. This video can not be played BBC numbers man Robert Cuffe: ""The government are trying to measure the schools rather than the kids"" This has led to some confusion and disquiet, with schools and individual pupils effectively being judged by different standards. The DfE said: ""More schools are below the floor in 2017 because the distribution of Progress 8 scores changed. There were more schools that achieved both  very negative and very positive scores in 2017 than 2016."" The schools with the biggest drop in results, once grade 5 was used to measure standards, tend to have much higher proportions of disadvantaged children. In fact the bottom 10% of schools had an average of 38.4% disadvantaged students. Notably, the percentage achieving grade 4 or above in English and maths is stable compared to last year. Schools minister Nick Gibb said teachers and pupils had been responding well to the new more rigorous curriculum introduced by the government. ""Academic standards are rising in our schools thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers. ""Today's results reinforce this success, with teachers and pupils responding well to the new more rigorous curriculum introduced by this government. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the secondary school performance tables could not be compared with previous years because the government had ""once again moved the goalposts"". Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto.If you are unable to see the map on your device,click here,external He added that the mix of grading systems had complicated and changed the way the headline measures are worked out. ""As the DfE itself says in today's statistics, these changes are the main reason why there has been an increase in the number of schools which are deemed to be below the 'floor standard' for Progress 8. ""It is extremely unfair that more schools find themselves in this situation because of complex changes to the way in which this is calculated."" He said it was ""very frustrating"" that the bar for achievement in English and maths has been raised arbitrarily to a grade 5 under the new system - which is higher than the old standard of grade C. ""And it is potentially baffling for parents and employers that schools are now judged on grade 5 - described as a 'strong pass' - while grade 4 is good enough to be deemed a 'standard pass'."" Mr Barton said the tables revealed only a limited amount about the true quality of a school in a system undergoing significant change. The DfE has made clear that there is no automatic consequence to being below the floor or coasting. It said: ""Where a school has fallen below these standards for the first time in 2017, the data will be a starting point for a conversation about school improvement.""

"Fishermen burned tyres as they blocked a road leading to the port of Boulogne French fishermen have blocked the ports of Calais and Boulogne in protest at so-called pulse fishing, which uses electrified nets to stun fish. Fishing boats stopped ferries entering or leaving Calais while a roadblock stopped traffic at Boulogne. Calais is a major link between the UK and France used by thousands of tourists and lorries every day. The European Parliament recently voted to ban pulse fishing which is mainly used by Dutch trawlers. The head of P&O Ferries, Janette Bell, said the blockade of Calais was ""utterly unacceptable"". It was lifted at 17:00 (16:00 GMT), though the ports were expected to take a while to get back to normal. The fishermen said they would meet government officials on Friday to discuss the issue. Fishing boats were stopping ferries entering or leaving Calais The English port of Dover was also hit by the action, with P&O and DFDS Seaways suspending some scheduled services. DFDS later rerouted some services through Dunkirk while P&O advised some customers to use the Channel Tunnel. Fishermen in Boulogne set pallets and tyres alight on an access road while two French boats blockaded an area of the port where Dutch trawlers unload their catches. Pulse fishing: Is it ok to 'electrocute' fish? Dover MP Charlie Elphicke called on French President Emmanuel Macron to ""get a grip of the situation"" and put a stop to the disruption which he said was damaging both the French and British economies.

StÃ©phane Pinto, vice president of the regional fisheries committee, said a small flotilla of boats had sailed to Calais from Boulogne and other boats from Dunkirk had joined them. He said the fishermen faced financial losses because of the use of pulse fishing. ""We're at our wits ends. We feel abandoned,"" he added. The controversial technique involves trawlers using nets that generate an electric current, stunning the fish and making them float upwards where they are easier to catch. This video can not be played Is electrofishing safe and humane? The Netherlands is the biggest user of this method in the EU, and argues that it is better for the environment than traditional trawling. However, the practice has inflamed French fishermen who complain it is depleting stocks. The French conservation group Bloom is also campaigning against the method. Following its vote, the European Parliament will hold long negotiations with the European Commission and member states to agree a package of measures to streamline regulations for fishing. Dutch trawlers can continue to use pulse fishing until the new legislation comes into force.

"This video can not be played Trump: We're on the same wavelength President Donald Trump has predicted a ""tremendous increase"" in UK-US trade, after talks with Theresa May. He also said the US and UK were ""joined at the hip"" on military matters, while Mrs May said they stood ""shoulder to shoulder"" in facing shared threats. In a series of warm exchanges in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump also told the UK PM:  ""We love your country."" He also rejected ""false rumours"" of differences, saying that the two leaders ""like each other a lot"". And Downing Street said later that they had asked officials to work on ""finalising the details of a visit by the president to the UK later this year"". It was their first meeting since clashing over the US president's retweets of far-right videos in November. And earlier this month Mr Trump cancelled a visit to the UK, criticising the location of the new US embassy in London. But after their meeting, Mr Trump told Mrs May at their news conference: ""I have great respect for everything you are doing, we love your country, I think it's really great."" Pay attention to UK-US rapport, says Tillerson US revives post-Brexit trade deal hopes May calls for online terror crackdown Trump casts doubt on Middle East peace talks The two leaders met in Davos, at the World Economic Forum, with post-Brexit trade relations between the two countries high on the agenda. Mr Trump said: ""One thing that will be taking place over a number of years will be trade. Trade is going to increase many times. ""I look forward to that... the discussions... that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increases in trade between our two countries which is great for both in terms of jobs. We look forward to that and we are starting that process, pretty much as we speak."" He added the US would be ""there to fight for you - you know that"" and the two were ""joined at the hip when it comes to the military"". Mrs May replied that the ""really special relationship"" between the UK and US continued and they stood ""shoulder to shoulder because we are facing the same challenges across the world"". ""Alongside that working for a good trade relationship for the future which will be for both our benefits, so the UK and the US both do well out of this - and it's been great to see you today."" In response to reporters' questions, both leaders said they would ""talk about"" his state visit to the UK - offered by Mrs May when she visited him in Washington shortly after he became US president. No date has been set. Downing Street later confirmed that the visit officials were discussing this year would be a working, not a state, visit. But BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the British would be pleased with the press call. The mood music had been good and the Americans were talking positively about a trade deal. The UK prime minister also spoke about the need to put more pressure on tech giants to deal with extremist content A Downing Street spokesman said the two leaders had also discussed the Bombardier trade dispute and that Mrs May had ""reiterated"" the importance of the firm to Northern Ireland, Iran, Syria and Brexit negotiations.

She acknowledged people's concerns about the impact of technology on jobs - pointing to Uber as an example of a company that had ""got things wrong along the way"". The ride-hailing firm should not be shut down but should address concerns about safety and workers' rights and enforce standards ""that can make this technology work for customers and employees alike"", she said. Mrs May said that employment law must keep pace with the way technology is changing jobs and while it must protect the ""flexibility"" companies valued, it must not be ""a one way street deal that can become exploitative."" The UK is in the process of leaving the European Union - the day set for Brexit is 29 March, 2019, so is expected to negotiate its own trade deals in future, rather than being part of the deals drawn up on behalf of  all EU member states.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Mummy is distant ancestor Scientists in the Swiss city of Basel have solved a decades-old mystery over the identity of a mummified woman. Their research revealed a surprise: the woman is the great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother of UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. The body was uncovered in 1975 while renovations were being done on Basel's BarfÃ¼sser Church. She was buried right in front of the altar, clearly well fed, and wearing good quality clothes. This was obviously the body of a wealthy lady of Basel. But who was she exactly, and when did she die? There was no gravestone to indicate her identity, but initial testing of her wooden coffin suggested it dated from the 16th Century. Another clue: her body was riddled with mercury - a standard treatment for syphilis from the late 15th to the 19th Century. Highly toxic mercury treatment was more often a kill than a cure and it was this that preserved her body. But that still left open the question of who she was. Boris Johnson: A history of undiplomacy Johnson under pressure over jailed mum case Boris Johnson's dad in I'm A Celebrity Basel in the 16th and 17th Centuries was a wealthy trading city; its port on the river Rhine was a key hub for moving goods across Europe, and it remains so today. Local historians knew that members of Basel's wealthy families were buried in and around the BarfÃ¼sser Church. This video can not be played For centuries, BarfÃ¼sser Church held clues to the ancestral history of Boris Johnson's family. Some were clearly named in records, some had clearly marked gravestones. But not the mummy. It only became clear in 2017, in newly discovered archives, that the mummy had been uncovered once before, in 1843. Those records led historians to suspect the mummy was a member of a well-established Basel family, the Bischoffs. Using the most up to date methods, scientists were able to extract DNA material from the mummy's big toe. Scientists have used DNA testing to establish the mummy's identity This was compared, by scientists working independently from one another, with DNA taking from living descendants of the Bischoff family. The results were clear, showing a 99.8% probability that the descendants and the mummy were all from the same maternal line. Now the scientists and the historians were sure: the mummy was none other than Anna Catharina Bischoff. Born in Basel in 1719, she died there in 1787. Once her identity had been established, genealogists were able - with the help of the efficient records of births, marriages, and deaths which tend to be kept by the wealthier classes - to trace more of Anna Catharina's descendants. An artist's impression gives an idea of how researchers think Anna Catharina Bischoff might have looked She had seven children. Only two survived childhood, but one daughter, also Anna, married a certain Christian Hubert Baron Pfeffel von Kriegelstein. Five generations of von Pfeffels later, and we find Marie Luise von Pfeffel marrying one Stanley Fred Williams. Their daughter Yvonne married Osman Wilfred Johnson Kemalâ¦ and their son, Stanley Johnson, is British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's father. The five-star review that changed my life The protester who is a social media hero The church that thrives in a ghost town Boris Johnson had already been aware of the von Pfeffel connections, having once told theBBC programme Who Do You Think You Are?that they were ""posh toffs"". He was clearly delighted by the discovery of his ancestor. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After hearing of the find, Stanley Johnson told the BBC he thought it was ""most brilliant"" that scientists had managed to make the connection. ""I think she's rather nice,"" he said of his ancestor. But what of Anna Catharina herself? Did she, to borrow a phrase from her seven-times great grandson, live a life of blameless domesticity? In fact she seems to have. Many of Anna Catharina Bischoff's descendants - including Stanley Johnson (right) and Rachel Johnson - are in the public eye She married a church minister, and lived for much of her adult life in Strasbourg. There, it is believed, she may have contracted syphilis while caring for patients with the sexually transmitted disease. On the death of her husband she returned to her home town of Basel, and apparently underwent rigorous mercury treatment in the hope of a cure. It did not work: scientists believe Anna Catharina probably died from mercury poisoning. But the mercury also preserved her body - allowing today's researchers to find out exactly who she was, and who her descendants are.

"Mo'Nique is calling for a boycott of Netflix after the company allegedly offered her less money than Amy Schumer and Chris Rock for a comedy special. The comedian, an Oscar winner, claims Netflix is guilty of gender and racial bias. Mo'Nique says the streaming service offered her $500,000 (Â£350,380), much less than the $13million (Â£9.1m) Amy Schumer reportedly earned for hers. Netflix is yet to respond to a request for comment. Comedy legend Dave Chappelle was reportedly paid $20m (Â£14m) for each of his three 2017 specials, while Chris Rock is expected to receive the same for his upcoming shows. Mo'Nique has posted numerous videos to Instagram discussing the alleged offer. ""Hey my loves, I am asking that you stand with me and boycott Neflix for gender bias and colour bias,"" Mo'Nique said on Instagram. Allow Instagram content?

Mo'Nique says the streaming service admitted she was a ""legend"" like Chris Rock and David Chappelle, but wasn't worth as much to them. ""Why shouldn't I get what the legends are getting?

"This video can not be played Four stories of rough sleeping in England Rough sleeping in England has increased for the seventh year in a row, new official figures reveal. There were 4,751 people counted or estimated to be bedding down outside in autumn 2017, a 15% rise on the year before and more than double the figure recorded five years ago. The figures provide a snapshot of rough sleeping on a typical night and showed about a quarter were in London. The government said it was investing Â£1bn to tackle rough sleeping. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto. Can't see the map?Click here,external. Of the people counted in theMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) figures,external, 653 were women, 760 were EU nationals from outside the UK and 193 were from outside the EU. Most councils provide an estimate based on intelligence from local services but some conduct a count of the number of people seen sleeping rough on a single night. They do not include people who are in hostels, shelters or sofa surfers. Rough sleeping increased in London by 18% in a year and by 14% across the rest of England. The north west recorded an increase of 39%. Housing charity Shelter said the figures may be an underestimate because many people ""hide and remain out of sight"", meaning that counts often miss those who bed down for the night in derelict buildings. Chief executive Polly Neate, said: ""These figures expose the worst pain inflicted by our housing crisis. ""We have failed as a society when so many people are forced to sleep rough. But they are not alone, the scourge of homelessness extends far beyond our streets. ""Hidden away in emergency B&Bs, temporary bedsits and on friends' sofas are hundreds of thousands of other homeless people, including families with children."" Violence and loneliness New homelessness law: What impact will it have? How we ended up sleeping rough by the coast Reality Check: How do we count how many people are homeless? Homelessness charities said the figures showed the need for ""urgent"" action. Howard Sinclair, chief executive of St Mungo's, said: ""Another huge rise in the number of men and women sleeping rough in England, for seven years in a row and 169% since 2010, is shocking and a scandal."" Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said: ""It is truly a catastrophe that in a country as prosperous as this, more and more people are finding themselves forced to sleep in dangerous and freezing conditions."" From April councils will be legally obliged to provide services to anyone at risk of becoming homeless, not just those with a priority need such as vulnerable people or families with children. This video can not be played Hugo Sugg: 'I've been homeless more than once' The National Audit Officesaid homelessness of all kinds had increased""significantly"" over six years. Although London accounted for almost a quarter of all rough sleepers, figures for individual authorities showed areas such as Brighton and Hove, Bedford, Luton, Oxford, Southend-on-Sea, Eastbourne and Thanet all recorded high rates. The 217 rough sleepers counted in Westminster was equivalent to about 18 for every 10,000 households. In Brighton and Hove there were 178 rough sleepers, equivalent to about 14 for every 10,000 households. The biggest rise in rough sleepers recorded by an individual council was the London borough of Camden, which saw its number jump to more than seven times the figure for the previous year, up from 17 to 127. The north west of England recorded the biggest proportional rise in the number of rough sleepers. The jump from 313 to 434 between autumn 2016 and autumn 2017 was a 39% rise. Cheshire East saw rough sleeping increase from four cases to 21. However, the earlier figure was based on a count of rough sleepers and the latest is an estimate. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the government needed to allow authorities to borrow more to invest in new homes. Housing spokesman Councillor Martin Tett said: ""If we want to end homelessness then councils need to be given the powers and funding to adapt welfare reforms and begin building affordable homes again."" A spokesman for the MHCLG: ""No one should ever have to sleep rough. That's why this Government is committed to halving rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminating it altogether by 2027. ""To break the homelessness cycle once and for all, we are providing over Â£1 billion of funding, supporting rough sleepers with the most complex needs through a new Housing First approach and bringing in the most ambitious legislation in decades that will mean people get the support they need earlier. ""In addition a new cross-Government taskforce supported by a panel of experts will drive forward a new strategy that will make life on the streets a thing of the past.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May said more work needed to be done for women ""to be accepted and respected as equals"". A government minister has been reprimanded by No 10 for attending a men-only gala that led to allegations of sexual harassment and groping. Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said he attended The Presidents Club fundraiser but left early. The BBC understands Mr Zahawi was called to Downing Street on Wednesday to meet chief whip Julian Smith. Prime Minister Theresa May said she accepted Mr Zahawi's explanation, but was ""appalled"" at reports of the event. The Presidents Club said it was closing and would no longer hold eventsafter an undercover reporter for the Financial Times,externalrevealed hostesses were subject to groping and lewd comments. Mrs May, who is in Davos, said she understood that Mr Zahawi had left early from the event, but that such dinners should not take place. ""Frankly I was appalled,"" she said. ""I thought that sort of approach to women, that objectification of women, was something that we had left behind."" The Metropolitan Police said it had not received any complaints about the Presidents Club dinner last Thursday. Time up on men-only networking events? Scandal-hit club shuts amid groping claims 'Flirtatious and handsy': More women speak out The dinner and auction - which has taken place annually for over 30 years and raised Â£20m for children's charities - was held at the Dorchester Hotel in central London and attended by senior figures in business and finance. This video can not be played How The Presidents Club scandal unfolded The FT revealed the 130 hostesses were told to wear skimpy black outfits with matching underwear and high heels, and made to sign a non-disclosure agreement before starting work. Auction prizes included lunch with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a trip to a London strip club and plastic surgery ""to spice up your wife"". It is understood that Mr Johnson did not agree to support the event and will not take part in the lunch. Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said he had attended the scandal-hit event but left early Culture Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was appalled and it was a ""good thing"" that The Presidents club had shut down. He told the BBC Breakfast programme that he understood his colleague, Mr Zahawi, had been invited because it was a charity fundraiser. Asked if Mr Zahawi should stay in his role, Mr Hancock said it was a ""matter for the whips and the prime minister, rather than for me"". The organisation said it would distribute its remaining funds to children's charities, although some - including Great Ormond Street children's hospital - have said they will return any donations they have already received. The Charity Commission also said it was investigating the claims ""as a matter of urgency"". On Wednesday, Mr Zahawi, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, tweeted that he arrived at the event at 20:00 GMT and left at 21:35 GMT as he ""felt uncomfortable"", but said he did not see any of the ""horrific"" events reported. He also tweeted that he would never attend a men-only function again. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The minister for digital and the creative industries, Margot James, told Newsnight that the event represented ""the very worst form of sexism with a smile on its face"". But she stood by Mr Zahawi and his claim of an early exit. ""That indicates to me that he was shocked by the events, didn't like the culture, the atmosphere, and left,"" she said. This video can not be played Labour MP Jess Philips: 'Lads' culture has no place in country' But Labour's Sarah Jones said Mr Zahawi should resign if he did not report his concerns and had attended on previous occasions. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner also called for an investigation into his attendance. Earlier on Wednesday, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had confidence in Mr Zahawi and he was not being referred for investigation. One of the organisers, David Meller, quit his non-executive role on the Department for Education board following the reports. This video can not be played Financial Times journalist Madison Marriage: âI was groped several timesâ Madison Marriage, the reporter who worked at the event, said she and ""numerous other hostesses"" were groped at the dinner. Shetold BBC Newsnight: ""It's a hands up skirts, hands on bums but also hands on hips, hands on stomachs, arms going round your waist unexpectedly. ""This isn't, I suppose, a high-level groping, but one of the strangest things was you could be talking to a man and he'd suddenly start holding your hand."" She said there were other women there ""who had absolutely no idea that was the kind of event it would be"". Before the fundraiser announced it was closing, a number of businesses said they would cut ties with the event - including WPP, the world's biggest advertising agency, and real estate investment business Frogmore. British-Asian businessman, Rami Ranger, told the BBC Asian Network that men were warned not to ""misbehave"" prior to the dinner, which he was invited to by a friend and did not pay for. Mr Ranger said he was ""horrified"" by the revelations and would never attend a men-only event again. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, said: ""If even half of what's been written about this event is true, it is deplorable and confirms how far we have still to go to stamp out sexual harassment."" Ann Francke, CMI chief executive, told the BBC: ""If you're a captain of industry in 2018, do you really want your shareholders, your customers, your employees to see you associated with things like this? ""And all of the people who attended should have thought about that before they walked through that door."" Comedian and children's author David Walliams, who is not the subject of any allegations, was the compere for the evening. He said he ""did not witness any of the kind of behaviour that allegedly occurred"", but added that he was ""absolutely appalled"" by the reports and he would be donating his fee to the Children's Trust. TV presenter Jonny Gould, who was the auctioneer at the dinner, said he had ""never witnessed any of the alleged behaviour of guests at this event nor in previous years"". He added: ""If I had, I would not have continued to work at the event."" The Dorchester said it was ""deeply concerned"" and was looking into the claims. A spokesman for the Artista agency, which recruited the hostesses, said: ""I was not aware of any claims of sexual harassment but the kind of behaviour alleged is completely unacceptable. ""I am checking with the staff and any complaints will be dealt with promptly and fairly."" Have you ever worked as a hostess at an event like this?

"This video can not be played May in new warning to social media firms Investors should put pressure on technology giants to respond more quickly to extremist content on social networks, the prime minister has said. Theresa May told the World Economic Forum in Davos that investors should consider the social impact of the firms they have a stake in. Social networks must stop providing a platform for terror, extremism and child abuse, she stressed. Such content ought to be ""removed automatically"", Mrs May added. ""Earlier this month, a group of shareholders demanded that Facebook and Twitter disclose more information about sexual harassment, fake news, hate speech and other forms of abuse that take place on the companies' platforms,"" she said. ""Investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered - and I urge them to do so."" Ms May told the BBC in Davos that while technology firms were already working with the government, much more still needed to be done. ""The tech companies can be a tremendous force for good in so many ways, but also we need to ensure that we're looking at those ways in which the internet and technology can be used by those who wish to do us harm,"" she said. Telegram is an encrypted app that has been used by terrorists and criminals to network in secret online The prime minister also wants to see the stalwarts of the tech industry work together with start-ups to deal with the issue. Smaller platforms - such as the privacy-focused encrypted messaging app Telegram -are often used by terrorists, criminals and paedophiles,external. ""These companies have some of the best brains in the world,"" Mrs May said. ""They must focus their brightest and best on meeting these fundamental social responsibilities."" Telegram has previouslysaid it is ""no friend of terrorists"",externaland blocked channels used by extremists. Last year Facebook announced several measures designed to improve the detection of illegal content on the network, includingusing artificial intelligenceto spot images, videos and text related to terrorism, as well as clusters of fake accounts. In November the social network said 99% of the material it now removes about al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State wasfirst detected by itself rather than its users. However, Facebook admitted it had to do more work to identify other terror and extremist groups. Facebook says it is using AI to detect and remove content relating to Islamic State ""Tech firms may not always agree with government on the means, but there is no disagreement on the objective to make online platforms hostile environments for illegal and inappropriate content,"" said Julian David, chief executive of tech trade association techUK.

"Sky plans to make all its channels and content available online, giving customers the option of doing away with a satellite dish. The pay TV company already offers some programming online on its Sky Go and Now TV services and through Sky boxes. Sky said offering the option was a ""major development"" that would let it enter new markets. It hopes that making its hundreds of channels more widely available will increase both revenue and profits. Italy will be its first market to get all Sky channels online, followed by Austria, with the UK expected to follow later this year or in 2019. Sky is not proposing to stop broadcasting by satellite. The move will allow customers who cannot have a dish or do not want one to get Sky, a spokesperson said. A Sky box will still be required. The company's move is a response to greater competition from the likes of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon. Jeremy Darroch, Sky chief executive, said the consumer environment was expected to remain ""challenging"". Sky-Fox deal 'not in public interest' What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal? Reporting itsresults for the six months to 31 December,external, Sky said average revenue per user in the UK and Ireland - by far its biggest market - fell Â£1 to Â£46 a month. However, the number of customers leaving - the ""churn"" rate - decreased from 11.6% at the end of 2016 to 11.2%. Sky said the fall was a result of more customers taking its premium Sky Q box and a ""more disciplined and targeted approach to discounting"". Julia Stiles stars in the Sky Atlantic drama Riviera Mr Darroch said there was good growth at both the top end of the market, with its premium Sky Q box now in 2 million homes in the UK and Ireland, and the bottom end with Now TV. Now TV offers sports, movies and entertainment channels over the internet more flexibly and cheaply than through a Sky subscription. A new USB stick will allow customers to watch Now TV content on any television - including EU countries when an expected change to ""geoblocking"" rules comes into effect this summer. The number of Sky retail customers in the UK and Ireland rose by 255,000 to 12.9 million, while Sky added 365,000 new customers to bring the total to 22.9 million. Like-for-like revenues rose 5% to Â£6.7bn in the half-year and pre-tax profit jumped by Â£106m to Â£448m compared with the same period in the previous year. Last year 21st Century Fox made a bid to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not own. Both companies are controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. This week the the UK's Competition and Markets Authority ruled that the proposed takeover wasnot in the public interest on grounds of media plurality. Since Fox made the bid it has agreed to be taken over by Disney, so the US media giant could end up owning Sky. Sky shares rose 1.1% to Â£10.35 in afternoon trading in London, valuing the company at Â£17.7bn. Sky-Fox deal 'not in public interest' What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal?

"Fishermen burned tyres as they blocked a road leading to the port of Boulogne French fishermen have blocked the ports of Calais and Boulogne in protest at so-called pulse fishing, which uses electrified nets to stun fish. Fishing boats stopped ferries entering or leaving Calais while a roadblock stopped traffic at Boulogne. Calais is a major link between the UK and France used by thousands of tourists and lorries every day. The European Parliament recently voted to ban pulse fishing which is mainly used by Dutch trawlers. The head of P&O Ferries, Janette Bell, said the blockade of Calais was ""utterly unacceptable"". It was lifted at 17:00 (16:00 GMT), though the ports were expected to take a while to get back to normal. The fishermen said they would meet government officials on Friday to discuss the issue. Fishing boats were stopping ferries entering or leaving Calais The English port of Dover was also hit by the action, with P&O and DFDS Seaways suspending some scheduled services. DFDS later rerouted some services through Dunkirk while P&O advised some customers to use the Channel Tunnel. Fishermen in Boulogne set pallets and tyres alight on an access road while two French boats blockaded an area of the port where Dutch trawlers unload their catches. Pulse fishing: Is it ok to 'electrocute' fish? Dover MP Charlie Elphicke called on French President Emmanuel Macron to ""get a grip of the situation"" and put a stop to the disruption which he said was damaging both the French and British economies.

StÃ©phane Pinto, vice president of the regional fisheries committee, said a small flotilla of boats had sailed to Calais from Boulogne and other boats from Dunkirk had joined them. He said the fishermen faced financial losses because of the use of pulse fishing. ""We're at our wits ends. We feel abandoned,"" he added. The controversial technique involves trawlers using nets that generate an electric current, stunning the fish and making them float upwards where they are easier to catch. This video can not be played Is electrofishing safe and humane? The Netherlands is the biggest user of this method in the EU, and argues that it is better for the environment than traditional trawling. However, the practice has inflamed French fishermen who complain it is depleting stocks. The French conservation group Bloom is also campaigning against the method. Following its vote, the European Parliament will hold long negotiations with the European Commission and member states to agree a package of measures to streamline regulations for fishing. Dutch trawlers can continue to use pulse fishing until the new legislation comes into force.

"This video can not be played President Trump said he welcomed being quizzed by Mr Mueller President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to be questioned under oath as part of an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. He said he was ""looking forward"" to it, subject to the advice of his lawyers. Investigators are assessing if the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election in his favour - a claim denied by Mr Trump and Russia. Investigators will also determine if Mr Trump obstructed the inquiry. The US intelligence community has already concluded that Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. The president had previously said he thought an interview was ""unlikely""because there had been no collusion. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words The 'secret memo' intriguing Washington He has called the Russia investigation a ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax"". Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, Mr Trump maintained he was ""absolutely"" prepared to be questioned under oath by the top investigator. ""There's been no collusion whatsoever, there's no obstruction whatsoever,"" he said. On Thursday morning Mr Trump landed in Zurich, on his way to the World Economic Forum in Davos. He is the first sitting US president to do so since Bill Clinton 18 years ago. The president's lawyers have been talking to the investigation team led by justice department special counsel Robert Mueller about an interview, and the form it might take. The questioning could happen face-to-face, in writing, or it could be a combination of both. Special council Robert Mueller is a former FBI director As to when it might happen, Mr Trump said: ""Yesterday they were talking about two to three weeks."" Asked if he thought Mr Mueller would be fair, the president replied: ""We are going to find out... I hope so."" ALawyer's Worst Nightmare Analysis:Anthony Zurcher- BBCWashington A lawyer's worst nightmare is a client who won't stop talking. And when the client is the president, whose every public utterance is carefully inspected, the headaches are compounded. Such is the fate of Ty Cobb, Donald Trump's personal lawyer. At the moment, his legal team is in delicate negotiations with Robert Mueller about how - or whether - the president might answer questions the special counsel has relevant to his investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Could the interview be conducted in person or via written answers? Will it be open-ended or will the boundaries of any discussion be delineated? This is all reportedly on the table. Then, on Wednesday night, Mr Trump not only said he's eager to talk directly with Mr Mueller, but that he's willing to do so ""under oath"". The president also appears to have outlined a defence against allegations that he may have illegally interfered with the Russia investigation, saying his efforts to ""fight back"" against a partisan witch hunt were being unfairly characterised as obstruction. That kind of strategy is better suited for a war for public opinion than a legal fight. Mr Trump, however, may end up with both. US Attorney General Jeff Sessions was interviewed by the Mueller inquiryfor several hours last week. The country's top prosecutor is thought to be the first member of the Trump cabinet to be questioned.

"This video can not be played President Trump said he welcomed being quizzed by Mr Mueller President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to be questioned under oath as part of an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. He said he was ""looking forward"" to it, subject to the advice of his lawyers. Investigators are assessing if the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election in his favour - a claim denied by Mr Trump and Russia. Investigators will also determine if Mr Trump obstructed the inquiry. The US intelligence community has already concluded that Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. The president had previously said he thought an interview was ""unlikely""because there had been no collusion. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words The 'secret memo' intriguing Washington He has called the Russia investigation a ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax"". Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, Mr Trump maintained he was ""absolutely"" prepared to be questioned under oath by the top investigator. ""There's been no collusion whatsoever, there's no obstruction whatsoever,"" he said. On Thursday morning Mr Trump landed in Zurich, on his way to the World Economic Forum in Davos. He is the first sitting US president to do so since Bill Clinton 18 years ago. The president's lawyers have been talking to the investigation team led by justice department special counsel Robert Mueller about an interview, and the form it might take. The questioning could happen face-to-face, in writing, or it could be a combination of both. Special council Robert Mueller is a former FBI director As to when it might happen, Mr Trump said: ""Yesterday they were talking about two to three weeks."" Asked if he thought Mr Mueller would be fair, the president replied: ""We are going to find out... I hope so."" ALawyer's Worst Nightmare Analysis:Anthony Zurcher- BBCWashington A lawyer's worst nightmare is a client who won't stop talking. And when the client is the president, whose every public utterance is carefully inspected, the headaches are compounded. Such is the fate of Ty Cobb, Donald Trump's personal lawyer. At the moment, his legal team is in delicate negotiations with Robert Mueller about how - or whether - the president might answer questions the special counsel has relevant to his investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Could the interview be conducted in person or via written answers? Will it be open-ended or will the boundaries of any discussion be delineated? This is all reportedly on the table. Then, on Wednesday night, Mr Trump not only said he's eager to talk directly with Mr Mueller, but that he's willing to do so ""under oath"". The president also appears to have outlined a defence against allegations that he may have illegally interfered with the Russia investigation, saying his efforts to ""fight back"" against a partisan witch hunt were being unfairly characterised as obstruction. That kind of strategy is better suited for a war for public opinion than a legal fight. Mr Trump, however, may end up with both. US Attorney General Jeff Sessions was interviewed by the Mueller inquiryfor several hours last week. The country's top prosecutor is thought to be the first member of the Trump cabinet to be questioned.

"Smokers need to quit cigarettes rather than cut back on them to significantly lower their risk of heart disease and stroke, a large BMJ study suggests. People who smoked even one cigarette a day were still about 50% more likely to develop heart disease and 30% more likely to have a stroke than people who had never smoked, researchers said. They said it showed there was no safe level of smoking for such diseases. But an expert said people who cut down were more likely to stop. Why young people are now less likely to smoke Quit smoking campaign backs e-cigs 'One smoke leads to daily habit for most' Cardiovascular disease, not cancer, is the greatest mortality risk for smoking, causing about 48% of smoking-related premature deaths. While the percentage of adults in the UK who smoked had been falling, the proportion of people who smoked one to five cigarettes a day had been rising steadily, researchers said. Theiranalysis of 141 studies, published in the BMJ,external, indicates a 20-a-day habit would cause seven heart attacks or strokes in a group of 100 middle-aged people. But if they drastically cut back to one a day it would still cause three heart attacks, the research suggests. The researchers said men who smoked one cigarette a day had about a 48% higher risk of developing coronary heart disease and were 25% more likely to have a stroke than those who had never smoked. For women, it was higher - 57% for heart disease and 31% for stroke. Prof Allan Hackshaw at the UCL Cancer Institute at University College London, who led the study, told the BBC: ""There's been a trend in quite a few countries for heavy smokers to cut down, thinking that's perfectly fine, which is the case for things like cancer. ""But for these two common disorders, which they're probably more likely to get than cancer, it's not the case. They've got to stop completely."" The researchers said it might be expected that smoking fewer cigarettes would reduce harm in a proportionate way as had been shown in some studies with lung cancer. However, they found that men who smoked one cigarette per day had 46% of the excess risk of heart disease and 41% for stroke compared with those who smoked 20 cigarettes per day. For women it was 31% of the excess risk of heart disease and 34% for stroke. Prof Hackshaw said the increased risks of cardiovascular illness were over the course of a lifetime but damage could be done in just a few years of smoking. But he said the good news was that those who quit smoking could also quickly reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease. Paul Aveyard, professor of behavioural medicine at the University of Oxford, said the ""well conducted"" study confirmed what epidemiologists had suspected - that light smoking created a ""substantial risk for heart disease and stroke"". But he said it was wrong to conclude cutting down smoking was useless. ""Those who try to cut down with the aid of nicotine, whether from nicotine replacement treatment or an e-cigarette, are more likely to stop eventually and thus really reduce their risks from smoking,"" he said. Martin Dockrell, tobacco lead at Public Health England, said: ""This study adds to the growing body of evidence which tells us that cutting down to just one cigarette a day still leaves a substantial risk of heart attack and stroke. The best and safest thing you can do is to quit completely for good."" Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity ASH, said: ""It's addiction to nicotine that keeps people smoking but it's the tar in cigarette smoke that does the serious damage. ""Vaping is much less harmful, but only if you quit smoking altogether."" Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said discouraging people from cutting down smoking could be ""counter-productive"". FollowAlex on Twitter,external.

"After falling for several years, knife crime in England and Wales is rising again. So what is happening? There were 43,516 knife crime offences in the 12 months ending March 2019. This is an 80% increase from the low-point in the year ending March 2014, when there were 23,945 offences, and is the highest number since comparable data was compiled. These statistics do not include those from Greater Manchester Police because of data recording issues. Out of the 44 police forces, 43 recorded a rise in knife crime since 2011. Police figures are prone to changes in counting rules and methods, but data for NHS hospitals in England over a similar period showed an 8% increase in admissions for assault by a sharp object, leading the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to conclude there had been a ""real change"" to the downward trend in knife crime. Doctors said the injuries they were treating were becoming more severe and the victims were getting younger, with increasing numbers of girls involved. All of the statistics here relate to England and Wales. Policing, criminal justice and sentencing are devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which also collect crime data in slightly different ways. In the latest figures, which include only selected knife offences, about half, 21,700, were assaults that caused an injury or where there was an intent to cause serious harm; a further 20,172 involved robberies. These figures focus on homicides, or killings, a category comprising cases of murder, manslaughter and infanticide. In about two out of every five killings, the victim was fatally assaulted with a sharp object or stabbed to death. The number of knife-related homicides went from 272 in 2007 to 186 in 2015.  Since then it's risen every year, with a steep increase in 2017-18, when there were 285 killings, the highest figure since 1946. One in four victims were men aged 18-24. The figures also show 25% of victims were black - the highest proportion since data was first collected in 1997. Although knife crime is on the increase, it should be seen in context. It's relatively unusual for a violent incident to involve a knife, and rarer still for someone to need hospital treatment. Most violence is caused by people hitting, kicking, shoving or slapping someone, sometimes during a fight and often when they're drunk; the police figures on violence also include crimes of harassment and stalking. The Crime Survey for England and Wales, which includes offences that aren't reported to police, indicates that overall levels of violence have fallen by about a quarter since 2013. However, the police-recorded statistics - which tend to pick up more ""high harm"" crimes - have indicated that the most serious violent crime is increasing. In the year to March 2019, 22,041 people were cautioned, reprimanded or convicted for carrying a knife in England and Wales, most of whom were adults. But one in five - 4,451 - was under the age of 18. Knife crime tends to be more prevalent in large cities, particularly in London. For every 100,000 people in the capital, there were 169 knife offences in 2018-19. In 2018, figures from the mayor's office showed that young black and minority ethnic teenage boys and men were disproportionately affected, as both victims and perpetrators. The Metropolitan Police Chief Commissioner Cressida Dick has said tackling violence in London is her ""priority"". Next highest was the North West, with 93 knife offences per 100,000 population, and Yorkshire and the Humber, 86. The explanations for rising knife crime have ranged from police budget cuts, to gang violence and disputes between drug dealers. Some have also cited the steep decline in the use by police of stop and search. The powers enable officers to search people on the street if they have reasonable grounds to suspect they may be carrying weapons, illegal drugs, stolen property or items to be used to commit a crime. People can also be searched without reasonable grounds if a senior officer believes there's a risk of serious violence in a particular area. From 2009, the number of stops fell sharply across England and Wales, especially in London, primarily because of concerns that the measures unfairly targeted young black men, wasted police resources and were ineffective at catching criminals. Theresa May, as home secretary, led efforts to drive down the number of stops, but there's anecdotal evidence from police that young people are now more inclined to carry knives because of growing confidence they won't be stopped. The statistical basis for that is far from clear - but Scotland Yard, with the mayor of London's support, has begun increasing the use of stop and search again. Since 2010, police numbers have decreased by almost 20,000. Prime Minister Theresa Mayhas said there is no ""direct correlation""between the rise in knife crime and a fall in police numbers, but the issue is contested. In 2018, a Home Affairs Committee reportsaid police forces were ""struggling to cope""amid falling staff numbers anda leaked Home Office documentsaid they had ""likely contributed"" to a rise in serious violent crime. The average prison term for those jailed for carrying a knife or other offensive weapon has gone up from almost five months to well over eight months, with 85% serving at least three months, compared with 53% only 10 years ago. Sentences for all kinds of violent crime have been getting tougher, particularly for knife crime. The Ministry of Justice tracks the penalties imposed for those caught carrying knives and other offensive weapons in England and Wales. In the year ending December 2018, 37% of those dealt with were jailed and a further 18% were given a suspended prison sentence. The figures for 2008, when the data was first compiled, were 20% and 9% respectively. Over the same period, there's been a steady decline in the use of community sentences, and a sharp drop in cautions, from 30% to 11%. Public anxiety about knife crime, legislative changes and firmer guidance for judges and magistrates have led to the stiffer sentences, although offenders under 18 are still more likely to be cautioned than locked up.

"This video can not be played Special correspondent Ed Thomas has witnessed the reality of knife crime The number of violent crimes and sex offences recorded by police in England and Wales has risen sharply over the past year, figures suggest. Knife crime and robbery also increased in the 12 months to September 2017 compared with the previous year, theOffice for National Statistics said.,external About 5.3 million crimes were recorded in all in that 12-month period, up 14%. However, the separate Crime Survey, based on people's experiences, suggests crime continues to fall. This survey, based on interviews with 35,000 households in England and Wales, includes crimes that people do not report to police. Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales Crime survey v police statistics - how do they compare? Can Scotland help London stop violent deaths? On a knife edge: Rising violence in London The latest police figures for the 12 months to September from 44 forces show: 68,968 robbery offences, up29% 138,045 sex offences, up23% 37,443 knife crime offences, up21% 1,291,405 violent crime offences, up20% There were 37,443 knife crimes and 6,694 gun crime offences recorded in the year to September. The number of offences involving a knife or a sharp instrument had been falling since 2011 but started rising again over the past three years, the ONS said. This contrasts with the Crime Survey which found that most crimes either fell or were at a similar level. However the ONS says higher-harm violent offences, such as knife crime occur in relatively low volumes, and also tend to be concentrated in cities and are therefore not ""well-measured"" by the Crime Survey. Excluding the Hillsborough stadium deaths and last year's terror attacks from the data, 57 more people were killed or murdered than the previous year - the highest total since 2008-9. The 96 cases of manslaughter from Hillsborough stadium in 1989 were only included in crime figures in 2016, after an inquest ruled that the football fans had been unlawfully killed. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Although there's likely to be a dispute about the accuracy of the police crime figures because they hinge, to some extent, on the way forces log offences, how pro-active they are and the willingness of victims to come forward, they clearly demonstrate a rapidly rising caseload. For example, recorded sexual offences and violent crimes have more than doubled in three years. At the same time, the number of police officers has continued to fall: in the 12 months to last September, down 930 to 121,929. The Home Office says that's the lowest figure since comparable records began in 1996. That combination - rising crime, declining police numbers - is creating enormous strain for forces. But it's unclear whether the smaller police workforce is contributing to the growth in violent crime, particularly what the ONS says are the ""genuine"" increases in knife crime and firearm offences. This video can not be played Knife crime was up by 26% year-on-year - an increasing number of teenagers in London are being injured by knives There were also increases in vehicle-related theft offences, which were up 18% to 443,577, and burglary, which rose by 8% to 433,110, police data showed. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the figures were ""truly shocking"" and should ""put an end to government complacency on crime"". ""The Tories are failing in a basic duty to protect the public,"" she added. The Police and Crime Commissioner for the West Midlands, David Jamieson, said his force had lost more than 2,000 uniformed officers since 2010 and his budget had been cut by 25%. ""Any sensible person can see if you take away a quarter of the budget, you can't carry on protecting the public in the same way,"" he told BBC News. He anticipates having to lose a further 150 officers this year. Police Federation of England and Wales General Secretary Andy Fittes said:  ""The reality is there are around 21,000 fewer officers than there were in 2010 and they are having to deal with an ever-increasing number of crimes."" ""To say crime has fallen is smoke and mirrors,"" he added. He added that police officers have ""numerous other roles"" not covered in today's statistics - such as counter-terrorism, sex offender management, policing football matches and missing person searches. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The independent Office for National Statistics is clear that overall, traditional crime is continuing to fall. ""It is now down by almost 40% since 2010."" Policing Minister Nick Hurd also said crime had fallen but added the government was ""very concerned"" about the ""uptick in the most serious violent crime"". He said the government would ""redouble efforts"" to bear down on the increased through legislation and tougher police enforcement. And also to try to steer young people away from ""a culture of violence"". Reality Check: Is there more crime?

"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin For nearly two years the Trump-Russia affair has dominated front pages and mired the president's administration in conflict and controversy. But what is it exactly? How did it begin? And what did it find out? The inquiry, led by widely respected former director of the FBI Robert Mueller, focused on alleged collusion between Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Moscow. The report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out 10 instances where the president possibly obstructed justice. Mr Mueller has said his report did not exonerate the president, but that charging a sitting president was not an option. Here's a breakdown on one of the most high-profile political inquiries in US history. Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams were accused of conspiring with Russian agents to influence the US election in the then Republican candidate's favour. US intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scales of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Both the Russian and US presidents had poured scorn on suggestions of ""collusion"", with Mr Trump calling it ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". At least 17 Trump associates had contacts with Russians or Wikileaks, which released hacked documents, during the campaign or transition, according toan analysis of public records by the New York Times,external, with at least 100 face-to-face interactions, phone calls or electronic messages with Russians or Kremlin-linked figures and at least 51 individual communications. Trump aides known to have had contact with Russians include the president's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, his son Donald Trump Jr, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The president's supporters point out that interactions with foreign nationals are routine during any White House campaign, but three Trump associates have now admitted lying about these encounters. The special counsel has indicted more than 30 people, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team or administration, an adviser and long-time ally, and 26 Russians, as well as three Russian companies. A former prosecutor, Mr Mueller went on to become the second-longest serving FBI director in history, after J Edgar Hoover. His Senate confirmation vote as FBI director went 98-0 in his favour. A special Senate vote to extend his term beyond the usual 10 years to 12 passed 100-0. With a team of experienced lawyers drawn from private practice and from the Department of Justice, as well as FBI officers, Mr Mueller worked quietly from an unassuming building in south-west Washington, not issuing any public comment during the investigation. What is a special counsel? America's most mysterious public figure On 22 March, he submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, who replaced Jeff Sessions after he was forced to resign. The448-page report,externalpainted a mixed picture of the president's conduct. While it did not establish that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to meddle in the election, it built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the president. Mr Mueller said the report did not exonerate the president but stopped short of saying Mr Trump committed a crime. Eight new things in the Mueller report ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" It also revealed Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try and remove Mr Mueller over alleged ""conflicts of interest"", but the lawyer resigned. Around 10% of the public report is redacted. As well as the special counsel inquiry by Mr Mueller under the aegis of the justice department there have been four congressional investigations: The Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating alleged Kremlin meddling and any collusion with Trump aides The House Oversight Committee is scrutinising links between Trump associates and Russian officials The Judiciary Committee has issued more than 80 document requests in a broad probe that goes beyond alleged contacts between the campaign and Moscow Meanwhile federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York and in Washington are looking at other areas related to Russia All of the House inquiries were plagued by political squabbling amongst lawmakers, and closed without leading to any charges or claims of Russian collusion. Democrats have reopened the investigations after gaining a majority in the House in January. The Senate committee has yet to release its findings. Before the redacted report was released, Mr Barr, who was attorney general under the late George HW Bush between 1991 and 1993, spent two days poring over Mr Mueller's report beforeissuing his interpretation to Congress. There was a lot of speculation that an obstruction of justice legal case against the president could be considered. One of the possibilities raised was that it could look into Mr Trump's sacking of James Comey as head of the FBI. But legal experts had warned that the charge carried a fairly high threshold - proof of ""corrupt intent"". In his summary, Mr Barr says, quoting Mr Mueller's report: ""The special counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him'."" Mr Barr then says that, after consulting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, there was insufficient evidence ""to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence"". Mr Mueller gave a rare statement in May about the investigation, and announced his office was officially shutting down. His statement largely reaffirmed what was in the report released with redactions last month. He said if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump ""clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so"". Mr Mueller added that ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process. The special counsel said he did not believe it was ""appropriate to speak further"" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report. But the end of the special counsel investigation does not mark the end of the story. The former FBI director will face questions from two congressional committees about his report on the Donald Trump campaign and Russia. The congressional probes could stretch into 2020 and several of the prosecutions Mr Mueller initiated could be continued by lawyers within the Department of Justice. This video can not be played What to expect from Mueller hearings Mr Barr has said that it is his objective to get as much information to Congress and the public as possible, consistent with prosecutorial guidelines and confidentiality requirements. Democrats in Congress have called for whatever information Mr Mueller produces to be released publicly in its entirety. Back in February 2017, before Mr Mueller was appointed as special counsel, the FBI was investigating Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russian officials. Then-head of the FBI, Mr Comey, attended a briefing in the Oval Office at the White House, along with Vice-President Mike Pence and Mr Sessions. According to a detailed account of the meeting written by Mr Comey immediately afterwards, the president asked Mr Pence and Mr Sessions to leave the room before suggesting Mr Comey end the Flynn investigation. The FBI director's notes quote the president as saying: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" Mr Comey prepared memos from his notes and shared them with other senior FBI officials, saying he was concerned about the nature of the meeting. A few months later, in May, the president sacked Mr Comey, citing ""this Russia thing"", a move that shocked Washington and led to talk of a cover-up. Part of the inquiry focuses on a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City involving Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. The meeting occurred after a Russian intermediary contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would ""incriminate"" Hillary Clinton - the Democratic candidate - and be ""very useful to your father"". It was part of the Russian government's ""support"" for Mr Trump, he noted. Mr Trump Jr replied: ""I love it."" Mr Trump Jr later defended the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered only ""inane nonsense"" and nothing came of it, but he also told Fox News' Sean Hannity ""in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently"". In an initial statement to explain the meeting one year after it occurred, Mr Trump Jr claimed that it had been held to discuss Russian adoptions. But in a follow-up statement he said that the actual purpose had been about political opposition research. In June 2018 Mr Trump tweeted that the meeting was ""to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics"". President Trump's lawyers say he dictated his son's first misleading explanation, leading to questions of whether the president sought to obstruct a Department of Justice inquiry. See our fullRussia timeline. The arrest of Mr Stone, a long-time adviser and close confidant to Mr Trump, marks a significant development in this legal drama. The charges against him are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. Mr Stone denies suggestions of criminal misconduct. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Stone: Trump ally, political strategist and Nixon fan It means that, for the first time, a member of Mr Trump's inner circle is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling. Mr Papadopoulos's role in the drama begins with a May 2016 drink in a London bar with an Australian diplomat. He told the envoy that Russia had ""political dirt"" on Hillary Clinton - a conversation which was later reported by Australian authorities to the FBI and may have prompted the bureau's investigation into the campaign. In late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Mr Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. He falsely claimed he had met two figures with Russian connections before joining the Trump campaign in March 2016. In fact, he met them after joining the campaign. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. Emails reveal that he communicated with high-level figures in the Trump campaign. He was pictured in March 2016 seated at a foreign policy meeting with Mr Trump, Jeff Sessions and others, in a photo Mr Trump shared on Twitter. Just before he began a two-week sentence in a Wisconsin prison in late November 2018 however, he sent a tweet saying he had ""never met a single Russian official"". On his release, he announced he was publishing a book entitled ""Deep State Target: How I got caught in the crosshairs of the plot to bring down President Trump"". In January 2017, a secret dossier was leaked to the press. It had been compiled by a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, Christopher Steele, who had been paid to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia. The dossier alleged Moscow had compromising material on Mr Trump, including claims he was once recorded with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel during a 2013 trip for one of his Miss Universe pageants. Mr Trump emphatically denies this. The file purported to show financial and personal links between Mr Trump, his advisers and Moscow. It also suggested the Kremlin had cultivated Mr Trump for years before he ran for president. Mr Trump dismissed the dossier, arguing its contents were based largely on unnamed sources. It was later reported that Mr Steele's report was funded as opposition research by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Fusion GPS, the Washington-based firm that was hired to commission the dossier, had previously been paid via a conservative website to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. It didn't, exactly. Hacking voter machines, and rigging elections generally, is very, very difficult. Hacking people? That would be easier. The special counsel charges show that Russia effectively ran a two-pronged operation. The first prong in mid-2016 allegedly involved sending rafts of so-called ""phishing"" emails to figures in the Democratic Party - an unsophisticated method used by everyone from state-sponsored actors to low-level scammers for duping people into giving up their passwords. Hackers gained access to the Democratic National Committee's systems and the personal email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. They leaked tens of thousands of emails revealing the inner workings of the Clinton campaign and the party's operations, along with mundane, embarrassing details. The second prong allegedly involved flooding social media networks, especially Facebook, with bogus stories designed to smear the Democrats and undermine the Clinton campaign. According to testimony by Facebook before Congress, Russia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans on the social network during and after election. In August 2016, an envelope arrived at the White House marked for the eyes of President Barack Obama and three senior aides. According to theWashington Post,external, the envelope had come by courier from the CIA, and contained a bombshell revelation - Mr Putin was directing a state-sponsored effort to interfere with the US election. The FBI was already looking at ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but the CIA memo seemed to confirm Russian efforts to throw the election Mr Trump's way. According to reporting in the Post and elsewhere, the Obama administration agonised over whether to divulge the alleged operations. Reportedly fearful of appearing to attempt to interfere politically, they stayed relatively quiet. Other intelligence agencies were slow in reaching the same conclusion as the CIA, and congressional Republicans were reluctant to offer support to a public condemnation of Moscow. Warnings were issued to Russian officials, but it wasn't until the main US intelligence agencies agreed, in late September, that President Obama directed them to make a public statement. To avoid appearing partisan, the statement would not carry his name. The president is celebrating the findings of the special counsel's report revealed by Mr Barr, but there are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political. However, it is effectively impossible to bring criminal charges against a sitting president, and any case would have to be brought by the executive branch, of which Mr Trump is the boss. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? As for impeachment, it remains unlikely at this stage. A majority in the House of Representatives is first required to approve an article of impeachment, and the Democratic leaders in that chamber appear reluctant to make such a move until the multiple investigations are concluded. In the event of a successful House vote, the Senate holds a trial presided over by the Supreme Court chief justice, and a two-thirds majority vote is required in the Senate to convict the president. That's a high bar - two presidents, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have been acquitted at this stage. With a Republican majority in the 100-seat Senate, at least 19 members of Mr Trump's own party would have to break ranks to remove him from office.

"Congressman Devin Nunes' memo is shrouded in secrecy - for now It's the memo that everyone is talking about, but no-one can (really) talk about. Depending on whom you ask, it will either explode the entire basis for the Trump-Russia investigation or is an inflammatory collection of rumours and conjecture. Donald Trump Jr has tweeted about it. More than 200 members of Congress have seen it. A social media hashtag - #releasethememo - has been pushed by interested parties including, it appears, a sizable number of pro-Russian Twitter bots. The document was written by staffers working for Devin Nunes, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, which is holding hearings on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and, seemingly of equal interest to the congressman, investigating allegations of anti-Trump bias in the US intelligence community. Mr Nunesmade headlineslast March when he visited the White House and then publicly announced that some members of Donald Trump's post-election team had been the subject of ""incidental surveillance"" by US intelligence agencies. He later had to step down from overseeing the Russian hearings because he was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for possibly sharing classified intelligence with the White House. He has since been cleared in the matter by the ethics panel. The four-page memo is said to draw on highly classified information about FBI surveillance practices that, according to many of the Republicans who have read it, were abused by the intelligence community in order to undermine Mr Trump's campaign and, subsequently, his presidency. The memo reportedly asserts that the decision to begin surveillance of Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page was based on the so-called Steele dossier - the collection of largely unsubstantiated raw intelligence gathered by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. That set the ball rolling for broader investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, an inquiry that continues, under the direction of special counsel Robert Mueller, to this day. Members of the intelligence community dispute this claim and insist that Page was on the counter-intelligence radar long before the dossier research, which was funded by anti-Trump conservatives and later Democrats, was ever circulated. The memo may also reportedly contain - or reference - evidence of anti-Trump sentiment from high-level FBI officials, possibly including Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and Peter Strzok, the top FBI Russia expert involved in the bureau's 2016 election investigations and who later moved over to Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation. Strzok has been in the headlines for text messages he exchanged in 2016 with an FBI colleague with whom he was having an extramarital affair. The messages, many of which have already been publicly released, show the two criticising candidate Trump, as well as other politicians and Justice Department officials. Conservative commentators and some politicians have expressed concern that other messages, dating from late 2016 through the early days of the Trump presidency, were not preserved by the FBI due to misconfigured mobile phones. Then there are rumours that the memo might also cast Rod Rosenstein, who as deputy attorney general is overseeing the Justice Department Russia investigation, in a less-than-favourable light. If all this sounds rather vague, it's because the memo has yet to be made public. Lots of people are talking about what it means, but few are giving any specific details about what it contains. As the ""secret"" memo circulates through the halls of Congress, many conservatives are saying it contains explosive revelations. Iowa Congressman Steve King has compared the allegations in the memo to the scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon, saying they're  ""worse than Watergate"". ""I've read the memo,"" says Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, who has been one of the sharpest critics of the Mueller investigation. ""It has surprised and horrified many of us."" He said that the memo will not just lead to firings within the FBI, but also criminal prosecution. Other Republicans have downplayed the implications of the memo. Mueller 'in talks to interview Trump' Why attacks on Mueller are mounting ""I think there's a lot of paranoia around here when it comes to that topic,"" John Cornyn, a top Senate Republican,told Politico,external. While Donald Trump himself has not commented on the memo - although Gaetz reportedly discussed it with the president during a meeting - one of his sons has taken up the cause. ""It sounds pretty troubling to me,"" Donald Trump Jr told Fox News. ""The interesting thing about it is the only collusion, the only shadiness, the only thing that's been discovered is what the prior administration, the [Democratic National Committee] and all of them have done."" Hardly. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the memo is based on cherry-picked information presented in a ""profoundly misleading"" way. ""Rife with factual inaccuracies and referencing highly classified materials that most of Republican Intelligence Committee members were forced to acknowledge they had never read, this is meant only to give Republican House members a distorted view of the FBI,"" Schiff said in a press statement. Jarod Nadler of New York, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, complained ina letter,externalto committee chair Bob Goodlatte that the FBI and the Justice Department has not been able to see the memo in order to respond to the allegations. Mr Schiff and Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, have also noted that the hashtag conservatives are using to push for public dissemination of the document - #releasethememo - is being promoted by social media accounts linked to Russian influence operations. In a letter to Facebook and Twitter executives, they note data from asocial media watchdog group,externalthat showed that particular hashtag was by far the most tweeted by Russian bots. ""If these reports are accurate, we are witnessing an ongoing attack by the Russian government through Kremlin-linked social media actors directly acting to intervene and influence our democratic process,"" they write. ""This should be disconcerting to all Americans, but especially your companies, as once again, it appears the vast majority of their efforts are concentrated on your platforms."" Probably. As president, Mr Trump has the power to declassify any document he wishes. The House Intelligence Committee has voted to release the memo, which Mr Trump must accept or reject. If he signs off, the full House of Representatives could meet in closed session to vote on the matter. Or the president could take the committee approval as sufficient to justify ordering the release immediately. Sixty-five members of the House of Representatives have signed a letter urging the memo's publication. A member of Congress with a particularly good memory could even recite details of the memo into the congressional record, free from legal jeopardy. Then there's the possibility that the memo - which is being kept in a secure location - could end up anonymously leaked to the press. Wikileaks - which the US intelligence agencies concluded collaborated with Russian interests during the 2016 election - has offered $1m for anyone who provides it with a copy of the document. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Democrats in Congress - and some Republicans - have resisted efforts to make the memo public, citing the highly classified intelligence on which it is based. ""The documents that supposedly inform these talking points are highly classified,"" the members of the House Intelligence Committee said in ajoint statement,external. ""And they will not be made public, making it impossible for the few members who have seen the documents to explain the flaws and misstatements contained within the talking points without disclosing our most closely held intelligence sources and methods."" The FBI and Mr Trump's own Justice Department have objected to the memo's release. An FBI spokesperson released a statement saying ""we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy"". For now, the memo remains a shadow. At some point it may see the light of day, but it seems unlikely that the dispute over its meaning and political potency will be put to rest even then. The investigation into the Trump campaign and Russian election meddling that has resulted in several high-profile indictments and draws closer to the president himself is becoming increasingly mired in a partisan melee. Given the stakes, the heat will only grow more intense in the days ahead.

"This video can not be played Four stories of rough sleeping in England Rough sleeping in England has increased for the seventh year in a row, new official figures reveal. There were 4,751 people counted or estimated to be bedding down outside in autumn 2017, a 15% rise on the year before and more than double the figure recorded five years ago. The figures provide a snapshot of rough sleeping on a typical night and showed about a quarter were in London. The government said it was investing Â£1bn to tackle rough sleeping. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto. Can't see the map?Click here,external. Of the people counted in theMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) figures,external, 653 were women, 760 were EU nationals from outside the UK and 193 were from outside the EU. Most councils provide an estimate based on intelligence from local services but some conduct a count of the number of people seen sleeping rough on a single night. They do not include people who are in hostels, shelters or sofa surfers. Rough sleeping increased in London by 18% in a year and by 14% across the rest of England. The north west recorded an increase of 39%. Housing charity Shelter said the figures may be an underestimate because many people ""hide and remain out of sight"", meaning that counts often miss those who bed down for the night in derelict buildings. Chief executive Polly Neate, said: ""These figures expose the worst pain inflicted by our housing crisis. ""We have failed as a society when so many people are forced to sleep rough. But they are not alone, the scourge of homelessness extends far beyond our streets. ""Hidden away in emergency B&Bs, temporary bedsits and on friends' sofas are hundreds of thousands of other homeless people, including families with children."" Violence and loneliness New homelessness law: What impact will it have? How we ended up sleeping rough by the coast Reality Check: How do we count how many people are homeless? Homelessness charities said the figures showed the need for ""urgent"" action. Howard Sinclair, chief executive of St Mungo's, said: ""Another huge rise in the number of men and women sleeping rough in England, for seven years in a row and 169% since 2010, is shocking and a scandal."" Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said: ""It is truly a catastrophe that in a country as prosperous as this, more and more people are finding themselves forced to sleep in dangerous and freezing conditions."" From April councils will be legally obliged to provide services to anyone at risk of becoming homeless, not just those with a priority need such as vulnerable people or families with children. This video can not be played Hugo Sugg: 'I've been homeless more than once' The National Audit Officesaid homelessness of all kinds had increased""significantly"" over six years. Although London accounted for almost a quarter of all rough sleepers, figures for individual authorities showed areas such as Brighton and Hove, Bedford, Luton, Oxford, Southend-on-Sea, Eastbourne and Thanet all recorded high rates. The 217 rough sleepers counted in Westminster was equivalent to about 18 for every 10,000 households. In Brighton and Hove there were 178 rough sleepers, equivalent to about 14 for every 10,000 households. The biggest rise in rough sleepers recorded by an individual council was the London borough of Camden, which saw its number jump to more than seven times the figure for the previous year, up from 17 to 127. The north west of England recorded the biggest proportional rise in the number of rough sleepers. The jump from 313 to 434 between autumn 2016 and autumn 2017 was a 39% rise. Cheshire East saw rough sleeping increase from four cases to 21. However, the earlier figure was based on a count of rough sleepers and the latest is an estimate. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the government needed to allow authorities to borrow more to invest in new homes. Housing spokesman Councillor Martin Tett said: ""If we want to end homelessness then councils need to be given the powers and funding to adapt welfare reforms and begin building affordable homes again."" A spokesman for the MHCLG: ""No one should ever have to sleep rough. That's why this Government is committed to halving rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminating it altogether by 2027. ""To break the homelessness cycle once and for all, we are providing over Â£1 billion of funding, supporting rough sleepers with the most complex needs through a new Housing First approach and bringing in the most ambitious legislation in decades that will mean people get the support they need earlier. ""In addition a new cross-Government taskforce supported by a panel of experts will drive forward a new strategy that will make life on the streets a thing of the past.""

"This video can not be played President Trump said he welcomed being quizzed by Mr Mueller President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to be questioned under oath as part of an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. He said he was ""looking forward"" to it, subject to the advice of his lawyers. Investigators are assessing if the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election in his favour - a claim denied by Mr Trump and Russia. Investigators will also determine if Mr Trump obstructed the inquiry. The US intelligence community has already concluded that Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. The president had previously said he thought an interview was ""unlikely""because there had been no collusion. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words The 'secret memo' intriguing Washington He has called the Russia investigation a ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax"". Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, Mr Trump maintained he was ""absolutely"" prepared to be questioned under oath by the top investigator. ""There's been no collusion whatsoever, there's no obstruction whatsoever,"" he said. On Thursday morning Mr Trump landed in Zurich, on his way to the World Economic Forum in Davos. He is the first sitting US president to do so since Bill Clinton 18 years ago. The president's lawyers have been talking to the investigation team led by justice department special counsel Robert Mueller about an interview, and the form it might take. The questioning could happen face-to-face, in writing, or it could be a combination of both. Special council Robert Mueller is a former FBI director As to when it might happen, Mr Trump said: ""Yesterday they were talking about two to three weeks."" Asked if he thought Mr Mueller would be fair, the president replied: ""We are going to find out... I hope so."" ALawyer's Worst Nightmare Analysis:Anthony Zurcher- BBCWashington A lawyer's worst nightmare is a client who won't stop talking. And when the client is the president, whose every public utterance is carefully inspected, the headaches are compounded. Such is the fate of Ty Cobb, Donald Trump's personal lawyer. At the moment, his legal team is in delicate negotiations with Robert Mueller about how - or whether - the president might answer questions the special counsel has relevant to his investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Could the interview be conducted in person or via written answers? Will it be open-ended or will the boundaries of any discussion be delineated? This is all reportedly on the table. Then, on Wednesday night, Mr Trump not only said he's eager to talk directly with Mr Mueller, but that he's willing to do so ""under oath"". The president also appears to have outlined a defence against allegations that he may have illegally interfered with the Russia investigation, saying his efforts to ""fight back"" against a partisan witch hunt were being unfairly characterised as obstruction. That kind of strategy is better suited for a war for public opinion than a legal fight. Mr Trump, however, may end up with both.

"Shops, cafes and businesses will offer free water refill points in every major city and town in England by 2021. Industry body Water UK says its scheme could cut disposable plastic bottle use by tens of millions a year. The move comes amid growing concern about the effect of plastic waste on the environment. Whitbread, which owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, is the first to sign up to the initiative and will provide water in all of its branches from March 2018. Refill stations and public fountains will be able to be found via an app or window signs pointing people in the direction of the nearest one. What are your free drinking water rights? Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Sea plastic to be recycled into kayaks This video can not be played A giant build-up of plastic was captured by underwater photographer Caroline Power The new scheme has been set up on the back of a previous initiative, the Refill campaign, which currently has more than 1,600 refill stations across the UK and operates in 13 towns and cities in England. Water companies already taking part in local schemes under Refill include Anglian Water in Norwich, Northumbrian Water in Durham, South West Water in Cornwall and Bristol Water in Bristol. In 2015, Bristol adopted the campaign and the city now has more than 200 points. It is estimated that if every city resident in Bristol refilled one bottle once a week, the city could cut the use of disposable bottles by 22.3 million a year. In December, London mayor Sadiq Khan pledged to create 20 new fountains and other bottle-refill points in the city. Water UK's chief executive, Michael Roberts, said the industry wants to tackle the problems caused by plastic bottle and ""help turn this harmful tide of plastic waste"". ""This country has some of the best drinking water in the world and we want everyone to benefit from it. ""This scheme will do that by making it easier for people to refill their bottles wherever they work, rest, shop or play."" The issue of plastic waste has also been highlighted by theBBC's Blue Planet II. Analysis by BBC Reality Check Making it easier for people to refill water bottles instead of buying single-use ones is squarely on the agenda, with support from Environment Secretary Michael Gove and the Mayor of London. But there are no figures to show how many working drinking fountains there are across the UK. Installing them is a local responsibility. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, says it doesn't hold data on the number of drinking fountains. Water UK, which will run the free water refill scheme, also could not provide figures. The Drinking Fountain Association, founded as the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association in 1959, owns 2,406 fountains in England, but the vast majority of these aren't working fountains - they are historic monuments. Hundreds of drinking fountains were installed in the Victorian times to promote public health - and as part of the temperance movement, with many being stationed outside pubs. The advent of bottled water in the 1980s among other things pushed the need for drinking fountains down council priority lists.

"This video can not be played Theresa May said more work needed to be done for women ""to be accepted and respected as equals"". A government minister has been reprimanded by No 10 for attending a men-only gala that led to allegations of sexual harassment and groping. Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said he attended The Presidents Club fundraiser but left early. The BBC understands Mr Zahawi was called to Downing Street on Wednesday to meet chief whip Julian Smith. Prime Minister Theresa May said she accepted Mr Zahawi's explanation, but was ""appalled"" at reports of the event. The Presidents Club said it was closing and would no longer hold eventsafter an undercover reporter for the Financial Times,externalrevealed hostesses were subject to groping and lewd comments. Mrs May, who is in Davos, said she understood that Mr Zahawi had left early from the event, but that such dinners should not take place. ""Frankly I was appalled,"" she said. ""I thought that sort of approach to women, that objectification of women, was something that we had left behind."" The Metropolitan Police said it had not received any complaints about the Presidents Club dinner last Thursday. Time up on men-only networking events? Scandal-hit club shuts amid groping claims 'Flirtatious and handsy': More women speak out The dinner and auction - which has taken place annually for over 30 years and raised Â£20m for children's charities - was held at the Dorchester Hotel in central London and attended by senior figures in business and finance. This video can not be played How The Presidents Club scandal unfolded The FT revealed the 130 hostesses were told to wear skimpy black outfits with matching underwear and high heels, and made to sign a non-disclosure agreement before starting work. Auction prizes included lunch with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a trip to a London strip club and plastic surgery ""to spice up your wife"". It is understood that Mr Johnson did not agree to support the event and will not take part in the lunch. Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said he had attended the scandal-hit event but left early Culture Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was appalled and it was a ""good thing"" that The Presidents club had shut down. He told the BBC Breakfast programme that he understood his colleague, Mr Zahawi, had been invited because it was a charity fundraiser. Asked if Mr Zahawi should stay in his role, Mr Hancock said it was a ""matter for the whips and the prime minister, rather than for me"". The organisation said it would distribute its remaining funds to children's charities, although some - including Great Ormond Street children's hospital - have said they will return any donations they have already received. The Charity Commission also said it was investigating the claims ""as a matter of urgency"". On Wednesday, Mr Zahawi, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, tweeted that he arrived at the event at 20:00 GMT and left at 21:35 GMT as he ""felt uncomfortable"", but said he did not see any of the ""horrific"" events reported. He also tweeted that he would never attend a men-only function again. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The minister for digital and the creative industries, Margot James, told Newsnight that the event represented ""the very worst form of sexism with a smile on its face"". But she stood by Mr Zahawi and his claim of an early exit. ""That indicates to me that he was shocked by the events, didn't like the culture, the atmosphere, and left,"" she said. This video can not be played Labour MP Jess Philips: 'Lads' culture has no place in country' But Labour's Sarah Jones said Mr Zahawi should resign if he did not report his concerns and had attended on previous occasions. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner also called for an investigation into his attendance. Earlier on Wednesday, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had confidence in Mr Zahawi and he was not being referred for investigation. One of the organisers, David Meller, quit his non-executive role on the Department for Education board following the reports. This video can not be played Financial Times journalist Madison Marriage: âI was groped several timesâ Madison Marriage, the reporter who worked at the event, said she and ""numerous other hostesses"" were groped at the dinner. Shetold BBC Newsnight: ""It's a hands up skirts, hands on bums but also hands on hips, hands on stomachs, arms going round your waist unexpectedly. ""This isn't, I suppose, a high-level groping, but one of the strangest things was you could be talking to a man and he'd suddenly start holding your hand."" She said there were other women there ""who had absolutely no idea that was the kind of event it would be"". Before the fundraiser announced it was closing, a number of businesses said they would cut ties with the event - including WPP, the world's biggest advertising agency, and real estate investment business Frogmore. British-Asian businessman, Rami Ranger, told the BBC Asian Network that men were warned not to ""misbehave"" prior to the dinner, which he was invited to by a friend and did not pay for. Mr Ranger said he was ""horrified"" by the revelations and would never attend a men-only event again. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, said: ""If even half of what's been written about this event is true, it is deplorable and confirms how far we have still to go to stamp out sexual harassment."" Ann Francke, CMI chief executive, told the BBC: ""If you're a captain of industry in 2018, do you really want your shareholders, your customers, your employees to see you associated with things like this? ""And all of the people who attended should have thought about that before they walked through that door."" Comedian and children's author David Walliams, who is not the subject of any allegations, was the compere for the evening. He said he ""did not witness any of the kind of behaviour that allegedly occurred"", but added that he was ""absolutely appalled"" by the reports and he would be donating his fee to the Children's Trust. TV presenter Jonny Gould, who was the auctioneer at the dinner, said he had ""never witnessed any of the alleged behaviour of guests at this event nor in previous years"". He added: ""If I had, I would not have continued to work at the event."" The Dorchester said it was ""deeply concerned"" and was looking into the claims. A spokesman for the Artista agency, which recruited the hostesses, said: ""I was not aware of any claims of sexual harassment but the kind of behaviour alleged is completely unacceptable. ""I am checking with the staff and any complaints will be dealt with promptly and fairly."" Have you ever worked as a hostess at an event like this?

"It was more gripping than any box set we could get our hands on. Over two years, the investigations into Russian interference in the US election, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, delivered daily developments and drama worthy of anything seen in House of Cards. In the end, 35 people and three companies were charged by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Here's our guide to the main characters in the four seasons of the only political drama that mattered. This was the season in which Donald Trump, the reality TV star, took centre stage in his own political drama by launching a presidential campaign. He was supported by his family and got the attention of the Russians. The season ended with a cliffhanger - could Trump the outsider actually win?! It's been a while since all of this happened, so let's remind you of the key players in this season. Who was he?Donald Trump, the billionaire candidate (who by Season Three is the 45th president of the United States). If you really need a refresher,here's his life story. Key plot lineAs Donald Trump was busy traversing the country canvassing for votes in Season One, Russia hacked into the emails of his Democratic rivals, investigators later said. The question is why? Was the Kremlin trying to alter the outcome of the election, and what did Trump and his campaign know? Skip forward to the end of Season Four and Mr Trump stood triumphant before reporters in a Florida airport, celebrating what he called ""a complete and total exoneration"". But in between, there was no shortage of drama or tension. Who was he?He was Trump's campaign chairman before being forced to quit over his ties to Russian oligarchs and Ukraine. Key plot lineHe was one of the biggest dominoes to fall. When he ended up being arrested, it was a big season-ending shocker. Manafort hung around a bit in Season One, but then disappeared from view for a while. He quit the campaign after being accused of having links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine. He also sat in on a crucial meeting with a Russian lawyer who may have been trying to feed the Trump team classified information (more on that later). After an FBI raid on his home in Season Three, Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts and is sentenced to 47 months in prison. In Season Four, he agreed to co-operate with a special counsel inquiry in exchange for a reduced prison term. But then, in a twist - prosecutors claimed he breached his plea bargain by repeatedly lying to the FBI. Read more:The man who helped Trump win Who was he?The president's eldest child, who it emerged met some questionable Russians. Key plot lineDonald Trump Jr's role in this unfolding saga all came down to a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer, which was set up by a music publicist (the full details of which come out in Season Three). If it sounds random, then in many ways it is. The publicist, Rob Goldstone, offered Trump Jr a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, promising him dirt on Hillary Clinton. This meeting was the key to much of our plot line because it raised several key questions. Did this amount to the campaign colluding with a foreign government? Why did he agree to the meeting? What happened at the meeting was the scene investigators played over and over again as they tried to work out if there was any impropriety. In the end, no collusion charges were brought. Read more:Trump Jr's habit for making headlines DonaldTrumpconfounded his critics by winningthe presidency.But the transition was as gripping as the season before it as Trump picked his cabinet, introducing key characters to the mix. The season ended with Trump taking the oath of office on a cold January morning - but there were more twists to come. Who was he?The granite-faced former general who later became the shortest-serving member of Donald Trump's cabinet. He resigned after not being honest about his contact with a Russian official - and was later charged with making false statements to the FBI. Key plot lineFlynn was appointed national security adviser just days after the election, against the advice of then-President Obama, who warned Trump not to hire him. Flynn's starring role came in December 2016, just before Trump was sworn in, when he spoke to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. The Washington Post and New York Times said the men discussed Russian sanctions, and that Flynn later lied to the Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation (Mr Kislyak says the men discussed only ""simple things""). The substance of those talks eventually led to Flynn being prosecuted as part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. At the end of Season Three, in December 2017,Flynn pleaded guiltyto making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" to the FBI about what he and Kislyak discussed. With that, the investigation reached Trump's inner circle. Read more:Out after 23 days - who is Michael Flynn? Who was he?Many roads in this drama led back to Sergei Kislyak, the jolly and charismatic figure, who up until July 2017 wasthe Russian ambassador to Washington. Key plot lineKislyak's role in this drama remained unclear up to the end - but many of the players in this drama had meetings with him, and that put them in awkward spots. The key questions for investigators were: why were they drawn to him, and what was said? The Russian ambassador spoke to both Flynn and Attorney-General Jeff Sessions - meetings which both Trump officials didn't initially acknowledge took place. Anything else we should know? Well, Russia fiercely fought back against claims on CNN that Kislyak was a ""top spy and recruiter of spies"". Who was he?Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III hovered in the background during Season One, when he was an Alabama senator and a trusted Trump adviser, but we really got to know him during Season Two, when he became Trump's nominee for attorney general, a job he kept for almost two years. Key plot lineSessions was one of several Trump aides to meet Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and question marks emerged over the nature of those meetings. When the FBI investigation focused on the Trump campaign, Sessions stood down from the inquiry, much to Trump's irritation. That decision to step down dogged him to the end, and he was written out of the series close to the end of Season Four, when Trump forced him to resign. That move put control of the Mueller investigation into the hands of a Trump loyalist. Read more:An attorney general dogged by scandal This was where the drama really picked up and all the plot lines came together. A lot of the background characters we saw in Season One came back with a vengeance and the infighting got nasty - and this is when the police started circling. Who was she?A Russian lawyer with a fearsome reputation who fought against US restrictions on Russia. But was she a Kremlin stooge? Despite earlier denials, she admitted in April 2018 to being an ""informant"" for Russia's prosecutor general. Key plot lineHers was a small but crucial role - she's the one who Manafort, Trump Jr and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met in June 2016, the details of which begin trickling out a year later in a flashback sequence. She said the meeting was to discuss adoptions - but those who helped set it up said she was offering dirt on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign. While the meeting became a central plot point, whatever happened inside never actually led to any charges. That meeting would never have happened without... Who were they?Emin Agalarov is Azerbaijan's biggest pop star, of course. Have you not heard Love is a Deadly Game? Emin helped bring Donald Trump's Miss Universe competition to Russia and the two are close enough tosend each other birthday messages,external. His dad, Aras, is a billionaire who mixes in the highest circles of influence in Moscow. Key plot lineAgain in a flashback scene, we met Emin as he set the wheels in motion on that Trump Jr meeting. An email sent to Trump Jr suggested Emin was offering information on the Democrats (Emin said he wasn't). The email also said Aras Agalarov had apparently met the ""crown prosecutor"" of Russia - a role that weirdly didn't exist - and got information on Hillary Clinton. Are you keeping up? Read more:The tough-talking networker Who was he?He became deputy attorney general under Jeff Sessions. In the TV drama of the Russia scandal, this is the sort of role that would go to a solid Broadway actor you recognise but can't put a name to. Key plot lineWhen Sessions stood down from leading the main investigation into the Trump-Russia ties, it fell to Rosenstein to do that job. In a major plot development, he appointed a special investigator - not a popular move with the White House. Read more:Who is Rod Rosenstein? Who was he?Married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, Kushner was the character who was seen but very rarely heard. Key plot lineAmid cries of nepotism, he was given a plum White House job as senior adviser to the president with a wide-ranging portfolio. It was his contacts with the Russians during the election campaign and beyond that led investigators to circle him. In June 2016, Kushner attended THAT meeting with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer. He said he was so bored he messaged his assistant to call him so he could leave. Kushner was also another character who had repeated contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak - contact that he initially failed to disclose. Read more:The son-in-law with Trump's ear Who was he?A British former tabloid journalist, with a penchant for selfies in silly hats, was perhaps an unlikely addition to the cast, but in most good dramas there's always room for the slightly out-of-place eccentric. Key plot lineRob Goldstone found his way into Donald Trump's circle of trust thanks to his connections with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov. Goldstone managed the pop star, and it was he who contacted Donald Trump Jr on behalf of his client to set up that now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. Goldstone sent an email to Trump Jr promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Read more:The Music Man with a love for hats Who was he?At 6ft 8in, James Comey was a towering figure, the character who gave little away about himself personally but had a huge role in this story. Key plot lineHe first entered this drama in Season One, when as head of the FBI he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails - just weeks before the election. Democrats blamed him for her loss, Republicans hailed him a hero. That, we thought, was the last we'd seen of him. Jump ahead to Season Three, when months into the Trump presidency, Comey was fired by the new president. In true television drama style, he learned of his sacking as he was watching TV news during a trip to LA. Up to then, Comey was heading up an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Even by the end of the series, whether this amounted to obstruction of justice by the president remained an unresolved plot point. Comey's testimony to the Senate was one of the most set-pieces in the series up to this point, as  - under oath - he told politicians he was asked to pledge loyalty to the president, but refused. Read more:The FBI director who took centre stage Who was he?A former election adviser to Trump, although you'd be forgiven if you didn't remember the face. He was in only a few scenes in Season Two, but he had a massive role to play in Season Three, becoming the first person to plead guilty as part of the investigation. Key plot lineIn late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. His guilty plea and co-operation with the investigation had the potential to damage the US leader because it related directly to his campaign - but in the end, it didn't do so. Read more:Why Papadopoulos case matters Who was he?The man who held the fate of the Trump presidency in his hands. Key plot lineSome characters wielded a lot of power, but didn't have a starring role, such as Robert Mueller, the tall chiselled figure who was appointed as ""special counsel"" to take over the Russia investigation after the dismissal of James Comey. Mueller came from the same stock as Comey - both were former heads of the FBI. There were no showboating scenes and powerhouses speeches from Mueller in this series - we only ever saw him studiously working in his office. There were reports that the president considered firing Mueller at one point - but Mueller stayed in the background doing his job until the very end of the series. After Season Three ended with the first charges being laid down by Robert Mueller, things really sped up in Season Four.The president's fury with the special counsel investigation increased and he fired his Attorney-General. But the series ended with no charges laid against the president and a sense of victory in the White House. Might we see a spin-off series...? Who was he?OK, he wasn't Putin's chef by this point, but he once was. In Season Four, he was the man accused of spearheading Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election. Key plot lineA little out of the blue, Mueller announced charges against Prigozhin and 12 other Russians, accusing them of tampering with the US election by (among other things) organising and promoting political rallies in the US. In one surreal flashback sequence, we even see the Russians trying to buy a cage large enough to hold an actress dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison costume. Read more:Seven key takeaways from indictment Who was he?The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump - but who instead turned against him. Key plot lineCohen, as Trump's long-time personal lawyer, lingered around the edges of the plot for the first three seasons, but became the big player of the fourth. When Mueller's team began looking into Cohen's finances, they passed on their concerns to investigators in New York. Then the plot took an unexpected new turn: Cohen, a long-time Trump loyalist, flipped and began co-operating with investigators. Not only that, but he ended up giving them a lot of help in exchange for a lighter sentence. Cohen ended up admitting violating campaign finance laws, committing tax evasion and lying to Congress. The last shot of the entire series was a mournful Cohen being locked into his jail cell. Who was he?A long-time Washington political operative who acted as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign. He called himself an agent provocateur, and once defended his actions by saying: ""One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action."" Key plot lineStone was one of those memorable bit-part characters in Seasons One and Two - a colourful character known for his fiery tongue, sharp suits and the Richard Nixon tattoo spread across his back. Towards the end of Season One, he appeared to let the cat out of the bag, hinting on Twitter that there was damaging information coming out on Hillary Clinton. Soon after, that information (that we later learned was found by Russia) was made public. After a bit of a lull in the middle of Season Four, investigators indicted Stone on seven counts of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements, although he wasn't charged with co-ordinating with Russia. All the way through, he denied any wrongdoing. He, like the president, called the investigation a ""witch-hunt"" and once said the accusations of collusion with Russia were ""a steaming plate of bull"".

"This video can not be played Jamie Dimon says 4,000 UK jobs could go The chief executive of JP Morgan has told the BBC it could cut its 16,000 UK workforce by more than a quarter if financial rules diverge after Brexit. Jamie Dimon said the US bank had not needed to make drastic cuts on day one after the EU referendum. But he revised his long-term estimate of job losses upwards if Brexit talks failed to produce an outcome close to the current arrangements. Mr Dimon added that such a scenario would harm London as a financial hub. The boss of the US's most valuable bank had warned in the run-up to the referendum that 4,000 jobs could go if the UK voted to leave the EU. Since then, JP Morgan has revised that estimate down to between 500 and 1,000 jobs, leading many to dismiss his warnings as part of ""Project Fear"". In an interview with the BBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Dimon acknowledged that on closer analysis, it turned out the bank did not need to make such drastic moves on day one of Brexit. More from Davos on the BBC Cameron: Brexit not as bad as we thought Polish PM: UK must pay for EU access But he added that could go up again. ""If we can't find reciprocal recognition of rules - and there are a lot of people who are mad with the Brits for leaving and want their pound of flesh - then it could be bad. It could be more than 4000,"" he said. When asked if that outcome would represent a real threat to the future success of London as a financial centre, he gave a single word answer: ""Yep."" A government spokesperson said it was determined to maintain London's ""competitiveness now and in the future"". That includes a partnership with the EU ""based on our rules and regulations being the same at the start and on our shared belief in free trade and a commitment to high regulatory standards"". But if Jamie Dimon's warning comes to pass, where would these jobs go? JP Morgan, along with fellow US bank Goldman Sachs, has already indicated that Frankfurt will be the major beneficiary. But in common with many chief executives at the Swiss ski resort, Jamie Dimon is increasingly impressed with the offer from the new darling of Davos, French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron invited Mr Dimon, along with over a hundred international chief executives, to the Palace of Versailles this week and the charm offensive appears to be working. Emmanuel Macron told Davos: France is back According to Mr Dimon, it's not just style but substance. ""Here's a guy who is 39 years old who formed his own party and within a year won a parliamentary majority,"" Mr Dimon said. ""He spoke and answered questions for two hours and was pro-business, pro-capital, pro-reform. ""It's a shocking change from what came before and if Macron had been around before maybe you would have had the British staying in,"" he added. That sounds fanciful to UK ears, but the positive impact the new resident at the Elysee Palace has made on business leaders in Davos is hard to over emphasise. Of course, the main event for many is yet to come - the arrival of Donald Trump who will give the closing address on Friday. Trump is the first sitting US president to attend Davos since Bill Clinton and his appearance is all the more surprising given his previous public scorn for the gathering of the pro-globalisation elite it attracts. His speech has been described as ""kick ass"" by his advisers. Global leaders including Narendra Modi of India and Justin Trudeau of Canada have used their time on the platform to warn against Trump's protectionist America First approach. Donald Trump is set to speak at Davos on Friday In Jamie Dimon, the President has a supporter amidst a fairly hostile crowd. He described Trump's complaints about global trade and the recent imposition of new tariffs on solar panels and washing machines as ""shots across the bows"" signalling legitimate concerns. ""When America talks about free trade, it means reciprocal trade and we don't have that. Foreign companies can buy 100% of US ones but not the other way, tariffs are unequal and I think he's right to raise that."" It's worth remembering that Trump's recent corporation tax cuts from 35% to 21% will create a windfall of $20bn for JP Morgan over the next five years. Dimon has pledged that money will be used in part to increase wages for lower paid workers in the retail part of JP Morgan Chase and to increase lending to lower income borrowers. He told the BBC that the bonus pool for the high rollers at the investment bank would not increase as a result of Trumps tax largesse. That will all be worth monitoring but if correct is the kind of ""trickle down"" that will get two thumbs up from the White House. Jamie Dimon is not a supporter of Trump on all trade issues, and would hate to be called a protectionist, but if we are going to get a punch up on Friday with Trump in one corner and the rest of the world in the other - it's clear which corner Jamie Dimon will be in.

Most councils provide an estimate based on intelligence from local services but some conduct a count of the number of people seen sleeping rough on a single night. They do not include people who are in hostels, shelters or sofa surfers. Rough sleeping increased in London by 18% in a year and by 14% across the rest of England. The north west recorded an increase of 39%. Housing charity Shelter said the figures may be an underestimate because many people ""hide and remain out of sight"", meaning that counts often miss those who bed down for the night in derelict buildings. Chief executive Polly Neate, said: ""These figures expose the worst pain inflicted by our housing crisis. ""We have failed as a society when so many people are forced to sleep rough. But they are not alone, the scourge of homelessness extends far beyond our streets. ""Hidden away in emergency B&Bs, temporary bedsits and on friends' sofas are hundreds of thousands of other homeless people, including families with children."" Violence and loneliness New homelessness law: What impact will it have? How we ended up sleeping rough by the coast Reality Check: How do we count how many people are homeless? Homelessness charities said the figures showed the need for ""urgent"" action. Howard Sinclair, chief executive of St Mungo's, said: ""Another huge rise in the number of men and women sleeping rough in England, for seven years in a row and 169% since 2010, is shocking and a scandal."" Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said: ""It is truly a catastrophe that in a country as prosperous as this, more and more people are finding themselves forced to sleep in dangerous and freezing conditions."" From April councils will be legally obliged to provide services to anyone at risk of becoming homeless, not just those with a priority need such as vulnerable people or families with children. This video can not be played Hugo Sugg: 'I've been homeless more than once' The National Audit Officesaid homelessness of all kinds had increased""significantly"" over six years. Although London accounted for almost a quarter of all rough sleepers, figures for individual authorities showed areas such as Brighton and Hove, Bedford, Luton, Oxford, Southend-on-Sea, Eastbourne and Thanet all recorded high rates. The 217 rough sleepers counted in Westminster was equivalent to about 18 for every 10,000 households. In Brighton and Hove there were 178 rough sleepers, equivalent to about 14 for every 10,000 households. The biggest rise in rough sleepers recorded by an individual council was the London borough of Camden, which saw its number jump to more than seven times the figure for the previous year, up from 17 to 127. The north west of England recorded the biggest proportional rise in the number of rough sleepers. The jump from 313 to 434 between autumn 2016 and autumn 2017 was a 39% rise. Cheshire East saw rough sleeping increase from four cases to 21. However, the earlier figure was based on a count of rough sleepers and the latest is an estimate. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the government needed to allow authorities to borrow more to invest in new homes. Housing spokesman Councillor Martin Tett said: ""If we want to end homelessness then councils need to be given the powers and funding to adapt welfare reforms and begin building affordable homes again."" A spokesman for the MHCLG: ""No one should ever have to sleep rough. That's why this Government is committed to halving rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminating it altogether by 2027. ""To break the homelessness cycle once and for all, we are providing over Â£1 billion of funding, supporting rough sleepers with the most complex needs through a new Housing First approach and bringing in the most ambitious legislation in decades that will mean people get the support they need earlier. ""In addition a new cross-Government taskforce supported by a panel of experts will drive forward a new strategy that will make life on the streets a thing of the past.""

"Paedophile doctor Larry Nassar tried to claim his accusers ""fabricated"" allegations for money and fame The head of Michigan State University (MSU) has resigned, hours after sports doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced for sexually abusing young athletes. Lou Anna Simon had been facing pressure to step down. Nassar worked at MSU between 1997 and 2016. Also a former team doctor for USA Gymnastics, he was sentenced to 40 to 175 years' imprisonment after testimony from almost 160 women. Ms Simon denied reports that MSU knew of the abuse claims but failed to act. She said in a statement: ""To the survivors, I can never say enough that I am so sorry,externalthat a trusted, renowned physician was really such an evil, evil person who inflicted such harm under the guise of medical treatment."" The accounts of Nassar's victims are ""tragic, heartbreaking, and personally gut-wrenching,"" she added. Lou Anna Simon was under intense pressure to stand down On Wednesday Michigan's House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling on Ms Simon to quit. About 140 young women have filed a lawsuit against Nassar, USA Gymnastics and MSU, claiming the two institutions heard the paedophilia allegations against him years ago. The sports body and the school deny there was a cover-up. Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of sexual assault against girls and young women, including Olympians. Before his sentencing on Wednesday, the 54-year-old had already been sentenced to 60 years for possession of child pornography. This video can not be played Larry Nassar speaks as judge says 'I've signed your death warrant' Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told Nassar during the sentencing: ""As much as it was my honour and privilege to hear the sister survivors, it was my honour and privilege to sentence you. ""Because, sir, you do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again."" As the judge finished her sentence, witnesses in the packed courtroom stood and applauded her verdict. The 156 women who confronted a predator The judge who let survivors speak The sentencing follows a week of harrowing testimony from scores of women, including Olympic gold medal gymnasts Aly Raisman and Jordyn Weiber. This video can not be played From the courtroom: Rachael Denhollander's powerful testimony Their teammates, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles, also revealed they had been abused by Nassar. In 2015, USA Gymnastics - the sport's top governing body - quietly cut ties with Nassar over allegations about his professional care. An investigation in 2014 resulted in a three-month suspension from MSU, then his workplace. But he continued to see patients until he was publicly accused of abuse in a 2016 report by the Indianapolis Star newspaper. This video can not be played Sister survivors condemn master manipulator Later that year, he was arrested and charged by Michigan officials with sexual contact with a child. A year later, he was sentenced for child abuse images found on his computer. Rachael Denhollander, who was one of the first women to publicly accuse Nassar, pointed the finger at MSU in court on Wednesday. ""How much is a little girl worth? How much is a young woman worth?"" Ms Denhollander, now a lawyer, asked as she described the abuse that occurred when she was 15 years old. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""No-one believed because they did not listen,"" she said, recounting the several times victims told MSU of their allegations. ""Victims were silenced, intimidated, told they were receiving medical treatment, and at times sent back to be further abused. ""This is what it looks like when institutions create a culture when a predator can behave unabated."" Ms Denhollander said trauma she suffered had ""cast a horrific shadow"" over her medical care when she gave birth to three children, including two daughters. As the court adjourned on Wednesday, the US Olympic Committee announced it would hold an independent investigation ""to examine how an abuse of this proportion could have gone undetected for so long"". The committee's chief executive Scott Blackmun has called on ""all current USA Gymnastics directors"" to resign. On Tuesday, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) said it would investigate MSU's original handling of the gymnasts' abuse claims. Over 130 women are suing Nassar, according to the Associated Press. He is due to appear in court again on 31 January for another sentencing involving three more cases of sexual assault.

"This video can not be played What has Aung San Suu Kyi said about Rohingya Muslims? Veteran US diplomat Bill Richardson has resigned from an international panel set up by Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to advise on the Rohingya crisis. He claimed the panel was a ""whitewash"" and accused Ms Suu Kyi, his long-time friend, of lacking ""moral leadership"". Myanmar accused him of pursuing ""his own agenda"". More than 650,000 Rohingya people, from a mostly-Muslim minority in Buddhist Myanmar, fled to Bangladesh last year in the face of a military crackdown. Many are now living in refugee camps in the neighbouring country.Bangladesh has said they will all be returned to Myanmarwithin two years. Mr Richardson added that Ms Suu Kyi had been ""furious"" when he raised the case of two Reuters reporters on trial in Myanmar. Thejournalists have been charged with breaching the Official Secrets Actwhile working on coverage of the Rohingya crisis. Ms Suu Kyi ""exploded"" at Mr Richardson when he mentioned the journalists,external, he told the New York Times. ""Her face was quivering, and if she had been a little closer to me, she might have hit me, she was so furious,"" Mr Richardson said. How Suu Kyi sees the Rohingya crisis Bill Richardson, a former governor of New Mexico, has sharply criticised Aung San Suu Kyi Mr Richardson, a former adviser to the Clinton administration, has known Ms Suu Kyi for decades and visited the Nobel laureate while she was under house arrest in the 1990s. He told Reuters he was resigning from the advisory board because it was a ""whitewash"" and he did not want to be part of a ""cheerleading squad for the government"". He was ""alarmed by the lack of sincerity with which the critical issue of citizenship was discussed,"" he wrote in a statement. This video can not be played Watch: Who are the Rohingya? There were around one million Rohingya people in Myanmar at the start of 2017, where they have their own language and culture. But the government sees them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and denies them citizenship. In August last year, after Rohingya militants in Rakhine state attacked police posts, people started to flee across the border. Arriving in Bangladesh, they told repeated stories of troops, backed by local Buddhist mobs, burning villages and attacking and killing civilians. The military offensive has been described by the United Nations as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" - something Myanmar denies. What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis Could Aung San Suu Kyi face genocide charges? Seeing through the official story in Myanmar Mr Richardson went on to say he had been ""taken aback by the vigour"" with which Ms Suu Kyi had ""disparaged"" the media, the UN, human rights groups and the international community during three days of meetings. ""She's not getting good advice from her team,"" he said. ""I like her enormously and respect her. But she has not shown moral leadership on the Rakhine issue and the allegations made, and I regret that."" Myanmar's government said Mr Richardson was pursuing ""his own agenda"" and the government had decided his continued participation on the board was ""not in the best interest of all concerned"". The Advisory Board for the Committee for Implementation of the Recommendations on Rakhine State was set up by Ms Suu Kyi's government last year. BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head Rarely can such blistering criticism have come from a seasoned diplomat of a woman whose cause he once championed, and whom he considered a friend. Ms Suu Kyi's government has denied allegations of horrific human rights abuses and stubbornly resisted pressure to allow international organisations access to Rakhine state. Bill Richardson's fear that the board could be just a cheerleader for the government may be quietly shared by other members and his reservations will have surprised few. But strong and personal reproaches of Ms Suu Kyi's attitude may destroy a personal relationship going back more than two decades. She is known to be intolerant of such slights and strong-willed to the point of stubbornness. There is little likelihood that she will change her views because of his comments. More likely they will compound a sense, shared by her millions of supporters, that western governments and political leaders are treating her unfairly, and that she should look elsewhere for sympathy. Until Mr Richardson resigned, the board had 10 members, five of whom are from overseas. One of those, former South African Defence Minister Roelof Meyer, travelled with the board's remaining members to Rakhine state on Wednesday. He told Reuters the visit had been ""very constructive"", and said any suggestion the board was ""just a rubber stamp or a voice on behalf of the government... would be completely untrue, unfair. We haven't done any recommendations so far."" Another member of the board, Khin Nyo, told the BBC that Mr Richardson was asked not to urge for the release of the Reuters journalists in the meeting as it did not concern the board. ""The advisory board is independent and [the government] don't restrict anything on us,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Mummy is distant ancestor Scientists in the Swiss city of Basel have solved a decades-old mystery over the identity of a mummified woman. Their research revealed a surprise: the woman is the great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother of UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. The body was uncovered in 1975 while renovations were being done on Basel's BarfÃ¼sser Church. She was buried right in front of the altar, clearly well fed, and wearing good quality clothes. This was obviously the body of a wealthy lady of Basel. But who was she exactly, and when did she die? There was no gravestone to indicate her identity, but initial testing of her wooden coffin suggested it dated from the 16th Century. Another clue: her body was riddled with mercury - a standard treatment for syphilis from the late 15th to the 19th Century. Highly toxic mercury treatment was more often a kill than a cure and it was this that preserved her body. But that still left open the question of who she was. Boris Johnson: A history of undiplomacy Johnson under pressure over jailed mum case Boris Johnson's dad in I'm A Celebrity Basel in the 16th and 17th Centuries was a wealthy trading city; its port on the river Rhine was a key hub for moving goods across Europe, and it remains so today. Local historians knew that members of Basel's wealthy families were buried in and around the BarfÃ¼sser Church. This video can not be played For centuries, BarfÃ¼sser Church held clues to the ancestral history of Boris Johnson's family. Some were clearly named in records, some had clearly marked gravestones. But not the mummy. It only became clear in 2017, in newly discovered archives, that the mummy had been uncovered once before, in 1843. Those records led historians to suspect the mummy was a member of a well-established Basel family, the Bischoffs. Using the most up to date methods, scientists were able to extract DNA material from the mummy's big toe. Scientists have used DNA testing to establish the mummy's identity This was compared, by scientists working independently from one another, with DNA taking from living descendants of the Bischoff family. The results were clear, showing a 99.8% probability that the descendants and the mummy were all from the same maternal line. Now the scientists and the historians were sure: the mummy was none other than Anna Catharina Bischoff. Born in Basel in 1719, she died there in 1787. Once her identity had been established, genealogists were able - with the help of the efficient records of births, marriages, and deaths which tend to be kept by the wealthier classes - to trace more of Anna Catharina's descendants. An artist's impression gives an idea of how researchers think Anna Catharina Bischoff might have looked She had seven children. Only two survived childhood, but one daughter, also Anna, married a certain Christian Hubert Baron Pfeffel von Kriegelstein. Five generations of von Pfeffels later, and we find Marie Luise von Pfeffel marrying one Stanley Fred Williams.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Mummy is distant ancestor Scientists in the Swiss city of Basel have solved a decades-old mystery over the identity of a mummified woman. Their research revealed a surprise: the woman is the great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother of UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. The body was uncovered in 1975 while renovations were being done on Basel's BarfÃ¼sser Church. She was buried right in front of the altar, clearly well fed, and wearing good quality clothes. This was obviously the body of a wealthy lady of Basel. But who was she exactly, and when did she die? There was no gravestone to indicate her identity, but initial testing of her wooden coffin suggested it dated from the 16th Century. Another clue: her body was riddled with mercury - a standard treatment for syphilis from the late 15th to the 19th Century. Highly toxic mercury treatment was more often a kill than a cure and it was this that preserved her body. But that still left open the question of who she was. Boris Johnson: A history of undiplomacy Johnson under pressure over jailed mum case Boris Johnson's dad in I'm A Celebrity Basel in the 16th and 17th Centuries was a wealthy trading city; its port on the river Rhine was a key hub for moving goods across Europe, and it remains so today. Local historians knew that members of Basel's wealthy families were buried in and around the BarfÃ¼sser Church. This video can not be played For centuries, BarfÃ¼sser Church held clues to the ancestral history of Boris Johnson's family. Some were clearly named in records, some had clearly marked gravestones. But not the mummy. It only became clear in 2017, in newly discovered archives, that the mummy had been uncovered once before, in 1843. Those records led historians to suspect the mummy was a member of a well-established Basel family, the Bischoffs. Using the most up to date methods, scientists were able to extract DNA material from the mummy's big toe. Scientists have used DNA testing to establish the mummy's identity This was compared, by scientists working independently from one another, with DNA taking from living descendants of the Bischoff family. The results were clear, showing a 99.8% probability that the descendants and the mummy were all from the same maternal line. Now the scientists and the historians were sure: the mummy was none other than Anna Catharina Bischoff. Born in Basel in 1719, she died there in 1787. Once her identity had been established, genealogists were able - with the help of the efficient records of births, marriages, and deaths which tend to be kept by the wealthier classes - to trace more of Anna Catharina's descendants. An artist's impression gives an idea of how researchers think Anna Catharina Bischoff might have looked She had seven children. Only two survived childhood, but one daughter, also Anna, married a certain Christian Hubert Baron Pfeffel von Kriegelstein. Five generations of von Pfeffels later, and we find Marie Luise von Pfeffel marrying one Stanley Fred Williams. Their daughter Yvonne married Osman Wilfred Johnson Kemalâ¦ and their son, Stanley Johnson, is British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's father.

"Shops, cafes and businesses will offer free water refill points in every major city and town in England by 2021. Industry body Water UK says its scheme could cut disposable plastic bottle use by tens of millions a year. The move comes amid growing concern about the effect of plastic waste on the environment. Whitbread, which owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, is the first to sign up to the initiative and will provide water in all of its branches from March 2018. Refill stations and public fountains will be able to be found via an app or window signs pointing people in the direction of the nearest one. What are your free drinking water rights? Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Sea plastic to be recycled into kayaks This video can not be played A giant build-up of plastic was captured by underwater photographer Caroline Power The new scheme has been set up on the back of a previous initiative, the Refill campaign, which currently has more than 1,600 refill stations across the UK and operates in 13 towns and cities in England. Water companies already taking part in local schemes under Refill include Anglian Water in Norwich, Northumbrian Water in Durham, South West Water in Cornwall and Bristol Water in Bristol. In 2015, Bristol adopted the campaign and the city now has more than 200 points. It is estimated that if every city resident in Bristol refilled one bottle once a week, the city could cut the use of disposable bottles by 22.3 million a year. In December, London mayor Sadiq Khan pledged to create 20 new fountains and other bottle-refill points in the city. Water UK's chief executive, Michael Roberts, said the industry wants to tackle the problems caused by plastic bottle and ""help turn this harmful tide of plastic waste"". ""This country has some of the best drinking water in the world and we want everyone to benefit from it. ""This scheme will do that by making it easier for people to refill their bottles wherever they work, rest, shop or play."" The issue of plastic waste has also been highlighted by theBBC's Blue Planet II. Analysis by BBC Reality Check Making it easier for people to refill water bottles instead of buying single-use ones is squarely on the agenda, with support from Environment Secretary Michael Gove and the Mayor of London. But there are no figures to show how many working drinking fountains there are across the UK. Installing them is a local responsibility. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, says it doesn't hold data on the number of drinking fountains. Water UK, which will run the free water refill scheme, also could not provide figures. The Drinking Fountain Association, founded as the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association in 1959, owns 2,406 fountains in England, but the vast majority of these aren't working fountains - they are historic monuments. Hundreds of drinking fountains were installed in the Victorian times to promote public health - and as part of the temperance movement, with many being stationed outside pubs. The advent of bottled water in the 1980s among other things pushed the need for drinking fountains down council priority lists.

"More than one in eight secondary schools in England is below the standard deemed acceptable by ministers, league table data shows. The secondary school league tables have just been published, featuring the results of the first pupils to sit new, tougher GCSEs in English and maths. Some 365 schools, or 12%, were below the new tougher floor standard. In 2016 it was 282 schools or 9.3%. The tables allow parents and pupils to compare the local schools' results. Schools are judged by two new measures,Progress 8,externalandAttainment 8,external. The data shows how many schools have missed the government's floor standard of -0.5 in Progress 8 in last summer's GCSEs. There are significant regional variations, with London having the lowest proportion of under-performing schools at 6.9% and the North East the highest at 20.9%. The tables use raw GCSE results from last year and a raft of data from the Department for Education to evaluate how well pupils progress in a school. All you need to know about secondary school league tables Both Progress 8 and Attainment 8 focus on the results of a pupil's best eight GCSE results including English and maths. In schools where pupils failed to progress to the expected level (-0.5 or below in Progress 8), they were getting around half a GCSE grade worse than they could have done, based on end of primary school results. In total, 365 schools - with some 47,342 pupils sitting GCSEs last year  - did not make the required progress. Last summer, teenagers sat new, tougher GCSEs in English and maths, which were graded 9 to 1 (9 being the top grade). All other GCSEs are graded under the old-style alphabetical system. Pupils are considered to have passed the new exams if they achieved a grade 4 or above - equivalent to the old C, but schools are judged on a grade 5. This video can not be played BBC numbers man Robert Cuffe: ""The government are trying to measure the schools rather than the kids"" This has led to some confusion and disquiet, with schools and individual pupils effectively being judged by different standards. The DfE said: ""More schools are below the floor in 2017 because the distribution of Progress 8 scores changed. There were more schools that achieved both  very negative and very positive scores in 2017 than 2016."" The schools with the biggest drop in results, once grade 5 was used to measure standards, tend to have much higher proportions of disadvantaged children. In fact the bottom 10% of schools had an average of 38.4% disadvantaged students. Notably, the percentage achieving grade 4 or above in English and maths is stable compared to last year. Schools minister Nick Gibb said teachers and pupils had been responding well to the new more rigorous curriculum introduced by the government. ""Academic standards are rising in our schools thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers. ""Today's results reinforce this success, with teachers and pupils responding well to the new more rigorous curriculum introduced by this government. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the secondary school performance tables could not be compared with previous years because the government had ""once again moved the goalposts"". Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto.If you are unable to see the map on your device,click here,external He added that the mix of grading systems had complicated and changed the way the headline measures are worked out. ""As the DfE itself says in today's statistics, these changes are the main reason why there has been an increase in the number of schools which are deemed to be below the 'floor standard' for Progress 8. ""It is extremely unfair that more schools find themselves in this situation because of complex changes to the way in which this is calculated."" He said it was ""very frustrating"" that the bar for achievement in English and maths has been raised arbitrarily to a grade 5 under the new system - which is higher than the old standard of grade C. ""And it is potentially baffling for parents and employers that schools are now judged on grade 5 - described as a 'strong pass' - while grade 4 is good enough to be deemed a 'standard pass'."" Mr Barton said the tables revealed only a limited amount about the true quality of a school in a system undergoing significant change. The DfE has made clear that there is no automatic consequence to being below the floor or coasting. It said: ""Where a school has fallen below these standards for the first time in 2017, the data will be a starting point for a conversation about school improvement.""

Several people were rescued from the wreckage of the carriages that derailed next to the Pioltello Limito station in the morning rush hour. The cause of the accident is not yet clear but a collapse of the rail track is under investigation. Witnesses said the train trembled for a few minutes before the accident. Firefighters are battling to free passengers from the debris The train derailed at Pioltello Limito station The Trenord train, carrying some 250 people, was heading to Milan's Porta Garibaldi station from Cremona when it derailed at about 07:00 local time (06:00 GMT). The train was travelling at normal speed when the accident happened, a spokesperson for Trenord told Reuters news agency. Services in the area were halted for hours. The identities of the victims have not been confirmed, but Italian media report that they are all women. ""A train can derail for only two reasons; either through a structural collapse of the track or a collapse of the train. This is the first thing that needs to be cleared up,"" said Raffaele Cattaneo, president of the regional council. RFI, which manages the rail network, said there was a rupture in the track but that it was unclear whether this was a cause or a consequence of the accident.

"Paedophile doctor Larry Nassar tried to claim his accusers ""fabricated"" allegations for money and fame The head of Michigan State University (MSU) has resigned, hours after sports doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced for sexually abusing young athletes. Lou Anna Simon had been facing pressure to step down. Nassar worked at MSU between 1997 and 2016. Also a former team doctor for USA Gymnastics, he was sentenced to 40 to 175 years' imprisonment after testimony from almost 160 women. Ms Simon denied reports that MSU knew of the abuse claims but failed to act. She said in a statement: ""To the survivors, I can never say enough that I am so sorry,externalthat a trusted, renowned physician was really such an evil, evil person who inflicted such harm under the guise of medical treatment."" The accounts of Nassar's victims are ""tragic, heartbreaking, and personally gut-wrenching,"" she added. Lou Anna Simon was under intense pressure to stand down On Wednesday Michigan's House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling on Ms Simon to quit. About 140 young women have filed a lawsuit against Nassar, USA Gymnastics and MSU, claiming the two institutions heard the paedophilia allegations against him years ago. The sports body and the school deny there was a cover-up. Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of sexual assault against girls and young women, including Olympians. Before his sentencing on Wednesday, the 54-year-old had already been sentenced to 60 years for possession of child pornography. This video can not be played Larry Nassar speaks as judge says 'I've signed your death warrant' Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told Nassar during the sentencing: ""As much as it was my honour and privilege to hear the sister survivors, it was my honour and privilege to sentence you. ""Because, sir, you do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again."" As the judge finished her sentence, witnesses in the packed courtroom stood and applauded her verdict. The 156 women who confronted a predator The judge who let survivors speak The sentencing follows a week of harrowing testimony from scores of women, including Olympic gold medal gymnasts Aly Raisman and Jordyn Weiber. This video can not be played From the courtroom: Rachael Denhollander's powerful testimony Their teammates, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles, also revealed they had been abused by Nassar. In 2015, USA Gymnastics - the sport's top governing body - quietly cut ties with Nassar over allegations about his professional care. An investigation in 2014 resulted in a three-month suspension from MSU, then his workplace. But he continued to see patients until he was publicly accused of abuse in a 2016 report by the Indianapolis Star newspaper. This video can not be played Sister survivors condemn master manipulator Later that year, he was arrested and charged by Michigan officials with sexual contact with a child. A year later, he was sentenced for child abuse images found on his computer. Rachael Denhollander, who was one of the first women to publicly accuse Nassar, pointed the finger at MSU in court on Wednesday. ""How much is a little girl worth? How much is a young woman worth?"" Ms Denhollander, now a lawyer, asked as she described the abuse that occurred when she was 15 years old. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""No-one believed because they did not listen,"" she said, recounting the several times victims told MSU of their allegations. ""Victims were silenced, intimidated, told they were receiving medical treatment, and at times sent back to be further abused. ""This is what it looks like when institutions create a culture when a predator can behave unabated."" Ms Denhollander said trauma she suffered had ""cast a horrific shadow"" over her medical care when she gave birth to three children, including two daughters. As the court adjourned on Wednesday, the US Olympic Committee announced it would hold an independent investigation ""to examine how an abuse of this proportion could have gone undetected for so long"". The committee's chief executive Scott Blackmun has called on ""all current USA Gymnastics directors"" to resign. On Tuesday, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) said it would investigate MSU's original handling of the gymnasts' abuse claims. Over 130 women are suing Nassar, according to the Associated Press. He is due to appear in court again on 31 January for another sentencing involving three more cases of sexual assault.

"This video can not be played Sara Khan: 'I'm not a Home Office mouthpiece' The head of Theresa May's new anti-extremism commission - set up after the Manchester Arena attack - is facing calls to quit from Muslim groups. Sara Khan, who has campaigned for women's rights in Muslim communities, has been given the task of rooting out extremism in the UK. She has promised ""zero tolerance to those who promote hate"". But her support for the Home Office's Prevent strategy has led to claims she is too close to the government. Downing Street has insisted Ms Khan is ""expertly qualified"" for the new role - but a number of Muslim organisations are understood to be calling for her to be sacked and saying they will not work with her. A petition by anti-Islamophobia campaign MEND, saying her appointment ""will further damage relations between the government and Muslim communities,"" is being circulated, the BBC understands. Lady Warsi, the first Muslim woman to serve as a British cabinet minister, said many British Muslims saw Ms Khan as a ""mouthpiece"" of ministers. The Conservative peer questioned Ms Khan's likely independence as the Commissioner for Countering Extremism in a series of tweets and warned of ""destructive and dangerous games"" being played.

Harun Khan, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: ""The fight against terrorism requires equal partnership between all parties, including Muslim communities. ""This appointment risks sending a clear and alarming message that the government has no intention of doing so."" Ms Khan's work in schools and community groups, through her Inspire charity, was praised by then Home Secretary Theresa May, who joined the Sun newspaper in backing her 2014 Making A Stand campaign, which aimed to stop young people joining the Islamic State group. She describes herself on her website,externalas a ""born human rights activist"", and has campaigned for women's rights within British Muslim communities for over 20 years. Born and raised in Bradford, she worked as a hospital pharmacist and was president of an Islamic youth organisation before launching the Inspire charity in 2008, with the aim of challenging extremism and promoting gender equality. In September 2005, after the London bombings, she sat on the Home Office's Tackling Extremism and Radicalisation Working Group and has also worked with the education department and the Department for International Development. In 2015, she was named in theBBC Woman's Hour Power List. Ms Khan has been a vocal supporter of the government's Prevent strategy, which operates through community groups, local authorities and the police to identify and ""divert"" those deemed to be at risk of radicalisation. But the scheme has proved controversial, with claims it demonises and spies on Muslim communities. A UN Human Rights Council report in 2016 said Prevent was ""inherently flawed."" UN labels Prevent 'inherently flawed' Longer jail terms for web terror viewers Ms Khan hit back at her critics, telling the BBC: ""My work over the last 10 years speaks for itself. ""I don't recognise this idea of being a mouthpiece. ""I want to recognise and empower the victims of extremism. ""This idea that I am a creation of the Home Office is just frankly ridiculous."" She earlier told Sky News: ""The work that I am doing in the commission is not part of Prevent. This is about preventing extremism. Prevent is part of the countering terrorism strategy."" One of her first tasks, she said, would be to carry out ""a comprehensive study of the scale, influence and reach of extremism in this country - because I don't believe we have a clear national or regional picture"". She said she wanted to challenge hate speech by offering an ""alternative narrative, not to drive it underground"" - and she stressed that she would not just be focusing on Islamic extremism. ""Far-right extremism is a virulent strain that is permeating all aspects of our society - the two feed each other, they have a symbiotic relationship with each other... and it's important that I am going to be challenging both."" Plans to set up the commission were announced in the wake of the Manchester bombing last May - one of five terror attacks to hit Britain in 2017 - which took place during the general election campaign. Its remit is also expected to include helping train schools and colleges to spot warning signs and ensuring women's rights are upheld. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Given that it's so hard to come up with a definition of extremism on which everyone is agreed, whoever got this job was going to face criticism. But on top of that, Sara Khan is something of the Marmite candidate: people either love her for the manner in which she has spoken out - or they absolutely loathe her for allegedly ""selling out"" Muslim identity and being prepared to debate with some provocative commentators who have been labelled Islamophobes. So the challenge she faces is twofold: First to come up with a plan to combat extremism - and secondly to get everyone to agree to it. Labour MP Naz Shah, who chairs the British Muslims All Party Parliamentary group, is a longstanding critic of Ms Khan's work and support for Prevent. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What is at question is the independence of the person appointed. ""It's a fantastic appointment for the Home Office because this is somebody who is a creation of the Home Office."" Labour's shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said Ms Khan's appointment was ""very ill-advised"" and would not ""build confidence across our communities"". Lib Dem equalities spokeswoman Baroness Hussein-Ece said Ms Khan ""will need to prove herself as a critical friend to government in order to inspire confidence"". But the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson, tweeted: ""The idea that she is a government stooge is hard to reconcile with her opposition (strongly shared by me) to its ill-advised 2015-16 plans for a counter-extremism bill."" He added: ""Let's hope she and her fellow-commissioners can make something useful of this post, whose intended purpose I have never really understood.""

"The Stage spoke to 1,000 theatre professionals for its research Almost a third of theatre professionals in the UK have been sexually harassed at work, according to a survey. The Stage magazine,externalasked over 1,000 people working in industry for their experiences, with 31% saying they had suffered sexual harassment. Over 40% of respondents said they had been bullied and almost 8% said they had been sexually assaulted at work. Director of the National Theatre Rufus Norris said the ""shaming"" revelations ""must force change"". The study comes after allegations of sexual assault and harassment were made against actor Kevin Spacey. He worked as the artistic director of London's Old Vic theatre between 2004 and 2015. The theatre has now launched a ""guardians programme"" to offer staff someone to talk to about any concerns they have. Kevin Spacey worked as the artistic director of the Old Vic for over 10 years Spacey's spokesperson has previously said the actor is ""taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment"". Professionals interviewed by the magazine included performers, backstage workers, front of house staff and management. Some said that harassment and bullying were ""ingrained into the theatre culture"", with others saying they felt ""systematically disrespected, devalued and belittled"". However, 67% of people who had suffered did not report incidents, and when sexual assault was reported, no action was taken in four out of five cases. Rufus Norris said those in the industry coming forward with their stories were a ""powerful prompt"" to review policy and codes of practice, as well as a moment for ""for each of us to look at our individual behaviour"".

"Theresa May delivers her speech in Davos The prime minister says she wants the UK to lead the world in deciding how artificial intelligence can be deployed in a safe and ethical manner. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Theresa May said a new advisory body,previously announced in the Autumn Budget,external, will co-ordinate efforts with other countries. In addition, she confirmed that the UK would join the Davos forum's own council on artificial intelligence. But others may have stronger claims. Earlier this week, Google picked France as the base for anew research centre dedicated to exploring how AI,externalcan be applied to health and the environment. Facebook also announced it was doubling the size of its existing AI lab in Paris, while software firm SAP committed itself to a 2bn euro ($2.5bn; Â£1.7bn) investment into the country that will include work on machine learning. Meanwhile, a report released last month by the Eurasia Group consultancy suggested that theUS and China are engaged,externalin a ""two-way race for AI dominance"". It predicted Beijing would take the lead thanks to the ""insurmountable"" advantage of offering its companies more flexibility in how they use data about its citizens. Theresa May is expected to meet US President Donald Trump at the Davos event on Thursday. The prime minister based the UK's claim to leadership in part on the health of its start-up economy, quoting a figure that a new AI-related company has been created in the country every week for the last three years. In addition, she said the UK is recognised as first in the world for its preparedness to ""bring artificial intelligence into government"". DeepMind's game-playing AI experiments are among the UK's highest profile success stories However, she recognised that many people have concerns about potential job losses and other impacts of the tech, and declared that AI poses one of the ""greatest tests of leadership for our time"". ""But it is a test that I am confident we can meet,"" she added. ""For right across the long sweep of history from the invention of electricity to advent of factory production, time and again initially disquieting innovations have delivered previously unthinkable advances and we have found the way to make those changes work for all our people,"" Mrs May said. This includes through a new UK advisory body, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation. Academics and tech industry leaders differ in opinion about the risks involved. At one end of the scale, Prof Stephen Hawking haswarned that AI could""spell the end of the human race"", while Tesla's Elon Musk has said that a universal basic income - in which people get paid whether or not they work - has a ""good chance"" of becoming necessary as jobs become increasingly automated. Facebook's AI chief has played down the risk of robots destroying humanity But Facebook's AI chief Yann LeCun has said society will develop the ""checks and balances"" to prevent a Terminator movie-likeapocalypse ever coming to pass,external. And earlier this week,Google's former chief Eric Schmidt,externaltold the BBC he did not believe predictions of mass job losses would occur. ""There will be some jobs eliminated but the vast majority will be augmented,"" he explained. ""You're going to have more doctors not fewer. More lawyers not fewer. More teachers not fewer. ""But they are going to be more efficient."" Eric Schmidt thinks AI will enhance jobs rather than destroy them en masse While many tech industry leaders acknowledge there will be a need for new rules and regulations, they also suggest it may be premature to introduce them in the short term. Microsoft, for example, has launched a book calledThe Future Computed,externalto coincide with the Davos event. Itproposes that it be given time to develop rules,externalto govern its own AI work internally before legislation is passed. Much of the AI research involved in developing Amazon's Alexa voice assistant was done in the UK Is the UK really on track to lead the world in Artificial Intelligence? Well the United States and China might have a thing or two to say about that. Both are engaged in an AI arms race and are investing the kind of sums that would make Chancellor Philip Hammond's - or even Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's - eyes water. Still, it is true that in London and Cambridge some of the world's leading AI scientists are at work. It was here that the Alexa digital voice assistant was developed and where a computer was trained to defeat champion players of the Chinese game of Go. The trouble is that those scientists were employed by Amazon and by Google, which brought up the DeepMind AI business when it was still in its infancy. That's a pattern frequently repeated in the UK technology sector. A Chinese AI investor on a trip to the UK this week expressed surprise that the government had not done more to protect these AI assets. Now there is to be another AI body, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, joining in a global conversation about the moral challenges posed by AI. We already have the Alan Turing Institute which has a similar mission. The concern is that while the UK agonises over the implications of this technology, the Chinese will just be getting on with it. Theresa May also addressed the need for tech firms to tackle terrorism and extremist content during her speech. Telegram is a privacy-focused chat app She said Telegram - a privacy-focused chat app - became popular with criminals and terrorists over a short period of time. ""We need to see more co-operation from smaller platforms like this,"" she added. Telegram has previouslysaid it is ""no friend of terrorists"",externaland blocked channels used by extremists. In addition, the prime minister called on tech company investors to play their part by demanding that trust and safety issues be considered.

"Insurers have said they will pay more than Â£30m to businesses owed money by collapsed construction giant Carillion. Sums ranging from Â£5,000 to several million pounds are being paid to firms which had insurance policies against bad debts. However, most of Carillion's suppliers risk getting little or nothing back, as only a minority of firms had the cover. Carillion went under last week with Â£1.5bn debt, leaving its 30,000 suppliers facing an uncertain future. Mark Shepherd at the Association of British Insurers said: ""One insolvency can risk a domino effect to hundreds of firms in the supply chain."" The association said that about Â£31m will be paid out for trade credit insurance, which covers firms against the risk of not being paid if a company that it does business with collapses. Carillion, which was the UK's second biggest construction firm and a major service provider for the government, went into liquidation with a Â£900m debt pile and Â£600m pension deficit. Small businesses are owed Â£141,000 on average by Carillion, according to a survey of building, engineering and electrical firms by industry bodies. Medium sized ones with 50 to 250 employees are owed typically Â£236,000, while larger firms face an average shortfall of over Â£15m. The firm's cleaning, catering and other public service work has been kept going and much of its private sector work is being revived, but most of its outstanding debts remain, according to BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz. It comes as Labour put further pressure on the government on Wednesday to publish the risk assessments it did into Carillion before its collapse. The signals that the company was going bust Bonuses for Carillion bosses are blocked Mapping Carillion's biggest construction projects Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said it would release the information to the Public Accounts Committee, but had to ensure it did not release anything commercially sensitive. The Pensions and Business Committees in parliament confirmed on Wednesday that they will grill several Carillon bosses on 6 February. They include former chief executive Richard Howson, chairman Phillip Green, interim boss Keith Cochrane and ex-finance chiefs Richard Adam, Zafar Khan and Emma Mercer. It comes after a backlash over Mr Howson's pay packet during and after his tenure, as well as that of Mr Khan and Mr Cochrane.

"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin Throughout the confusion of Donald Trump's campaign and the chaotic events of his early days in the White House, one controversy has clung to the Trump team like glue: Russia. US intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. It is alleged that Russian hackers stole information linked to the campaign of his rival Hillary Clinton and passed it to Wikileaks so it could be released to undermine her. Congressional committees were set up to investigate the matter and, in March, then-FBI director James Comey confirmed the bureau had its own inquiry. President Trump sacked Mr Comey on 9 May, citing his reason as ""this Russia thing"", in a move that shocked Washington andfuelled claims of a cover-up. However, it did not halt the investigation. On 18 May, the department of justice appointed ex-FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to look into the matter. Mr Mueller has not given any details of his investigation but US media have reported he is investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice, both in the firing of Mr Comey and whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn resigned in February after failing to reveal the extent of his contacts with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington. In December, he pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his meetings with Mr Kislyak. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling the allegations a ""witch hunt"". It was back in May 2016 that the first reports emerged of hackers targeting the Democratic Party. Over the next two months, the reports suggested US intelligence agencies had traced the breaches back to Russian hackers. In July, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, Wikileaks published 20,000 internal emails stolen by the hackers. US intelligence officials said they believed with ""high confidence"" that Russia was behind the operation, but the Trump campaign publicly refused to accept the findings. Instead, at a press conference, Mr Trump caused outrage by inviting Russian hackers to target Hillary Clinton's controversial personal email server, saying: ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"". About the same time the hacking scandal was beginning to unfold, Mr Trump's then campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was accused of accepting millions of dollars in cash for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and US, including dealings with an oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Mr Manafort was running the campaign, the Republican Party changed the language in its manifesto regarding the conflict in Ukraine, removing anti-Russian sentiment, allegedly at the behest of two Trump campaign representatives. Subsequently, further allegations were made in Ukraine about secret funds said to have been paid to Mr Manafort, and it has also been claimed that he secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to assist President Putin's political ends. Mr Manafort has denied both allegations. He was found guilty in August 2018 of eight counts of financial fraud and tax evasion crimes. In September 2018, he pleaded guilty to two remaining charges - and agreed to co-operate with the special counsel's investigation in exchange for a reduced jail sentence. This video can not be played Trump praises Putin's leadership In October, the US intelligence community released a unanimous statement formally accusing Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Mr Trump continued to argue against the finding, claiming in a presidential debate that it ""could be Russia, but it could also be China, it could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds"". The same day that the intelligence agencies released their findings, the explosive ""Access Hollywood"" recording emerged of Mr Trump's obscene remarks about women in 2005. An hour later, Wikileaks began dumping thousands more leaked Clinton emails. Mr Trump continued to refuse to acknowledge the consensus that Russia was behind the hack. In December, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security published a report of the US intelligence findings linking Russia to the hack. In response, President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and levied new sanctions on Russia. The world awaited Mr Putin's response but he chose not retaliate. Mr Trump, by then the president-elect, sided with the Russian president, tweeting: ""Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!"" Mr Putin's decision not to respond in kind struck many as a canny PR move, but reportedly set off suspicions among US intelligence officials that Russia was confident the sanctions would not last. The same month, Mr Trump picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state, arguably the most important job in the cabinet. The biggest hurdle for Mr Tillerson's confirmation? Close ties to Mr Putin. As CEO of the ExxonMobil oil company, Mr Tillerson cultivated a close personal relationship with the Russian leader, leading many to speculate on whether he was fit to serve as America's most senior diplomat. Mr Tillerson wassworn in as secretary of state on 2 February. In January, Buzzfeed published a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, which alleged that Moscow had compromising material on the then-president-elect, making him liable to blackmail. Among the various memos in the dossier was an allegation that Mr Trump had been recorded by Russian security services consorting with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel. Mr Trump dismissed the claims as fake news. CNN revealed that President Obama and President-elect Trump had been briefed on the existence of the dossier by intelligence officials, and Buzzfeed went one further, publishing the entire thing. In February, the most concrete and damaging Russia scandal finally surfaced, months after suspicions were raised among intelligence officials. Michael Flynn quit as national security adviser after 23 days US media reported that Mr Flynn had discussed the potential lifting of Mr Obama's Russia sanctions with the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, before Mr Trump took the reins of government. It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy. He resigned as Mr Trump's national security adviser after 23 days on the job, saying he had ""inadvertently briefed the vice-president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador"" late last year. Since leaving the White House, the Pentagon has launched an investigation into whether he failed to disclose payments from Russian and Turkish lobbyists that he was given for speeches and consulting work. Who is Michael Flynn? Attorney General Jeff Sessions was being accused of lying at his confirmation hearing when he said he had had ""no communications with the Russians"" during the election campaign. It later emerged that he too had met Mr Kislyak - at a private meeting in September and as part of a group of ambassadors in July last year. The Alabama senator was one of the most prominent players in Mr Trump's bid to take the White House. But he says his meetings with Mr Kislyak were related to his role as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and had nothing to do with the election campaign. But Mr Sessions recused himself from the FBI investigation into the Russian hacking claims, an investigation he is overseeing. Two months into the Trump presidency, Mr Comey confirmed at a rare open hearing of the House Intelligence Committee that the agency was investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. It is an ""ongoing"" investigation that began in July 2016, he said. Mr Trump's controversial meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Mr Kislyak But on 9 May, Mr Comey was fired. The White House initially said it was over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails. But Mr Trump later said ""this Russia thing"" was a factor. On 10 May, Mr Trump met the Russian ambassador and foreign minister in the Oval Office. He told them firing Mr Comey had eased ""great pressure"",the New York Times reported,external. He also reportedlyshared with them highly-sensitive ""codeword"" materialrelating to terrorism and airline safety, sending more shockwaves through Washington. Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel a week later. In his much anticipated testimony before a Senate panel, Mr Comey said that Mr Trump had asked him to pledge his loyalty, confirming previous media reports about a January meeting between the pair. ""I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,"" Mr Trump said, according to Mr Comey's testimony. James Comey was ""terminated and removed from office"" by President Trump Mr Comey said: ""I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence."" Mr Comey also said Mr Trump had asked him to drop the investigation into Mr Flynn. ""[Trump] said: 'I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' I replied only that 'he is a good guy.'"" But Mr Comey did confirm the president's account that he had told Mr Trump the FBI was not investigating him personally. He said he had kept written memos on his meetings and phone calls with the president, fearing Mr Trump might lie. He denied asking for Mr Comey's loyalty, although he added: ""I don't think it would be a bad question to ask."" The White House also denied that Mr Trump had asked for the Flynn inquiry to be dropped. Mr Trump has alsoquestioned the neutrality of Robert Mueller, saying the special counsel's friendship with Mr Comey is ""bothersome"". He has criticised the FBI on numerous occasions and, in one tweet, said the organisation's reputation was ""in tatters"". On9 July came newsof what was thought to be the first confirmed private meeting between a Russian national and members of President Trump's inner circle. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr, admitted meeting Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya on 9 June 2016 at Trump Tower after being told that she had damaging material on Hillary Clinton. But he insisted the lawyer had provided ""no meaningful information"" in a meeting that also included the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Mr Manafort. Mr Trump Jr told the House Intelligence committee he discussed the Trump Tower meeting with his father once it became public in a New York Times report earlier this year, but he refused to provide details of their conversation, citing attorney-client privilege. September saw Facebook reveal it had discovered that politically charged advertising had been targeted at American voters during the 2016 campaign. The social network said it believed this had been paid for by Russians with links to the Kremlin. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said his company would share 3,000 Russia-linked political adverts with US investigators. The adverts did not support a specific candidate, Facebook said, but instead posted inflammatory information on hot topics such as immigration. Rival network Twitter said it had shut down about 200 accounts linked to a Russian misinformation campaign. President Trump responded to Facebook's revelations by saying the site had always been against him. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg rejected his comments, saying his company did not take sides. In October 2017, Mr Manafort,who quit as Mr Trump's campaign chairman last August, was charged with conspiring to defraud the US in his dealings with Ukraine. The good news for Mr Trump was that these charges - of which he was later convicted - were not directly linked to the Russia investigation. But the bad news is that Mr Manafort later agreed to co-operate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. Paul Manafort ended up falling prey to the controversy his appointment was intended to stifle Another of his advisers, George Papadopoulos, admitted making false statements to FBI agents about his dealings with an unnamed overseas academic who allegedly informed him that the Russians possessed ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. The charges against Mr Papadopoulos were the first to be brought by Robert Mueller as part of the Russia investigation. Paul Manafort: The man who helped Trump win In December, Michael Flynn admitted making false statements to the FBI about meetings with the Russian ambassador, making him the most senior member of the administration to be indicted. He also revealed he was co-operating with Mr Mueller's inquiry. A statement made by Mr Flynn to prosecutors appeared to implicate a more senior, though unnamed, Trump team official - indicating the direction in which Mr Mueller's investigation may be heading. Numerous US media outlets said the senior official now under the spotlight is Jared Kushner - Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law. Soon after Mr Flynn was charged, the president appeared to suggest that he had known Mr Flynn had lied about meetings with the Russian ambassador, contradicting his own account from the time - and prompting accusations that he obstructed justice. A White House lawyer later said he had written the tweet and that the controversial line had actually been an error.

"Theresa May delivers her speech in Davos The prime minister says she wants the UK to lead the world in deciding how artificial intelligence can be deployed in a safe and ethical manner. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Theresa May said a new advisory body,previously announced in the Autumn Budget,external, will co-ordinate efforts with other countries. In addition, she confirmed that the UK would join the Davos forum's own council on artificial intelligence. But others may have stronger claims. Earlier this week, Google picked France as the base for anew research centre dedicated to exploring how AI,externalcan be applied to health and the environment. Facebook also announced it was doubling the size of its existing AI lab in Paris, while software firm SAP committed itself to a 2bn euro ($2.5bn; Â£1.7bn) investment into the country that will include work on machine learning. Meanwhile, a report released last month by the Eurasia Group consultancy suggested that theUS and China are engaged,externalin a ""two-way race for AI dominance"". It predicted Beijing would take the lead thanks to the ""insurmountable"" advantage of offering its companies more flexibility in how they use data about its citizens. Theresa May is expected to meet US President Donald Trump at the Davos event on Thursday. The prime minister based the UK's claim to leadership in part on the health of its start-up economy, quoting a figure that a new AI-related company has been created in the country every week for the last three years. In addition, she said the UK is recognised as first in the world for its preparedness to ""bring artificial intelligence into government"". DeepMind's game-playing AI experiments are among the UK's highest profile success stories However, she recognised that many people have concerns about potential job losses and other impacts of the tech, and declared that AI poses one of the ""greatest tests of leadership for our time"". ""But it is a test that I am confident we can meet,"" she added. ""For right across the long sweep of history from the invention of electricity to advent of factory production, time and again initially disquieting innovations have delivered previously unthinkable advances and we have found the way to make those changes work for all our people,"" Mrs May said. This includes through a new UK advisory body, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation. Academics and tech industry leaders differ in opinion about the risks involved. At one end of the scale, Prof Stephen Hawking haswarned that AI could""spell the end of the human race"", while Tesla's Elon Musk has said that a universal basic income - in which people get paid whether or not they work - has a ""good chance"" of becoming necessary as jobs become increasingly automated. Facebook's AI chief has played down the risk of robots destroying humanity But Facebook's AI chief Yann LeCun has said society will develop the ""checks and balances"" to prevent a Terminator movie-likeapocalypse ever coming to pass,external. And earlier this week,Google's former chief Eric Schmidt,externaltold the BBC he did not believe predictions of mass job losses would occur. ""There will be some jobs eliminated but the vast majority will be augmented,"" he explained. ""You're going to have more doctors not fewer. More lawyers not fewer. More teachers not fewer. ""But they are going to be more efficient."" Eric Schmidt thinks AI will enhance jobs rather than destroy them en masse While many tech industry leaders acknowledge there will be a need for new rules and regulations, they also suggest it may be premature to introduce them in the short term. Microsoft, for example, has launched a book calledThe Future Computed,externalto coincide with the Davos event. Itproposes that it be given time to develop rules,externalto govern its own AI work internally before legislation is passed. Much of the AI research involved in developing Amazon's Alexa voice assistant was done in the UK Is the UK really on track to lead the world in Artificial Intelligence? Well the United States and China might have a thing or two to say about that. Both are engaged in an AI arms race and are investing the kind of sums that would make Chancellor Philip Hammond's - or even Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's - eyes water. Still, it is true that in London and Cambridge some of the world's leading AI scientists are at work. It was here that the Alexa digital voice assistant was developed and where a computer was trained to defeat champion players of the Chinese game of Go. The trouble is that those scientists were employed by Amazon and by Google, which brought up the DeepMind AI business when it was still in its infancy. That's a pattern frequently repeated in the UK technology sector. A Chinese AI investor on a trip to the UK this week expressed surprise that the government had not done more to protect these AI assets. Now there is to be another AI body, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, joining in a global conversation about the moral challenges posed by AI. We already have the Alan Turing Institute which has a similar mission. The concern is that while the UK agonises over the implications of this technology, the Chinese will just be getting on with it. Theresa May also addressed the need for tech firms to tackle terrorism and extremist content during her speech. Telegram is a privacy-focused chat app She said Telegram - a privacy-focused chat app - became popular with criminals and terrorists over a short period of time. ""We need to see more co-operation from smaller platforms like this,"" she added. Telegram has previouslysaid it is ""no friend of terrorists"",externaland blocked channels used by extremists. In addition, the prime minister called on tech company investors to play their part by demanding that trust and safety issues be considered.

"This video can not be played How The Presidents Club scandal unfolded The Presidents Club says it is to close following allegations that hostesses were groped at its men-only annual charity dinner. It said remaining funds would be distributed to children's charities ""in an efficient manner"". There was widespread outrage followingclaims about the event by an undercover FT reporter,external, and charities said they would return past donations. It also led to the resignation of a Department for Education director. The only women at last Thursday's event at the Dorchester Hotel in central London, which was attended by senior figures in business and finance, were hired hostesses. Event compere David Walliams said he was ""appalled"" by the claims but had not witnessed anything. The comedian and author tweeted,externalthat he was there in a ""strictly professional capacity"" and not as a guest. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

David Meller, who helped to organise the dinner, quit his non-executive role on the Department for Education board following the reports. Education minister Nadhim Zahawi was also a guest, and the BBC understands he has been called to see the government's chief whip to explain his version of events. It is believed he will be reprimanded but not fired. A No 10 source said the prime minister was ""appalled"" by reports of the event, adding: ""This shows there is a long way to go to ensure all women are treated properly as equals."" Former Channel 5 baseball show presenter Jonny Gould, who was the auctioneer at the dinner, also said he had not witnessed any of the alleged behaviour at the event or in previous years. ""If I had I would not have continued to work at the event,"" he said. The Dorchester said it was ""deeply concerned"" and was looking into the claims. Great Ormond Street Hospital and Evelina London Children's Hospital have said they will return previous donations from the organisers following the allegations. Madison Marriage, the Financial Times reporter who worked at the event, said she and ""numerous other hostesses"" were groped at the event. She said the 130 hostesses were told to wear skimpy black outfits with matching underwear and high heels and also that they could drink alcohol while working. They were asked to sign a five-page non-disclosure agreement about the event upon arrival at the hotel, Ms Marriage said, and were not warned they might be sexually harassed. She told BBC Newsnightshe was groped ""several times"" and said: ""It's a hands up skirts, hands on bums but also hands on hips, hands on stomachs, arms going round your waist unexpectedly. ""This isn't, I suppose, a high-level groping, but one of the strangest things was you could be talking to a man and he'd suddenly start holding your hand."" She said there were other women there ""who had absolutely no idea that was the kind of event it would be"". ""I had one woman tell me that she was shocked,"" she said. ""She was asked if she was a prostitute on the night."" The men-only dinner has been held annually for more than 30 years and has raised Â£20m for children's charities, including Great Ormond Street Hospital and Evelina London Children's Hospital. Back in 2014, it generated Â£694,000 but cost Â£673,000 to put on. In the most recent figures in 2016, its expenditure was Â£597,790 and income was Â£1,590,139. In 2015, the dinner cost Â£685,406 and Â£1,103,855 was generated. Great Ormond Street Hospital and Evelina London Children's Hospital have said they will return previous donations from the organisers of the dinner following the reports. Great Ormond Street said it was ""shocked"" and said it had received Â£530,000 from the Presidents Club via three gifts between 2009 and 2016. ""The returning of a donation is unusual and we are aiming to return the monies in full at the earliest opportunity,"" a spokeswoman said. The Royal Academy of Music said the allegations were ""deeply disturbing"" and said it would refund a Â£10,000 donation. The Charity Commission said it was investigating the claims ""as a matter of urgency"". Responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons, education minister Anne Milton told MPs that Mr Meller had quit his role following the allegations. She said Mr Meller, founder of the Meller Educational Trust, was ""absolutely clear"" that stepping down was the ""right thing to do"". This video can not be played Labour MP Jess Philips: 'Lads' culture has no place in country' Ms Milton said allegations of this type of behaviour were ""completely unacceptable"" and that board members were required to follow a code of conduct. ""It is quite extraordinary to me that, in the 21st Century, allegations of this kind are still emerging,"" she said. ""Women have the right to feel safe wherever they work."" Education minister Anne Milton said David Meller was ""absolutely clear"" that stepping down was the ""right thing to do"" Mr Meller has also resigned as a trustee of the Mayor's Fund for London. A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Zahawi had ""attended briefly and felt uncomfortable at what had begun to happen."" Mr Zahawi told Newsnight: ""I didn't stay long enough to really comment on the occasion."" Mr Zahawi later tweeted,external: ""I do unequivocally condemn this behaviour. The report is truly shocking. I will never attend a men only function ever."" The minister for digital and the creative industries, Margot James, told Newsnight that the event represented ""the very worst form of sexism with a smile on its face"". But she stood by Mr Zahawi, who told her he had left the event after an hour and a half. She said: ""That indicates to me that he was shocked by the events, didn't like the culture, the atmosphere."" But Labour's Sarah Jones said Mr Zahawi should resign if he did not report his concerns and had attended on previous occasions, while shadow education secretary Angela Rayner called for an investigation into his attendance. The Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had confidence in Mr Zahawi and he was not being referred for investigation. The Department for Education said Mr Meller and Mr Zahawi had both attended in a personal capacity. Retail tycoon Sir Philip Green was also among the guests. In a statement, the Presidents Club said: ""The organisers are appalled by the allegations of bad behaviour at the event asserted by the Financial Times reporters. Such behaviour is totally unacceptable. ""The allegations will be investigated fully and promptly and appropriate action taken."" A further statement added: ""The trustees have decided that the Presidents Club will not host any further fundraising events. Remaining funds will be distributed in an efficient manner to children's charities and it will then be closed."" A spokesman for the Artista agency, which recruited the hostesses, said: ""I was not aware of any claims of sexual harassment but the kind of behaviour alleged is completely unacceptable. ""I am checking with the staff and any complaints will be dealt with promptly and fairly."" Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality and women's rights, said: ""Sexual harassment, but all in a good cause? This is completely outrageous and proves why we need sexual harassment by clients or customers to be covered by law. ""At the moment, these women are unable to hold their employer to account for putting them in that situation."" Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: ""Dragging progress for women's rights back 50 years in the name of charity is deplorable. ""This demonstrates how entrenched sexual harassment is in the workplace and how far we still have to go."" WPP, the world's biggest advertising agency, which had sponsored a table at the dinner, said it was withdrawing its future support. Boss Sir Martin Sorrell, who did not attend, told BBC Radio 4's Todayhis guests did not see such behaviour and said: ""We won't support the charity in future, which is regrettable because it is a charity that supports numerous children's charities and has done a lot of good work."" Real estate investment business Frogmore said the guests at its table were ""unaware of any of the described events but in no way condone this behaviour"" and it will now end its association with the event. Part of the event included a charity auction, with one of the prizes being the chance to have tea with Bank of England governor Mark Carney. However, a Bank of England spokesman said it was not aware of the dinner and ""did not approve any prize"". He said it was understood a prize donated by the Bank to the Lord Mayor's Appeal charity auction had been re-gifted by the winner to the Presidents Club event. ""The unauthorised re-auctioning of the prize at the Presidents Club dinner was clearly against the spirit of the original donation,"" he said. ""The Bank has therefore made clear that it has been withdrawn."" He said Mr Carney was ""deeply dismayed that such an event could take place"". The Lord Mayor's Appeal said the prize should not have been transferred without prior agreement and said the original bidder had been offered a refund. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, said: ""If even half of what's been written about this event is true, it is deplorable and confirms how far we have still to go to stamp out sexual harassment."" Ann Francke, CMI chief executive, told the BBC: ""If you're a captain of industry in 2018, do you really want your shareholders, your customers, your employees to see you associated with things like this? ""And all of the people who attended should have thought about that before they walked through that door."" Former investment fund manager, now chief executive of Money&Co, Nicola Horlick, told the BBC: ""For this to be happening in this day and age it is unbelievable. ""The world has to change, there has been too much of this going on."" Downing Street said the prime minister was ""uncomfortable"" at the reports about the dinner and a spokesman added that it was ""an event she wouldn't be invited to"". Another auction prize included lunch with Boris Johnson, but Ms Milton said the foreign secretary knew nothing of his inclusion and in no way endorsed the event. Maria Miller, chair of the Women and Equalities select committee, told the BBC the report gave ""cause for concern"" and brought into question whether laws in the area were strong enough. Jess Phillips MP, who chairs the Women's Parliamentary Labour Party, told the BBC it was ""totally unacceptable that women should be hired in as a herd to entertain a group of entitled rich men"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""This is brave reporting from the FT, exposing behaviour that is outrageous and unacceptable."" Jo Swinson, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, has written to the head of the Charity Commission asking for an investigation into the ""serious and potentially criminal nature of the behaviour"" at the event.

"This video can not be played President Trump said he welcomed being quizzed by Mr Mueller President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to be questioned under oath as part of an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. He said he was ""looking forward"" to it, subject to the advice of his lawyers. Investigators are assessing if the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election in his favour - a claim denied by Mr Trump and Russia. Investigators will also determine if Mr Trump obstructed the inquiry. The US intelligence community has already concluded that Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. The president had previously said he thought an interview was ""unlikely""because there had been no collusion. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words The 'secret memo' intriguing Washington He has called the Russia investigation a ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax"". Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, Mr Trump maintained he was ""absolutely"" prepared to be questioned under oath by the top investigator. ""There's been no collusion whatsoever, there's no obstruction whatsoever,"" he said. On Thursday morning Mr Trump landed in Zurich, on his way to the World Economic Forum in Davos. He is the first sitting US president to do so since Bill Clinton 18 years ago. The president's lawyers have been talking to the investigation team led by justice department special counsel Robert Mueller about an interview, and the form it might take. The questioning could happen face-to-face, in writing, or it could be a combination of both. Special council Robert Mueller is a former FBI director As to when it might happen, Mr Trump said: ""Yesterday they were talking about two to three weeks."" Asked if he thought Mr Mueller would be fair, the president replied: ""We are going to find out... I hope so."" ALawyer's Worst Nightmare Analysis:Anthony Zurcher- BBCWashington A lawyer's worst nightmare is a client who won't stop talking. And when the client is the president, whose every public utterance is carefully inspected, the headaches are compounded. Such is the fate of Ty Cobb, Donald Trump's personal lawyer. At the moment, his legal team is in delicate negotiations with Robert Mueller about how - or whether - the president might answer questions the special counsel has relevant to his investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Could the interview be conducted in person or via written answers? Will it be open-ended or will the boundaries of any discussion be delineated? This is all reportedly on the table. Then, on Wednesday night, Mr Trump not only said he's eager to talk directly with Mr Mueller, but that he's willing to do so ""under oath"". The president also appears to have outlined a defence against allegations that he may have illegally interfered with the Russia investigation, saying his efforts to ""fight back"" against a partisan witch hunt were being unfairly characterised as obstruction. That kind of strategy is better suited for a war for public opinion than a legal fight. Mr Trump, however, may end up with both.

The country's top prosecutor is thought to be the first member of the Trump cabinet to be questioned.

"This video can not be played Financial Times journalist Madison Marriage details her experience at the event An undercover report by the Financial Times,externalhas exposed the alleged sexual harassment of hostesses at a charity dinner organised by The Presidents Club. Since the story hit the headlines,a number of women who have previously worked at the event have come forward with their experiences. Speaking to the BBC, they said they felt uncomfortable and described witnessing inappropriate behaviour at the annual event held at the Dorchester Hotel in London. Here are two of their stories. We have changed their names to protect their identities. Jo was 20 when she worked at the dinner in 2015. ""I was a law student and wanted to make some extra money. ""I had been hosting for a few different agencies by that time, and those jobs were all boring and normal. ""We were given food and wine when we arrived and I remember thinking there is no such thing as a free lunch, which did put me on edge. ""Later in the evening the men got more drunk, more flirtatious and more 'handsy' - they were groping the girls. ""Another hostess told me one of the men had asked me to come to his table. I told her I'd rather stick pins in my eyes. ""Some of the girls looked shell-shocked at what was happening, and some were more comfortable and sitting on the men's lap. ""Later the event moved to a number of smaller bars in the hotel. I saw some girls go up in the lift with the men. ""When it was time to leave, I just couldn't wait to get out of there. ""From then on I associated the Dorchester with that night. I refused to work at the hotel ever again."" Louise, who worked at the dinner in the same year, was a full-time model. ""For the Presidents Club event the client requested photos before we were hired. ""We were told to wear black nail varnish, sexy black shoes and black underwear. You also had to be at least 5ft 6in (1.7m). ""Men were summoning girls to sit on their laps. There were some girls who were voluntarily going over and were happy to talk to the guests. It was very flirtatious. ""The after-party was downstairs but I didn't go to that. I suppose this is where everything happened. ""I was paid Â£170 plus Â£20 for travel. ""This felt like a completely different atmosphere to other hosting events that I have worked at. The lines of what is acceptable and right felt very blurred. ""I never worked for the agency again.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May said more work needed to be done for women ""to be accepted and respected as equals"". A government minister has been reprimanded by No 10 for attending a men-only gala that led to allegations of sexual harassment and groping. Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said he attended The Presidents Club fundraiser but left early. The BBC understands Mr Zahawi was called to Downing Street on Wednesday to meet chief whip Julian Smith. Prime Minister Theresa May said she accepted Mr Zahawi's explanation, but was ""appalled"" at reports of the event. The Presidents Club said it was closing and would no longer hold eventsafter an undercover reporter for the Financial Times,externalrevealed hostesses were subject to groping and lewd comments. Mrs May, who is in Davos, said she understood that Mr Zahawi had left early from the event, but that such dinners should not take place. ""Frankly I was appalled,"" she said. ""I thought that sort of approach to women, that objectification of women, was something that we had left behind."" The Metropolitan Police said it had not received any complaints about the Presidents Club dinner last Thursday. Time up on men-only networking events? Scandal-hit club shuts amid groping claims 'Flirtatious and handsy': More women speak out The dinner and auction - which has taken place annually for over 30 years and raised Â£20m for children's charities - was held at the Dorchester Hotel in central London and attended by senior figures in business and finance. This video can not be played How The Presidents Club scandal unfolded The FT revealed the 130 hostesses were told to wear skimpy black outfits with matching underwear and high heels, and made to sign a non-disclosure agreement before starting work. Auction prizes included lunch with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a trip to a London strip club and plastic surgery ""to spice up your wife"". It is understood that Mr Johnson did not agree to support the event and will not take part in the lunch. Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said he had attended the scandal-hit event but left early Culture Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was appalled and it was a ""good thing"" that The Presidents club had shut down. He told the BBC Breakfast programme that he understood his colleague, Mr Zahawi, had been invited because it was a charity fundraiser. Asked if Mr Zahawi should stay in his role, Mr Hancock said it was a ""matter for the whips and the prime minister, rather than for me"". The organisation said it would distribute its remaining funds to children's charities, although some - including Great Ormond Street children's hospital - have said they will return any donations they have already received. The Charity Commission also said it was investigating the claims ""as a matter of urgency"". On Wednesday, Mr Zahawi, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, tweeted that he arrived at the event at 20:00 GMT and left at 21:35 GMT as he ""felt uncomfortable"", but said he did not see any of the ""horrific"" events reported. He also tweeted that he would never attend a men-only function again. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The minister for digital and the creative industries, Margot James, told Newsnight that the event represented ""the very worst form of sexism with a smile on its face"". But she stood by Mr Zahawi and his claim of an early exit. ""That indicates to me that he was shocked by the events, didn't like the culture, the atmosphere, and left,"" she said. This video can not be played Labour MP Jess Philips: 'Lads' culture has no place in country' But Labour's Sarah Jones said Mr Zahawi should resign if he did not report his concerns and had attended on previous occasions. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner also called for an investigation into his attendance. Earlier on Wednesday, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had confidence in Mr Zahawi and he was not being referred for investigation. One of the organisers, David Meller, quit his non-executive role on the Department for Education board following the reports. This video can not be played Financial Times journalist Madison Marriage: âI was groped several timesâ Madison Marriage, the reporter who worked at the event, said she and ""numerous other hostesses"" were groped at the dinner. Shetold BBC Newsnight: ""It's a hands up skirts, hands on bums but also hands on hips, hands on stomachs, arms going round your waist unexpectedly. ""This isn't, I suppose, a high-level groping, but one of the strangest things was you could be talking to a man and he'd suddenly start holding your hand."" She said there were other women there ""who had absolutely no idea that was the kind of event it would be"". Before the fundraiser announced it was closing, a number of businesses said they would cut ties with the event - including WPP, the world's biggest advertising agency, and real estate investment business Frogmore. British-Asian businessman, Rami Ranger, told the BBC Asian Network that men were warned not to ""misbehave"" prior to the dinner, which he was invited to by a friend and did not pay for. Mr Ranger said he was ""horrified"" by the revelations and would never attend a men-only event again. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, said: ""If even half of what's been written about this event is true, it is deplorable and confirms how far we have still to go to stamp out sexual harassment."" Ann Francke, CMI chief executive, told the BBC: ""If you're a captain of industry in 2018, do you really want your shareholders, your customers, your employees to see you associated with things like this? ""And all of the people who attended should have thought about that before they walked through that door."" Comedian and children's author David Walliams, who is not the subject of any allegations, was the compere for the evening. He said he ""did not witness any of the kind of behaviour that allegedly occurred"", but added that he was ""absolutely appalled"" by the reports and he would be donating his fee to the Children's Trust. TV presenter Jonny Gould, who was the auctioneer at the dinner, said he had ""never witnessed any of the alleged behaviour of guests at this event nor in previous years"". He added: ""If I had, I would not have continued to work at the event."" The Dorchester said it was ""deeply concerned"" and was looking into the claims. A spokesman for the Artista agency, which recruited the hostesses, said: ""I was not aware of any claims of sexual harassment but the kind of behaviour alleged is completely unacceptable. ""I am checking with the staff and any complaints will be dealt with promptly and fairly."" Have you ever worked as a hostess at an event like this?

"This video can not be played Financial Times journalist Madison Marriage details her experience at the event An undercover report by the Financial Times,externalhas exposed the alleged sexual harassment of hostesses at a charity dinner organised by The Presidents Club. Since the story hit the headlines,a number of women who have previously worked at the event have come forward with their experiences. Speaking to the BBC, they said they felt uncomfortable and described witnessing inappropriate behaviour at the annual event held at the Dorchester Hotel in London. Here are two of their stories. We have changed their names to protect their identities. Jo was 20 when she worked at the dinner in 2015. ""I was a law student and wanted to make some extra money. ""I had been hosting for a few different agencies by that time, and those jobs were all boring and normal. ""We were given food and wine when we arrived and I remember thinking there is no such thing as a free lunch, which did put me on edge. ""Later in the evening the men got more drunk, more flirtatious and more 'handsy' - they were groping the girls. ""Another hostess told me one of the men had asked me to come to his table. I told her I'd rather stick pins in my eyes. ""Some of the girls looked shell-shocked at what was happening, and some were more comfortable and sitting on the men's lap. ""Later the event moved to a number of smaller bars in the hotel. I saw some girls go up in the lift with the men. ""When it was time to leave, I just couldn't wait to get out of there. ""From then on I associated the Dorchester with that night. I refused to work at the hotel ever again."" Louise, who worked at the dinner in the same year, was a full-time model. ""For the Presidents Club event the client requested photos before we were hired. ""We were told to wear black nail varnish, sexy black shoes and black underwear. You also had to be at least 5ft 6in (1.7m). ""Men were summoning girls to sit on their laps. There were some girls who were voluntarily going over and were happy to talk to the guests. It was very flirtatious. ""The after-party was downstairs but I didn't go to that. I suppose this is where everything happened. ""I was paid Â£170 plus Â£20 for travel. ""This felt like a completely different atmosphere to other hosting events that I have worked at. The lines of what is acceptable and right felt very blurred. ""I never worked for the agency again.""

"The Stage spoke to 1,000 theatre professionals for its research Almost a third of theatre professionals in the UK have been sexually harassed at work, according to a survey. The Stage magazine,externalasked over 1,000 people working in industry for their experiences, with 31% saying they had suffered sexual harassment. Over 40% of respondents said they had been bullied and almost 8% said they had been sexually assaulted at work. Director of the National Theatre Rufus Norris said the ""shaming"" revelations ""must force change"". The study comes after allegations of sexual assault and harassment were made against actor Kevin Spacey. He worked as the artistic director of London's Old Vic theatre between 2004 and 2015. The theatre has now launched a ""guardians programme"" to offer staff someone to talk to about any concerns they have. Kevin Spacey worked as the artistic director of the Old Vic for over 10 years Spacey's spokesperson has previously said the actor is ""taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment"". Professionals interviewed by the magazine included performers, backstage workers, front of house staff and management. Some said that harassment and bullying were ""ingrained into the theatre culture"", with others saying they felt ""systematically disrespected, devalued and belittled"". However, 67% of people who had suffered did not report incidents, and when sexual assault was reported, no action was taken in four out of five cases. Rufus Norris said those in the industry coming forward with their stories were a ""powerful prompt"" to review policy and codes of practice, as well as a moment for ""for each of us to look at our individual behaviour"".

"Plastic is sorted and processed and turned into pellets Plastic being washed up on beaches and hauled up in fishing nets is being recycled and turned into kayaks. It is part of a new scheme in Devon and Cornwall which is looking at different ways of cleaning up plastic sea pollution. Neil Hembrow from Keep Britain Tidy said all the plastic collected is processed into pellets and then ""melted and moulded into products"". The kayaks will be used by community groups to clean up beaches. More on this and other Devon and Cornwall stories The kayaks will be given to local community groups to clean up rivers and coastlines this spring The plastic gathered on beaches under the new scheme is brought to recycling centres in one of 11 harbours across the South West. The idea is to turn washed-up plastic into a useful product. Mr Hembrow said: ""We do find, by weight, around about 80% of the waste is coming in from the marine environment."" The fishing industry says it has had a project in place for more than 10 years to help with sea pollution. Jim Portas, chief executive of South Western Fish Producer Organisation, said fishermen find an ""awful lot of lightweight debris"" coming up in their nets, as the nets come aboard. ""Fishermen are bringing that sort of plastic into the harbours to be disposed of and that finds its way to recycling centres,"" he added. The Marine Conservation Society said in the last five years, its volunteer beach cleaners have found over 42,000 items of fishing industry related litter on beaches in the South West. It urges UK governments to ""support recent EU proposals and tackle litter from ships, including fishing vessels"" which will ""change the 100% indirect fee for waste disposal from ships"". The kayaks produced are due to be given to local community groups to clean up rivers and coastlines this spring.

"Theresa May delivers her speech in Davos The prime minister says she wants the UK to lead the world in deciding how artificial intelligence can be deployed in a safe and ethical manner. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Theresa May said a new advisory body,previously announced in the Autumn Budget,external, will co-ordinate efforts with other countries. In addition, she confirmed that the UK would join the Davos forum's own council on artificial intelligence. But others may have stronger claims. Earlier this week, Google picked France as the base for anew research centre dedicated to exploring how AI,externalcan be applied to health and the environment. Facebook also announced it was doubling the size of its existing AI lab in Paris, while software firm SAP committed itself to a 2bn euro ($2.5bn; Â£1.7bn) investment into the country that will include work on machine learning. Meanwhile, a report released last month by the Eurasia Group consultancy suggested that theUS and China are engaged,externalin a ""two-way race for AI dominance"". It predicted Beijing would take the lead thanks to the ""insurmountable"" advantage of offering its companies more flexibility in how they use data about its citizens. Theresa May is expected to meet US President Donald Trump at the Davos event on Thursday. The prime minister based the UK's claim to leadership in part on the health of its start-up economy, quoting a figure that a new AI-related company has been created in the country every week for the last three years. In addition, she said the UK is recognised as first in the world for its preparedness to ""bring artificial intelligence into government"". DeepMind's game-playing AI experiments are among the UK's highest profile success stories However, she recognised that many people have concerns about potential job losses and other impacts of the tech, and declared that AI poses one of the ""greatest tests of leadership for our time"". ""But it is a test that I am confident we can meet,"" she added. ""For right across the long sweep of history from the invention of electricity to advent of factory production, time and again initially disquieting innovations have delivered previously unthinkable advances and we have found the way to make those changes work for all our people,"" Mrs May said. This includes through a new UK advisory body, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation. Academics and tech industry leaders differ in opinion about the risks involved. At one end of the scale, Prof Stephen Hawking haswarned that AI could""spell the end of the human race"", while Tesla's Elon Musk has said that a universal basic income - in which people get paid whether or not they work - has a ""good chance"" of becoming necessary as jobs become increasingly automated. Facebook's AI chief has played down the risk of robots destroying humanity But Facebook's AI chief Yann LeCun has said society will develop the ""checks and balances"" to prevent a Terminator movie-likeapocalypse ever coming to pass,external. And earlier this week,Google's former chief Eric Schmidt,externaltold the BBC he did not believe predictions of mass job losses would occur. ""There will be some jobs eliminated but the vast majority will be augmented,"" he explained. ""You're going to have more doctors not fewer. More lawyers not fewer. More teachers not fewer. ""But they are going to be more efficient."" Eric Schmidt thinks AI will enhance jobs rather than destroy them en masse While many tech industry leaders acknowledge there will be a need for new rules and regulations, they also suggest it may be premature to introduce them in the short term. Microsoft, for example, has launched a book calledThe Future Computed,externalto coincide with the Davos event. Itproposes that it be given time to develop rules,externalto govern its own AI work internally before legislation is passed. Much of the AI research involved in developing Amazon's Alexa voice assistant was done in the UK Is the UK really on track to lead the world in Artificial Intelligence? Well the United States and China might have a thing or two to say about that. Both are engaged in an AI arms race and are investing the kind of sums that would make Chancellor Philip Hammond's - or even Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's - eyes water. Still, it is true that in London and Cambridge some of the world's leading AI scientists are at work. It was here that the Alexa digital voice assistant was developed and where a computer was trained to defeat champion players of the Chinese game of Go. The trouble is that those scientists were employed by Amazon and by Google, which brought up the DeepMind AI business when it was still in its infancy. That's a pattern frequently repeated in the UK technology sector. A Chinese AI investor on a trip to the UK this week expressed surprise that the government had not done more to protect these AI assets. Now there is to be another AI body, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, joining in a global conversation about the moral challenges posed by AI. We already have the Alan Turing Institute which has a similar mission. The concern is that while the UK agonises over the implications of this technology, the Chinese will just be getting on with it. Theresa May also addressed the need for tech firms to tackle terrorism and extremist content during her speech. Telegram is a privacy-focused chat app She said Telegram - a privacy-focused chat app - became popular with criminals and terrorists over a short period of time. ""We need to see more co-operation from smaller platforms like this,"" she added. Telegram has previouslysaid it is ""no friend of terrorists"",externaland blocked channels used by extremists. In addition, the prime minister called on tech company investors to play their part by demanding that trust and safety issues be considered.

He has to quickly learn.
We love you Antonio Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger speaking to Sky Sports:""In the first half we gave Chelsea too much respect and distance. We were a bit scared to go for it and we suffered from that. ""We were not playing in the right position but we amended that in the second half and took control of the game. We knew we could perform better in the second half and that's what we did. In the first half we watched them play a bit but we were tighter after the break. ""We lost a great player in Alexis Sanchez but when a team doesn't know what's going on in the dressing room there is less clarity and focus on performances. We know we have to deal with it now. ""We have some time to prepare for the final but we are happy to take our fans to Wembley. We've been there a few times now and we're happy to be going again."" Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea It is like a return to the Gunners pre-Wenger glory days.   Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Arsene Wenger said yesterday that some teams - cough Liverpool, cough, cough Tottenham - get undue prominence and praise in the media despite their lack of trophies. âYou celebrate some teams who have not been in a final for 25 years and yet you kill us even though we have won the FA Cup three times in the last four years,"" he said. âItâs like that, we have to live with that.â The club's Twitter account got the memo. Text 81111 Mohamed Elneny was actually a great signing by Wenger, he's not worldclass a very solid player, he was quality today and probably worth Â£25m in today's market. Stewart Smith Yep, but Leicester's third-choice striker is a Â£25m player in today's market. Only bitcoin has been on a steeper upward curve than footballers' transfer fees. Text 81111 Why canât Conte adapt to a desperate situation? 2-1 down and we still have five defenders and two defensive midfielders on the pitch! Alex, Lincoln Just as you think Arsenalâs season is falling apart after losing at Forest and Bournemouth , they fluke a couple of results together to semi - rescue their season.
It was the same last year after losing 5-1 twice to Bayern. 2 lucky draws in the FA Cup against Sutton and Lincoln again semi-rescues their season and they end up winning it Brian Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere speaking to Sky Sports:""The team effort in the second half was key when we knew he had to dig deep. We might have got a formation wrong in the first 25 minutes and they have good players in the middle who could take advantage. ""At this level, we are creating a few more chances and it takes a bit of luck some time. We have to be up for it and ready to go. ""I wouldn't see it as surreal being back here and in the first team. I went away on loan last season, but wanted to come back and fight for my place in the team."" Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka speaking to Sky Sports:""We changed the system in the second half and we were the better team.I think it is only my second goal from inside the box for Arsenal."" #bbcfootball or 81111 on text (UK only) Concerns aplenty for Chelsea fans after that result... John7144:Chelsea rely so much on Hazard  that all these Madrid rumours have me worried. antzhumbleent:I can clearly see why Conte is desperately after another striker, Batshuayi is just useless at times. st2405:Why didnât Conte start Batshuayi? Why is he the only manager in England that canât get the better of Wenger? Surely the clock is ticking for him... #bbcfootball or 81111 on text (UK only) They'll be partying on the streets of north London tonight! Can we play Chelsea every week? Callum, an ageing Arsenal fan Canât wait for Mkhitaryan to come into this team! Onwards and upwards JD Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Jermaine JenasFormer Tottenham midfielder at Emirates Stadium I gave Chelsea a lot of praise in the first half but they didn't really open up Arsenal apart from their goal. After that they were a bit stale unless Eden Hazard was on the ball. I was disappointed with Barkley but we've got to give him time. He's going to have to work something out very quickly. He has to take responsibility. He needs to be more productive, score goals and make things happen and be the player that Chelsea have bought. Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Allow Twitter content?

In the first half I was worried, it wasn't looking good. A completely different team came out in second half, they got themselves back into the game and I think the better team won. Chelsea didn't offer enough or do enough. Most of those Chelsea players can't look at themselves and say they deserved to win that game. Managers are often stubborn but Arsene Wenger saw his team needed help at half-time. Moving Mohamed Elneny back was a stroke of genius. Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Allow Twitter content?

"Arsenal will play Man City in final on 25 February Gunners have not won League Cup since 1993 Rudiger unlucky in both Arsenal goals with deflections Barkley replaced injured Willian for Chelsea debut Mike Henson Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Right, that is your lot from the Emirates tonight. Antonio Conte still looks like distinctly underwhelmed by life at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal's post-Alexis existence is going pretty well. A bit of a pot to polish would sweeten things even more. Intrigue to come. Tweet #bbcfootball or text 81111 Dimos:So, if Wenger does a Mourinho-2017 ie win Carabao Cup and Europa League, is he a success or a failure? Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Chelsea coach Antonio Conte on Sky Sports:""My thoughts are there is disappointment for the final result. ""I think my
players must be pleased with their effort, we tried to reach the final, we conceded two goals and we were unlucky, two deflections. ""It is a pity because we had a good run
in this competition, it is a pity for me, the players and fans. ""We started very well, played a good first half
and in the second half I saw a lot of balance. ""When there is an injury to one of your best players it is not simple, especially when on the bench the only substitue is Ross Barkley. ""Barkley has a lot of space for improvement, he is
working with us only two weeks but for sure today I was forced to make this substitution,
but he can improve a lot. ""I don't need anything, I'm a coach and I continue with my
players."" #bbcfootball or 81111 on text (UK only) LukaFoley:Was so disappointed when I saw Batshuayi on the bench. What does he have to do to start a LC game? From what I've just watched, if Hazard leaves us, we're in deep trouble because I believe he is  well and truly the only player we rely on to create chances. ARrahmanfreak:Winning cups are a different ball game altogether. Conte hasn't won any in his managerial career.

He has to quickly learn.
We love you Antonio Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger speaking to Sky Sports:""In the first half we gave Chelsea too much respect and distance. We were a bit scared to go for it and we suffered from that. ""We were not playing in the right position but we amended that in the second half and took control of the game. We knew we could perform better in the second half and that's what we did. In the first half we watched them play a bit but we were tighter after the break. ""We lost a great player in Alexis Sanchez but when a team doesn't know what's going on in the dressing room there is less clarity and focus on performances. We know we have to deal with it now. ""We have some time to prepare for the final but we are happy to take our fans to Wembley. We've been there a few times now and we're happy to be going again."" Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea It is like a return to the Gunners pre-Wenger glory days.   Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Arsene Wenger said yesterday that some teams - cough Liverpool, cough, cough Tottenham - get undue prominence and praise in the media despite their lack of trophies. âYou celebrate some teams who have not been in a final for 25 years and yet you kill us even though we have won the FA Cup three times in the last four years,"" he said. âItâs like that, we have to live with that.â The club's Twitter account got the memo. Text 81111 Mohamed Elneny was actually a great signing by Wenger, he's not worldclass a very solid player, he was quality today and probably worth Â£25m in today's market. Stewart Smith Yep, but Leicester's third-choice striker is a Â£25m player in today's market. Only bitcoin has been on a steeper upward curve than footballers' transfer fees. Text 81111 Why canât Conte adapt to a desperate situation? 2-1 down and we still have five defenders and two defensive midfielders on the pitch! Alex, Lincoln Just as you think Arsenalâs season is falling apart after losing at Forest and Bournemouth , they fluke a couple of results together to semi - rescue their season.
It was the same last year after losing 5-1 twice to Bayern. 2 lucky draws in the FA Cup against Sutton and Lincoln again semi-rescues their season and they end up winning it Brian Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere speaking to Sky Sports:""The team effort in the second half was key when we knew he had to dig deep. We might have got a formation wrong in the first 25 minutes and they have good players in the middle who could take advantage. ""At this level, we are creating a few more chances and it takes a bit of luck some time. We have to be up for it and ready to go. ""I wouldn't see it as surreal being back here and in the first team. I went away on loan last season, but wanted to come back and fight for my place in the team."" Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka speaking to Sky Sports:""We changed the system in the second half and we were the better team.I think it is only my second goal from inside the box for Arsenal."" #bbcfootball or 81111 on text (UK only) Concerns aplenty for Chelsea fans after that result... John7144:Chelsea rely so much on Hazard  that all these Madrid rumours have me worried. antzhumbleent:I can clearly see why Conte is desperately after another striker, Batshuayi is just useless at times. st2405:Why didnât Conte start Batshuayi? Why is he the only manager in England that canât get the better of Wenger? Surely the clock is ticking for him... #bbcfootball or 81111 on text (UK only) They'll be partying on the streets of north London tonight! Can we play Chelsea every week? Callum, an ageing Arsenal fan Canât wait for Mkhitaryan to come into this team! Onwards and upwards JD Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Jermaine JenasFormer Tottenham midfielder at Emirates Stadium I gave Chelsea a lot of praise in the first half but they didn't really open up Arsenal apart from their goal. After that they were a bit stale unless Eden Hazard was on the ball. I was disappointed with Barkley but we've got to give him time. He's going to have to work something out very quickly. He has to take responsibility. He needs to be more productive, score goals and make things happen and be the player that Chelsea have bought. Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Allow Twitter content?

Arsenal and Manchester City were due to be playing each other in the Premier League on 25 February. They will now meet but at Wembley and in a different competition. Chelsea's meeting with Manchester United - which is also scheduled for that day - will take place as planned after being in danger of a postponement. App users may need to click through to view Bill Edgar's tweet. Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Jermaine JenasFormer Tottenham midfielder at Emirates Stadium Fair play to Arsenal. In the first half I was worried, it wasn't looking good. A completely different team came out in second half, they got themselves back into the game and I think the better team won. Chelsea didn't offer enough or do enough. Most of those Chelsea players can't look at themselves and say they deserved to win that game. Managers are often stubborn but Arsene Wenger saw his team needed help at half-time. Moving Mohamed Elneny back was a stroke of genius. Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Allow Twitter content?
