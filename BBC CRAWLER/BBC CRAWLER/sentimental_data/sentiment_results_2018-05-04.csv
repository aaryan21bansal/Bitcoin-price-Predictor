"Harvey Proctor was a Conservative MP between 1979 and 1987 A former MP is claiming Â£1m in damages from the Metropolitan Police after being falsely accused of child sexual abuse and murder. Harvey Proctor is also taking legal action against his accuser - a man known by the pseudonym ""Nick"". Mr Proctor says the allegations and subsequent investigation by the Met resulted in him losing his job and home, and suffering from depression. Scotland Yard said it would be defending the claim. The investigation, known as Operation Midland, began in 2014 when Nick named Mr Proctor as one of a number of men who he claimed were part of an establishment paedophile ring in the 1970s and 1980s. The former MP was cleared in 2016 when the Met said it had found insufficient evidence to consider any criminal charges.  Scotland Yard apologised and a review of the case strongly criticised the investigation. Mr Proctor's claim - filed at the High Court and seen by the BBC - identifies the Met Police Commissioner and Nick as the two defendants. Mr Proctor's legal claim says that Nick's allegations were ""false and malicious"" and designed to damage him in an attempt to pervert the course of justice. He claims police could have carried out ""elementary research"" to dismiss them before taking any action that would have resulted in him being affected. He is accusing the Met of conspiring with Nick and a news agency, Exaro, which first published the allegations and facilitated a meeting with detectives. Mr Proctor's claim highlights the statement by a senior police officer in late 2014 that Nick's claims were ""credible and true"". He also says a police application for a warrant to search his home in Leicestershire amounted to an attempt to pervert the course of justice because it relied on Nick's allegations. His legal claim details how police raised ""child protection concerns"" about him during the investigation and asked his employer - Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire - to suspend him. He ended being forced to resign and lost his home, which was part of his employment at the castle. Mr Proctor is also claiming his privacy was breached. Since the investigation he has suffered what his doctor describes in the claim as a ""major depressive episode"". Operation Midland began in 2014 after Nick claimed boys had been sexually abused and that three had been murdered by a group of powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies. Retired judge Sir Richard Henriques later reviewed the investigation and identified 43 serious failings in his report, including that Nick had been believed for too long and that search warrants had been applied for with flawed information.

"They seem stuck with each other - so close, in fact, that ourprojected national share of the votefrom the results would mean that, in a hypothetical general election tomorrow, the two main Westminster parties would receive exactly the same levels of public support. For reasons we've discussed at length overnight and in recent days, we have to be careful about directly transposing what happened on Thursday into a theoretical nationwide election. But while in one sense not very much happened in the local election - not very many councils and seats changed hands and neither of the main parties have (with a couple of hours to go) made dramatic strides - something important did happen. Leaders upbeat despite lack of big gains Local election results 2018 - live The results in maps Voters opted again for roughly the status quo, underlining the trends that we saw developing at the general election as the political parties grappled with a new landscape after the referendum. Labour piled up support in big urban areas, but struggled to show advances in towns or areas where there used to be big industries, which are often - inconveniently for them - the kinds of places that have Westminster constituencies that swing the election. And notably, in part due to the grim row over anti-Semitism not being tackled in the Labour Party quickly enough, Labour did not make the kinds of additional gains in London boroughs they had suggested, even though in some of those critical parts of the metropolis, they ran the Tories extremely close. Almost in a mirror image, the Tories have struggled to get voters in big cities on side, even though, as above, they held back what would have been totemic losses in London. But they nibbled away in some of those kinds of places where Labour lost some of their appeal. Just as at the general election, we saw that outside London the Conservatives inched forward, and inside London, Labour took some small steps. There were of course many other interesting results, and you can read about them here. However, broadly speaking, both of the main Westminster parties maintained their comfort zone, but showed little evidence of pushing out of it. At this stage of the electoral cycle, that is a significant problem for the Labour Party. To demonstrate to the public, and to their own foot soldiers, they are banging on the door of No 10, they were eager to show more striking advances that did not come to pass. Some of their own MPs have been candid enough to admit that, in the last few hours, and to confront the geographical divide in their vote. But for the Tories too, there is a sense of relief, rather than a feeling of hope. They held off challenges more effectively than they expected to, but again, they showed little sign of having much to offer to voters in what's alien territory for them. Just as in June last year, we saw broadly Tory v Labour, Towns v Cities, Young v Old, and Leave v Remain. Of course it's not as simple as that. The Lib Dems had a better night than expected and UKIP pretty much disappeared. But the fault lines which the Referendum exposed are deeper still. And here is the conundrum for Labour and the Tories - they both are perhaps digging deeper into their holes. For the Tories, in the traditional context, this can fairly be described as a pretty decent performance after eight years in government, which traditionally see parties get hammered as voters get fed up with them over the years. It would be perfectly easy for them therefore to say, move on, nothing to see here, let's carry on as we are, not least because the Tories are divided, and have faced drama after drama. But there's caution too. One senior Conservative warns that in London Councils they held on ""in spite of the Westminster government and not because of it"". They added: ""The big risk is that the national party kicks the reform can down the road because we are trundling along. Just because the wheels didn't fall off, doesn't mean the early warning lights aren't flashing faster than ever."" For Labour, the results don't suggest confident strides towards Number 10, but neither are they so bad that the party is likely to re-examine their approach. One shadow minister told the BBC it was ""very serious to be going backwards"" in some Midlands areas. Another said in frustration that there was ""no strategy"", but said nothing will change in their view, because ""we've got 500,000 people who think this guy walks on water"". For real majorities, rather than hung politics, parties have to achieve beyond their comfort zones. Until either of them can do that, perhaps Mr Corbyn can't truly beat Mrs May, but nor will Mrs May be able to see off Mr Corbyn.

"With the final result declared Labour has taken control of Tower Hamlets, but has failed to take other target councils in London, while the Conservatives have lost control of two councils overall. The Lib Dems have gained four councils, two of them in London. UKIP has lost over 120 councillors and the Greens have a net increase of eight councillors. Those councils changing hands are listed below. In total, 4,371 seats were contested across 150 local authorities, in the first major test of public opinion since last year's general election.  Maps built using Carto. If you can't see the map,tap or click here,external. Based on the results, the gap in predicted national vote share between the Conservatives and Labour has closed since the council elections last year.

In the rest of England excluding London, the Tories gained 57 seats, while Labour took an additional 12. The Lib Dems and the Greens both gained more council seats in London than in the rest of England. Labour have takenPlymouthfrom the Conservatives and gained control ofKirkleesandTower Hamlets. However, in the north they lost overall control ofNuneaton and Bedworth, andDerby, while also losing some seats in strongholds likeWiganandSheffield. In London, Labour gained multiple seats inWandsworthandWestminster, as the map below shows - but these gains were not enough to take control of each borough.  The Conservatives gained control ofBasildonandPeterboroughcouncils thanks to the collapse in UKIP support, and won some seats inWakefieldandLeeds, traditional Labour areas. In London, the Tories gained seats inHillingdon- which some had touted as a potential Labour target - and won nine more seats inSutton, despite the area remaining in Lib Dem control. However, they lost control ofTrafford,Plymouth,KingstonandRichmond- where they lost 28 seats in total.  The Liberal Democrats won control ofRichmond-upon-Thames, gaining 24 seats in the process in one of the biggest swings of the night. The party also tookThree Rivers,KingstonandSouth Cambridgeshire.

"Labour group leader Barry Rawlings (right) said the anti-Semitisim row had ""made a difference"" A senior Labour politician says he ""suspects"" the anti-Semitism row led to his party's failure to take control of Barnet Council. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth believes Labour needs to regain the trust of voters who had been ""turned away"". Labour had been expected to win Barnet for the first time, however the Conservative Party held the council. The Tories increased their majority by winning 38 seats. Labour group leader Barry Rawlings said the party'santi-Semitism rowhad ""made a difference"" as Barnet has one of the UK's largest Jewish populations. Lib Dems regain Richmond Council Mixed picture in English council elections London local election results 2018 ""If it had happened a couple of years ago Barnet would now be a Labour council,"" he said. Barnet had been in no overall control before the election. Labour won 25 seats compared to 30 in the 2014 election while the Liberal Democrats lost their only seat on the north London council. The Conservatives controlled Barnet after the last council election in 2014, but it changed to no overall control when one councillor resigned earlier this year. Labour's Andrew Gwynne said the party has to ""tackle the anti-Semitism issue head on"" Adam Langleben, one of the Labour councillors who lost their seat in Barnet, said allegations of anti-Semitism were the key reasons for the party's losses in London. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I spent countless hours knocking on countless doors speaking to Jewish voters who are Labour voters or were Labour voters - people who genuinely believe in the same values as the Labour Party, who agreed with our local manifesto for Barnet. ""But they could not vote for a Labour Party that they see as hostile or dangerous to the Jewish community. ""And the Labour Party is seen by far too many people in the Jewish community as being racist right now."" However, Richard Cornelius, Conservative leader of Barnet Council, said voters were more concerned about ""local issues"" than with accusations of anti-Semitism within Labour. He said: ""They are all basic issues. It was things like potholes, the collection of their rubbish bins and keeping the council tax low. ""Of course there is a concern about anti-Semitism in the Jewish areas, and of course there is a wider concern about it more generally. ""People are horrified, and Labour have to address that."" Speaking at a visit to Barnet, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""People of all faiths have rejected the vile anti-semitism that has gone unchallenged in the Labour party for too long"". Labour MP John Mann, an outspoken critic of Jeremy Corbyn,tweeted,externalthat the anti-Semitism row had ""cost Labour badly last night"". ""A Jewish member for more than 60 years told me on the doorstep he couldn't vote Labour in Barnet yesterday,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""There's much more to come and it's going to get even better"" Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour achieved ""solid"" English local election results despite not making big gains. The party failed to take several targets from the Tories, including Wandsworth, but won back Plymouth and became the largest party in Trafford. Theresa May praised Tory councillors after winning Barnet, Basildon and Peterborough. The party gained from a collapse in UKIP's vote. The BBC's projected national vote share puts both parties on 35%. Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice told the BBC it was ""a draw"", so far as both parties' national performance was concerned. The Lib Dems are on 16% according the BBC estimate, which uses the results of key wards to estimate what a Britain-wide vote would have been. Recap: How the election results unfolded Sir John Curtice: How important was Brexit? UKIP official compares party to the Black Death The final council to be declared was Tower Hamlets, which was gained by Labour from no overall control. Across the 150 council elections, Labour won 2,350 seats, up 77, the Conservatives won 1,332, down 33, the Lib Dems won 536, up 75, the Greens won 39, up eight and UKIP won three, down 123. The BBC estimate, based on 800 key wards, puts turnout at 36%, the same as in these wards four years ago. The Conservativesgained the London council of Barnetfrom no overall control, and held their flagship London councils of Westminster and Wandsworth. They also won Basildon and Peterborough, which had both also been under no overall control. But they havelost control of their northern flagship Trafford Councilafter 14 years of Conservative rule. Labour had high hopes for the night, and havewon Plymouth from the Toriesand gained Kirklees from no overall control butlost Nuneaton and BedworthandDerby. The Lib Dems have gained four councils, winning neighbouringKingston-upon-ThamesandRichmond-upon-Thamesin Greater London andSouth Cambridgeshirefrom the Tories andThree Riversfrom no overall control. The Greenshave gained seats- taking some from Labour in Sheffield and from the Tories in Richmond upon Thames. UKIP, which performed strongly last time most of the seats were fought in 2014,has seen its vote collapse. It had just three councillors elected, after losing 123. Sinn FÃ©inhas won the Westminster by-election in West Tyrone. Labour MP Dan Jarvis has beenelected mayor of the Sheffield City Region. This video can not be played Theresa May hails Tory campaigners in Wandsworth The Conservatives held on to their flagship London councils, gained control of Redditch from Labour and Barnet, Basildon and Peterborough, which had been under no overall control. But they have lost control of Trafford in Greater Manchester, a key northern stronghold, where Labour is now the largest party, Plymouth, and Mole Valley, Surrey - as well as losing two London councils to the Lib Dems. According to the BBC's projected national vote share, the party is three points down on what it achieved in 2017's county council elections but, after eight years in government, it is better than its performance in any of the local elections held between 2012 and 2014 and in 2016. Prime Minister Theresa May visited Wandsworth on Friday morning - one of the Conservative's key London councils which the party held, despite losing eight seats. She said: ""Labour thought they could take control, this was one of their top targets and they threw everything at it, but they failed."" She said the party ""won't take anything for granted"" and would ""build on this success for the future"". Party chairman Brandon Lewis acknowledged some disappointments, but told BBC Breakfast that voters had chosen the Tories after seeing ""good, clear and strong leadership"" from the prime minister. Labour did pick up a seat in the Tory stronghold of Kensington and Chelsea Council, but the Conservatives retained control, despite criticism of their handling of the Grenfell Tower disaster. Tory leader of the council, Elizabeth Campbell, said they needed to ""rebuild trust"". Labour had hoped to take control of Wandsworth Labour was defending the most seats - more than 2,200 - and had talked up its prospects in London, where it made gains in last year's general election. The party gained control of Plymouth from the Conservatives as well as Kirklees, but lost control of two Midlands councils - Derby and Nuneaton and Bedworth - to no overall control. Its hopes of seizing control of Wandsworth and Westminster proved unfounded while the party lost ground in Hillingdon. Labour's projected national vote share - at 35% - is its best such performance since 2012 and puts it neck and neck with the Conservatives - but in 2013, 2014 and 2016 it was estimated to be narrowly ahead of the Tories. Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party's win in Plymouth was a ""fantastic result"" and ""a sign that Labour is back in this part of Britain"". Of the party's performance more widely, he said ""obviously I'm disappointed at any places where we lost a bit of ground"" but described it as a ""solid set of results"" which left the party ""well placed to fight and win the next general election"". Deputy leader Tom Watson said Labour now had more councillors in London than at any time since the 1970s. Shadow Local Government Secretary Andrew Gwynne said he believed the anti-Semitism row had had an impact on the result in Barnet, north London, which the Tories took back from no overall control. Backbencher Jess Phillips said the party had to look at what had gone wrong in white working class areas in northern England while Chuka Umunna called for an election ""post-mortem"" to look at why expected gains hadn't materialised. Mr Umunna said the government was ""divided and incompetent"" yet Labour had not seen ""the big win in Wandsworth or Kensington that was expected"". Victory proved sweet for the Liberal Democrats in Richmond-upon-Thames The Lib Dems have won back control of Kingston-upon-Thames, in south-west London, which they lost to the Tories four years ago, after taking neighbouring Richmond - both areas had a large majority in favour of remaining in the EU. The party has also gained control of Three Rivers, south-west Hertfordshire, which had been under no overall control and has won South Cambridgeshire from the Tories. The party also withstood a strong Conservative challenge to hold onto Sutton in south-west London - while it picked up nine seats in Kingston-upon-Hull. Professor Sir John Curtice said the party's 16% projected national vote share was an improvement on its performances between 2013 and 2015 - but well down on the 25% or so it would achieve before it entered the coalition government in 2010. Party leader Sir Vince Cable hailed the result in Richmond: ""It's certainly the beginning of the comeback of the Lib Dems. It's not going to happen overnight - Rome wasn't built in a day. ""Morale is now very high. We have demonstrated that we can win when we are focused and we can only build on that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Greens have made overall gains, including taking two seats off Labour in Sheffield, where the Labour-run council has been engulfed in a row over the felling of thousands of trees. They also took seats from the Conservatives in the London borough of Richmond-upon-Thames and added two new councillors in Trafford and one in Worcester. Greens co-leader Caroline Lucas told the BBC: ""I think the Greens have had a really good night and... even with a fraction of the resources, a fraction of the media time when people see Greens on the ground they like what they see and they elect more Greens. And that's what we are seeing from Richmond to Greater Manchester to the Midlands. We've had some great results."" But she acknowledged she was ""incredibly disappointed"" to lose five of the Greens' 10 seats on Norwich Council, blaming a ""bit of a Corbyn surge"" among younger voters.     The Eurosceptic party has, as predicted, haemorrhaged support, losing nearly all of the council seats it won in 2014, when it broke through into local government for the first time. It put up candidates in only 540 seats compared with 2,193 in 2014, lost all ten seats it contested in Basildon, five in Thurrock and seven in Dudley. So far they have lost more than 100 seats and won two - including unseating Labour's council leader in Derby. Former deputy chair Suzanne Evans said the fact it had taken two seats in Derby was a sign it could still ""put the cat among the pigeons"". Meanwhile its general secretary, Paul Oakley, compared UKIP to the Black Death and said the party ""not all over at all"". ""Think of the Black Death in the Middle Ages. It comes along and it causes disruption and then it goes dormant, and that's exactly what we are going to do. Our time isn't finished because Brexit is being betrayed.""

Read Laura's blog This video can not be played Professor Sir John Curtice on three things we learnt from the local election results Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice said the Tories were performing relatively well in areas with a substantial Leave vote in the 2016 referendum, where they are picking up votes from UKIP, which did not stand candidates in many areas, while Labour were performing better in places where the Remain vote was stronger and with a higher proportion of younger voters. In addition to the council polls, there have been a series of mayoral elections in London boroughs. Labour mayors were elected in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham and Tower Hamlets - while in Watford, the Lib Dem candidate was elected.

"The Argentine peso is still sliding in value Argentina's central bank has raised interest rates for the third time in eight days as the country's currency, the peso, continues to fall sharply. On Friday, the bank hiked rates to 40% from 33.25%, a day after they were raised from 30.25%. A week ago, they were raised from 27.25%. The rises are aimed at supporting the peso, which has lost a quarter of its value over the past year. Analysts say the crisis is escalating and looks set to continue. Argentina is in the middle of a pro-market economic reform programme under President Mauricio Macri, who is seeking to reverse years of protectionism and high government spending under his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Inflation, a perennial problem in Argentina, was at 25% in 2017, the highest rate in Latin America except for Venezuela. This year, the central bank has set an inflation target of 15% and has said it will continue to act to enforce it. Despite the twin rate rises, the peso, which was fixed by law at parity with the US dollar before Argentina's economic meltdown in 2001-02, is now trading at about 22 to the dollar. ""This crisis looks set to continue unless the government steps in to reassure investors that it will take more aggressive steps to fix Argentina's economic vulnerabilities,"" said Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at Capital Economics. ""Risks to the peso have been brewing for a while - large twin budget and current account deficits, a heavy dollar debt burden, entrenched high inflation and an overvalued currency. ""The real surprise is how quickly and suddenly things seem to be escalating."" Mr Glossop said ""a sizeable fiscal tightening"" was planned for 2018, but it might now need to be larger and prompter. ""Unless or until that happens, the peso is likely to remain under pressure, and there remains a real risk of a messy economic adjustment."" Argentina's president Mauricio Macri is a controversial figure in a country that is still strongly divided ideologically. But among international investors he is unanimously praised. Since coming to office, he moved swiftly to end capital controls and re-establish trust in economic data coming from Argentina. However, he is not winning a crucial battle in the country - the one against inflation. Markets are taking notice and there has been a sell-off of the peso. The opposition wants to stop Macri from removing subsidies in controlled prices, such as energy and utility tariffs, which may bring more inflation in the short term but could help bring it down from above 20% now to about 5% by 2020. Friday was a day for emergency measures - a massive hike to 40% in interest rates and a commitment to bring down government spending. Investors still believe Macri has a sound plan to recover Argentina, but they are not convinced he can see it through.

"This video can not be played Who were the real Peaky Blinders? Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight has revealed plans for a ballet version of the hit Birmingham gangster TV show. The Oscar-nominated screenwriter said the Rambert dance company had approached him with plans for a ballet based on the Shelby crime family. Knight also told the Birmingham Press Club he is planning three more series of the drama and is lobbying the BBC to film more of the show in his home city. The last series wasthe most popular instalment of the BBC Two drama yet. Knight, who is currently writing season five, said: ""We are definitely doing [series] six and we will probably do seven. After series four it went mad. ""We've talked to [lead actor] Cillian Murphy and he's all for it, and the rest of the principal cast are in for it."" He revealed talks over a dance version of the show, saying: ""I had a meeting with Ballet Rambert who want to do Peaky Blinders - The Ballet. I'm saying 'why not?'"" Steven Knight attended the premier of the third series in Birmingham with the show's stars Cillian Murphy and Packy Lee in 2016 Knight said he was keen to use the show's success to promote Birmingham and wants more filming to take place in the city. Previous episodes have been filmed elsewhere, with the Black Country Living Museum one of the only locations close to Birmingham. ""I'm trying to get series five shot here and trying to get as many Birmingham actors as I can in,"" he said. ""It's always bothered me that Birmingham didn't have that profile. It's a big city and it wasn't shouting about it. ""I'm sort of an evangelist for the city, so that was part of wanting to do it.""

"Harvey Proctor was a Conservative MP between 1979 and 1987 A former MP is claiming Â£1m in damages from the Metropolitan Police after being falsely accused of child sexual abuse and murder. Harvey Proctor is also taking legal action against his accuser - a man known by the pseudonym ""Nick"". Mr Proctor says the allegations and subsequent investigation by the Met resulted in him losing his job and home, and suffering from depression. Scotland Yard said it would be defending the claim. The investigation, known as Operation Midland, began in 2014 when Nick named Mr Proctor as one of a number of men who he claimed were part of an establishment paedophile ring in the 1970s and 1980s. The former MP was cleared in 2016 when the Met said it had found insufficient evidence to consider any criminal charges.  Scotland Yard apologised and a review of the case strongly criticised the investigation. Mr Proctor's claim - filed at the High Court and seen by the BBC - identifies the Met Police Commissioner and Nick as the two defendants. Mr Proctor's legal claim says that Nick's allegations were ""false and malicious"" and designed to damage him in an attempt to pervert the course of justice. He claims police could have carried out ""elementary research"" to dismiss them before taking any action that would have resulted in him being affected. He is accusing the Met of conspiring with Nick and a news agency, Exaro, which first published the allegations and facilitated a meeting with detectives. Mr Proctor's claim highlights the statement by a senior police officer in late 2014 that Nick's claims were ""credible and true"". He also says a police application for a warrant to search his home in Leicestershire amounted to an attempt to pervert the course of justice because it relied on Nick's allegations. His legal claim details how police raised ""child protection concerns"" about him during the investigation and asked his employer - Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire - to suspend him. He ended being forced to resign and lost his home, which was part of his employment at the castle. Mr Proctor is also claiming his privacy was breached. Since the investigation he has suffered what his doctor describes in the claim as a ""major depressive episode"". Operation Midland began in 2014 after Nick claimed boys had been sexually abused and that three had been murdered by a group of powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies. Retired judge Sir Richard Henriques later reviewed the investigation and identified 43 serious failings in his report, including that Nick had been believed for too long and that search warrants had been applied for with flawed information. Northumbria Police has carried out an criminal investigation into Nick's actions and the CPS is currently considering the evidence. Nick is separately facing a trial in connection with six charges of possessing images of child abuse and voyeurism. The Metropolitan Police has already paid damages to Lord Bramall, the former chief of the defence staff, and the family of Lord Brittan, both of whom were also accused by Nick and investigated.

"All results from 150 English council elections are in In mixed results for the main parties, Labour gains Plymouth, while the Conservatives take Peterborough and Basildon, and the Lib Dems won control of four councils Trafford, Derby and Nuneaton & Bedworth move to no overall control Labour seals its best result in London since 1971 But the Conservatives saw off Labour challenges in the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Westminster Sinn Fein holds West Tyrone in a parliamentary by-election With the last of the results coming in this morning, it's time for a quick recap:  Read more about theresults here. Analysis suggests the two main parties were neck and neck overall in terms of national vote share - on 35% each. Labour called the results solid but leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""disappointed at places where we lost a bit of ground"". The BBC's Chris Mason said the overriding sentiment among Conservatives was one of relief. The Lib Dems gained four councils while UKIP saw its vote collapse. The annual conference of Progress, a centre-left pressure group, is under way in central London. In her opening speech, chair Alison McGovern says the group was shfting Labour's policy on Brexit. ""Last year our policy was to leave the customs union, now it is to stay in the customs union,"" she tells delegates. She goes on to say immigration has made families and the country strong, and ""we will never be embarrassed to say so"". ""We must stand against those who demonise immigrants,"" she adds. Alastair Campell, Tony Blair's director of communications, and Liz Kendall, a former Labour leadership contender, are to speak at the event.

Catch up here with our video of the winners and the losers. This video can not be played Election night's big results Labour has failed to take target councils in London, while the Conservatives have lost control of two councils. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 Richard Burgon, Labour's shadow justice secretary, denies the results were bad. ""They were solid results,"" he says, pointing out that his party got more seats than in the 2014 elections. But he acknowledges they could have been better and the party needs to ""get a grip"" on the problem of anti-Semitism. He denies that leader Jeremy Corbyn's response to Syria and the poisoning of the Russian spy in Salisbury were issues on the doorstep for traditional Labour voters. He says in his experience of doorknocking in these elections, it was ""very rare"" for the public to raise Mr Corbyn's leadership in a negative way. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former communications director, is not impressed with Labour's results. ""What planet are they on? These are bad results. ""You do not get into a winning position by being in denial,"" he tells the Today programme. The current government is the ""worst in living memory"", showing ""serial incompetence day after day"", he says, yet the public don't seem remotely interested in supporting Labour. ""We're mid-term in the middle of disastrous Brexit negotiations. We should be destroying this Tory party. ""Brexit is a fog that is clouding the entirety of our politics. Both main parties are ducking the big questions,"" he says. He wants to see Labour come out and lead on Brexit. Asked if he thinks Mr Corbyn should stand down, he replies: ""I'm not saying that."" Jeremy Corbyn says Labour have built on the ""historic gains"" made at the last general election. In a thank you video to party members and supporters, the party leader says Labour won Plymouth and Kirklees, increased the number of councillors across England and made progress in the places it needs to win the next general election. Labour has had its best results in London since 1971, he adds, and missed out on winning the flagship Conservative London borough of Wandsworth ""by a whisker"". He concludes by saying Labour is well-placed to fight and win the next general election. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 BBC political reporter Tom Barton says neither Labour nor the Conservatives would be dancing in the aisles nor particularly despondent after the results from Thursday. He says while the elections were only held in parts of England, some conclusions could be drawn with the BBC's projected national share of the vote. That has both parties neck and neck on 35%. Not much, it seems, has moved since last year's general election, he adds. The fallout from the elections dominates the headlines in Saturday's papers. The i  focuses on the downfall of UKIP, which lost more than 100 council seats  - with the Conservatives swallowing up many of their votes in pro-Brexit areas. Theresa May has ""survived the biggest test of public opinion since the general election"", it adds. It also declares ""everyone's a winner"", citing Labour's solid - if unspectacular - gains. The Guardian writes there are ""big lessons and implications"" for Labour. It asks whether the party should now reconsider its ""strategic ambiguity"" over leaving the European Union. The Times also suggests a rethink - questioning the methods of the group Momentum. It points out that the party's solitary council gain was in Plymouth where the group was not involved. It also asks whether the party's focus on urban voters under the age of 45 is misplaced. Read the full paper reviewhere. With all councils now declared, the results are:  More aboutthe results here Counting is finally finished in Tower Hamlets: Still waiting on results for several Tower Hamlets wards - 27 of 45 seats have been declared so far. We already know Labour has control of the council. Labour has gained control of Tower Hamlets council from no overall control
after winning 23 of the 45 seats. Some wards are still to declare. Dan Jarvis has been MP for Barnsley Central since 2011 Dan Jarvis, the Labour MP who has been elected the first mayor of the Sheffield City Region, said there is a ""conversation to be had"" about the future of Yorkshire devolution. Among the ex-soldier's first jobs will be to help the leaders of Sheffield, Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham councils agree a deal on the issue. A deal struck in 2015 with the then chancellor George Osborne paved the way for the region to take control of power over transport, strategic planning and skills and receive Â£900m over 30 years. But the leaders of Barnsley and Doncaster councils have refused to agree to the proposal and have thrown their weight, together with Mr Jarvis, into securing a devolution deal for the whole of Yorkshire.  It looks like Tower Hamlets may not be declaring any time soon. There is already a recount underway for Canary Wharf ward, which was too close to call. And there could be a possible recount in Island Gardens, the council said. The leader of the Green Party in Worcester tweeted that he's ""a little dizzy"" after the party took its highest ever total of councillors with three. The last council to declare is Tower Hamlets. The results are coming through - but for many at the count, tiredness is beginning to set in. Caroline Lucas says her party defied expectations in a ""David and Goliath"" battle against big parties.

"This video can not be played The Kilauea volcano erupted after a series of earthquakes on the island Kilauea volcano has erupted near a residential area on Hawaii's largest island, prompting a local state of emergency and the mandatory evacuation of 1,700 residents. Streams of lava have been seen running through woods and bubbling on to roads. Extreme levels of dangerous sulphur dioxide gas have been detected in the area, the Civil Defense Agency said. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes and the eruption follows a series of recent earthquakes. ""It sounds like a jet engine,"" resident Ikaika Marzo told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. ""It's going hard."" Community centres have been opened to provide shelter for evacuees. Talmadge Mango, the civil defence administrator for Hawaii County, said that power lines had melted off their poles in one area. ""Seismic activity is still extremely high, so we feel that this might just be the beginning of things,"" he said. The volcano's plume of smoke and ash is visible from a great distance Officials had been warning residents all week they should be prepared to evacuate as an eruption would give little warning. A volcanic crater vent - known as Puu Oo - collapsed earlier this week, sending lava down the mountain's slopes towards populated areas. Local resident Stephen Clapper said he had told his mother to pack a bag ""just in case"", and they wasted no time getting in the car to drive to safety after the eruption. ""My neighbour came running over and said, 'What's that awful noise?'"" Mr Clapper told local channel Khon TV. ""He said he had never heard a noise like it, and he's been here for 40 years."" Hawaii's Governor, David Ige, says he has activated military reservists from the National Guard to help evacuate thousands of people. Allow Twitter content?

You could hear and feel the eruption a good half a mile away, and the closer you got, the more you could feel it. It was like when someone plays the bass really heavy, and you can feel the bass - you could really feel the power and the lava - the colour was unbelievable, and the sound was unbelievable. It sounds very explosive... It's spitting out as hard as it can. It's not so much what you hear, it's what you feel. One resident says: I'm not leaving Close-up footage shot by a drone showed lava emerging from a fissure in a wooded residential neighbourhood and oozing down a road.

"This video can not be played Lava flows are continuing from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii A number of strong earthquakes have hit Hawaii's Big Island, a day after the eruption of the Kilauea volcano. One 6.9 magnitude quake, south-east of the volcano, was the most powerful to hit the US state since 1975. It briefly cut power and sent people fleeing from buildings but there was no tsunami warning. Meanwhile, several fresh eruptions spewed fountains of lava 30m (100ft), destroying several homes and leaving fissures on three streets. The Civil Defense Agency told any remaining residents to evacuate. It said there were deadly levels of dangerous sulphur dioxide gas in the air and emergency crews would not be able to help anyone affected. The new volcanic activity in Mt Kilauea's lower east rift zone amounted to ""vigorous lava spattering"", the US Geological Survey (USGS) said, adding that additional outbreaks in the area were likely. The USGS said ""vigorous lava spattering"" was happening The lava was not travelling more than a ""few tens of yards"" from the vents, which were on streets in the Leilani Estates neighbourhood near Big Island's eastern tip, the USGS said. However, ground deformation was continuing and there was high earthquake activity in the area, it said. Meanwhile, the level of the lava lake inside the volcano was continuing to drop. Two homes were destroyed in the latest activity, ABC quoted Hawaii island Mayor Harry Kim as saying. Maija Stenback, an eyewitness, told the BBC the eruption ""was like when someone plays the bass really heavy: you could really feel the power and the lava"". ""The colour was unbelievable, and the sound was unbelievable,"" she said. ""You could hear and feel the eruption a good half a mile away, and the closer you got, the more you could feel it."" Residents described fleeing their homes on Thursday evening. ""My family is safe, the rest of the stuff can be replaced. When I bought here 14 years [ago], I knew that this day would eventually come. Butthe reality is sinking in now,external,"" one resident told Hawaii News Now. A spokesperson for Hawaii's Mayor, Janet Snyder, said ""elevated levels"" of sulphur dioxide were stopping people returning to evacuated areas. ""It is quite toxic and in fact, even our first responders find it too hazardous at this time to go back into the sub-divisions without heavy, protective equipment,"" she said. Steaming cracks appeared moments before a fissure opened early on Friday morning Thursday's eruption prompted a local state of emergency and the mandatory evacuation of 1,700 residents. Community centres have been opened to provide shelter for evacuees. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes and the eruption follows a series of recent earthquakes. Officials had been warning residents all week they should be prepared to evacuate as an eruption would give little warning. A volcanic crater vent - known as Puu Oo - collapsed earlier this week, sending lava down the mountain's slopes towards populated areas. Dr Dougal Jerram, an earth scientist at the University of Oslo, told the BBC that the quake had ""occurred in the middle of a housing estate effectively, erupting through the roads, with magma shooting 30 metres up into the sky"". Hawaii's Governor, David Ige, said he had activated military reservists from the National Guard to help evacuate thousands of people. Allow Twitter content?

"The Argentine peso is still sliding in value Argentina's central bank has raised interest rates for the third time in eight days as the country's currency, the peso, continues to fall sharply. On Friday, the bank hiked rates to 40% from 33.25%, a day after they were raised from 30.25%. A week ago, they were raised from 27.25%. The rises are aimed at supporting the peso, which has lost a quarter of its value over the past year. Analysts say the crisis is escalating and looks set to continue. Argentina is in the middle of a pro-market economic reform programme under President Mauricio Macri, who is seeking to reverse years of protectionism and high government spending under his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Inflation, a perennial problem in Argentina, was at 25% in 2017, the highest rate in Latin America except for Venezuela. This year, the central bank has set an inflation target of 15% and has said it will continue to act to enforce it. Despite the twin rate rises, the peso, which was fixed by law at parity with the US dollar before Argentina's economic meltdown in 2001-02, is now trading at about 22 to the dollar. ""This crisis looks set to continue unless the government steps in to reassure investors that it will take more aggressive steps to fix Argentina's economic vulnerabilities,"" said Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at Capital Economics. ""Risks to the peso have been brewing for a while - large twin budget and current account deficits, a heavy dollar debt burden, entrenched high inflation and an overvalued currency. ""The real surprise is how quickly and suddenly things seem to be escalating."" Mr Glossop said ""a sizeable fiscal tightening"" was planned for 2018, but it might now need to be larger and prompter. ""Unless or until that happens, the peso is likely to remain under pressure, and there remains a real risk of a messy economic adjustment."" Argentina's president Mauricio Macri is a controversial figure in a country that is still strongly divided ideologically. But among international investors he is unanimously praised. Since coming to office, he moved swiftly to end capital controls and re-establish trust in economic data coming from Argentina. However, he is not winning a crucial battle in the country - the one against inflation. Markets are taking notice and there has been a sell-off of the peso. The opposition wants to stop Macri from removing subsidies in controlled prices, such as energy and utility tariffs, which may bring more inflation in the short term but could help bring it down from above 20% now to about 5% by 2020. Friday was a day for emergency measures - a massive hike to 40% in interest rates and a commitment to bring down government spending. Investors still believe Macri has a sound plan to recover Argentina, but they are not convinced he can see it through.

"This video can not be played ""I will never forgive them for what's happened"" A mother whose son died after not being given a life-saving blood test says she will ""never forgive"" the hospital. Callum Cartlidge, aged eight, died after suffering a cardiac arrest at home in Redditch, Worcestershire, on 3 March 2017. A coroner has said not giving a blood test to Callum, who had an undiagnosed rare illness, was ""a failure to provide basic medical care"". The coroner said death would have been prevented if a blood test was done. Midlands Live: Labour lose Nuneaton to no overall control; Lorry spills load of yeast Callum, who has a twin brother, was discharged from Worcestershire Royal Hospital the day before his death with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis. He had been suffering an Addisonian crisis, linked to undiagnosedAddison's disease,external. Callum's mother, Stacey Cartlidge, said: ""They didn't listen to me when I did ask them for a blood test. ""They kept saying he wasn't at the stage to have a blood test. ""So what stage would he have to be at to have a blood test? ""I will never forgive them for what's happened, never. ""My son's not here and if he'd had a blood test he would have survived."" Callum Cartlidge fell ill at his home in Redditch and was taken to Worcestershire Royal Hospital but later died A medical experttold the inquest the test would have identifiedCallum's rare disease. Recording a narrative verdict, Worcestershire assistant coroner David Reid said while not carrying out the blood test was a ""serious failing"", it was not a gross failing and he could not record a verdict of neglect. Callum, who was described as usually a ""cheeky chappie"" was described as ""lethargic and yellow"" and regularly off school in the months before his death. During the five-day hearing, the court was told how Callum had a 23-minute ambulance journey to Worcester hospital the day he died, rather than to the Alexandra Hospital, three minutes away, which stopped admitting children to A&E in 2016. However, Mr Reid -who heard evidence from a paediatric emergency consultant- said he did not think it had been a factor in the boy's death. Dr Andrew Short, the divisional medical director for Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, expressed its ""deepest condolences"" to the family and said despite their ""best intentions, the outcome is not what we anticipated.""

"Jamie Acourt, pictured in police custody in Spain, faces an extradition hearing One of Britain's most wanted fugitives, Jamie Acourt, has been captured in Spain on suspicion of drug offences. A Spanish police source told the BBC that the 41-year-old from south London had used false identities to evade capture for two years. Mr Acourt, who was wanted by police investigating the large-scale supply of drugs, was arrested in Barcelona on Friday. On Saturday he was remanded in custody by a Spanish high court judge. He appeared in front of the judge in Madrid via video-link from Barcelona. A former suspect inStephen Lawrence's murder in 1993, Mr Acourt has always denied any involvement in the killing. Armed officers detained Mr Acourt after he left the Metropolitan Sagrada Familia Gym in the Spanish city on Friday afternoon. He was arrested as part of operation Captura, a joint effort by the National Crime Agency (NCA), Metropolitan Police and Spanish National Police. A senior Spanish police source told the BBC police believe Mr Acourt had taken ""great care"" and ""plenty of security measures"" to avoid getting caught. ""He had protection. He had help. He didn't live a normal, relaxing life. He was using false identities, false names,"" the source said. This video can not be played Jamie Acourt was led away in handcuffs from a gym in Barcelona, witness Simon McDonald told the BBC's Tom Burridge Police believe Mr Acourt was using four or five different branches of the Metropolitan chain of gyms in Barcelona. The BBC understands from a source at the gym that he had been a member at the one near the Sagrada Familia cathedral for ""a long time"" and he was seen there on a regular basis. Police said he was moving around Spain and spending time in ""places where a tourist could disappear"". Recently, police believe he had been living in Barcelona. The investigation to find him took years and was a close collaboration between Spanish National Police and the NCA. When arrested he told police he was an Italian tourist, according to the source. Jamie Acourt at the 1998 public inquiry into the killing of Stephen Lawrence Mr Acourt was last seen in the UK on 1 February 2016, in the Eltham area and was known to visit south-west London and areas of Surrey. A spokesman for the Met said: ""The European Arrest Warrant was issued as part of the Met's efforts to trace Mr Acourt in relation to an investigation into the unlawful supply of controlled substances. ""This relates to an investigation launched in 2016 by detectives from the Serious and Organised Crime Command. ""Extradition proceedings now await."" Steve Reynolds, the NCA's regional head of international operations, toldRadio 4's Today Programmethat many fugitives ""believe they can hide in plain sight"" among Spain's large British community. Mr Reynolds said Mr Acourt's extradition is likely to take ""days or weeks rather than months"". Mr Acourt will appear at court in Madrid early next week for an extradition hearing. Spanish police confirmed Mr Accourt had been refused bail by a high court judge and transferred to a prison ahead of the hearing.

"All results from 150 English council elections are in In mixed results for the main parties, Labour gains Plymouth, while the Conservatives take Peterborough and Basildon, and the Lib Dems won control of four councils Trafford, Derby and Nuneaton & Bedworth move to no overall control Labour seals its best result in London since 1971 But the Conservatives saw off Labour challenges in the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Westminster Sinn Fein holds West Tyrone in a parliamentary by-election With the last of the results coming in this morning, it's time for a quick recap:  Read more about theresults here. Analysis suggests the two main parties were neck and neck overall in terms of national vote share - on 35% each. Labour called the results solid but leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""disappointed at places where we lost a bit of ground"". The BBC's Chris Mason said the overriding sentiment among Conservatives was one of relief. The Lib Dems gained four councils while UKIP saw its vote collapse. The annual conference of Progress, a centre-left pressure group, is under way in central London. In her opening speech, chair Alison McGovern says the group was shfting Labour's policy on Brexit. ""Last year our policy was to leave the customs union, now it is to stay in the customs union,"" she tells delegates. She goes on to say immigration has made families and the country strong, and ""we will never be embarrassed to say so"". ""We must stand against those who demonise immigrants,"" she adds. Alastair Campell, Tony Blair's director of communications, and Liz Kendall, a former Labour leadership contender, are to speak at the event.

Catch up here with our video of the winners and the losers. This video can not be played Election night's big results Labour has failed to take target councils in London, while the Conservatives have lost control of two councils. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 Richard Burgon, Labour's shadow justice secretary, denies the results were bad. ""They were solid results,"" he says, pointing out that his party got more seats than in the 2014 elections. But he acknowledges they could have been better and the party needs to ""get a grip"" on the problem of anti-Semitism. He denies that leader Jeremy Corbyn's response to Syria and the poisoning of the Russian spy in Salisbury were issues on the doorstep for traditional Labour voters. He says in his experience of doorknocking in these elections, it was ""very rare"" for the public to raise Mr Corbyn's leadership in a negative way. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former communications director, is not impressed with Labour's results. ""What planet are they on? These are bad results. ""You do not get into a winning position by being in denial,"" he tells the Today programme. The current government is the ""worst in living memory"", showing ""serial incompetence day after day"", he says, yet the public don't seem remotely interested in supporting Labour. ""We're mid-term in the middle of disastrous Brexit negotiations. We should be destroying this Tory party. ""Brexit is a fog that is clouding the entirety of our politics. Both main parties are ducking the big questions,"" he says. He wants to see Labour come out and lead on Brexit. Asked if he thinks Mr Corbyn should stand down, he replies: ""I'm not saying that."" Jeremy Corbyn says Labour have built on the ""historic gains"" made at the last general election. In a thank you video to party members and supporters, the party leader says Labour won Plymouth and Kirklees, increased the number of councillors across England and made progress in the places it needs to win the next general election. Labour has had its best results in London since 1971, he adds, and missed out on winning the flagship Conservative London borough of Wandsworth ""by a whisker"". He concludes by saying Labour is well-placed to fight and win the next general election. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 BBC political reporter Tom Barton says neither Labour nor the Conservatives would be dancing in the aisles nor particularly despondent after the results from Thursday. He says while the elections were only held in parts of England, some conclusions could be drawn with the BBC's projected national share of the vote. That has both parties neck and neck on 35%. Not much, it seems, has moved since last year's general election, he adds. The fallout from the elections dominates the headlines in Saturday's papers. The i  focuses on the downfall of UKIP, which lost more than 100 council seats  - with the Conservatives swallowing up many of their votes in pro-Brexit areas. Theresa May has ""survived the biggest test of public opinion since the general election"", it adds. It also declares ""everyone's a winner"", citing Labour's solid - if unspectacular - gains. The Guardian writes there are ""big lessons and implications"" for Labour. It asks whether the party should now reconsider its ""strategic ambiguity"" over leaving the European Union. The Times also suggests a rethink - questioning the methods of the group Momentum. It points out that the party's solitary council gain was in Plymouth where the group was not involved. It also asks whether the party's focus on urban voters under the age of 45 is misplaced. Read the full paper reviewhere. With all councils now declared, the results are:  More aboutthe results here Counting is finally finished in Tower Hamlets: Still waiting on results for several Tower Hamlets wards - 27 of 45 seats have been declared so far. We already know Labour has control of the council. Labour has gained control of Tower Hamlets council from no overall control
after winning 23 of the 45 seats. Some wards are still to declare. Dan Jarvis has been MP for Barnsley Central since 2011 Dan Jarvis, the Labour MP who has been elected the first mayor of the Sheffield City Region, said there is a ""conversation to be had"" about the future of Yorkshire devolution. Among the ex-soldier's first jobs will be to help the leaders of Sheffield, Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham councils agree a deal on the issue. A deal struck in 2015 with the then chancellor George Osborne paved the way for the region to take control of power over transport, strategic planning and skills and receive Â£900m over 30 years. But the leaders of Barnsley and Doncaster councils have refused to agree to the proposal and have thrown their weight, together with Mr Jarvis, into securing a devolution deal for the whole of Yorkshire.  It looks like Tower Hamlets may not be declaring any time soon. There is already a recount underway for Canary Wharf ward, which was too close to call. And there could be a possible recount in Island Gardens, the council said. The leader of the Green Party in Worcester tweeted that he's ""a little dizzy"" after the party took its highest ever total of councillors with three. The last council to declare is Tower Hamlets. The results are coming through - but for many at the count, tiredness is beginning to set in. Caroline Lucas says her party defied expectations in a ""David and Goliath"" battle against big parties.

Based on the results, the gap in predicted national vote share between the Conservatives and Labour has closed since the council elections last year. The fortunes of the main parties were different inside and outside London. Labour made gains in the capital picking up 65 councillors, while the Conservatives lost 90 seats. In the rest of England excluding London, the Tories gained 57 seats, while Labour took an additional 12. The Lib Dems and the Greens both gained more council seats in London than in the rest of England. Labour have takenPlymouthfrom the Conservatives and gained control ofKirkleesandTower Hamlets. However, in the north they lost overall control ofNuneaton and Bedworth, andDerby, while also losing some seats in strongholds likeWiganandSheffield. In London, Labour gained multiple seats inWandsworthandWestminster, as the map below shows - but these gains were not enough to take control of each borough.  The Conservatives gained control ofBasildonandPeterboroughcouncils thanks to the collapse in UKIP support, and won some seats inWakefieldandLeeds, traditional Labour areas. In London, the Tories gained seats inHillingdon- which some had touted as a potential Labour target - and won nine more seats inSutton, despite the area remaining in Lib Dem control. However, they lost control ofTrafford,Plymouth,KingstonandRichmond- where they lost 28 seats in total.  The Liberal Democrats won control ofRichmond-upon-Thames, gaining 24 seats in the process in one of the biggest swings of the night. The party also tookThree Rivers,KingstonandSouth Cambridgeshire.

"They seem stuck with each other - so close, in fact, that ourprojected national share of the votefrom the results would mean that, in a hypothetical general election tomorrow, the two main Westminster parties would receive exactly the same levels of public support. For reasons we've discussed at length overnight and in recent days, we have to be careful about directly transposing what happened on Thursday into a theoretical nationwide election. But while in one sense not very much happened in the local election - not very many councils and seats changed hands and neither of the main parties have (with a couple of hours to go) made dramatic strides - something important did happen. Leaders upbeat despite lack of big gains Local election results 2018 - live The results in maps Voters opted again for roughly the status quo, underlining the trends that we saw developing at the general election as the political parties grappled with a new landscape after the referendum. Labour piled up support in big urban areas, but struggled to show advances in towns or areas where there used to be big industries, which are often - inconveniently for them - the kinds of places that have Westminster constituencies that swing the election. And notably, in part due to the grim row over anti-Semitism not being tackled in the Labour Party quickly enough, Labour did not make the kinds of additional gains in London boroughs they had suggested, even though in some of those critical parts of the metropolis, they ran the Tories extremely close. Almost in a mirror image, the Tories have struggled to get voters in big cities on side, even though, as above, they held back what would have been totemic losses in London. But they nibbled away in some of those kinds of places where Labour lost some of their appeal. Just as at the general election, we saw that outside London the Conservatives inched forward, and inside London, Labour took some small steps. There were of course many other interesting results, and you can read about them here. However, broadly speaking, both of the main Westminster parties maintained their comfort zone, but showed little evidence of pushing out of it. At this stage of the electoral cycle, that is a significant problem for the Labour Party. To demonstrate to the public, and to their own foot soldiers, they are banging on the door of No 10, they were eager to show more striking advances that did not come to pass. Some of their own MPs have been candid enough to admit that, in the last few hours, and to confront the geographical divide in their vote. But for the Tories too, there is a sense of relief, rather than a feeling of hope. They held off challenges more effectively than they expected to, but again, they showed little sign of having much to offer to voters in what's alien territory for them. Just as in June last year, we saw broadly Tory v Labour, Towns v Cities, Young v Old, and Leave v Remain. Of course it's not as simple as that. The Lib Dems had a better night than expected and UKIP pretty much disappeared. But the fault lines which the Referendum exposed are deeper still. And here is the conundrum for Labour and the Tories - they both are perhaps digging deeper into their holes. For the Tories, in the traditional context, this can fairly be described as a pretty decent performance after eight years in government, which traditionally see parties get hammered as voters get fed up with them over the years. It would be perfectly easy for them therefore to say, move on, nothing to see here, let's carry on as we are, not least because the Tories are divided, and have faced drama after drama. But there's caution too. One senior Conservative warns that in London Councils they held on ""in spite of the Westminster government and not because of it"". They added: ""The big risk is that the national party kicks the reform can down the road because we are trundling along. Just because the wheels didn't fall off, doesn't mean the early warning lights aren't flashing faster than ever."" For Labour, the results don't suggest confident strides towards Number 10, but neither are they so bad that the party is likely to re-examine their approach. One shadow minister told the BBC it was ""very serious to be going backwards"" in some Midlands areas. Another said in frustration that there was ""no strategy"", but said nothing will change in their view, because ""we've got 500,000 people who think this guy walks on water"". For real majorities, rather than hung politics, parties have to achieve beyond their comfort zones. Until either of them can do that, perhaps Mr Corbyn can't truly beat Mrs May, but nor will Mrs May be able to see off Mr Corbyn.

"Jamie Acourt, pictured in police custody in Spain, faces an extradition hearing One of Britain's most wanted fugitives, Jamie Acourt, has been captured in Spain on suspicion of drug offences. A Spanish police source told the BBC that the 41-year-old from south London had used false identities to evade capture for two years. Mr Acourt, who was wanted by police investigating the large-scale supply of drugs, was arrested in Barcelona on Friday. On Saturday he was remanded in custody by a Spanish high court judge. He appeared in front of the judge in Madrid via video-link from Barcelona. A former suspect inStephen Lawrence's murder in 1993, Mr Acourt has always denied any involvement in the killing. Armed officers detained Mr Acourt after he left the Metropolitan Sagrada Familia Gym in the Spanish city on Friday afternoon. He was arrested as part of operation Captura, a joint effort by the National Crime Agency (NCA), Metropolitan Police and Spanish National Police. A senior Spanish police source told the BBC police believe Mr Acourt had taken ""great care"" and ""plenty of security measures"" to avoid getting caught. ""He had protection. He had help. He didn't live a normal, relaxing life. He was using false identities, false names,"" the source said. This video can not be played Jamie Acourt was led away in handcuffs from a gym in Barcelona, witness Simon McDonald told the BBC's Tom Burridge Police believe Mr Acourt was using four or five different branches of the Metropolitan chain of gyms in Barcelona. The BBC understands from a source at the gym that he had been a member at the one near the Sagrada Familia cathedral for ""a long time"" and he was seen there on a regular basis. Police said he was moving around Spain and spending time in ""places where a tourist could disappear"". Recently, police believe he had been living in Barcelona. The investigation to find him took years and was a close collaboration between Spanish National Police and the NCA. When arrested he told police he was an Italian tourist, according to the source. Jamie Acourt at the 1998 public inquiry into the killing of Stephen Lawrence Mr Acourt was last seen in the UK on 1 February 2016, in the Eltham area and was known to visit south-west London and areas of Surrey. A spokesman for the Met said: ""The European Arrest Warrant was issued as part of the Met's efforts to trace Mr Acourt in relation to an investigation into the unlawful supply of controlled substances. ""This relates to an investigation launched in 2016 by detectives from the Serious and Organised Crime Command. ""Extradition proceedings now await."" Steve Reynolds, the NCA's regional head of international operations, toldRadio 4's Today Programmethat many fugitives ""believe they can hide in plain sight"" among Spain's large British community. Mr Reynolds said Mr Acourt's extradition is likely to take ""days or weeks rather than months"". Mr Acourt will appear at court in Madrid early next week for an extradition hearing. Spanish police confirmed Mr Accourt had been refused bail by a high court judge and transferred to a prison ahead of the hearing.

"North Korea has changed time zone to match the South after last week's inter-Korean summit, according to state media. At 23:30 local time (15:00 GMT) on Friday the country's clocks moved forward 30 minutes to midnight. The reset is ""the first practical step"" to speed up Korean unification, the official KCNA news agency said. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump says he has a date for his meeting with the North's leader, Kim Jong-Un. ""We now have a date and we have a location, we'll be announcing it soon,"" Mr Trump told US journalists outside the White House on Friday, adding that he was expecting ""very, very good things"" to come out of it. Mr Trump will host South Korea's president Moon Jae-in at the White House on 22 May to discuss the upcoming meeting. This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea Until now, it was on Pyongyang Time, which is half an hour behind South Korea and Japan. It introduced the extra 30 minutes in 2015 as a stand against ""wicked Japanese imperialists"", because its hours were changed to match Tokyo's when the Korean peninsula was under Japan's rule. South Korea (which is nine hours ahead of GMT) had also moved away from Japanese time in the 1950s but it switched back again in the 1960s. Two clocks - showing the time in North and South Korea - sit side by side in Panmunjom, the town in the so-called Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) where the two countries' leaders recently met. After the talks, South Korea's presidency sent a tweet sayingMr Kim was distressed by seeing the clocks,external. South Korea takes down propaganda speakers President Trump did not share details on the time and place for the landmark meeting with Mr Kim. It is expected to happen in May or early June. Mr Trump has previously expressed a preference for meeting in the demilitarized zone between the North and South but Singapore is also an option. The meeting was suggested and provisionally agreed in March, after a South Korean delegation met Mr Kim in Pyongyang and later visited the White House. America's main goal is to secure the North's nuclear disarmament. Discussions are already believed to be under way to secure the release of three US hostages held in North Korea before the two leaders come face to face. Trump accepts 'milestone' meeting with Kim Who are the US hostages in N Korea? North Korea-Trump talks in 400 words ""We're having very substantive talks with North Korea and a lot of things have already happened with respect to the hostages,"" said Mr Trump on Friday. He denied suggestions that he was considering taking US troops out of South Korea as part of the negotiations. In 2007, Venezuela's former leader Hugo ChÃ¡vez turned the clocks back by half an hour, saying it would allow more people to wake up in daylight. However, many believed he mostly wanted to distance himself from the time zone of his arch-enemy, the US. In 2016,his successor, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, returned to the previous system, four hours behind GMT, hoping daylight in the evening would reduce energy demands amid a growing economic crisis. In 2011,Samoa and Tokelau skipped an entire day- and jumped westwards across the international dateline - to align with trade partners. Canada's Newfoundland province is officially half-an-hour out of step with other Atlantic provinces. India is half-an-hour ahead of Pakistan and a mere 15 minutes behind Nepal. Western Australia and South Australia observe a 90-minute time difference across the state boundary. However, the remote border town of Eucla and the surrounding area, home to a few hundred people, unofficially operate on their own time zone, 45 minutes ahead of Western Australia and 45 minutes behind South Australia.

His comments came in a speech to the National Rifle Association (NRA), in which he defended US gun laws. He also told the firearms lobby's conference in Dallas, Texas, that American gun rights were ""under siege"". Mr Trump is due to visit the UK this summer, after previously cancelling a trip amid calls for mass protests. ""I recently read a story that in London, which has unbelievably tough gun laws, a once very prestigious hospital right in the middle is like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds,"" he said on Friday. ""They don't have guns. They have knives and instead there's blood all over the floors of this hospital. ""They say it's as bad as a military war zone hospital. Knives, knives, knives, knives.""

"This video can not be played Trump on Giuliani: 'He'll get his facts straight' US President Donald Trump has said his new lawyer will ""get his facts straight"" about a legal case involving claims of an affair with a porn star. Rudy Giuliani this week contradicted Mr Trump's statements distancing himself from hush money that was paid to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. At the White House, Mr Trump said Mr Giuliani was new to the job and ""wasn't familiar with everything"". He did not specify what he thought his new attorney had got wrong. The conflicting statements in the Stormy Daniels saga Stormy Daniels sues Trump over 'defamatory' tweet Mr Giuliani later released a statement ""intended to clarify"" his remarks. As he left the White House on Friday, Mr Trump told reporters when asked about his new attorney: ""He started yesterday. He'll get his facts straight."" Before boarding Air Force One, he told reporters that Mr Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, is ""a special guy"". ""I will tell you this, when Rudy made the statement, Rudy's great, but Rudy had just started, and he wasn't totally familiar with everything,"" the Republican president added. This video can not be played On 5 April Donald Trump said ""I don't know"" about a payment to Stormy Daniels Pressed on his shifting statements regarding the payment to Ms Daniels, Mr Trump said: ""We're not changing any stories."" He then flew off to the National Rifle Association annual meeting in Dallas, Texas, where he and Vice-President Mike Pence are speaking. In Mr Giuliani's subsequent statement on Friday, he said: ""The payment was made to resolve a personal and false allegation in order to protect the President's family. ""It would have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not."" He added: ""My references to timing were not describing my understanding of the President's knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters."" The president and the porn star: Why this matters The big question at heart of Stormy Daniels saga In a blitz of media interviews this week, Mr Giuliani addressed the $130,000 (Â£96,000) paid to Ms Daniels under a non-disclosure agreement. The former federal prosecutor told Fox News that Mr Trump had reimbursed his other attorney, Michael Cohen, for the pay-off. Just last month, the president told reporters he had been unaware of Mr Cohen's payment to Ms Daniels, and did not know where the money came from. Stormy Daniels says she had sex with Mr Trump at a Lake Tahoe hotel in 2006 Following Mr Giuliani's remarks, Mr Trump posted several tweets on Thursday morning about the matter. The president said that Ms Daniels was not given money from election campaign funds. Mr Trump also asserted the transaction was aimed at stopping ""false and extortionist accusations"" by Ms Daniels of an affair. The payment to Ms Daniels - just before the 2016 presidential election - is a potential legal problem for the president because it could be seen as an illegal campaign contribution. This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: ""I was threatened"" In his statement on Friday, Mr Giuliani began by saying: ""There is no campaign violation."" FBI agents last month raided Mr Cohen's home and office, seizing a number of files. Mr Trump's long-standing personal attorney initially denied to reporters that any money had changed hands, but in February he admitted making the payment. Ms Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, says she had sex with Mr Trump at a Lake Tahoe hotel in 2006, a year after his marriage to Melania Trump. Michael Cohen is reportedly under criminal investigation for potential campaign finance violations, bank fraud and wire fraud Mr Giuliani has said he is the president's new chief counsel in a Department of Justice inquiry into whether Trump campaign officials colluded with Russians before the 2016 election. Meanwhile, a judge on Friday rebuked investigators of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the inquiry into Mr Trump. Lawyers for the president's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, were in a Virginia court in an attempt to dismiss charges of bank fraud brought by the special counsel. District Judge TS Ellis warned that he would not grant ""unfettered power"" to Mr Mueller in order to pressure Mr Manafort to ""sing"". ""You really care about getting information Mr Manafort can give you that would reflect on Mr Trump and lead to his prosecution or impeachment,"" he told the prosecution. As President Trump took to the NRA stage in Texas, he praised the remarks by the ""highly respected judge"". ""I've been saying that for a long time,"" said the president. ""It's a witch hunt.""

Mr Trump, whose mother was born on the Isle of Lewis, owns golf resorts in Aberdeenshire and at Turnberry in Ayrshire. Speaking in January, he described his regret at not being able to visit Scotland since he became US president, describing the country as a ""very special place"" with ""very special people"". Trump: half-Scottish, wholly controversial Trump's uneasy relationship with Scotland It was confirmed last month that Mr Trump will visit the UK on Friday 13 July, with the trip expected to include a meeting with the Queen. However, it will not be the full-blown state visit Mr Trump was promised when Prime Minister Theresa May visited the White House in January last year. The president was recently urged by UK-based supporters to stay away from London during his visit and instead focus on his ""ancestral home"" in Scotland. Mr Trump made regular trips to Scotland before becoming president In a letter to the US president, six conservative groups said the move would allow Mr Trump to avoid ""major protests, crime and disorder"". And they suggested he meets the Queen at Balmoral to avoid ""potential embarrassment"" in London. At the time, the Scottish government said the country had ""deep and longstanding ties of family, friendship and business with the United States, which will continue to endure"". It added: ""At the same time, we will not compromise our fundamental values of equality, diversity, and human rights and we expect these values to be made clear during the presidential visit to the UK."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump, and stripped him of his role as a business ambassador for Scotland in 2015 after he proposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States. But last year, Ms Sturgeon said she would agree to meet the president if he was to come to Scotland. Mr Trump made frequent visits to Scotland before becoming president, with his last trip coming in June 2016 when he visited his golf resorts during the presidential campaign. He cancelled a planned trip to London to open the new US embassy in Vauxhall earlier this year, complaining the move to an ""off location"" south of the Thames had been a ""bad deal"". But critics said his decision may have been driven by a fear of protests. Commenting on the prospect of Mr Trump visiting Scotland, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said there was a ""strong resolve to show that he is not welcome here"". Mr Leonard said Scottish Labour would help campaign for ""a mass protest"" if a visit went ahead. He added: ""It is my view, and that of the Scottish Labour Party, that someone who holds such misogynist, racist and anti-trade union views, not to mention his dangerous approach to foreign policy, and someone who rejects the Paris Climate Change Agreement, should not be given the 'red carpet' treatment.""

"The UK's car industry has hit out at the government over unconfirmed reports ministers will target hybrid vehicles as part of a new emissions crackdown. New cars unable to do at least 50 miles on electric power may be banned by 2040, a ruling that would hit the UK's best-selling hybrid, Toyota's Prius. The SMMT car trade body said ""misleading"" government messages were damaging the industry and hitting jobs. In a short statement, the Department for Transport denied plans for a ban. TheFinancial Times,externalandAutocar,externalsaid that the government's Road to Zero car emissions strategy was due to be unveiled imminently. It followslast year's announcement by the government that it would ban the sale of all new diesel and petrol carsin the UK by 2040. But the position on electrified models was unclear, and Road to Zero is due to clarify the situation. The FT and Autocar reported that vehicles which could not travel at least 50 miles using only electric power would be outlawed. Along with the bans on new petrol and diesel cars from 2040, that would affect 98% of the vehicles currently on Britain's roads, including the popular Prius, which like most plug-in hybrids on sale typically offer 30 miles of zero-emissions travel. The Prius would no longer be classified as ""environmentally friendly"". Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the industry was becoming increasingly concerned. He criticised the lack of clarity over the government's plans. ""Unrealistic targets and misleading messaging on bans will only undermine our efforts to realise this future, confusing consumers and wreaking havoc on the new car market and the thousands of jobs it supports,"" Mr Hawes aid. He said the industry shares the government's goal of zero emission transport and was investing billions of pounds in new technologies and offering greater consumer choice. But he added: ""We cannot support ambition levels which do not appreciate how industry, the consumer or the market operate and which are based neither on fact nor substance. ""Consumers need clear information about the right vehicles for their driving needs and it is again disappointing for both industry and consumers that vitally important information about government policy is being communicated by leaks."" If the government really is planning to include hybrids as part of its 2040 ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars, it makes that policy much more ambitious - and potentially much more of a headache for the industry. By 2040, it is reasonable to assume that nearly all cars will be hybridised in some way, because of ever tightening emissions legislation. That makes a ban that only covers conventional, non-hybridised cars likely to be pretty irrelevant. But if the government stipulates that all cars must be able to travel at least 50 miles on electric power, then a whole swathe of current machines will be outlawed. Even the performance of most so-called plug-in hybrids, which can already travel at least some distance on battery power, will not be good enough. That means a lot more investment will be needed, both to make cars more efficient, and to beef up charging infrastructure. And car buyers will need to be encouraged to buy the right vehicles. The proposed ban might be 22 years away - but arguments over who pays for what are likely to begin raging sooner rather than later. A Department for Transport (DfT) spokesperson said: ""It is categorically untrue that government is planning to ban the sale of hybrid cars in the UK by 2040."" The DfT added: ""We do not comment on leaked draft documents. The Road to Zero Strategy is yet to be finalised and has not been agreed by ministers."" But Autocar's editorial director Jim Holder accused the government of failing to provide ""any clarity of how it will support the ban"" through purchase incentives and the creation of a suitable charging infrastructure. ""By imposing a ban with so little detail or evidence of support car buyers are likely to be confused once again,"" he told the Press Association.

"This video can not be played The Kilauea volcano erupted after a series of earthquakes on the island. Residents nearerupting Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's largest islandhave described seeing ""unbelievable"" colours in the lava and experiencing multiple earthquakes. After a mandatory evacuation was ordered, some families have left the area, but one resident told the BBC she refuses to leave their home. A state of emergency has been declared and the Civil Defense Agency tweeted that extremely high levels of dangerous sulphur dioxide gas have been detected in the evacuation zone. Joyce Jennett, 52, and her husband Roger are 1.2 miles (2km) away from the eruption. ""They say there is a mandatory evacuation but no-one's come to tell us we have to go yet. If you do leave, the question is when will they let you back in, and you have to worry about people looting. We'll stay until they make us leave,"" Ms Jennett explained, adding that earthquakes were occurring as she spoke. Joyce Jennett and her husband live in the evacuation zone but are currently refusing to leave their home ""Our pick-up truck is all packed - our paperwork, some of our artwork that we would hate to see go up, clothes, my jewellery, and stuff for our dog Lara."" Ms Jennett, who is a medical coder, explained they could see grey plumes of smoke near to their home. ""There are cracks in the streets all through the Leilani Estates [where Ms Jennett lives}, so it could happen that another lava flows pops up right here on us, but we've calculated we could get out in five to 10 minutes. ""I don't think we'll be sleeping much tonight. It's kind of a gamble, but neither of us panic easily. ""Now we will just what happens where the lava is going, or if maybe it's slowing down - the problem is they don't know what direction it's going in."" After filming lava flowing at the end of their road, Maija Stenback was evacuated from the Leilani Estates along with her daughter, her daughter's boyfriend, two grandchildren aged 20 months and six years, and their dogs. Maija Stenback filmed lava flow before being evacuated from her home ""Yesterday the roads started cracking - about 150 yards (137m) from our house, the road was cracking in three places. ""That's when it started getting real. We had an idea of where the lava was travelling under the ground, we just didn't know where and when it would erupt,"" she explained. When it erupted she went to see what was happening: ""It was like when someone plays the bass really heavy, and you can feel the bass - you could really feel the power and the lava. It sounds very explosive."" Maija Stenback evacuated her home along with her family The family has moved to nearby town Hilo to stay with friends. Maija said: ""At this point we have no idea when we can get back, we locked up the house - tomorrow we'll find out more. I haven't had time to put a lot of thought into whether our house will be there tomorrow. It will be day-to-day from here."" High school student Natalie Myers, 17, is with her family 20 minutes from the eruption zone, and has family living inside the evacuation area. ""There is a huge crack in the road, you can put your whole arm inside of it. It is very earthquakey here. In Hawaii you expect it because we are on an active plate, but this is really scary,"" she told the BBC. Natalie Myers lives 20 minutes away from the eruption zone ""Because of the sulphur in the air, it's hard to breathe, it's disgusting. My friend has breathing problems and needs to evacuate but she can't leave her house."" An evacuated family is staying with Ms Myers, and she's worried about homes and schools nearby after her community was badly affected in previous eruptions. ""Last time the flow nearly took out our school. We're afraid we might not be able to graduate because we can't get to school or hand in work,"" she said.

"A confidential settlement has been reached between the BBC, the Guardian and law firm Appleby over the reporting of leaked documents detailing offshore tax-avoidance schemes. Appleby began legal action after details from the documents, known as the Paradise Papers, were published. It said it wanted to know which of its confidential documents had been taken. The Guardian and BBC said the reports were in the public interest but did not give more detail about the settlement. Panorama led research for the BBCas part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations in 67 countries, after the records were passed toGerman newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,external. The BBC does not know the identity of the source. Appleby says the data was taken by hackers. The leak of financial documents revealed how the powerful and ultra-wealthy secretly invest cash in offshore tax havens. They contained details about investments made by the Queen's private estate, a tax avoidance scheme used by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys and also showed that Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet. About half of the 13.4m leaked documents were from Appleby, one of the world's largest providers of offshore legal services. BBC sued over Paradise Papers leaks In a joint statement, Appleby, the Guardian and the BBC said they have ""resolved their differences"" in relation to the breach of confidence claim. It said: ""Without compromising their journalistic integrity or ability to continue to do public interest journalism, the Guardian and the BBC have assisted Appleby by explaining which of the company's documents may have been used to underpin their journalism. ""It is now clear that the vast majority of documents that were of interest in the Paradise Papers investigation related to the fiduciary business that is no longer owned by Appleby and so were not legally privileged documents."" Michael O'Connell, group managing partner of Appleby, said: ""From the outset we wanted to be able to explain to our clients and colleagues what information of theirs had been stolen. That was our duty. ""As a result of this legal action we are well on our way to achieving our objectives."" The Guardian said the reporting of the Paradise Papers was investigative journalism that had raised important issues. The BBC said it welcomed the settlement as it ""preserves our ability to carry out investigative journalism in the public interest"".

"Daryll Rowe admitted having sex with four men in the knowledge he was HIV positive An Edinburgh hairdresser has been jailed for eight years for deliberately trying to infect four men with HIV. Daryll Rowe admitted having sex with four men knowing he was HIV positive. One contracted the virus. Last month, in England, Rowe was jailed for life for trying to infect 10 men. Five of them contracted HIV. After being diagnosed with the virus in 2015, the 27-year-old began to have sex with men in a deliberate effort to infect them. At the High Court in Edinburgh, Rowe pled guilty to four counts of culpable and reckless conduct and was placed on the sex offenders register for life. He will serve the eight years concurrently with the life sentence given to him in England. Lady Scott said Daryll Rowe had acted with ""a total disregard of the consequences"". She said it was with ""utter callousness"" and said for the victim who became HIV positive it had been ""traumatic"" with a ""profound effect on his life"". He met men using online dating apps and entered into sexual relationships without disclosing his illness. During contact with victims Rowe would either refrain from wearing a condom, or tamper with them, as he attempted to deliberately infect men. Between October 2015 and December 2016 he continued to commit similar offences in Edinburgh, Sussex and north east England. During last month's case in Brighton, the court heard he had sent mocking text messages after sex saying he was ""riddled"". Rowe, formerly of Musselburgh, met men on the gay dating app Grindr and had intercourse with eight men in Brighton between October 2015 and February 2016 before fleeing to Northumberland where he targeted a further two men. He sent another victim a text reading: ""Maybe you have the fever coz.... I have HIV LOL."" Advocate depute Jo McDonald told the High Court in Edinburgh Rowe was diagnosed with HIV in April 2015 after he had been in contact with someone with the virus. He was given information about medication and advised of the risk of transmission through unprotected intercourse. The prosecutor said he attended a follow-up appointment and added: ""At that appointment the accused was advised that his viral load, that being the term used to describe the amount of HIV in the carrier's blood, was in excess of 200,000. ""A high load is generally considered to be that over 100,000, although virus levels can be much higher and counted in millions."" At a further meeting a doctor noted that he was ""not keen to take HIV treatment"" as he disliked medication. He was advised to use condoms at all times for penetrative sex and was told that his viral load was quite high. Rowe had originally faced a total of 20 charges involving 12 different men. As well as allegations of culpable and reckless conduct by exposing individuals to the virus in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Musselburgh and Burntisland, in Fife, through intercourse without using condoms they had included offences of attempted extortion. It was alleged that he tried to obtain Â£1,000 from one man by threatening to expose him as gay and tried to get a further Â£1,000 from another man by putting photos and video of a sexual encounter on the internet. The Crown accepted his not guilty pleas to the further 16 charges. Defence counsel Shelagh McCall said it was clear from medical notes that Rowe was not coping with the HIV diagnosis at the time but also believed he could be cured through alterative therapies, including a urine therapy. She said: ""He accepts his behaviour was reckless. It is fair to say he regrets it enormously."" Det Ch Insp Martin MacLean, of Police Scotland, said: ""Daryll Rowe is a devious and deceptive predator who has shown absolutely no remorse for the extensive suffering and distress he has caused his victims. ""Since April 2015 he was fully aware of his illness, yet refused treatment that would ensure his own health and safeguard his sexual partners from the risk of infection.

"Mr Trump's Turnberry golf course would be a potential destination for the US president Donald Trump is expected to visit Scotland on his trip to the UK this summer, BBC Scotland understands. The full itinerary for the US president's visit has not yet been finalised. But BBC Scotland correspondent Glenn Campbell said the current plan included a Scottish leg to his tour. Mr Trump, whose mother was born on the Isle of Lewis, owns golf resorts in Aberdeenshire and at Turnberry in Ayrshire. Speaking in January, he described his regret at not being able to visit Scotland since he became US president, describing the country as a ""very special place"" with ""very special people"". Trump: half-Scottish, wholly controversial Trump's uneasy relationship with Scotland It was confirmed last month that Mr Trump will visit the UK on Friday 13 July, with the trip expected to include a meeting with the Queen. However, it will not be the full-blown state visit Mr Trump was promised when Prime Minister Theresa May visited the White House in January last year. The president was recently urged by UK-based supporters to stay away from London during his visit and instead focus on his ""ancestral home"" in Scotland. Mr Trump made regular trips to Scotland before becoming president In a letter to the US president, six conservative groups said the move would allow Mr Trump to avoid ""major protests, crime and disorder"". And they suggested he meets the Queen at Balmoral to avoid ""potential embarrassment"" in London. At the time, the Scottish government said the country had ""deep and longstanding ties of family, friendship and business with the United States, which will continue to endure"". It added: ""At the same time, we will not compromise our fundamental values of equality, diversity, and human rights and we expect these values to be made clear during the presidential visit to the UK."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump, and stripped him of his role as a business ambassador for Scotland in 2015 after he proposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States. But last year, Ms Sturgeon said she would agree to meet the president if he was to come to Scotland. Mr Trump made frequent visits to Scotland before becoming president, with his last trip coming in June 2016 when he visited his golf resorts during the presidential campaign. He cancelled a planned trip to London to open the new US embassy in Vauxhall earlier this year, complaining the move to an ""off location"" south of the Thames had been a ""bad deal"". But critics said his decision may have been driven by a fear of protests. Commenting on the prospect of Mr Trump visiting Scotland, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said there was a ""strong resolve to show that he is not welcome here"". Mr Leonard said Scottish Labour would help campaign for ""a mass protest"" if a visit went ahead. He added: ""It is my view, and that of the Scottish Labour Party, that someone who holds such misogynist, racist and anti-trade union views, not to mention his dangerous approach to foreign policy, and someone who rejects the Paris Climate Change Agreement, should not be given the 'red carpet' treatment.""

"This video can not be played ""I will never forgive them for what's happened"" A mother whose son died after not being given a life-saving blood test says she will ""never forgive"" the hospital. Callum Cartlidge, aged eight, died after suffering a cardiac arrest at home in Redditch, Worcestershire, on 3 March 2017. A coroner has said not giving a blood test to Callum, who had an undiagnosed rare illness, was ""a failure to provide basic medical care"". The coroner said death would have been prevented if a blood test was done. Midlands Live: Labour lose Nuneaton to no overall control; Lorry spills load of yeast Callum, who has a twin brother, was discharged from Worcestershire Royal Hospital the day before his death with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis. He had been suffering an Addisonian crisis, linked to undiagnosedAddison's disease,external. Callum's mother, Stacey Cartlidge, said: ""They didn't listen to me when I did ask them for a blood test. ""They kept saying he wasn't at the stage to have a blood test. ""So what stage would he have to be at to have a blood test? ""I will never forgive them for what's happened, never. ""My son's not here and if he'd had a blood test he would have survived."" Callum Cartlidge fell ill at his home in Redditch and was taken to Worcestershire Royal Hospital but later died A medical experttold the inquest the test would have identifiedCallum's rare disease. Recording a narrative verdict, Worcestershire assistant coroner David Reid said while not carrying out the blood test was a ""serious failing"", it was not a gross failing and he could not record a verdict of neglect. Callum, who was described as usually a ""cheeky chappie"" was described as ""lethargic and yellow"" and regularly off school in the months before his death. During the five-day hearing, the court was told how Callum had a 23-minute ambulance journey to Worcester hospital the day he died, rather than to the Alexandra Hospital, three minutes away, which stopped admitting children to A&E in 2016. However, Mr Reid -who heard evidence from a paediatric emergency consultant- said he did not think it had been a factor in the boy's death. Dr Andrew Short, the divisional medical director for Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, expressed its ""deepest condolences"" to the family and said despite their ""best intentions, the outcome is not what we anticipated.""

"This video can not be played BBC Weather's Alina Jenkins looks at the forecast Temperatures could reach 27C (81F) in parts of England on Monday, which would make it the hottest early May Bank Holiday on record. The South East can expect the highest temperatures - while Wales and Scotland could also see temperatures in the mid to high 20s, BBC forecasters said. The warmest early May Bank Holiday Monday on record was 23.6C, in 1999. But this Monday could be the hottest since 1978, when the early May Bank Holiday was introduced. The average high for the May Bank Holiday in London is about 18C. The highest temperatures of 26C and 27C are expected in south-east England, particularly around west London. In East Anglia temperatures could reach 25C, while northern England and Wales are likely to have highs of 23C. It will be slightly cooler in south-west England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with most places between 19C to 22C. The RAC said a total of 8.5 million journeys are expected on the road between Friday and Monday. By 17:00 BST on Friday, stretches of several motorways were heavily congested, the RAC said. Traffic was at a standstill at the M5 and M4 near Bristol and there were long delays on roads near Exeter, as people headed to the south-west of England. How hot is it where you are? Share your weather pictures Prof Hawking's multiverse finale Swedish meatball admission: They're Turkish ""Bank Holiday Monday looks like it will be a fine and dry day for almost all of the UK with plenty of blue sky and warm sunshine,"" said BBC Weather's Nikki Berry. ""Although many may head to the beach to soak up the sun, it is likely to be a few degrees cooler on the coast as sea breezes develop. ""Sea fog may also plague some North Sea coasts in Scotland."" It comes in sharp contrast to last Monday when some parts of the UK experienced ""unseasonably cold weather"" and saw more than half a month's rainfall in a day. And in early April, parts of Scotland, northern England and north Wales were covered in heavy snow. The highest May temperature ever recorded in the UK was on 29 May 1944, when Regent's Park, Horsham and Tunbridge Wells reached 32.8C (91F). How hot is it where you are?

"Daryll Rowe admitted having sex with four men in the knowledge he was HIV positive An Edinburgh hairdresser has been jailed for eight years for deliberately trying to infect four men with HIV. Daryll Rowe admitted having sex with four men knowing he was HIV positive. One contracted the virus. Last month, in England, Rowe was jailed for life for trying to infect 10 men. Five of them contracted HIV. After being diagnosed with the virus in 2015, the 27-year-old began to have sex with men in a deliberate effort to infect them. At the High Court in Edinburgh, Rowe pled guilty to four counts of culpable and reckless conduct and was placed on the sex offenders register for life. He will serve the eight years concurrently with the life sentence given to him in England. Lady Scott said Daryll Rowe had acted with ""a total disregard of the consequences"". She said it was with ""utter callousness"" and said for the victim who became HIV positive it had been ""traumatic"" with a ""profound effect on his life"". He met men using online dating apps and entered into sexual relationships without disclosing his illness. During contact with victims Rowe would either refrain from wearing a condom, or tamper with them, as he attempted to deliberately infect men. Between October 2015 and December 2016 he continued to commit similar offences in Edinburgh, Sussex and north east England. During last month's case in Brighton, the court heard he had sent mocking text messages after sex saying he was ""riddled"". Rowe, formerly of Musselburgh, met men on the gay dating app Grindr and had intercourse with eight men in Brighton between October 2015 and February 2016 before fleeing to Northumberland where he targeted a further two men. He sent another victim a text reading: ""Maybe you have the fever coz.... I have HIV LOL."" Advocate depute Jo McDonald told the High Court in Edinburgh Rowe was diagnosed with HIV in April 2015 after he had been in contact with someone with the virus. He was given information about medication and advised of the risk of transmission through unprotected intercourse. The prosecutor said he attended a follow-up appointment and added: ""At that appointment the accused was advised that his viral load, that being the term used to describe the amount of HIV in the carrier's blood, was in excess of 200,000. ""A high load is generally considered to be that over 100,000, although virus levels can be much higher and counted in millions."" At a further meeting a doctor noted that he was ""not keen to take HIV treatment"" as he disliked medication. He was advised to use condoms at all times for penetrative sex and was told that his viral load was quite high. Rowe had originally faced a total of 20 charges involving 12 different men. As well as allegations of culpable and reckless conduct by exposing individuals to the virus in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Musselburgh and Burntisland, in Fife, through intercourse without using condoms they had included offences of attempted extortion. It was alleged that he tried to obtain Â£1,000 from one man by threatening to expose him as gay and tried to get a further Â£1,000 from another man by putting photos and video of a sexual encounter on the internet. The Crown accepted his not guilty pleas to the further 16 charges. Defence counsel Shelagh McCall said it was clear from medical notes that Rowe was not coping with the HIV diagnosis at the time but also believed he could be cured through alterative therapies, including a urine therapy. She said: ""He accepts his behaviour was reckless. It is fair to say he regrets it enormously."" Det Ch Insp Martin MacLean, of Police Scotland, said: ""Daryll Rowe is a devious and deceptive predator who has shown absolutely no remorse for the extensive suffering and distress he has caused his victims. ""Since April 2015 he was fully aware of his illness, yet refused treatment that would ensure his own health and safeguard his sexual partners from the risk of infection. ""To make matters worse, he would then knowingly engage in sexual activity with individuals he met without divulging his condition.

"The crocodiles were intended for a farm in Cambridgeshire, where they were to be bred for meat Fifty crocodiles have been seized at Heathrow airport after their transport conditions breached regulations. The year-old reptiles, which arrived on a flight from Malaysia, had fought each other during the journey due to their cramped circumstances. Each of the five transportation boxes used had room for four crocodiles - but 10 foot-long animals were in each one. A Border Force spokesman said ""little attention"" had been paid to the crocodiles' welfare. One crocodile has since died. The animals had been destined for a farm in Cambridgeshire - where they were to be bred for meat - but are now being cared for by officials from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The remaining 49 crocodiles will be re-homed, a Home Office statement said. Fifty crocodiles were transported from Malaysia but one has since died Crocodile shock for police in Essex Crocodile found in Russian weapons raid Grant Miller, head of the national Border Force CITES team at Heathrow, said: ""It is just not acceptable for reptiles to be transported in this way.""

"The academy will now announce the 2018 winner along with the 2019 winner next year The organisation that decides the Nobel Prize for Literature has said it will not announce an award this year, after it was engulfed in a scandal over sexual assault allegations. The Swedish Academy has been in crisis over its handling of allegations against the husband of a member. She has since quit, as have the academy's head and four other members. The academy says it will now announce the 2018 winner along with the 2019 winner next year. The scandal is the biggest to hit the prize since it was first awarded in 1901. Apart from six years during the world wars, there has been only one year when the prize was not awarded. No worthy winner was found in 1935. This year's other Nobel prizes will go ahead as usual. In a statement on its website, the academy said,external: ""The present decision was arrived at in view of the currently diminished Academy and the reduced public confidence in the Academy."" It said that the academy's ""operative practices need to be evolved"", including tackling its statutes, conflict-of-interest issues and management of information. Anders Olsson, the academy's interim permanent secretary, said there needed to be ""long-term and robust work"" for change Some academy members had argued that the prize should proceed to protect the tradition, but others said the institution was in no state to present the award. The #MeToo campaign, which showed the prevalence of sexual assault globally, may have played a part in the academy's decision. It would have been difficult for potential winners to accept the prize with the academy in such turmoil. Analysis by Maddy Savage, BBC News, Stockholm This is an unusual but not entirely unexpected decision here in Sweden where internal spats between members and former members of the Swedish Academy have been headline news for months. The institution has faced deep criticism from the academic community with hundreds of professors, lecturers and researchers signing a number of letters calling for the academy to take action to restore its credibility. But this is a scandal that's also captured wider attention. Many Swedes are fiercely proud of the Nobel prizes and the fact that they live in a country that usually champions women's rights. Seeing the prestigious literature award committee unravel off the back of the mishandling of sexual assault allegations has been a bitter pill to swallow. Not everyone is confident the academy will regain its reputation in time for next year's prize announcements. Divisions started to emerge last November when French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, who ran a cultural project with funding from the Swedish Academy, was accused by 18 women of sexual assault. Several of the alleged incidents reportedly happened in properties belonging to the academy. Mr Arnault denies the allegations. The scandal behind the prize Photographer 'groped' princess at Swedish Academy event The organisation later voted against removing Mr Arnault's wife, the poet and writer Katarina Frostenson, from its committee. The academy's permanent secretary, Prof Sara Danius, resigned This, along with accusations of conflict of interest and the leaking of Nobel winners' names, divided the organisation. What followed was a wave of resignations, including Ms Frostenson and the head of the academy, Prof Sara Danius. Only 11 members are now in place. Of those, one, Kerstin Ekman, has been inactive since 1989, when the academy refused to condemn the fatwa issued over Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses. Swedish Academy head quits over probe Why women fear a #MeToo backlash The academy's statutes require a quorum of 12 to vote in any new members. Technically, members are appointed for life to the Swedish Academy and cannot resign, although they can refuse to take part. Academy patron King Carl XVI Gustaf has said he will change the rules to allow them to quit formally. The academy said: ""Work on the selection of a laureate is at an advanced stage and will continue as usual in the months ahead but the Academy needs time to regain its full complement, engage a larger number of active members and regain confidence in its work, before the next Literature Prize winner is declared."" Two prizes for literature will be announced next year, one for 2018 and one for 2019. This is not the first time this has happened. On five occasions a prize for one year has been awarded at the same time as the following year's prize. For example, American playwright Eugene O'Neill was given the 1936 award in 1937. A number have highlighted the importance of #MeToo, among other theories and opinions, including the neglect of Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o... Allow Twitter content?

"The Argentine peso is still sliding in value Argentina's central bank has raised interest rates for the third time in eight days as the country's currency, the peso, continues to fall sharply. On Friday, the bank hiked rates to 40% from 33.25%, a day after they were raised from 30.25%. A week ago, they were raised from 27.25%. The rises are aimed at supporting the peso, which has lost a quarter of its value over the past year. Analysts say the crisis is escalating and looks set to continue. Argentina is in the middle of a pro-market economic reform programme under President Mauricio Macri, who is seeking to reverse years of protectionism and high government spending under his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Inflation, a perennial problem in Argentina, was at 25% in 2017, the highest rate in Latin America except for Venezuela. This year, the central bank has set an inflation target of 15% and has said it will continue to act to enforce it. Despite the twin rate rises, the peso, which was fixed by law at parity with the US dollar before Argentina's economic meltdown in 2001-02, is now trading at about 22 to the dollar. ""This crisis looks set to continue unless the government steps in to reassure investors that it will take more aggressive steps to fix Argentina's economic vulnerabilities,"" said Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at Capital Economics. ""Risks to the peso have been brewing for a while - large twin budget and current account deficits, a heavy dollar debt burden, entrenched high inflation and an overvalued currency. ""The real surprise is how quickly and suddenly things seem to be escalating."" Mr Glossop said ""a sizeable fiscal tightening"" was planned for 2018, but it might now need to be larger and prompter. ""Unless or until that happens, the peso is likely to remain under pressure, and there remains a real risk of a messy economic adjustment."" Argentina's president Mauricio Macri is a controversial figure in a country that is still strongly divided ideologically. But among international investors he is unanimously praised. Since coming to office, he moved swiftly to end capital controls and re-establish trust in economic data coming from Argentina. However, he is not winning a crucial battle in the country - the one against inflation. Markets are taking notice and there has been a sell-off of the peso. The opposition wants to stop Macri from removing subsidies in controlled prices, such as energy and utility tariffs, which may bring more inflation in the short term but could help bring it down from above 20% now to about 5% by 2020. Friday was a day for emergency measures - a massive hike to 40% in interest rates and a commitment to bring down government spending. Investors still believe Macri has a sound plan to recover Argentina, but they are not convinced he can see it through.

"Thousands of ""mortgage prisoners"" who are paying high borrowing rates but are unable to switch to better deals should be given more help, the UK's financial regulator has said. These homeowners took out mortgages before new, stricter rules on affordability were brought in. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also said about 30% of borrowers failed to find the cheapest mortgage deal. However, it said competition in the market worked well for many people. The FCA's comments came inan interim report into the mortgage market.,external Christopher Woolard, director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: ""For many, the market is working well, with high levels of consumer engagement. ""However, we believe that things could work better with more innovative tools to help consumers. ""There are also a number of long-standing borrowers that have kept up-to-date with their mortgage repayments but are unable to get a new mortgage deal; we want to explore ways that we, and the industry, can help them."" People much less likely to move home than in 1970s Rate rise doubts as property demand falls Some mortgage holders found themselves trapped in their current deal when stricter affordability checks on mortgage applications were brought in during 2014. These ""mortgage prisoners"" were unable to move to a better deal when their existing mortgages switched back to the more expensive standard variable rate, even if they could meet the payments. The FCA said it had identified about 150,000 such customers. Of these, about 30,000 were with authorised mortgage lenders, while about 120,000 had mortgages held by non-regulated firms - which include some previous Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley customers. The regulator said it intended to explore options to help these customers, ""for example, an industry-wide agreement to approve applications for a new mortgage deal from existing customers whose most recent mortgage was taken out before the financial crisis and who are up-to-date with payments"". The regulator said there were high levels of choice and consumer awareness in the mortgage market, with three-quarters of borrowers switching to a new deal within six months of moving on to a standard variable rate. But it said there was no easy way for customers to be confident of which mortgage deal they might qualify for, and this was ""a significant impediment"" to shopping around. The FCA also said a ""significant minority"" - about 30% - of customers failed to find the cheapest mortgage. It wants to make it easier for borrowers, early on in the process, to see what mortgage products they can qualify for, and to assess and compare these products. The FCA is consulting on its interim findings and proposed remedies, and intends to publish its final report around the end of the year. Jackie Bennett, director of mortgages at UK Finance, said: ""Today's interim report highlights that, in the main, the mortgage market is working effectively for the vast majority of borrowers. ""We note the FCA's points regarding perceived areas of weaknesses within the market, particularly around customers who currently may be unable to switch products. ""We will be working through the FCA's recommendations and continuing to engage closely with the regulator over the coming weeks as we respond to the consultation.""

"Connor Sparrowhawk, who had learning disabilities and epilepsy, died in 2013 after being left alone in a bath A review into the deaths of people with learning disabilities by NHS England has highlighted significant concerns surrounding their care. Some 1,311 cases were passed for review between July 2016 and November 2017, with only 103 (8%) finished so far. Of these,the Learning Disability Mortality Review,externalfound failings had taken place in one in eight deaths, from abuse to delays in treatment. NHS England said Â£1.4m will be spent this year to complete more reviews. It added that ""early lessons"" will inform the work of hospitals and community services. The report comes in the wake of the death of Connor Sparrowhawk. Mr Sparrowhawk, who had learning disabilities and epilepsy,died when he had a seizure alonein a bath at an NHS care unit in 2013. Southern Health NHS Foundation Trustadmitted breaching health and safety lawand wasfined Â£2m for the deaths of Mr Sparrowhawk and another patient, 45-year-old Teresa Colvin who died in Hampshire in 2012. This video can not be played 'Things have actually got worse than they were ten years ago,' says Dr Sara Ryan Speaking to BBC News following Friday's report, Mr Sparrowhawk's mother, Dr Sara Ryan, said the authorities were showing a ""systematic disregard"" for some people. ""Certain people simply don't count - you can't dress it up as anything else,"" she said. ""We have so much evidence now of a complete dismissal of the human-ness of people labelled with learning disabilities and... I don't actually want to live in a society in which this just goes on and the government does nothing about it."" In its annual report, the Learning Disability Mortality Review said there was a pressing ""need for further action"". It said that in 13 of the 103 cases that had been reviewed, a patient's health had been ""adversely affected"" by factors including treatment delays, gaps in service provision, organisational dysfunction or neglect or abuse. In one example, a man was admitted to hospital with possible urinary sepsis after he had been discharged. He had been sent home with a catheter by staff who did not have training in catheter care. ""The failure to liaise with carers about their knowledge and skills in catheter care contributed to an unsafe discharge, readmission and rapid decline in health,"" the report said. In another example cited by the review, a man who had been under the care of a urologist until the age of 18, failed to receive follow-up care for the next eight years. During this time, he developed a large kidney stone, which was ruled to be the main cause of his death. The report also said there were instances of staff not being able to easily access records of a patient's specific needs. One example given involved a person with learning disabilities who had anxiety about accessing services where there were stairs, resulting in missed appointments. Had this been recorded properly, the report said, reasonable adjustments could have been made. Connor Sparrowhawk's mother, Dr Sara Ryan, said there was a ""systematic disregard"" for some people The report made 189 recommendations in relation to the completed reviews, highlighting the need for better communication between different agencies, awareness of the needs of people with learning disabilities and understanding and application of the Mental Capacity Act. Specific recommendations included: The creation of a health passport if a person with learning disabilities does not already have one when admitted to hospital The improvement of signage about waiting times in A&E departments Quality review group meetings to address poor or unsafe discharges from hospital GP practices to follow up the reason for non-attendance at annual health checks The report said: ""We have a responsibility to families and others to ensure that any learning points at individual level are taken forward into relevant service improvements as appropriate."" It added that some improvements had already been made, including changes in the discharge process and the provision of reasonable adjustments for people with learning disabilities. Sir Stephen Bubb, who authored the report intothe Winterbourne View abuse scandal, said the review highlighted ''endemic institutional abuse"". He said: ''The prime minister has said her mission is to tackle burning injustice. There can be no community more abused and neglected than people with learning disabilities and their families. ""How many more deaths before we tackle this injustice?'' The Department for Health said that every NHS Trust would have to publish data on avoidable deaths and provide evidence of improvements from June. It said NHS England ""must take up the recommendations of this review - and by learning from every avoidable death these tragedies should end in the future"". ""Clearly there is still more work to do,"" it said. The Learning Disability Mortality Review Programme is run by the University of Bristol and commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership on behalf of NHS England. An NHS England spokesperson said: ""We welcome this interim report from the Learning Disabilities Mortality Review programme - the first of its kind in the world. ""These early lessons will feed into hospital and community services' work including early detection of symptoms of sepsis, pneumonia prevention, constipation and epilepsy, where there is significant progress. ""Another Â£1.4m more will be spent this year so that those responsible locally - as well as the University of Bristol and HQIP nationally - can ramp up the speed and number of their reviews over the coming year.""

"This video can not be played Labour's Ellie Emberson was elected as councillor in Reading aged just 19 At 19, Ellie Emberson is one of the youngest councillors in England afterThursday's local election results. The teenager won her seat on Reading Borough Council, representing Labour in the town's Minster Ward for the next four years. She will dramatically alter the average age of councillors in the borough, which is around 65. She also has high ambitions to be the voice for a generation traditionally underrepresented in politics. ""Young people deserve to be represented,"" she said. ""Young people are in the community so someone has to step up and represent their thoughts and opinions. ""So I thought, 'I'll step up and do it myself'. ""I think the average age of a councillor is 65, so I looked at the council and thought 'you're all great but we need to get some new blood in here and someone that can stand up and actually say what it's like to be a young person, because they make assumptions and don't know'."" Ellie Emberson spent six months campaigning to be elected Ms Emberson added: ""Hopefully I'll work with the council to look at initiatives for young people, and work with the Labour Party in general to come up with policies that support young people in areas such as housing."" Housing is certainly a big issue for a town where the average price for a terraced house is just shy of Â£323k - far beyond a young person's starting salary. Even a flat in Reading will put you back by Â£244k on average. ""We are definitely the rent generation and it's just so unfortunate,"" she said. ""But I think as well as looking at ownership we need to look at renting, because ultimately young people are going to have to rent for longer than previous generations, which is not great, but if we are going to have to do that we need to make sure tenants aren't being ripped off by landlords and that there is security for young people."" Two 18 year olds, Jake Cooper (left) and Joe Roberts won seats for the Conservatives at the Dudley election In the Dudley local election, Jake Cooper, 18, won Belle Vale for the Tories taking it from Labour. He said: ""The Conservatives are giving young people a chance to stand up for their communities."" Joe Roberts, also 18, won Halesowen North and said ""it's been a fantastic night."" Ms Emberson is Reading born and bred, growing up in the Minster ward that she now represents. She started out in Reading politics as chair of the Reading Youth Cabinet in 2014, becoming the Member of Youth Parliament for Reading a year later. Despite these years of experience, she does inevitably come across views based on her teenager status, but her career has set her up to be thick-skinned. ""It is difficult when people say 'you're too young'"", she says, ""but then other people are saying it's amazing that young people are getting involved. ""There's a complete mix of opinions on the doorstep and it's just about making sure you listen to everyone."" Ms Emberson has taken over the Labour Minster seat from a councillor who was retiring and won 1,308 votes, beating candidates for the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and the Green Party.

"This video can not be played ""I will never forgive them for what's happened"" A mother whose son died after not being given a life-saving blood test says she will ""never forgive"" the hospital. Callum Cartlidge, aged eight, died after suffering a cardiac arrest at home in Redditch, Worcestershire, on 3 March 2017. A coroner has said not giving a blood test to Callum, who had an undiagnosed rare illness, was ""a failure to provide basic medical care"". The coroner said death would have been prevented if a blood test was done. Midlands Live: Labour lose Nuneaton to no overall control; Lorry spills load of yeast Callum, who has a twin brother, was discharged from Worcestershire Royal Hospital the day before his death with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis. He had been suffering an Addisonian crisis, linked to undiagnosedAddison's disease,external. Callum's mother, Stacey Cartlidge, said: ""They didn't listen to me when I did ask them for a blood test. ""They kept saying he wasn't at the stage to have a blood test. ""So what stage would he have to be at to have a blood test? ""I will never forgive them for what's happened, never. ""My son's not here and if he'd had a blood test he would have survived."" Callum Cartlidge fell ill at his home in Redditch and was taken to Worcestershire Royal Hospital but later died A medical experttold the inquest the test would have identifiedCallum's rare disease. Recording a narrative verdict, Worcestershire assistant coroner David Reid said while not carrying out the blood test was a ""serious failing"", it was not a gross failing and he could not record a verdict of neglect. Callum, who was described as usually a ""cheeky chappie"" was described as ""lethargic and yellow"" and regularly off school in the months before his death. During the five-day hearing, the court was told how Callum had a 23-minute ambulance journey to Worcester hospital the day he died, rather than to the Alexandra Hospital, three minutes away, which stopped admitting children to A&E in 2016. However, Mr Reid -who heard evidence from a paediatric emergency consultant- said he did not think it had been a factor in the boy's death. Dr Andrew Short, the divisional medical director for Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, expressed its ""deepest condolences"" to the family and said despite their ""best intentions, the outcome is not what we anticipated.""

"Elections are about asking voters what they want and what they think. This time round, what the public has said back to politicians, is we don't want big changes yet. Only just over half of the results from around England have come through so far, and I can't say that enough. But as things stand it looks like the Labour Party have made some gains in London, but small steps, rather than the dramatic strides some had expected. They had poured energy and the enthusiasm of their huge number of new activists particularly into London boroughs and that seems to have come up short. Live: Election results and updates Mixed picture in English council elections There could well be some head-scratching in Labour HQ about how that can be explained. It is certainly too soon to suggest that we have reached ""peak Corbyn"", as Conservative former education secretary Justine Greening has suggested.     Labour will be able to point to picking up Plymouth Council and removing the patch of blue in the sea of red that was Trafford, in the North West, from Tory control. Before the full picture is clear, it looks as if Labour has moved on slightly since the general election. But, in the words of Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde,  Jeremy Corbyn's party has come out of this more or less ""empty-handed"", and they can't show the kind of progress they would be shouting about if they were truly convinced they were on a rapid march to Number 10. The Tories have avoided the kind of wipe-out they feared and there will be huge relief in Conservative HQ this morning. After a torrid time since the start of the year, and significant divisions in the Tory Party, they could well have expected to take more of a hammering at the polls. But there are in these results, reminders of where their support really is. Where support has moved to Theresa May's party it has primarily been in areas that voted Leave in the EU referendum, heaping even more pressure on the Tories to get Brexit right. And Losing Richmond, in South West London to the Lib Dems is a reminder of how some voters in Remain-tending areas will turn away. Remember, this isn't done yet, there are many more results to come. But this has not been a night of change, but a night where voters seemed to have broadly backed the status quo.

"They seem stuck with each other - so close, in fact, that ourprojected national share of the votefrom the results would mean that, in a hypothetical general election tomorrow, the two main Westminster parties would receive exactly the same levels of public support. For reasons we've discussed at length overnight and in recent days, we have to be careful about directly transposing what happened on Thursday into a theoretical nationwide election. But while in one sense not very much happened in the local election - not very many councils and seats changed hands and neither of the main parties have (with a couple of hours to go) made dramatic strides - something important did happen. Leaders upbeat despite lack of big gains Local election results 2018 - live The results in maps Voters opted again for roughly the status quo, underlining the trends that we saw developing at the general election as the political parties grappled with a new landscape after the referendum. Labour piled up support in big urban areas, but struggled to show advances in towns or areas where there used to be big industries, which are often - inconveniently for them - the kinds of places that have Westminster constituencies that swing the election. And notably, in part due to the grim row over anti-Semitism not being tackled in the Labour Party quickly enough, Labour did not make the kinds of additional gains in London boroughs they had suggested, even though in some of those critical parts of the metropolis, they ran the Tories extremely close. Almost in a mirror image, the Tories have struggled to get voters in big cities on side, even though, as above, they held back what would have been totemic losses in London. But they nibbled away in some of those kinds of places where Labour lost some of their appeal. Just as at the general election, we saw that outside London the Conservatives inched forward, and inside London, Labour took some small steps. There were of course many other interesting results, and you can read about them here. However, broadly speaking, both of the main Westminster parties maintained their comfort zone, but showed little evidence of pushing out of it. At this stage of the electoral cycle, that is a significant problem for the Labour Party. To demonstrate to the public, and to their own foot soldiers, they are banging on the door of No 10, they were eager to show more striking advances that did not come to pass. Some of their own MPs have been candid enough to admit that, in the last few hours, and to confront the geographical divide in their vote. But for the Tories too, there is a sense of relief, rather than a feeling of hope. They held off challenges more effectively than they expected to, but again, they showed little sign of having much to offer to voters in what's alien territory for them. Just as in June last year, we saw broadly Tory v Labour, Towns v Cities, Young v Old, and Leave v Remain. Of course it's not as simple as that. The Lib Dems had a better night than expected and UKIP pretty much disappeared. But the fault lines which the Referendum exposed are deeper still. And here is the conundrum for Labour and the Tories - they both are perhaps digging deeper into their holes. For the Tories, in the traditional context, this can fairly be described as a pretty decent performance after eight years in government, which traditionally see parties get hammered as voters get fed up with them over the years. It would be perfectly easy for them therefore to say, move on, nothing to see here, let's carry on as we are, not least because the Tories are divided, and have faced drama after drama. But there's caution too. One senior Conservative warns that in London Councils they held on ""in spite of the Westminster government and not because of it"". They added: ""The big risk is that the national party kicks the reform can down the road because we are trundling along. Just because the wheels didn't fall off, doesn't mean the early warning lights aren't flashing faster than ever."" For Labour, the results don't suggest confident strides towards Number 10, but neither are they so bad that the party is likely to re-examine their approach. One shadow minister told the BBC it was ""very serious to be going backwards"" in some Midlands areas. Another said in frustration that there was ""no strategy"", but said nothing will change in their view, because ""we've got 500,000 people who think this guy walks on water"". For real majorities, rather than hung politics, parties have to achieve beyond their comfort zones. Until either of them can do that, perhaps Mr Corbyn can't truly beat Mrs May, but nor will Mrs May be able to see off Mr Corbyn.

"This video can not be played UKIP general secretary compares his party to the 'Black Death' UKIP is ""dormant"" like the Black Death, its general secretary said after it suffered heavy losses in the English local elections. In the 150 council elections UKIP won three seats - including two in Derby - and lost 123. But general secretary Paul Oakley said it was ""not all over at all"" for the Eurosceptic party, which has suffered since the Brexit vote in 2016. ""Think of the Black Death in the Middle Ages,"" Mr Oakley said. ""It comes along and it causes disruption and then it goes dormant, and that's exactly what we are going to do."" Mixed picture in English council elections Follow the results live as they come in Curtice: Where did UKIP's vote go? The Black Death claimed an estimated 25 million lives, more than a third of Europe's population, between 1347 and 1351. Scientists have previously warned it could be lying dormant and could strike again. UKIP leader Gerard Batten later said this would not have been his ""choice of medieval historical analogy"", adding: ""We've certainly been a plague on the houses of the Tories and Labour, so maybe we can be a plague on their houses again."" He added: ""I think things will change as we go forward and people realise they're not going to get the Brexit they voted for in 2016, when I think our support will build again.""

Despite the local elections result, former deputy chairwoman Suzanne Evans said UKIP could still ""put the cat among the pigeons"". She hailed the result in Derby, where the party unseated the Labour council leader, adding, in a reference to Brexit: ""If UKIP does crumble I think you could still arguably make the case that it's been one of the most successful political parties in history."" UKIP had a good night the last time the seats were contested, in 2014, when the vote coincided with European elections, which it topped. At the time it was led by Nigel Farage and was putting pressure on the government for an EU referendum. But it failed to win a seat in last year's general election and has gone through a succession of leaders since the Leave vote.

"A sonar image of one of the shipwrecks discovered in 2015 Two shipwrecks found during a failed search for Malaysia Airlines flight 370 were merchant vessels that sank in the 19th Century, researchers say. The ships, discovered 2,300km (1,400 miles) off Western Australia, have been narrowed down by experts to a handful of coal-carrying British vessels. Searchers stumbled on the wrecks during a trawl of the Indian Ocean in 2015. Australian maritime researchers used sonar pictures and shipping records in their efforts to identify the vessels. The location of MH370 remains unknown more than four years after it disappeared, carrying 239 people, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. One of the ships, spotted in December 2015, was identified as an iron barque. Dr Ross Anderson, curator of maritime archaeology from the Western Australian Museum, said it was likely to be one of three vessels: the West Ridge (lost in 1883), Kooringa (1894) or Lake Ontario (1897). The West Ridge, which vanished along with its 28 crew on a trip from England to India, appeared to be the closest match, he said. Dr Anderson said the vessel weighed between 1,000 and 1,500 tonnes and was found relatively intact and upright on the sea bed, about 4km below water level. The other vessel, found about 36km away in May 2015, had a wooden hull. This image shows an iron water tank from the wooden ship, researchers say Dr Anderson said two possibilities were the W. Gordon, which had been heading from Scotland to Australia in 1877, or the Magdala, which was lost in 1882 en route from Wales to Indonesia. The ships most likely had crews of between 15 and 30 men, he said. ""The evidence points to the ship sinking as a result of a catastrophic event such as explosion, which was common in the transport of coal cargoes,"" Dr Anderson said. MH370 mystery 'inconceivable in modern era' Too soon for MH370 memorial, say relatives He said his team could not be certain of the ships' identities due to incomplete historical records. The shipwrecks were found during the official search for MH370 by Australia, Malaysia and China. The unsuccessful mission ended in January 2016 after 1,046 days. Aprivate US firm began another search for the plane earlier this year. Now in its final weeks, it has not turned up any clues.

"This video can not be played Sir John Curtice: Labour gains are par for the course The election results will come as a disappointment to Labour, relief for the Conservatives and mild encouragement for the Liberal Democrats. But what role did factors such as Brexit and the votes of young people play, ask Prof John Curtice and colleagues on the BBC's local elections team. It was a night in which big swings were rare - apart from a collapse in the UKIP vote. That enabled all three main parties to register gains, but with none of them making a decisive advance. Labour's sole council gain so far was inPlymouth. More disappointing for the party was a failure to gain a single council in London, in particular the Tory totems ofWandsworthorWestminster. Outside the capital, the party lost control of bothDerbyandNuneaton. The Liberal Democrats managed to captureRichmond-upon-Thamesfrom the Conservatives, where their party leader, Sir Vince Cable, is a local MP. But the Conservatives had the consolation of winning control of bothBasildonandPeterborough. Local election results 2018: A mixed picture Latest updates: Local elections 2018 Laura Kuenssberg: Voters back status quo So, what does this tell us about how the parties have fared - and why? Behind these gains and losses is a clear pattern of rises and falls in the levels of party support. Most of the seats being contested were previously fought over in 2014, when Labour were narrowly ahead of the Conservatives in the opinion polls. At that time, UKIP were riding the crest of a wave, while the Liberal Democrats were in the doldrums. Thanks to a collapse in UKIP support almost everywhere, both the Conservatives and Labour are enjoying more support this year than they did four years ago. The BBC's projected national vote share puts both parties on 35%. This could be seen as a draw, so far as both parties' national performance was concerned. The Lib Dems are on 16% according the BBC estimate, which uses the results of key wards to estimate what a Britain-wide vote would have been. The absence of any substantial net swing between the two largest parties is broadly in line with what might have been expected from the opinion polls, which put the Conservatives just a nose ahead. Yet Labour had allowed expectations that the party would make big gains to grow, and especially that the party might perform spectacularly in London. Instead Jeremy Corbyn has come away virtually empty handed, while the Conservatives have emerged virtually unscathed. Not everywhere swung the same way. As in last year's general election, the Conservatives fared better in places that voted for Leave than in those that voted for Remain. The Conservative vote is up by 13 points where more than 60% backed Leave. These are the areas where UKIP had performed best four years ago.     However, the Conservatives have dropped by one point in areas where less than 45% voted Leave. Not least of the reasons for this divergence is that UKIP performed best in 2014 in Leave-voting areas. The collapsed UKIP vote in such places seems to have swung disproportionately behind the Conservatives, much as it did in last year's general election. This pattern helps explain why the Conservatives' performance is weaker in London, which voted by three to two in favour of Remain. The Conservative vote is only up one point in the capital, while Labour's vote increased by four points. Consequently the party has lost more than 60 seats in London, whereas it gained around 60 in other parts of the country. Also in evidence, as in last year's general election, is a tendency for the Conservatives to fall back most heavily in places with large numbers of young voters. In wards where more than 35% of the population are aged 18 to 34, the Conservative vote fell by one point. But it increased by eight points where fewer than 20% belong to this age group. Conversely, the Conservatives performed better the more pensioners there were in the ward. Its vote is up by as much as 10 points on average where more than 20% of the population are aged 65 or over. As well as struggling in places with relatively large numbers of young adults, the Conservatives did less well where there were more graduates and people from an ethnic minority background. All of these were groups that were disinclined to vote for Brexit. Liberal Democrat support has increased on average by three points. However, this represents no more than a modest improvement on the poor 2014 result that the party was trying to defend. Despite being the only significant party in England that opposes Brexit, the Liberal Democrats did not perform noticeably better in Remain voting areas. Rather, the party's best performances seem to have been reserved for where the party was already relatively strong locally. Meanwhile, the Greens found themselves trying to withstand a receding tide, with an average drop of 2 points to 7% in those wards where the party put up candidates. However, the party had the consolation of making a net gain of six seats. And, for a small party, occasional electoral success can be an invaluable lifeline.

"Connor Sparrowhawk, who had learning disabilities and epilepsy, died in 2013 after being left alone in a bath A review into the deaths of people with learning disabilities by NHS England has highlighted significant concerns surrounding their care. Some 1,311 cases were passed for review between July 2016 and November 2017, with only 103 (8%) finished so far. Of these,the Learning Disability Mortality Review,externalfound failings had taken place in one in eight deaths, from abuse to delays in treatment. NHS England said Â£1.4m will be spent this year to complete more reviews. It added that ""early lessons"" will inform the work of hospitals and community services. The report comes in the wake of the death of Connor Sparrowhawk. Mr Sparrowhawk, who had learning disabilities and epilepsy,died when he had a seizure alonein a bath at an NHS care unit in 2013. Southern Health NHS Foundation Trustadmitted breaching health and safety lawand wasfined Â£2m for the deaths of Mr Sparrowhawk and another patient, 45-year-old Teresa Colvin who died in Hampshire in 2012. This video can not be played 'Things have actually got worse than they were ten years ago,' says Dr Sara Ryan Speaking to BBC News following Friday's report, Mr Sparrowhawk's mother, Dr Sara Ryan, said the authorities were showing a ""systematic disregard"" for some people. ""Certain people simply don't count - you can't dress it up as anything else,"" she said. ""We have so much evidence now of a complete dismissal of the human-ness of people labelled with learning disabilities and... I don't actually want to live in a society in which this just goes on and the government does nothing about it."" In its annual report, the Learning Disability Mortality Review said there was a pressing ""need for further action"". It said that in 13 of the 103 cases that had been reviewed, a patient's health had been ""adversely affected"" by factors including treatment delays, gaps in service provision, organisational dysfunction or neglect or abuse. In one example, a man was admitted to hospital with possible urinary sepsis after he had been discharged. He had been sent home with a catheter by staff who did not have training in catheter care. ""The failure to liaise with carers about their knowledge and skills in catheter care contributed to an unsafe discharge, readmission and rapid decline in health,"" the report said. In another example cited by the review, a man who had been under the care of a urologist until the age of 18, failed to receive follow-up care for the next eight years. During this time, he developed a large kidney stone, which was ruled to be the main cause of his death. The report also said there were instances of staff not being able to easily access records of a patient's specific needs. One example given involved a person with learning disabilities who had anxiety about accessing services where there were stairs, resulting in missed appointments. Had this been recorded properly, the report said, reasonable adjustments could have been made. Connor Sparrowhawk's mother, Dr Sara Ryan, said there was a ""systematic disregard"" for some people The report made 189 recommendations in relation to the completed reviews, highlighting the need for better communication between different agencies, awareness of the needs of people with learning disabilities and understanding and application of the Mental Capacity Act. Specific recommendations included: The creation of a health passport if a person with learning disabilities does not already have one when admitted to hospital The improvement of signage about waiting times in A&E departments Quality review group meetings to address poor or unsafe discharges from hospital GP practices to follow up the reason for non-attendance at annual health checks The report said: ""We have a responsibility to families and others to ensure that any learning points at individual level are taken forward into relevant service improvements as appropriate."" It added that some improvements had already been made, including changes in the discharge process and the provision of reasonable adjustments for people with learning disabilities. Sir Stephen Bubb, who authored the report intothe Winterbourne View abuse scandal, said the review highlighted ''endemic institutional abuse"". He said: ''The prime minister has said her mission is to tackle burning injustice. There can be no community more abused and neglected than people with learning disabilities and their families. ""How many more deaths before we tackle this injustice?'' The Department for Health said that every NHS Trust would have to publish data on avoidable deaths and provide evidence of improvements from June. It said NHS England ""must take up the recommendations of this review - and by learning from every avoidable death these tragedies should end in the future"". ""Clearly there is still more work to do,"" it said. The Learning Disability Mortality Review Programme is run by the University of Bristol and commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership on behalf of NHS England. An NHS England spokesperson said: ""We welcome this interim report from the Learning Disabilities Mortality Review programme - the first of its kind in the world. ""These early lessons will feed into hospital and community services' work including early detection of symptoms of sepsis, pneumonia prevention, constipation and epilepsy, where there is significant progress. ""Another Â£1.4m more will be spent this year so that those responsible locally - as well as the University of Bristol and HQIP nationally - can ramp up the speed and number of their reviews over the coming year.""

"The air route linking Singapore and the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur has become the busiest in the world, research shows. Planes made 30,537 trips between the two airports in the year to February 2018, OAG Aviation said. The route overtook Hong Kong-Taipei in a list dominated by Asian destinations. Flying between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur takes about an hour, and there are plans to build a high-speed rail link between the two. The figures mean an average of 84 flights per day plied the route. The route is operated by a host of budget carriers such as Scoot, Jetstar, Air Asia and Malindo Air as well as the two countries' flagship carriers, Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines. In five charts: How Asia aviation took off OAG's report found that the busiest international route outside of Asia was between New York's LaGuardia airport and Toronto Pearson,external- a route which saw about 16,956 flights over the period. In terms of passenger numbers the flight between Hong Kong and the Taiwanese capital remains the busiest with 6.5 million passengers on the route. The second busiest was Singapore-Jakarta (4.7 million people) and Singapore-Kuala Lumpur (4 million). However, even the busiest international routes cannot compete with the most popular domestic air journeys. The world's busiest flight path is between the South Korean capital, Seoul, and the country's popular holiday island of Jeju. About 65,000 planes flew that route in 2017 according to OAG - the equivalent of almost 180 journeys per day. In five charts: How Asia aviation took off Why have we got a pilot shortage?

"Work continues to clean up areas of Salisbury exposed to the nerve agent The chemical weapons watchdog has backtracked on its suggestion 100g of Novichok nerve agent was used in the Salisbury spy poisoning. The head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)told the New York Times,externalthat amount may have been used. The OPCW later said the amount should have read ""100mg"". Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a bench on 4 March after being exposed to the nerve agent. The UK accuses Russia of being behind the attack, but Russia strongly denies this. Speaking to the newspaper, OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu said that an inspection of various sites in Salisbury indicated ""50, 100g or so"" had been used. He added that amount was more than was needed for ""research activities"", which would only require ""five to 10g"". However, the OPCW then released a statement saying it ""would not be able to estimate or determine the amount of the nerve agent"" used in Salisbury. It added: ""The quantity should probably be characterised in milligrams."" When asked by BBC to clarify whether Mr Uzumcu had meant to say ""milligrams"" in his first estimate or genuinely thought 100g had been used, the OPCW merely stated that milligrams ""should have been used"". Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury clean-up begins in bench area Mr Uzumcu also said the nerve agent was in liquid form and could have been applied with an aerosol spray or, ""if you take the necessary measures, you could use it as a liquid"". ""One thing, perhaps, which is important to note is that the nerve agent seems to be very persistent,"" he added. ""It's not affected by weather conditions. That explains, actually, that they were able to identify it after a considerable time lapse. We understand it was also of high purity."" The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He says the nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. Read more about Novichok agents Mr Skripal, 66, remains in hospital but Ms Skripal, 33, was discharged on 9 April and taken to a secure location. Wiltshire Police Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who attended the scene, was also treated in hospital after being exposed to the chemical, but has since been discharged. A clean-up operation is under way in the Wiltshire city, although no time-frame has been given for its completion. Yulia and Sergei Skripal were critically ill for several weeks The UK has blamed Moscow for the attack, expelling 23 Russian diplomats and their families. Karen Pierce, the UK's representative to the United Nations, told a meeting in April there was ""no plausible alternative"" to the explanation that Russia was responsible. She said: ""No terrorist group or non-state actor would be able to produce this agent in the purity described by the OPCW testing and this is something Russia has acknowledged. ""The Russian state has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so today."" Twenty-nine countries also expelled 145 Russian officials in solidarity with the UK - and Nato ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. Moscow has denied any involvement and has responded by expelling British and US diplomats, as well as several from other countries. It has also closed the British Council in Russia and the British Consulate in St Petersburg.

"The owner of the Jacques Vert fashion brand, Calvetron, is in administration, putting more than 1,400 jobs at risk. Administrator Duff & Phelps has been appointed to Calvetron, which also owns the Windsmoor, Dash and Eastex brands. Calvetron ran about 300 UK concessions in stores, including Debenhams and House of Fraser - which have both faced their own trading troubles. A squeeze on consumer spending and rise in online competition has seen many top names close and thousands of jobs lost. Duff & Phelps said Calvetron would continue to trade while it looked to see if the business could be sold. Calvetron employs a total of 1,408 people - 997 in the UK, 155 in Ireland and 256 in Canada. Its predecessor Style Group Brands (SGB) went into administration in June 2017, and was sold to Calvetron. Peter Ridler, Calvetron's chief executive, said great efforts had been made to revive the business: ""Everyone at Calvetron Brands has worked with energy and determination to achieve the turnaround that was needed. ""However, a combination of four brands that needed time and investment, against a backdrop of extremely difficult trading conditions on the High Street, rising costs and low customer confidence has meant that we haven't been able to achieve this within the timescales required."" House of Fraser plans to close stores Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Six shops defying High Street downturn Philip Duffy, managing director at Duff & Phelps, echoed the view about difficult trading on the High Street. ""Inflation and wage freezes have been major concerns for many fashion retailers and have been a driving force behind decreased spending,"" he said. However, he said that Calvetron had ""also been carrying a number of legacy issues dating back to the acquisition"" of Style Brands' assets. Mr Duffy said: ""In the difficult retail environment we are facing today [Calvetron] simply could not restructure its cost base quickly enough or create the necessary economies of scale to succeed.""

"Women who regularly eat fast food and not enough fruit are more likely to struggle to conceive, a study suggests. A survey of 5,598 women found those who ate fast food four or more times a week took nearly a month longer to get pregnant than those who never or rarely ate it. Regular junk food eaters were also less likely to conceive within a year,the report in Human Reproduction found,external. Experts said it suggested a good diet boosted the chances of conceiving. However, there were some limitations to the study, including that it relied on women having to remember what they had eaten before pregnancy. Painkillers may affect babies' fertility Fully funding IVF 'would improve safety' Women in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Ireland were quizzed about what they had eaten in the month before they became pregnant with their first child. Midwives visited the women when they were about 14-16 weeks pregnant and asked them how often they ate fruit, green leafy vegetables and fish, as well as foods, such as burgers, pizza, fried chicken and chips, from fast food outlets. Researchers found the women who had eaten fruit less than one to three times a month took on average half a month longer to become pregnant than those who had eaten it three or more times a day. They also calculate that the women with the lowest intake of fruit had a 12% risk of having been unable to conceive within a year, while this was 16% for those who had eaten fast food four or more times a week. This compared with a risk of 8% in the group as a whole. Couples were excluded from the analysis if the male partner was receiving fertility treatment. Prof Claire Roberts, from the University of Adelaide, Australia, who led the study, said: ""These findings show that eating a good quality diet that includes fruit and minimising fast food consumption improves fertility and reduces the time it takes to get pregnant."" UK's most polluted towns and cities revealed Plus-size model praised for unedited pics WATCH: Are you fat on the inside? However, while researchers found an association between the consumption of fruit and fast foods and the time it took to get pregnant, perhaps surprisingly their study found no link with eating green leafy vegetables and fish. Although the study was large, it incorporated only a limited range of foods. Information on the fathers' diets was not collected, and it is possible that other unknown factors might have affected the results, researchers said. But experts said it still added to evidence that women's diet before pregnancy had an impact on their chances of conceiving. Dr Gino Pecoraro, a senior Lecturer at the University of Queensland, who was not involved in the research, said: ""Generally, the study does support what most health professionals would intuitively believe - having a healthy diet is good for couples trying to conceive.""

"Thousands of ""mortgage prisoners"" who are paying high borrowing rates but are unable to switch to better deals should be given more help, the UK's financial regulator has said. These homeowners took out mortgages before new, stricter rules on affordability were brought in. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also said about 30% of borrowers failed to find the cheapest mortgage deal. However, it said competition in the market worked well for many people. The FCA's comments came inan interim report into the mortgage market.,external Christopher Woolard, director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: ""For many, the market is working well, with high levels of consumer engagement. ""However, we believe that things could work better with more innovative tools to help consumers. ""There are also a number of long-standing borrowers that have kept up-to-date with their mortgage repayments but are unable to get a new mortgage deal; we want to explore ways that we, and the industry, can help them."" People much less likely to move home than in 1970s Rate rise doubts as property demand falls Some mortgage holders found themselves trapped in their current deal when stricter affordability checks on mortgage applications were brought in during 2014. These ""mortgage prisoners"" were unable to move to a better deal when their existing mortgages switched back to the more expensive standard variable rate, even if they could meet the payments. The FCA said it had identified about 150,000 such customers. Of these, about 30,000 were with authorised mortgage lenders, while about 120,000 had mortgages held by non-regulated firms - which include some previous Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley customers. The regulator said it intended to explore options to help these customers, ""for example, an industry-wide agreement to approve applications for a new mortgage deal from existing customers whose most recent mortgage was taken out before the financial crisis and who are up-to-date with payments"". The regulator said there were high levels of choice and consumer awareness in the mortgage market, with three-quarters of borrowers switching to a new deal within six months of moving on to a standard variable rate. But it said there was no easy way for customers to be confident of which mortgage deal they might qualify for, and this was ""a significant impediment"" to shopping around. The FCA also said a ""significant minority"" - about 30% - of customers failed to find the cheapest mortgage. It wants to make it easier for borrowers, early on in the process, to see what mortgage products they can qualify for, and to assess and compare these products. The FCA is consulting on its interim findings and proposed remedies, and intends to publish its final report around the end of the year. Jackie Bennett, director of mortgages at UK Finance, said: ""Today's interim report highlights that, in the main, the mortgage market is working effectively for the vast majority of borrowers. ""We note the FCA's points regarding perceived areas of weaknesses within the market, particularly around customers who currently may be unable to switch products. ""We will be working through the FCA's recommendations and continuing to engage closely with the regulator over the coming weeks as we respond to the consultation.""

"All results from 150 English council elections are in In mixed results for the main parties, Labour gains Plymouth, while the Conservatives take Peterborough and Basildon, and the Lib Dems won control of four councils Trafford, Derby and Nuneaton & Bedworth move to no overall control Labour seals its best result in London since 1971 But the Conservatives saw off Labour challenges in the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Westminster Sinn Fein holds West Tyrone in a parliamentary by-election With the last of the results coming in this morning, it's time for a quick recap:  Read more about theresults here. Analysis suggests the two main parties were neck and neck overall in terms of national vote share - on 35% each. Labour called the results solid but leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""disappointed at places where we lost a bit of ground"". The BBC's Chris Mason said the overriding sentiment among Conservatives was one of relief. The Lib Dems gained four councils while UKIP saw its vote collapse. The annual conference of Progress, a centre-left pressure group, is under way in central London. In her opening speech, chair Alison McGovern says the group was shfting Labour's policy on Brexit. ""Last year our policy was to leave the customs union, now it is to stay in the customs union,"" she tells delegates. She goes on to say immigration has made families and the country strong, and ""we will never be embarrassed to say so"". ""We must stand against those who demonise immigrants,"" she adds. Alastair Campell, Tony Blair's director of communications, and Liz Kendall, a former Labour leadership contender, are to speak at the event.

Catch up here with our video of the winners and the losers. This video can not be played Election night's big results Labour has failed to take target councils in London, while the Conservatives have lost control of two councils. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 Richard Burgon, Labour's shadow justice secretary, denies the results were bad. ""They were solid results,"" he says, pointing out that his party got more seats than in the 2014 elections. But he acknowledges they could have been better and the party needs to ""get a grip"" on the problem of anti-Semitism. He denies that leader Jeremy Corbyn's response to Syria and the poisoning of the Russian spy in Salisbury were issues on the doorstep for traditional Labour voters. He says in his experience of doorknocking in these elections, it was ""very rare"" for the public to raise Mr Corbyn's leadership in a negative way. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former communications director, is not impressed with Labour's results. ""What planet are they on? These are bad results. ""You do not get into a winning position by being in denial,"" he tells the Today programme. The current government is the ""worst in living memory"", showing ""serial incompetence day after day"", he says, yet the public don't seem remotely interested in supporting Labour. ""We're mid-term in the middle of disastrous Brexit negotiations. We should be destroying this Tory party. ""Brexit is a fog that is clouding the entirety of our politics. Both main parties are ducking the big questions,"" he says. He wants to see Labour come out and lead on Brexit. Asked if he thinks Mr Corbyn should stand down, he replies: ""I'm not saying that."" Jeremy Corbyn says Labour have built on the ""historic gains"" made at the last general election. In a thank you video to party members and supporters, the party leader says Labour won Plymouth and Kirklees, increased the number of councillors across England and made progress in the places it needs to win the next general election. Labour has had its best results in London since 1971, he adds, and missed out on winning the flagship Conservative London borough of Wandsworth ""by a whisker"". He concludes by saying Labour is well-placed to fight and win the next general election. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 BBC political reporter Tom Barton says neither Labour nor the Conservatives would be dancing in the aisles nor particularly despondent after the results from Thursday. He says while the elections were only held in parts of England, some conclusions could be drawn with the BBC's projected national share of the vote. That has both parties neck and neck on 35%. Not much, it seems, has moved since last year's general election, he adds. The fallout from the elections dominates the headlines in Saturday's papers. The i  focuses on the downfall of UKIP, which lost more than 100 council seats  - with the Conservatives swallowing up many of their votes in pro-Brexit areas. Theresa May has ""survived the biggest test of public opinion since the general election"", it adds. It also declares ""everyone's a winner"", citing Labour's solid - if unspectacular - gains. The Guardian writes there are ""big lessons and implications"" for Labour. It asks whether the party should now reconsider its ""strategic ambiguity"" over leaving the European Union. The Times also suggests a rethink - questioning the methods of the group Momentum. It points out that the party's solitary council gain was in Plymouth where the group was not involved. It also asks whether the party's focus on urban voters under the age of 45 is misplaced. Read the full paper reviewhere. With all councils now declared, the results are:  More aboutthe results here Counting is finally finished in Tower Hamlets: Still waiting on results for several Tower Hamlets wards - 27 of 45 seats have been declared so far. We already know Labour has control of the council. Labour has gained control of Tower Hamlets council from no overall control
after winning 23 of the 45 seats. Some wards are still to declare. Dan Jarvis has been MP for Barnsley Central since 2011 Dan Jarvis, the Labour MP who has been elected the first mayor of the Sheffield City Region, said there is a ""conversation to be had"" about the future of Yorkshire devolution. Among the ex-soldier's first jobs will be to help the leaders of Sheffield, Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham councils agree a deal on the issue. A deal struck in 2015 with the then chancellor George Osborne paved the way for the region to take control of power over transport, strategic planning and skills and receive Â£900m over 30 years. But the leaders of Barnsley and Doncaster councils have refused to agree to the proposal and have thrown their weight, together with Mr Jarvis, into securing a devolution deal for the whole of Yorkshire.  It looks like Tower Hamlets may not be declaring any time soon. There is already a recount underway for Canary Wharf ward, which was too close to call. And there could be a possible recount in Island Gardens, the council said. The leader of the Green Party in Worcester tweeted that he's ""a little dizzy"" after the party took its highest ever total of councillors with three. The last council to declare is Tower Hamlets. The results are coming through - but for many at the count, tiredness is beginning to set in. Caroline Lucas says her party defied expectations in a ""David and Goliath"" battle against big parties.

"Work continues to clean up areas of Salisbury exposed to the nerve agent The chemical weapons watchdog has backtracked on its suggestion 100g of Novichok nerve agent was used in the Salisbury spy poisoning. The head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)told the New York Times,externalthat amount may have been used. The OPCW later said the amount should have read ""100mg"". Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a bench on 4 March after being exposed to the nerve agent. The UK accuses Russia of being behind the attack, but Russia strongly denies this. Speaking to the newspaper, OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu said that an inspection of various sites in Salisbury indicated ""50, 100g or so"" had been used. He added that amount was more than was needed for ""research activities"", which would only require ""five to 10g"". However, the OPCW then released a statement saying it ""would not be able to estimate or determine the amount of the nerve agent"" used in Salisbury. It added: ""The quantity should probably be characterised in milligrams."" When asked by BBC to clarify whether Mr Uzumcu had meant to say ""milligrams"" in his first estimate or genuinely thought 100g had been used, the OPCW merely stated that milligrams ""should have been used"". Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury clean-up begins in bench area Mr Uzumcu also said the nerve agent was in liquid form and could have been applied with an aerosol spray or, ""if you take the necessary measures, you could use it as a liquid"". ""One thing, perhaps, which is important to note is that the nerve agent seems to be very persistent,"" he added. ""It's not affected by weather conditions. That explains, actually, that they were able to identify it after a considerable time lapse. We understand it was also of high purity."" The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He says the nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. Read more about Novichok agents Mr Skripal, 66, remains in hospital but Ms Skripal, 33, was discharged on 9 April and taken to a secure location. Wiltshire Police Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who attended the scene, was also treated in hospital after being exposed to the chemical, but has since been discharged. A clean-up operation is under way in the Wiltshire city, although no time-frame has been given for its completion. Yulia and Sergei Skripal were critically ill for several weeks The UK has blamed Moscow for the attack, expelling 23 Russian diplomats and their families. Karen Pierce, the UK's representative to the United Nations, told a meeting in April there was ""no plausible alternative"" to the explanation that Russia was responsible. She said: ""No terrorist group or non-state actor would be able to produce this agent in the purity described by the OPCW testing and this is something Russia has acknowledged. ""The Russian state has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so today."" Twenty-nine countries also expelled 145 Russian officials in solidarity with the UK - and Nato ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. Moscow has denied any involvement and has responded by expelling British and US diplomats, as well as several from other countries. It has also closed the British Council in Russia and the British Consulate in St Petersburg.

"Sinn FÃ©in's Ãrfhlaith Begley is the new MP for West Tyrone Sinn FÃ©in's Ãrfhlaith Begley has won the West Tyrone by-election. The poll was triggered by theresignation of Sinn FÃ©in's Barry McElduffin January. Candidates from Northern Ireland's five main parties were represented on the ballot paper. The turnout was 55.13% - 35,337 of the 64,101 eligible voted. Ms Begley received 16,346 votes, with the DUP's Tom Buchanan second with 8,390. Who is the new West Tyrone MP? The turnout was down from 68% in the last Westminster election. A man has been charged with offences including carrying a firearm with criminal intent, and possession of a firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances. The 59-year-old man is due to appear at Dungannon Magistrates' Court later on Friday. It came after an incident at Greencastle polling station at Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School at about 13:00 BST. It is understood after handing over his ballot paper, a man produced what appeared to be a handgun. He then left the polling station and staff contacted the police. A man was arrested for allegedly having a gun in a polling station in Greencastle Members of the public were casting ballots at the time but were unaware of what was happening and no-one was harmed. Chief Electoral Officer Virginia McVea visited the polling station after the incident, and told the BBC she was very impressed with how staff conducted themselves, saying they remained calm throughout and were ""mindful of other people in the room at the time"".

The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He says the nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. Read more about Novichok agents Mr Skripal, 66, remains in hospital but Ms Skripal, 33, was discharged on 9 April and taken to a secure location. Wiltshire Police Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who attended the scene, was also treated in hospital after being exposed to the chemical, but has since been discharged. A clean-up operation is under way in the Wiltshire city, although no time-frame has been given for its completion. Yulia and Sergei Skripal were critically ill for several weeks The UK has blamed Moscow for the attack, expelling 23 Russian diplomats and their families. Karen Pierce, the UK's representative to the United Nations, told a meeting in April there was ""no plausible alternative"" to the explanation that Russia was responsible. She said: ""No terrorist group or non-state actor would be able to produce this agent in the purity described by the OPCW testing and this is something Russia has acknowledged. ""The Russian state has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so today."" Twenty-nine countries also expelled 145 Russian officials in solidarity with the UK - and Nato ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. Moscow has denied any involvement and has responded by expelling British and US diplomats, as well as several from other countries. It has also closed the British Council in Russia and the British Consulate in St Petersburg.

"Mohammed Hares is one of more than 150 Afghan interpreters who wrote to the home secretary asking for the fee to be waived Afghan interpreters who served with British troops fighting against the Taliban will be able to stay in the UK for free, the home secretary has said. More than 150 Afghans given five-year residency permits said they faced being sent back to Afghanistan when they expire, unless they paid Â£2,389 to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Sajid Javid said the fees had been waived. A spokesman for the translators said they were ""delighted"" with the news. But the group asked that their families be allowed to join them. Currently, the interpreters' wives and children are not allowed to live in the UK unless they travelled at the same time as those given permits. The group called this a ""miserable injustice"" because it was not possible for many families to gain the necessary documents to travel at the time. Afghan interpreters worked with the Army on the frontline in Helmand Province The group also said they were having to pay more than Â£1,000 to get proper documentation for children born in the UK. The home secretary said about 400 former Afghan interpreters had relocated to the UK as part of the government scheme. Mr Javid said: ""The local Afghan interpreters worked in dangerous and challenging situations, regularly putting their lives at risk. ""We have always been clear that they will be able to stay in the UK with their families and today I have announced that they will be able to do this for free."" He added that the Home Office was ""looking again at what can be done"" to make it easier for the interpreters to bring their wives and children into the country. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson said he was ""thrilled"" at Mr Javid's announcement and it was ""important we deliver"" for the interpreters. Sajid Javid said the interpreters had worked in dangerous conditions Interpreter Mohammad Walizada, who worked for the British military between 2009 and 2015, and relocated to the UK in 2016, said the situation ""should never have happened in the first place"". The 27-year-old, who now lives in Manchester, said being forced to return to Afghanistan would be like ""waiting for your death to come"". It is the second time in as many months the government has waived the indefinite leave to remain fee for a specific group of people. In April, the then-home secretary Amber Rudd saidall such fees would be axed for the Windrush generationand their families.

"Ping Kuen Shum said his fortune was ""unbelievable"" In what might just be the best day ever, a Canadian man has won a lottery jackpot on the day he retired, which was also his birthday. Vancouver's Ping Kuen Shum bought a lotto ticket on 28 April as he was in high spirits from his birthday and the last day of his working life. That night, the British Columbia Lottery Corporation confirmed that he had just scooped C$2m ($1.5m; Â£1.1m). Mr Ping celebrated by tucking into a dim sum meal with family and friends. He is planning a trip to China with his newly acquired retirement nest egg. ""It's unbelievable that all three events happened on the same day,"" said Mr Ping of his astonishing hat-trick. ""I have worked hard for so many years and I'm looking forward to sharing this fortune with my family."" Mr Ping matched all six numbers - 09, 12, 13, 18, 21 and 29 - to hit the whole jackpot. The British Columbia Lottery Corporation calculated the chances of getting all six numbers as one in 13,983,816. The organisation said it could not disclose Mr Ping's age and occupation.

"A sonar image of one of the shipwrecks discovered in 2015 Two shipwrecks found during a failed search for Malaysia Airlines flight 370 were merchant vessels that sank in the 19th Century, researchers say. The ships, discovered 2,300km (1,400 miles) off Western Australia, have been narrowed down by experts to a handful of coal-carrying British vessels. Searchers stumbled on the wrecks during a trawl of the Indian Ocean in 2015. Australian maritime researchers used sonar pictures and shipping records in their efforts to identify the vessels. The location of MH370 remains unknown more than four years after it disappeared, carrying 239 people, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. One of the ships, spotted in December 2015, was identified as an iron barque. Dr Ross Anderson, curator of maritime archaeology from the Western Australian Museum, said it was likely to be one of three vessels: the West Ridge (lost in 1883), Kooringa (1894) or Lake Ontario (1897). The West Ridge, which vanished along with its 28 crew on a trip from England to India, appeared to be the closest match, he said. Dr Anderson said the vessel weighed between 1,000 and 1,500 tonnes and was found relatively intact and upright on the sea bed, about 4km below water level. The other vessel, found about 36km away in May 2015, had a wooden hull. This image shows an iron water tank from the wooden ship, researchers say Dr Anderson said two possibilities were the W. Gordon, which had been heading from Scotland to Australia in 1877, or the Magdala, which was lost in 1882 en route from Wales to Indonesia. The ships most likely had crews of between 15 and 30 men, he said. ""The evidence points to the ship sinking as a result of a catastrophic event such as explosion, which was common in the transport of coal cargoes,"" Dr Anderson said. MH370 mystery 'inconceivable in modern era' Too soon for MH370 memorial, say relatives He said his team could not be certain of the ships' identities due to incomplete historical records. The shipwrecks were found during the official search for MH370 by Australia, Malaysia and China. The unsuccessful mission ended in January 2016 after 1,046 days. Aprivate US firm began another search for the plane earlier this year. Now in its final weeks, it has not turned up any clues.

"Welcome back: Young people are delaying moving out from their family home People in England and Wales were much more likely to move home in the 1970s than in the first decade of the 2000s, says research by population experts. The study, based on census data over 40 years, shows a picture of people becoming progressively less mobile, for both renters and homeowners. Dr Ian Shuttleworth, from Queen's University Belfast, says there had been a long term ""change in behaviour"". He said this lack of movement could be part of a slowdown in social mobility. The research, part of an international demographic project, shows that at least a million fewer people moved between 2001 and 2011 compared with 1971 to 1981, once other changes in population have been taken into account. It shows that the pattern of people moving up the housing ladder - and expecting to keep moving to a bigger or better home or more desirable location - was much more common in the 1970s and 1980s than in the 2000s. They might also put up with longer commutes rather than move for work, say the researchers. ""People now just move less than they did in the 1970s,"" says Dr Shuttleworth. Goodbye to the Good Life? The rapid rise up the housing ladder of the 1970s has slowed The researchers thought that such a big drop in moving home could have been driven by an ageing population, with older people less likely to move house. But this only accounted for about a third of the change and there was a similar pattern common across other age groups. Dr Shuttleworth says it seems to reflect a deeper social change, with a significant decline in the numbers of people changing address and moving location. 'It costs so much to move and the houses aren't there' Friday 13th shunned by home movers Fewest Londoners moving house since 1991, reports CML In the 1970s, 55% of people moved address across the course of a decade, and in the 2000s that had fallen to 45%. This reduction in moving elsewhere applied to those in work and those unemployed, in social housing as well as private renting and home owners. In particular, it seemed to affect local moves - where people might have only moved a few miles away - suggesting that people were less likely to be making aspirational upward moves in their local areas or downsizing as people grew older. Dr Shuttleworth says this could be driven by changes in the housing market, with the rising cost of property and a shortage of affordable housing making a move more difficult and expensive. There could also be ""life stages being delayed"", so that young people who might once have moved out are still living in their family home. People are staying put - but are they ""contented stayers"" or ""frustrated stayers""? Concerns about job insecurity could mean that people prefer to take long commutes, rather than commit to moving themselves and their families closer to work. Or else it could be a more positive decision, said Dr Shuttleworth, with people feeling ""rooted"" in their current home and community. ""We don't know whether they are contented stayers or frustrated stayers,"" says the population geographer. If the postcode search does not load,click to launch the interactive content,external. The growing lack of mobility is despite the rise in levels of young people going to university, which has been seen as a driver for people to change address and move to different towns. This decline in ""internal migration"" in England and Wales is part of a wider international pattern, with similar falls in mobility in the United States, say the researchers. In terms of the labour market and economy, it suggests that people are less likely to risk uprooting to move to a new job or to new areas. Dr Shuttleworth says the decline in moves ""may have implications for social mobility"".

"Labour is now Trafford Council's largest party with 30 seats The Conservatives have lost control of Trafford Council - the party's only council in Greater Manchester and its flagship northern council. The party lost five seats leaving the local authority with no party in overall control. Labour is the largest party with 30 seats. The Conservatives have 29 seats and the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party have two seats each. Labour gained four, the Green Party gained two, and the Lib Dems lost one. Manchester City Council, which had all its seats up for election, was retained by Labour, although lone Liberal Democrat councillor John Leech now has a companion with Richard Kirkpatrick joining him representing Didsbury West. Trafford was the Tories' flagship northern council Salford saw its youngest ever councillor elected - Laura Edwards, 19, took the Walkden South seat for Labour, one of the party's two gains in the city. Conservatives gained one seat. Ms Edwards replaces Tory leader Les Turner, who moved wards for this election, standing in the safe Conservative seat of Worsley. Andrew Western, Labour leader in Trafford, said the Trafford Council result was ""far beyond our expectations"". ""We hoped to take the council into no overall control tonight, but to have become the largest party at the same time is a fantastic bonus for us,"" he said. The Conservative Party's Sean Anstee, who led Trafford Council going into the election, said his party had not done enough ""to get all of our messages to land"". ""We need to consider and reflect what that means for the people and businesses of Trafford,"" he said. ""I will need to think about what we do next and how we come back."" The council had been Tory-controlled since 2004. Sir Graham Brady, Conservative MP for Altrincham and Sale West, said the result was ""deeply disappointing"". By BBC Radio Manchester political reporter Matthew Bone The results are in and there's a deal to be done. There are 63 councillors in Trafford including two Greens and a pair of Lib Dems. This little gang of four holds all the cards though. Because they could put either of the major parties into power, they just need to name their price. Labour is the biggest party so it's expected to be in pole position, but the Conservatives haven't given up hope yet. While the votes have been counted, the struggle for power in Trafford is far from over. Stockport Council remains no overall control with Labour still the largest party. The party gained two wards and now has 23 seats, compared with 21 for the Lib Dems and 13 for the Tories. The Lib Dems and Tories both lost a seat each. In Cheadle Hulme North, Labour candidate David Meller beat the Lib Dems' Claire Halliwell by just two votes. Stockport Labour leader Alex Ganotis said it was a ""fantastic"" night. Rochdale and Tameside remain Labour strongholds with no seat changes. Labour held Bury but did lose one seat to the Tories. Oldham Council also remained Labour-controlled with the party gaining an additional two seats. The Tories doubled their number of seats from two to four and the Lib Dems lost one of their seats and now have eight on the council. UKIP were wiped out in Oldham, losing both their seats. The Farnworth and Kearsley First Party won two seats in Bolton The main exceptions to Labour's positive night were in Wigan and Bolton. Five seats were lost by Labour in Wigan with two taken by the Conservatives and three by independent candidates. In Bolton, although the party held the council, they lost four seats. The Conservatives won three and the Lib Dems took one while UKIP lost two. The recently-formed Farnworth and Kearsley First Party, which won its first seatat a by-election in March, won two seats.

"Elections are about asking voters what they want and what they think. This time round, what the public has said back to politicians, is we don't want big changes yet. Only just over half of the results from around England have come through so far, and I can't say that enough. But as things stand it looks like the Labour Party have made some gains in London, but small steps, rather than the dramatic strides some had expected. They had poured energy and the enthusiasm of their huge number of new activists particularly into London boroughs and that seems to have come up short. Live: Election results and updates Mixed picture in English council elections There could well be some head-scratching in Labour HQ about how that can be explained. It is certainly too soon to suggest that we have reached ""peak Corbyn"", as Conservative former education secretary Justine Greening has suggested.     Labour will be able to point to picking up Plymouth Council and removing the patch of blue in the sea of red that was Trafford, in the North West, from Tory control. Before the full picture is clear, it looks as if Labour has moved on slightly since the general election. But, in the words of Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde,  Jeremy Corbyn's party has come out of this more or less ""empty-handed"", and they can't show the kind of progress they would be shouting about if they were truly convinced they were on a rapid march to Number 10. The Tories have avoided the kind of wipe-out they feared and there will be huge relief in Conservative HQ this morning. After a torrid time since the start of the year, and significant divisions in the Tory Party, they could well have expected to take more of a hammering at the polls. But there are in these results, reminders of where their support really is. Where support has moved to Theresa May's party it has primarily been in areas that voted Leave in the EU referendum, heaping even more pressure on the Tories to get Brexit right. And Losing Richmond, in South West London to the Lib Dems is a reminder of how some voters in Remain-tending areas will turn away. Remember, this isn't done yet, there are many more results to come. But this has not been a night of change, but a night where voters seemed to have broadly backed the status quo.

It shows that the pattern of people moving up the housing ladder - and expecting to keep moving to a bigger or better home or more desirable location - was much more common in the 1970s and 1980s than in the 2000s. They might also put up with longer commutes rather than move for work, say the researchers. ""People now just move less than they did in the 1970s,"" says Dr Shuttleworth. Goodbye to the Good Life? The rapid rise up the housing ladder of the 1970s has slowed The researchers thought that such a big drop in moving home could have been driven by an ageing population, with older people less likely to move house. But this only accounted for about a third of the change and there was a similar pattern common across other age groups. Dr Shuttleworth says it seems to reflect a deeper social change, with a significant decline in the numbers of people changing address and moving location. 'It costs so much to move and the houses aren't there' Friday 13th shunned by home movers Fewest Londoners moving house since 1991, reports CML In the 1970s, 55% of people moved address across the course of a decade, and in the 2000s that had fallen to 45%. This reduction in moving elsewhere applied to those in work and those unemployed, in social housing as well as private renting and home owners. In particular, it seemed to affect local moves - where people might have only moved a few miles away - suggesting that people were less likely to be making aspirational upward moves in their local areas or downsizing as people grew older. Dr Shuttleworth says this could be driven by changes in the housing market, with the rising cost of property and a shortage of affordable housing making a move more difficult and expensive. There could also be ""life stages being delayed"", so that young people who might once have moved out are still living in their family home. People are staying put - but are they ""contented stayers"" or ""frustrated stayers""? Concerns about job insecurity could mean that people prefer to take long commutes, rather than commit to moving themselves and their families closer to work. Or else it could be a more positive decision, said Dr Shuttleworth, with people feeling ""rooted"" in their current home and community. ""We don't know whether they are contented stayers or frustrated stayers,"" says the population geographer. If the postcode search does not load,click to launch the interactive content,external. The growing lack of mobility is despite the rise in levels of young people going to university, which has been seen as a driver for people to change address and move to different towns. This decline in ""internal migration"" in England and Wales is part of a wider international pattern, with similar falls in mobility in the United States, say the researchers. In terms of the labour market and economy, it suggests that people are less likely to risk uprooting to move to a new job or to new areas. Dr Shuttleworth says the decline in moves ""may have implications for social mobility"".

"Passwords that should have been scrambled were exposed on Twitter's network Twitter's 330 million users are being urged to change their passwords after some were exposed in plain text on its internal network. An error in the way the passwords were handled meant some were stored in easily readable form, said Twitter. The passwords should have been put through a procedure called ""hashing"" making them very difficult to read. Security experts said the way Twitter handled the potential breach was ""encouraging"". The bug caused the passwords to be stored on an internal computer log before the hashing process was completed. In a blog,the social network said once the mistake was uncovered,externalit carried out an internal investigation which found no indication passwords were stolen or misused by insiders. However, it still urged all users to consider changing their passwords ""out of an abundance of caution"". Twitter did not say how many passwords were affected but it is understood the number was ""substantial"" and that they were exposed for ""several months"". Twitter discovered the bug a few weeks ago and has reported it to some regulators, an insider told Reuters. Chief executive Jack Dorsey tweeted to say the ""bug"" had been fixed.

"With the final result declared Labour has taken control of Tower Hamlets, but has failed to take other target councils in London, while the Conservatives have lost control of two councils overall. The Lib Dems have gained four councils, two of them in London. UKIP has lost over 120 councillors and the Greens have a net increase of eight councillors. Those councils changing hands are listed below. In total, 4,371 seats were contested across 150 local authorities, in the first major test of public opinion since last year's general election.  Maps built using Carto. If you can't see the map,tap or click here,external. Based on the results, the gap in predicted national vote share between the Conservatives and Labour has closed since the council elections last year. The fortunes of the main parties were different inside and outside London. Labour made gains in the capital picking up 65 councillors, while the Conservatives lost 90 seats. In the rest of England excluding London, the Tories gained 57 seats, while Labour took an additional 12. The Lib Dems and the Greens both gained more council seats in London than in the rest of England. Labour have takenPlymouthfrom the Conservatives and gained control ofKirkleesandTower Hamlets. However, in the north they lost overall control ofNuneaton and Bedworth, andDerby, while also losing some seats in strongholds likeWiganandSheffield. In London, Labour gained multiple seats inWandsworthandWestminster, as the map below shows - but these gains were not enough to take control of each borough.  The Conservatives gained control ofBasildonandPeterboroughcouncils thanks to the collapse in UKIP support, and won some seats inWakefieldandLeeds, traditional Labour areas. In London, the Tories gained seats inHillingdon- which some had touted as a potential Labour target - and won nine more seats inSutton, despite the area remaining in Lib Dem control. However, they lost control ofTrafford,Plymouth,KingstonandRichmond- where they lost 28 seats in total.  The Liberal Democrats won control ofRichmond-upon-Thames, gaining 24 seats in the process in one of the biggest swings of the night. The party also tookThree Rivers,KingstonandSouth Cambridgeshire. They also had strong showings in the Labour areas ofHullandMerton, and the Tory council ofGosport,  The party has lost over 120 councillors across the country, with heavy losses inGreat YarmouthandBasildon, as the map below shows. It has only managed to hold on to a handful of seats so far.

"This video can not be played Sir John Curtice: Labour gains are par for the course The election results will come as a disappointment to Labour, relief for the Conservatives and mild encouragement for the Liberal Democrats. But what role did factors such as Brexit and the votes of young people play, ask Prof John Curtice and colleagues on the BBC's local elections team. It was a night in which big swings were rare - apart from a collapse in the UKIP vote. That enabled all three main parties to register gains, but with none of them making a decisive advance. Labour's sole council gain so far was inPlymouth. More disappointing for the party was a failure to gain a single council in London, in particular the Tory totems ofWandsworthorWestminster. Outside the capital, the party lost control of bothDerbyandNuneaton. The Liberal Democrats managed to captureRichmond-upon-Thamesfrom the Conservatives, where their party leader, Sir Vince Cable, is a local MP. But the Conservatives had the consolation of winning control of bothBasildonandPeterborough. Local election results 2018: A mixed picture Latest updates: Local elections 2018 Laura Kuenssberg: Voters back status quo So, what does this tell us about how the parties have fared - and why? Behind these gains and losses is a clear pattern of rises and falls in the levels of party support. Most of the seats being contested were previously fought over in 2014, when Labour were narrowly ahead of the Conservatives in the opinion polls. At that time, UKIP were riding the crest of a wave, while the Liberal Democrats were in the doldrums. Thanks to a collapse in UKIP support almost everywhere, both the Conservatives and Labour are enjoying more support this year than they did four years ago. The BBC's projected national vote share puts both parties on 35%. This could be seen as a draw, so far as both parties' national performance was concerned. The Lib Dems are on 16% according the BBC estimate, which uses the results of key wards to estimate what a Britain-wide vote would have been. The absence of any substantial net swing between the two largest parties is broadly in line with what might have been expected from the opinion polls, which put the Conservatives just a nose ahead. Yet Labour had allowed expectations that the party would make big gains to grow, and especially that the party might perform spectacularly in London. Instead Jeremy Corbyn has come away virtually empty handed, while the Conservatives have emerged virtually unscathed. Not everywhere swung the same way. As in last year's general election, the Conservatives fared better in places that voted for Leave than in those that voted for Remain. The Conservative vote is up by 13 points where more than 60% backed Leave. These are the areas where UKIP had performed best four years ago.     However, the Conservatives have dropped by one point in areas where less than 45% voted Leave. Not least of the reasons for this divergence is that UKIP performed best in 2014 in Leave-voting areas. The collapsed UKIP vote in such places seems to have swung disproportionately behind the Conservatives, much as it did in last year's general election. This pattern helps explain why the Conservatives' performance is weaker in London, which voted by three to two in favour of Remain. The Conservative vote is only up one point in the capital, while Labour's vote increased by four points. Consequently the party has lost more than 60 seats in London, whereas it gained around 60 in other parts of the country. Also in evidence, as in last year's general election, is a tendency for the Conservatives to fall back most heavily in places with large numbers of young voters. In wards where more than 35% of the population are aged 18 to 34, the Conservative vote fell by one point. But it increased by eight points where fewer than 20% belong to this age group. Conversely, the Conservatives performed better the more pensioners there were in the ward. Its vote is up by as much as 10 points on average where more than 20% of the population are aged 65 or over. As well as struggling in places with relatively large numbers of young adults, the Conservatives did less well where there were more graduates and people from an ethnic minority background. All of these were groups that were disinclined to vote for Brexit. Liberal Democrat support has increased on average by three points. However, this represents no more than a modest improvement on the poor 2014 result that the party was trying to defend. Despite being the only significant party in England that opposes Brexit, the Liberal Democrats did not perform noticeably better in Remain voting areas. Rather, the party's best performances seem to have been reserved for where the party was already relatively strong locally. Meanwhile, the Greens found themselves trying to withstand a receding tide, with an average drop of 2 points to 7% in those wards where the party put up candidates. However, the party had the consolation of making a net gain of six seats. And, for a small party, occasional electoral success can be an invaluable lifeline.

"Elections are about asking voters what they want and what they think. This time round, what the public has said back to politicians, is we don't want big changes yet. Only just over half of the results from around England have come through so far, and I can't say that enough. But as things stand it looks like the Labour Party have made some gains in London, but small steps, rather than the dramatic strides some had expected. They had poured energy and the enthusiasm of their huge number of new activists particularly into London boroughs and that seems to have come up short. Live: Election results and updates Mixed picture in English council elections There could well be some head-scratching in Labour HQ about how that can be explained. It is certainly too soon to suggest that we have reached ""peak Corbyn"", as Conservative former education secretary Justine Greening has suggested.     Labour will be able to point to picking up Plymouth Council and removing the patch of blue in the sea of red that was Trafford, in the North West, from Tory control. Before the full picture is clear, it looks as if Labour has moved on slightly since the general election. But, in the words of Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde,  Jeremy Corbyn's party has come out of this more or less ""empty-handed"", and they can't show the kind of progress they would be shouting about if they were truly convinced they were on a rapid march to Number 10. The Tories have avoided the kind of wipe-out they feared and there will be huge relief in Conservative HQ this morning. After a torrid time since the start of the year, and significant divisions in the Tory Party, they could well have expected to take more of a hammering at the polls. But there are in these results, reminders of where their support really is. Where support has moved to Theresa May's party it has primarily been in areas that voted Leave in the EU referendum, heaping even more pressure on the Tories to get Brexit right. And Losing Richmond, in South West London to the Lib Dems is a reminder of how some voters in Remain-tending areas will turn away. Remember, this isn't done yet, there are many more results to come. But this has not been a night of change, but a night where voters seemed to have broadly backed the status quo.

"This video can not be played BBC Weather's Alina Jenkins looks at the forecast Temperatures could reach 27C (81F) in parts of England on Monday, which would make it the hottest early May Bank Holiday on record. The South East can expect the highest temperatures - while Wales and Scotland could also see temperatures in the mid to high 20s, BBC forecasters said. The warmest early May Bank Holiday Monday on record was 23.6C, in 1999. But this Monday could be the hottest since 1978, when the early May Bank Holiday was introduced. The average high for the May Bank Holiday in London is about 18C. The highest temperatures of 26C and 27C are expected in south-east England, particularly around west London. In East Anglia temperatures could reach 25C, while northern England and Wales are likely to have highs of 23C. It will be slightly cooler in south-west England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with most places between 19C to 22C. The RAC said a total of 8.5 million journeys are expected on the road between Friday and Monday. By 17:00 BST on Friday, stretches of several motorways were heavily congested, the RAC said. Traffic was at a standstill at the M5 and M4 near Bristol and there were long delays on roads near Exeter, as people headed to the south-west of England. How hot is it where you are?

"This video can not be played Ex-Black Rod: John Bercow called me an anti-Semite Commons Speaker John Bercow creates a climate of ""fear and intimidation"", an ex-senior Parliament official has said. David Leakey, who was responsible for keeping order in the House of Lords, told BBC Newsnight he had seen ""bullying and unreasonable"" behaviour. He is the second official to accuse the Speaker of bullying. Earlier in the week Mr Bercow's ex-private secretary accused him of ""angry outbursts"". Mr Bercow's official spokesman has rejected all of the claims. Mr Leakey, who served as Black Rod until 2017, said he had a disagreement with Mr Bercow over seating arrangements for a ""high profile visit"" at Westminster. He said ""the red mist descended"" on Mr Bercow who ""banged the table, yelled and was highly insulting to me personally"". Mr Leakey said the speaker called him an ""anti-Semite"" for which Mr Bercow later apologised. The former Black Rod said: ""For me it's water off a duck's back but if that happened to someone else who was not used to that sort of treatment, that is by any definition bullying, it is intimidating, unreasonable, disproportionate."" Mr Leakey said Mr Bercow's behaviour could be seen by the public in the chamber where the speaker ""intimidates, mimics and mocks"" MPs. He said MPs were ""fearful"" of complaining because the speaker could be ""vindictive"" and not call on them to speak in the future. Mr Leakey said he did not believe Mr Bercow ""matches up to the standard"" he would expect from a public servant. He also said removing Mr Bercow would need the support of the Labour party but they ""obtain a considerable political benefit"" from the speaker's treatment of Conservative front-benchers. A spokesman for Mr Bercow's office said: ""John Bercow and David Leakey are two very different people with very different backgrounds, perspectives and ideas. ""They had fundamental disagreements in 2011 and 2012, but interacted adequately after that."" Bercow claims 'concerning', says No 10 Harassment at the House of Commons MPs' discipline 'cannot be left to MPs' The Speaker's Chaplain Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin told BBC's Daily Politics that Mr Bercow was ""very kind, caring and compassionate."" ""I know that if he felt that he had done something to someone, that he would be mortified,"" she said. ""It feels like a frenzy at the moment and that concerns me. Not only in relation to Mr Bercow, but in terms of other MPs, there are times when a frenzy is whipped up around individuals and that is quite concerning in terms of their well-being."" This video can not be played John Bercow is asked in the Commons about bullying allegations against him On Wednesday, the prime minister's spokesman said that allegations of bullying against Mr Bercow claims were ""concerning"" and should be properly investigated. Mr Bercow's former private secretaryAngus Sinclair has claimed that the Speaker shouted and swore at him, and attempted to physically intimidate him. Mr Sinclair toldNewsnightthat he faced angry outbursts from Mr Bercow whilst working for him in 2009-10. A spokesman for Mr Bercow said there was ""no substance"" to the allegations. Mr Bercow said in the Commons on Wednesday:  ""I have a superb team of dedicated, effective and long-serving staff, five of whom have served me for a collective total of over 40 years. ""I am also happy to confirm that the great majority of people who have left my service have done so on perfectly amicable terms."" An inquiry, under Dame Laura Cox QC, is under way into claims of bullying by MPs. Leader of the House and Tory MP Andrea Leadsom said on Wednesday it was up to Dame Laura to decide if her independent inquiry needed to be expanded to allow for investigations into individuals to take place.

"Passwords that should have been scrambled were exposed on Twitter's network Twitter's 330 million users are being urged to change their passwords after some were exposed in plain text on its internal network. An error in the way the passwords were handled meant some were stored in easily readable form, said Twitter. The passwords should have been put through a procedure called ""hashing"" making them very difficult to read. Security experts said the way Twitter handled the potential breach was ""encouraging"". The bug caused the passwords to be stored on an internal computer log before the hashing process was completed. In a blog,the social network said once the mistake was uncovered,externalit carried out an internal investigation which found no indication passwords were stolen or misused by insiders. However, it still urged all users to consider changing their passwords ""out of an abundance of caution"". Twitter did not say how many passwords were affected but it is understood the number was ""substantial"" and that they were exposed for ""several months"". Twitter discovered the bug a few weeks ago and has reported it to some regulators, an insider told Reuters. Chief executive Jack Dorsey tweeted to say the ""bug"" had been fixed.

"Bill Cosby and Roman Polanski have been expelled from the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The academy - which runs the Oscars - said this was done in accordance with its standards of conduct. TV star Cosby was convicted of sexual assault last month. Oscar-winning director Polanski admitted unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977. Producer Harvey Weinstein was kicked out last year, following numerous allegations of sexual assault. Less than a year after the downfall of the producer the #MeToo movement is catching up with other men who abused their power, the BBC's James Cook in Los Angeles reports. Neither Cosby nor Polanski have publicly reacted to the academy's decision. Cosby's wife, Camille, described his conviction as ""mob justice, not real justice"". ""This tragedy must be undone not just for Bill Cosby, but for the country,"" she said. Oscars board expels Harvey Weinstein Bill Cosby: The fall of 'America's Dad' The prestigious organisation made the announcement on Thursday - two days after its board members voted on the issue. In a statement, it said its board ""has voted to expel actor Bill Cosby and director Roman Polanski from its membership in accordance with the organisation's Standards of Conduct"". ""The Board continues to encourage ethical standards that require members to uphold the Academy's values of respect for human dignity,"" it added. Only four people are known to have been expelled in its 91-year history. The first was actor Carmine Caridi, who had his membership revoked in 2004 afterhe allegedly sent confidential film preview videos,externalto a friend which ended up online. On social media, many people have been asking what took the academy so long to take action against Polanski, who has been honoured in the decades since he admitted to statutory rape. 1981: Best Director for Tess 2003: Best Picture for The Pianist 2003: Best Director for The Pianist (which he won) The unlawful sex case against Polanski, now aged 84, has dragged on for more than 40 years. Polanski admitted unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer, who was a minor in 1977, and served 42 days in prison, but later fled the US over concern that a plea bargain deal would be scrapped. This video can not be played Samantha Geimar: Consequences of rape were awful He has French and Polish citizenship, and has evaded various extradition attempts by US authorities. France - where he lives - does not extradite its own citizens. A Polish court also rejected a US request when he was filming in Krakow in 2015. The Swiss authorities also turned down a US warrant in 2010, after placing Polanski under house arrest for nine months. Last year,he was picked to head the jury at the CÃ©sars, the French equivalent of the Oscars. He stepped down after the move sparked outrage. Last year, Ms Geimer told a US court she had forgiven Polanski and wanted to move on. But the court refused her plea. By James Cook, BBC News, Los Angeles Why now? That's the question, isn't it? For Bill Cosby, the answer appears obvious. A criminal conviction seems to be the standard which was applied in this case: expulsion from the academy came just one week after a guilty verdict. Roman Polanski's expulsion, by very stark contrast, comes more than 2,000 weeks after he pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor. Not only that but Harvey Weinstein was expelled without a criminal conviction although he faces (and denies) allegations of rape. So why did it take Hollywood more than 40 years to decide that the statutory rape of a 13-year-old was beneath its precious ""values of respect for human dignity""? The academy recently implemented revised standards of conduct for its 8,400 members, including a provision to suspend or expel those who ""compromise the integrity"" of the organisation. The real answer though does not lie in bureaucracy but in shame. The industry has been shamed into action by the disinfecting sunlight of the #MeToo and Time's Up movements. The problem for the academy is that this harsh glare is shining on many other members and with each expulsion the pressure grows to act in those cases too. In April, Cosby, 80, was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault, each of which carries a potential 10 years in prison. He was on trial for drugging and assaulting ex-basketball player Andrea Constand in 2004. It was the second time the actor had stood trial for the allegations, after an earlier jury failed to reach a verdict in 2017. Cosby starred in sitcom The Cosby Show, which was a global hit and ran from 1984-92. Cosby was widely known as ""America's Dad"" for his fatherly role in the comedy. At one point, he was the highest-paid actor in the US. The story of Bill Cosby's rise, fall and release The slow-burning Polanski saga Girl Polanski raped tells of impact.

"This video can not be played Sir John Curtice: Labour gains are par for the course The election results will come as a disappointment to Labour, relief for the Conservatives and mild encouragement for the Liberal Democrats. But what role did factors such as Brexit and the votes of young people play, ask Prof John Curtice and colleagues on the BBC's local elections team. It was a night in which big swings were rare - apart from a collapse in the UKIP vote. That enabled all three main parties to register gains, but with none of them making a decisive advance. Labour's sole council gain so far was inPlymouth. More disappointing for the party was a failure to gain a single council in London, in particular the Tory totems ofWandsworthorWestminster. Outside the capital, the party lost control of bothDerbyandNuneaton. The Liberal Democrats managed to captureRichmond-upon-Thamesfrom the Conservatives, where their party leader, Sir Vince Cable, is a local MP. But the Conservatives had the consolation of winning control of bothBasildonandPeterborough. Local election results 2018: A mixed picture Latest updates: Local elections 2018 Laura Kuenssberg: Voters back status quo So, what does this tell us about how the parties have fared - and why? Behind these gains and losses is a clear pattern of rises and falls in the levels of party support. Most of the seats being contested were previously fought over in 2014, when Labour were narrowly ahead of the Conservatives in the opinion polls. At that time, UKIP were riding the crest of a wave, while the Liberal Democrats were in the doldrums. Thanks to a collapse in UKIP support almost everywhere, both the Conservatives and Labour are enjoying more support this year than they did four years ago. The BBC's projected national vote share puts both parties on 35%. This could be seen as a draw, so far as both parties' national performance was concerned. The Lib Dems are on 16% according the BBC estimate, which uses the results of key wards to estimate what a Britain-wide vote would have been. The absence of any substantial net swing between the two largest parties is broadly in line with what might have been expected from the opinion polls, which put the Conservatives just a nose ahead. Yet Labour had allowed expectations that the party would make big gains to grow, and especially that the party might perform spectacularly in London. Instead Jeremy Corbyn has come away virtually empty handed, while the Conservatives have emerged virtually unscathed. Not everywhere swung the same way. As in last year's general election, the Conservatives fared better in places that voted for Leave than in those that voted for Remain. The Conservative vote is up by 13 points where more than 60% backed Leave. These are the areas where UKIP had performed best four years ago.     However, the Conservatives have dropped by one point in areas where less than 45% voted Leave. Not least of the reasons for this divergence is that UKIP performed best in 2014 in Leave-voting areas. The collapsed UKIP vote in such places seems to have swung disproportionately behind the Conservatives, much as it did in last year's general election. This pattern helps explain why the Conservatives' performance is weaker in London, which voted by three to two in favour of Remain. The Conservative vote is only up one point in the capital, while Labour's vote increased by four points. Consequently the party has lost more than 60 seats in London, whereas it gained around 60 in other parts of the country. Also in evidence, as in last year's general election, is a tendency for the Conservatives to fall back most heavily in places with large numbers of young voters. In wards where more than 35% of the population are aged 18 to 34, the Conservative vote fell by one point. But it increased by eight points where fewer than 20% belong to this age group. Conversely, the Conservatives performed better the more pensioners there were in the ward. Its vote is up by as much as 10 points on average where more than 20% of the population are aged 65 or over. As well as struggling in places with relatively large numbers of young adults, the Conservatives did less well where there were more graduates and people from an ethnic minority background. All of these were groups that were disinclined to vote for Brexit. Liberal Democrat support has increased on average by three points. However, this represents no more than a modest improvement on the poor 2014 result that the party was trying to defend. Despite being the only significant party in England that opposes Brexit, the Liberal Democrats did not perform noticeably better in Remain voting areas. Rather, the party's best performances seem to have been reserved for where the party was already relatively strong locally. Meanwhile, the Greens found themselves trying to withstand a receding tide, with an average drop of 2 points to 7% in those wards where the party put up candidates. However, the party had the consolation of making a net gain of six seats. And, for a small party, occasional electoral success can be an invaluable lifeline.

"The academy will now announce the 2018 winner along with the 2019 winner next year The organisation that decides the Nobel Prize for Literature has said it will not announce an award this year, after it was engulfed in a scandal over sexual assault allegations. The Swedish Academy has been in crisis over its handling of allegations against the husband of a member. She has since quit, as have the academy's head and four other members. The academy says it will now announce the 2018 winner along with the 2019 winner next year. The scandal is the biggest to hit the prize since it was first awarded in 1901. Apart from six years during the world wars, there has been only one year when the prize was not awarded. No worthy winner was found in 1935. This year's other Nobel prizes will go ahead as usual. In a statement on its website, the academy said,external: ""The present decision was arrived at in view of the currently diminished Academy and the reduced public confidence in the Academy."" It said that the academy's ""operative practices need to be evolved"", including tackling its statutes, conflict-of-interest issues and management of information. Anders Olsson, the academy's interim permanent secretary, said there needed to be ""long-term and robust work"" for change Some academy members had argued that the prize should proceed to protect the tradition, but others said the institution was in no state to present the award. The #MeToo campaign, which showed the prevalence of sexual assault globally, may have played a part in the academy's decision. It would have been difficult for potential winners to accept the prize with the academy in such turmoil. Analysis by Maddy Savage, BBC News, Stockholm This is an unusual but not entirely unexpected decision here in Sweden where internal spats between members and former members of the Swedish Academy have been headline news for months. The institution has faced deep criticism from the academic community with hundreds of professors, lecturers and researchers signing a number of letters calling for the academy to take action to restore its credibility. But this is a scandal that's also captured wider attention. Many Swedes are fiercely proud of the Nobel prizes and the fact that they live in a country that usually champions women's rights. Seeing the prestigious literature award committee unravel off the back of the mishandling of sexual assault allegations has been a bitter pill to swallow. Not everyone is confident the academy will regain its reputation in time for next year's prize announcements. Divisions started to emerge last November when French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, who ran a cultural project with funding from the Swedish Academy, was accused by 18 women of sexual assault. Several of the alleged incidents reportedly happened in properties belonging to the academy. Mr Arnault denies the allegations. The scandal behind the prize Photographer 'groped' princess at Swedish Academy event The organisation later voted against removing Mr Arnault's wife, the poet and writer Katarina Frostenson, from its committee. The academy's permanent secretary, Prof Sara Danius, resigned This, along with accusations of conflict of interest and the leaking of Nobel winners' names, divided the organisation. What followed was a wave of resignations, including Ms Frostenson and the head of the academy, Prof Sara Danius. Only 11 members are now in place. Of those, one, Kerstin Ekman, has been inactive since 1989, when the academy refused to condemn the fatwa issued over Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses. Swedish Academy head quits over probe Why women fear a #MeToo backlash The academy's statutes require a quorum of 12 to vote in any new members. Technically, members are appointed for life to the Swedish Academy and cannot resign, although they can refuse to take part. Academy patron King Carl XVI Gustaf has said he will change the rules to allow them to quit formally. The academy said: ""Work on the selection of a laureate is at an advanced stage and will continue as usual in the months ahead but the Academy needs time to regain its full complement, engage a larger number of active members and regain confidence in its work, before the next Literature Prize winner is declared."" Two prizes for literature will be announced next year, one for 2018 and one for 2019. This is not the first time this has happened. On five occasions a prize for one year has been awarded at the same time as the following year's prize. For example, American playwright Eugene O'Neill was given the 1936 award in 1937. A number have highlighted the importance of #MeToo, among other theories and opinions, including the neglect of Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o... Allow Twitter content?

"The prize is announced in the building which houses the Alfred Nobel Museum in Stockholm The decision to postpone the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature - one of the oldest and most prestigious cultural awards - follows a crisis over sexual assault allegations at the organisation which decides the winner. The Swedish Academy is under fire for how it dealt with alleged misconduct by French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, who is married to a former member of the centuries-old institution. The academy saysit will now announce the 2018 winner along with the 2019 winner next year. Last November, inspired by the #MeToo campaign, 18 women made allegations of sexual assault and harassment against Mr Arnault. Several of the alleged incidents reportedly happened in properties belonging to the academy. He denies all the allegations. The organisation then voted against removing his wife, the poet and writer Katarina Frostenson from its 18-person committee. This, along with accusations of conflict of interest and the leaking of Nobel winners' names is said to have divided the organisation and has sparked a wave of resignations, including Ms Frostenson and the head of the academy, Prof Sara Danius, leaving just 11 members in place. Normally secretive, academy members have attacked each other in public. One member, Horace Engdahl, called some of those resigning ""sore losers"" and described Prof Danius as the worst permanent secretary ever. Her supporters see Prof Danius as a reformer battling a patriarchal institution. After she quit some of them, including Sweden's culture minister,posted photos of themselves wearing a blouse favoured by Prof Danius in solidarity,external. Sara Danius quit as head of the Academy over the scandal Technically members cannot resign from their positions, which are for life, but they can stop participating in academy activities. The Swedish King King Carl XVI Gustaf says he will change those rules. Arnault has also been accused of groping the heir to the Swedish throne, Crown Princess Victoria, in 2006, something he denies. The Nobel Prize was established by Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel The academy saidthe decision to postpone this year's prize had been made due to a lack of public confidence.,external ""The Academy needs time to regain its full complement, engage a larger number of active members and regain confidence in its work,"" it said in a statement. Swedish National Television (SVT)'s culture editor Rebecca Lundberg, who has covered the woes extensively, told the BBC: ""It's very sad to all the authors... but it was a necessary decision. ""They have huge work to do. They have to recruit new members and that will be really hard. A lot of people don't want to be associated with the current academy."" The Swedish Academy also announced a review of its statutes and practices. In an earlier statement, it said the Nobel Prize for Literature's reputation had suffered ""greatly"",promising a plan to restore public confidence in the organisation,external. The academy's decision may have been influenced by the #MeToo campaign, which highlighted the extent of sexual assault in a number of countries. Potential winners may have found it difficult to accept the prize with the academy facing questions too. The circumstances that led to this year's award being postponed are unique but there have been years without a Nobel Prize for Literature. The prize has not been given out seven times in total, mostly during war years, although in 1935 it was thought no candidate deserved the prize. The last time there was no award was in 1943. Previous winners provide a formidable, eclectic mix. Recent years saw both US singer Bob Dylan and Belarusian writer and journalist Svetlana Alexievich claim the prize, while other recipients include Nigeria's Wole Soyinka, Colombian novelist Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez, dissident Russian author Alexandr Solzhenitsyn and Indian great Rabindranath Tagore.

"This video can not be played The Kilauea volcano erupted after a series of earthquakes on the island Kilauea volcano has erupted near a residential area on Hawaii's largest island, prompting a local state of emergency and the mandatory evacuation of 1,700 residents. Streams of lava have been seen running through woods and bubbling on to roads. Extreme levels of dangerous sulphur dioxide gas have been detected in the area, the Civil Defense Agency said. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes and the eruption follows a series of recent earthquakes. ""It sounds like a jet engine,"" resident Ikaika Marzo told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. ""It's going hard."" Community centres have been opened to provide shelter for evacuees. Talmadge Mango, the civil defence administrator for Hawaii County, said that power lines had melted off their poles in one area. ""Seismic activity is still extremely high, so we feel that this might just be the beginning of things,"" he said. The volcano's plume of smoke and ash is visible from a great distance Officials had been warning residents all week they should be prepared to evacuate as an eruption would give little warning. A volcanic crater vent - known as Puu Oo - collapsed earlier this week, sending lava down the mountain's slopes towards populated areas. Local resident Stephen Clapper said he had told his mother to pack a bag ""just in case"", and they wasted no time getting in the car to drive to safety after the eruption. ""My neighbour came running over and said, 'What's that awful noise?'"" Mr Clapper told local channel Khon TV. ""He said he had never heard a noise like it, and he's been here for 40 years."" Hawaii's Governor, David Ige, says he has activated military reservists from the National Guard to help evacuate thousands of people. Allow Twitter content?

Maija Stenback, eyewitness We live in Leilani Estates, about six blocks away from the eruption. We were evacuated a couple of hours ago and we are now with friends. Within about half an hour of the eruption, it was on social media, so me and my daughter went down to look at it. You could hear and feel the eruption a good half a mile away, and the closer you got, the more you could feel it. It was like when someone plays the bass really heavy, and you can feel the bass - you could really feel the power and the lava - the colour was unbelievable, and the sound was unbelievable. It sounds very explosive... It's spitting out as hard as it can. It's not so much what you hear, it's what you feel. One resident says: I'm not leaving Close-up footage shot by a drone showed lava emerging from a fissure in a wooded residential neighbourhood and oozing down a road. Earlier this year,a false alert warning of an incoming ballistic missile caused panic, leading the US state to reassess its alert system. Kilauea volcano erupts in Hawaii.

"This video can not be played Ex-Black Rod: John Bercow called me an anti-Semite Commons Speaker John Bercow creates a climate of ""fear and intimidation"", an ex-senior Parliament official has said. David Leakey, who was responsible for keeping order in the House of Lords, told BBC Newsnight he had seen ""bullying and unreasonable"" behaviour. He is the second official to accuse the Speaker of bullying. Earlier in the week Mr Bercow's ex-private secretary accused him of ""angry outbursts"". Mr Bercow's official spokesman has rejected all of the claims. Mr Leakey, who served as Black Rod until 2017, said he had a disagreement with Mr Bercow over seating arrangements for a ""high profile visit"" at Westminster. He said ""the red mist descended"" on Mr Bercow who ""banged the table, yelled and was highly insulting to me personally"". Mr Leakey said the speaker called him an ""anti-Semite"" for which Mr Bercow later apologised. The former Black Rod said: ""For me it's water off a duck's back but if that happened to someone else who was not used to that sort of treatment, that is by any definition bullying, it is intimidating, unreasonable, disproportionate."" Mr Leakey said Mr Bercow's behaviour could be seen by the public in the chamber where the speaker ""intimidates, mimics and mocks"" MPs. He said MPs were ""fearful"" of complaining because the speaker could be ""vindictive"" and not call on them to speak in the future. Mr Leakey said he did not believe Mr Bercow ""matches up to the standard"" he would expect from a public servant. He also said removing Mr Bercow would need the support of the Labour party but they ""obtain a considerable political benefit"" from the speaker's treatment of Conservative front-benchers. A spokesman for Mr Bercow's office said: ""John Bercow and David Leakey are two very different people with very different backgrounds, perspectives and ideas. ""They had fundamental disagreements in 2011 and 2012, but interacted adequately after that."" Bercow claims 'concerning', says No 10 Harassment at the House of Commons MPs' discipline 'cannot be left to MPs' The Speaker's Chaplain Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin told BBC's Daily Politics that Mr Bercow was ""very kind, caring and compassionate."" ""I know that if he felt that he had done something to someone, that he would be mortified,"" she said. ""It feels like a frenzy at the moment and that concerns me. Not only in relation to Mr Bercow, but in terms of other MPs, there are times when a frenzy is whipped up around individuals and that is quite concerning in terms of their well-being."" This video can not be played John Bercow is asked in the Commons about bullying allegations against him On Wednesday, the prime minister's spokesman said that allegations of bullying against Mr Bercow claims were ""concerning"" and should be properly investigated. Mr Bercow's former private secretaryAngus Sinclair has claimed that the Speaker shouted and swore at him, and attempted to physically intimidate him. Mr Sinclair toldNewsnightthat he faced angry outbursts from Mr Bercow whilst working for him in 2009-10. A spokesman for Mr Bercow said there was ""no substance"" to the allegations. Mr Bercow said in the Commons on Wednesday:  ""I have a superb team of dedicated, effective and long-serving staff, five of whom have served me for a collective total of over 40 years. ""I am also happy to confirm that the great majority of people who have left my service have done so on perfectly amicable terms."" An inquiry, under Dame Laura Cox QC, is under way into claims of bullying by MPs. Leader of the House and Tory MP Andrea Leadsom said on Wednesday it was up to Dame Laura to decide if her independent inquiry needed to be expanded to allow for investigations into individuals to take place.

"This video can not be played The storms destroyed homes and uprooted trees At least 125 people are now reported to have died in fierce dust storms in northern India, with officials warning of more bad weather to come. High-speed winds and lightning devastated many villages, bringing down walls and leaving dozens injured. An Uttar Pradesh relief commissioner's office spokesperson told AFP news agency the death toll was the highest from such storms in at least 20 years. Officials have said the death toll could rise as more bodies are found. Wind speeds were around 132 km/h (82mph) accompanied by hail storms and heavy lightning, officials said. India's Meteorological Department said more storms were likely,externalacross a wider area before the weekend. How a 'downburst' made India's storms more deadly Salman Ravi, BBC Hindi Villagers in Badhera, in the worst affected district of Agra in Uttar Pradesh, say they had had absolutely no warning of the storm that devastated their homes. This is despite senior police officials saying that an alert was issued across the northern state. The storm killed three people in the village, while several others were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Ten-year-old Abhishek Kumar was asleep with his family when the storm struck. Their house collapsed, trapping him and his brother in the debris. Villagers dug them out but while Abhishek survived, his brother did not. Dhambi Singh also suffered injuries but had to leave hospital to perform the last rites for his father who died when the roof of their house caved in. Villagers are now worried as they have been warned that a similar storm could strike the region again in the next 72 hours. ""People should be alert,"" the relief commissioner's office told AFP. In the two states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, the storm brought down electricity, uprooted trees, destroyed houses and killed livestock. The district of Agra in Uttar Pradesh, home of the Taj Mahal monument, was one of the areas worst hit. The storms also affected three districts in neighbouring Rajasthan state - Alwar, Bharatpur and Dholpur. Many of the dead were sleeping indoors when their houses collapsed after being struck by lightning or gusts of wind.

"President Granger said the deadly pirate attacks had ""come as a great setback"" Guyana's President David Granger has described as a ""massacre"" a pirate attack last week that is feared to have killed at least a dozen fishermen. ""It is a great massacre, a great tragedy,"" Mr Granger said on Thursday. Four boats carrying some 20 people were attacked off the coast of neighbouring Suriname in South America last Friday, local authorities said. The bodies of three men have since been found. Four others were said to have escaped, Reuters news agency reported. Some of the fishermen who remain missing were forced into the sea with weights tied to their legs, according to reports from the survivors. The men, most of them Guyanese, were beaten and robbed. Guyana country profile Why pirates choose kidnap over cargo Mr Granger told reporters on Thursday that Guyana had been ""very successful"" in curbing piracy in the region but that the latest deadly attacks had ""come as a great setback"". ""We extend sympathy to the families of the bereaved,"" he added. Search and rescue teams are continuing operations in the region, with Surinamese and Guyanese authorities working together, Mr Granger said. The families of the victims were told that they would be supported by the government.

"Welcome back: Young people are delaying moving out from their family home People in England and Wales were much more likely to move home in the 1970s than in the first decade of the 2000s, says research by population experts. The study, based on census data over 40 years, shows a picture of people becoming progressively less mobile, for both renters and homeowners. Dr Ian Shuttleworth, from Queen's University Belfast, says there had been a long term ""change in behaviour"". He said this lack of movement could be part of a slowdown in social mobility. The research, part of an international demographic project, shows that at least a million fewer people moved between 2001 and 2011 compared with 1971 to 1981, once other changes in population have been taken into account. It shows that the pattern of people moving up the housing ladder - and expecting to keep moving to a bigger or better home or more desirable location - was much more common in the 1970s and 1980s than in the 2000s. They might also put up with longer commutes rather than move for work, say the researchers. ""People now just move less than they did in the 1970s,"" says Dr Shuttleworth. Goodbye to the Good Life? The rapid rise up the housing ladder of the 1970s has slowed The researchers thought that such a big drop in moving home could have been driven by an ageing population, with older people less likely to move house. But this only accounted for about a third of the change and there was a similar pattern common across other age groups. Dr Shuttleworth says it seems to reflect a deeper social change, with a significant decline in the numbers of people changing address and moving location. 'It costs so much to move and the houses aren't there' Friday 13th shunned by home movers Fewest Londoners moving house since 1991, reports CML In the 1970s, 55% of people moved address across the course of a decade, and in the 2000s that had fallen to 45%. This reduction in moving elsewhere applied to those in work and those unemployed, in social housing as well as private renting and home owners. In particular, it seemed to affect local moves - where people might have only moved a few miles away - suggesting that people were less likely to be making aspirational upward moves in their local areas or downsizing as people grew older. Dr Shuttleworth says this could be driven by changes in the housing market, with the rising cost of property and a shortage of affordable housing making a move more difficult and expensive. There could also be ""life stages being delayed"", so that young people who might once have moved out are still living in their family home. People are staying put - but are they ""contented stayers"" or ""frustrated stayers""? Concerns about job insecurity could mean that people prefer to take long commutes, rather than commit to moving themselves and their families closer to work. Or else it could be a more positive decision, said Dr Shuttleworth, with people feeling ""rooted"" in their current home and community. ""We don't know whether they are contented stayers or frustrated stayers,"" says the population geographer. If the postcode search does not load,click to launch the interactive content,external. The growing lack of mobility is despite the rise in levels of young people going to university, which has been seen as a driver for people to change address and move to different towns. This decline in ""internal migration"" in England and Wales is part of a wider international pattern, with similar falls in mobility in the United States, say the researchers. In terms of the labour market and economy, it suggests that people are less likely to risk uprooting to move to a new job or to new areas. Dr Shuttleworth says the decline in moves ""may have implications for social mobility"".

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""There's much more to come and it's going to get even better"" Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour achieved ""solid"" English local election results despite not making big gains. The party failed to take several targets from the Tories, including Wandsworth, but won back Plymouth and became the largest party in Trafford. Theresa May praised Tory councillors after winning Barnet, Basildon and Peterborough. The party gained from a collapse in UKIP's vote. The BBC's projected national vote share puts both parties on 35%. Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice told the BBC it was ""a draw"", so far as both parties' national performance was concerned. The Lib Dems are on 16% according the BBC estimate, which uses the results of key wards to estimate what a Britain-wide vote would have been. Recap: How the election results unfolded Sir John Curtice: How important was Brexit? UKIP official compares party to the Black Death The final council to be declared was Tower Hamlets, which was gained by Labour from no overall control. Across the 150 council elections, Labour won 2,350 seats, up 77, the Conservatives won 1,332, down 33, the Lib Dems won 536, up 75, the Greens won 39, up eight and UKIP won three, down 123. The BBC estimate, based on 800 key wards, puts turnout at 36%, the same as in these wards four years ago. The Conservativesgained the London council of Barnetfrom no overall control, and held their flagship London councils of Westminster and Wandsworth. They also won Basildon and Peterborough, which had both also been under no overall control. But they havelost control of their northern flagship Trafford Councilafter 14 years of Conservative rule. Labour had high hopes for the night, and havewon Plymouth from the Toriesand gained Kirklees from no overall control butlost Nuneaton and BedworthandDerby. The Lib Dems have gained four councils, winning neighbouringKingston-upon-ThamesandRichmond-upon-Thamesin Greater London andSouth Cambridgeshirefrom the Tories andThree Riversfrom no overall control. The Greenshave gained seats- taking some from Labour in Sheffield and from the Tories in Richmond upon Thames. UKIP, which performed strongly last time most of the seats were fought in 2014,has seen its vote collapse. It had just three councillors elected, after losing 123. Sinn FÃ©inhas won the Westminster by-election in West Tyrone. Labour MP Dan Jarvis has beenelected mayor of the Sheffield City Region. This video can not be played Theresa May hails Tory campaigners in Wandsworth The Conservatives held on to their flagship London councils, gained control of Redditch from Labour and Barnet, Basildon and Peterborough, which had been under no overall control. But they have lost control of Trafford in Greater Manchester, a key northern stronghold, where Labour is now the largest party, Plymouth, and Mole Valley, Surrey - as well as losing two London councils to the Lib Dems. According to the BBC's projected national vote share, the party is three points down on what it achieved in 2017's county council elections but, after eight years in government, it is better than its performance in any of the local elections held between 2012 and 2014 and in 2016. Prime Minister Theresa May visited Wandsworth on Friday morning - one of the Conservative's key London councils which the party held, despite losing eight seats. She said: ""Labour thought they could take control, this was one of their top targets and they threw everything at it, but they failed."" She said the party ""won't take anything for granted"" and would ""build on this success for the future"". Party chairman Brandon Lewis acknowledged some disappointments, but told BBC Breakfast that voters had chosen the Tories after seeing ""good, clear and strong leadership"" from the prime minister. Labour did pick up a seat in the Tory stronghold of Kensington and Chelsea Council, but the Conservatives retained control, despite criticism of their handling of the Grenfell Tower disaster. Tory leader of the council, Elizabeth Campbell, said they needed to ""rebuild trust"". Labour had hoped to take control of Wandsworth Labour was defending the most seats - more than 2,200 - and had talked up its prospects in London, where it made gains in last year's general election. The party gained control of Plymouth from the Conservatives as well as Kirklees, but lost control of two Midlands councils - Derby and Nuneaton and Bedworth - to no overall control. Its hopes of seizing control of Wandsworth and Westminster proved unfounded while the party lost ground in Hillingdon. Labour's projected national vote share - at 35% - is its best such performance since 2012 and puts it neck and neck with the Conservatives - but in 2013, 2014 and 2016 it was estimated to be narrowly ahead of the Tories. Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party's win in Plymouth was a ""fantastic result"" and ""a sign that Labour is back in this part of Britain"". Of the party's performance more widely, he said ""obviously I'm disappointed at any places where we lost a bit of ground"" but described it as a ""solid set of results"" which left the party ""well placed to fight and win the next general election"". Deputy leader Tom Watson said Labour now had more councillors in London than at any time since the 1970s. Shadow Local Government Secretary Andrew Gwynne said he believed the anti-Semitism row had had an impact on the result in Barnet, north London, which the Tories took back from no overall control. Backbencher Jess Phillips said the party had to look at what had gone wrong in white working class areas in northern England while Chuka Umunna called for an election ""post-mortem"" to look at why expected gains hadn't materialised. Mr Umunna said the government was ""divided and incompetent"" yet Labour had not seen ""the big win in Wandsworth or Kensington that was expected"". Victory proved sweet for the Liberal Democrats in Richmond-upon-Thames The Lib Dems have won back control of Kingston-upon-Thames, in south-west London, which they lost to the Tories four years ago, after taking neighbouring Richmond - both areas had a large majority in favour of remaining in the EU. The party has also gained control of Three Rivers, south-west Hertfordshire, which had been under no overall control and has won South Cambridgeshire from the Tories. The party also withstood a strong Conservative challenge to hold onto Sutton in south-west London - while it picked up nine seats in Kingston-upon-Hull. Professor Sir John Curtice said the party's 16% projected national vote share was an improvement on its performances between 2013 and 2015 - but well down on the 25% or so it would achieve before it entered the coalition government in 2010. Party leader Sir Vince Cable hailed the result in Richmond: ""It's certainly the beginning of the comeback of the Lib Dems. It's not going to happen overnight - Rome wasn't built in a day. ""Morale is now very high. We have demonstrated that we can win when we are focused and we can only build on that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Greens have made overall gains, including taking two seats off Labour in Sheffield, where the Labour-run council has been engulfed in a row over the felling of thousands of trees. They also took seats from the Conservatives in the London borough of Richmond-upon-Thames and added two new councillors in Trafford and one in Worcester. Greens co-leader Caroline Lucas told the BBC: ""I think the Greens have had a really good night and... even with a fraction of the resources, a fraction of the media time when people see Greens on the ground they like what they see and they elect more Greens. And that's what we are seeing from Richmond to Greater Manchester to the Midlands. We've had some great results."" But she acknowledged she was ""incredibly disappointed"" to lose five of the Greens' 10 seats on Norwich Council, blaming a ""bit of a Corbyn surge"" among younger voters.     The Eurosceptic party has, as predicted, haemorrhaged support, losing nearly all of the council seats it won in 2014, when it broke through into local government for the first time. It put up candidates in only 540 seats compared with 2,193 in 2014, lost all ten seats it contested in Basildon, five in Thurrock and seven in Dudley. So far they have lost more than 100 seats and won two - including unseating Labour's council leader in Derby. Former deputy chair Suzanne Evans said the fact it had taken two seats in Derby was a sign it could still ""put the cat among the pigeons"". Meanwhile its general secretary, Paul Oakley, compared UKIP to the Black Death and said the party ""not all over at all"". ""Think of the Black Death in the Middle Ages. It comes along and it causes disruption and then it goes dormant, and that's exactly what we are going to do. Our time isn't finished because Brexit is being betrayed."" By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg They seem stuck with each other - so close, in fact, that our projected national share of the vote from the results would mean that, in a hypothetical general election tomorrow, the two main Westminster parties would receive exactly the same levels of public support. For reasons we've discussed at length overnight and in recent days, we have to be careful about directly transposing what happened on Thursday into a theoretical nationwide election. But while in one sense not very much happened in the local election - not very many councils and seats changed hands and neither of the main parties have (with a couple of hours to go) made dramatic strides - something important did happen. Voters opted again for roughly the status quo, underlining the trends that we saw developing at the general election as the political parties grappled with a new landscape after the referendum. Read Laura's blog This video can not be played Professor Sir John Curtice on three things we learnt from the local election results Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice said the Tories were performing relatively well in areas with a substantial Leave vote in the 2016 referendum, where they are picking up votes from UKIP, which did not stand candidates in many areas, while Labour were performing better in places where the Remain vote was stronger and with a higher proportion of younger voters. In addition to the council polls, there have been a series of mayoral elections in London boroughs. Labour mayors were elected in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham and Tower Hamlets - while in Watford, the Lib Dem candidate was elected. Labour MP Dan Jarvis has been elected mayor for the Sheffield City Region. There are no local elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, a parliamentary by-election for the Westminster seat of West Tyrone took place, with Sinn Fein retaining it.

"President Granger said the deadly pirate attacks had ""come as a great setback"" Guyana's President David Granger has described as a ""massacre"" a pirate attack last week that is feared to have killed at least a dozen fishermen. ""It is a great massacre, a great tragedy,"" Mr Granger said on Thursday. Four boats carrying some 20 people were attacked off the coast of neighbouring Suriname in South America last Friday, local authorities said. The bodies of three men have since been found. Four others were said to have escaped, Reuters news agency reported. Some of the fishermen who remain missing were forced into the sea with weights tied to their legs, according to reports from the survivors. The men, most of them Guyanese, were beaten and robbed. Guyana country profile Why pirates choose kidnap over cargo Mr Granger told reporters on Thursday that Guyana had been ""very successful"" in curbing piracy in the region but that the latest deadly attacks had ""come as a great setback"". ""We extend sympathy to the families of the bereaved,"" he added. Search and rescue teams are continuing operations in the region, with Surinamese and Guyanese authorities working together, Mr Granger said. The families of the victims were told that they would be supported by the government. Piracy has long been an issue in the waters off Suriname and Guyana, although the number of incidents reported has reduced in recent years. Why pirates choose kidnap over cargo.

"Bill Cosby and Roman Polanski have been expelled from the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The academy - which runs the Oscars - said this was done in accordance with its standards of conduct. TV star Cosby was convicted of sexual assault last month. Oscar-winning director Polanski admitted unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977. Producer Harvey Weinstein was kicked out last year, following numerous allegations of sexual assault. Less than a year after the downfall of the producer the #MeToo movement is catching up with other men who abused their power, the BBC's James Cook in Los Angeles reports. Neither Cosby nor Polanski have publicly reacted to the academy's decision. Cosby's wife, Camille, described his conviction as ""mob justice, not real justice"". ""This tragedy must be undone not just for Bill Cosby, but for the country,"" she said. Oscars board expels Harvey Weinstein Bill Cosby: The fall of 'America's Dad' The prestigious organisation made the announcement on Thursday - two days after its board members voted on the issue. In a statement, it said its board ""has voted to expel actor Bill Cosby and director Roman Polanski from its membership in accordance with the organisation's Standards of Conduct"". ""The Board continues to encourage ethical standards that require members to uphold the Academy's values of respect for human dignity,"" it added. Only four people are known to have been expelled in its 91-year history. The first was actor Carmine Caridi, who had his membership revoked in 2004 afterhe allegedly sent confidential film preview videos,externalto a friend which ended up online. On social media, many people have been asking what took the academy so long to take action against Polanski, who has been honoured in the decades since he admitted to statutory rape. 1981: Best Director for Tess 2003: Best Picture for The Pianist 2003: Best Director for The Pianist (which he won) The unlawful sex case against Polanski, now aged 84, has dragged on for more than 40 years. Polanski admitted unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer, who was a minor in 1977, and served 42 days in prison, but later fled the US over concern that a plea bargain deal would be scrapped. This video can not be played Samantha Geimar: Consequences of rape were awful He has French and Polish citizenship, and has evaded various extradition attempts by US authorities. France - where he lives - does not extradite its own citizens. A Polish court also rejected a US request when he was filming in Krakow in 2015. The Swiss authorities also turned down a US warrant in 2010, after placing Polanski under house arrest for nine months. Last year,he was picked to head the jury at the CÃ©sars, the French equivalent of the Oscars. He stepped down after the move sparked outrage. Last year, Ms Geimer told a US court she had forgiven Polanski and wanted to move on. But the court refused her plea. By James Cook, BBC News, Los Angeles Why now? That's the question, isn't it? For Bill Cosby, the answer appears obvious. A criminal conviction seems to be the standard which was applied in this case: expulsion from the academy came just one week after a guilty verdict. Roman Polanski's expulsion, by very stark contrast, comes more than 2,000 weeks after he pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor. Not only that but Harvey Weinstein was expelled without a criminal conviction although he faces (and denies) allegations of rape. So why did it take Hollywood more than 40 years to decide that the statutory rape of a 13-year-old was beneath its precious ""values of respect for human dignity""? The academy recently implemented revised standards of conduct for its 8,400 members, including a provision to suspend or expel those who ""compromise the integrity"" of the organisation. The real answer though does not lie in bureaucracy but in shame. The industry has been shamed into action by the disinfecting sunlight of the #MeToo and Time's Up movements. The problem for the academy is that this harsh glare is shining on many other members and with each expulsion the pressure grows to act in those cases too. In April, Cosby, 80, was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault, each of which carries a potential 10 years in prison. He was on trial for drugging and assaulting ex-basketball player Andrea Constand in 2004. It was the second time the actor had stood trial for the allegations, after an earlier jury failed to reach a verdict in 2017. Cosby starred in sitcom The Cosby Show, which was a global hit and ran from 1984-92. Cosby was widely known as ""America's Dad"" for his fatherly role in the comedy. At one point, he was the highest-paid actor in the US. The story of Bill Cosby's rise, fall and release The slow-burning Polanski saga Girl Polanski raped tells of impact.

"That's it! The polls are closed. In 150 areas the ballot boxes will be sealed up and spirited to sports halls, schools and council offices around the country. In many of them around England, the tellers will be flexing their fingers, ready for a long night ahead. In other places, they'll be asleep, ahead of a long day at the counts tomorrow. And for the politicians? Well, this is the moment where they know they have completely surrendered control. Polls close in local elections Iain Watson: The results to look out for Election live: all the latest updates Local elections: How can you tell who's won? They can't knock on any more doors. They can't make any more promises. And their councillors, activists and supporters can only wait and watch as the decisions of the public become clear, in the first completely authentic tests of public opinion since the general election. First off, here are the caveats. Elections aren't taking place everywhere. Voters have been to the polls right across London, and in other big cities and towns, Swindon, Plymouth, Carlisle, Sheffield - north, South, East and West. But in the areas up for grabs, Labour already holds more than half the seats - they are largely urban and metropolitan areas. So the results themselves will give a flavour of where particular parts of the country, certain types of voter are going, rather than a full national picture. It's also important to know that the last time these seats were contested was 2014, in a totally different political universe. David Cameron was still the prime minister. Nick Clegg was still the deputy prime minister. Ed Miliband was the leader of the Labour Party and Nigel Farage was in charge of UKIP, who were sweeping up more and more support. I don't need to remind you how much has changed since then. Remember too that local issues, unsurprisingly, are part of how people make their minds up in these local elections. Bear in mind that what happens in the next 24 hours doesn't definitively tell us anything about what will happen at the next general election. But, it gives us big clues about the direction in which the parties are going. Both of the main parties have had a difficult couple of months, grappling with their own demons. The national opinion polls suggest that they are also locked in a kind of stalemate with each other, roughly level pegging, both struggling to make any decisive moves. The Labour Party is almost certain to make big advances in London, potentially taking some of the Tories' totemic councils like Wandsworth and it's not impossible they'll take Kensington too. But London is already a Labour city. The harder test for them to pass is to show that they can advance,  in parts of the country where there are marginal Westminster constituencies - Swindon, Southampton, Watford. For the Tories, it is a case of stopping the rot. They dropped back, relative to Labour, in the general election. Traditionally, the governing party loses significant numbers of seats in local elections. But Theresa May is vulnerable. Her supporters have been fighting to stop the slide. It's possible though that the results may not see swathes of the country change hands. One senior Labour figure suggested this week that we may, broadly, simply see both parties digging in more firmly in territory that seems naturally theirs, a confirmation of what we saw at the general election - where Labour consolidated its urban support, and the Tories deepened their reach in town and country. Politics has changed at breakneck speed in the last few years. In contrast, these elections could see in the main, a deepening rather than a reverse of recent trends.

"Passwords that should have been scrambled were exposed on Twitter's network Twitter's 330 million users are being urged to change their passwords after some were exposed in plain text on its internal network. An error in the way the passwords were handled meant some were stored in easily readable form, said Twitter. The passwords should have been put through a procedure called ""hashing"" making them very difficult to read. Security experts said the way Twitter handled the potential breach was ""encouraging"". The bug caused the passwords to be stored on an internal computer log before the hashing process was completed. In a blog,the social network said once the mistake was uncovered,externalit carried out an internal investigation which found no indication passwords were stolen or misused by insiders. However, it still urged all users to consider changing their passwords ""out of an abundance of caution"". Twitter did not say how many passwords were affected but it is understood the number was ""substantial"" and that they were exposed for ""several months"".

"Det Con Jim Boyling worked for the now-disbanded Special Demonstrations Squad A former undercover police officer has been sacked from the Met after having a sexual relationship with a woman in a campaign group he was targeting. Det Con Jim Boyling, who worked for the Special Demonstrations Squad (SDS), was found guilty of gross misconduct. Using the name Sutton he infiltrated the campaign group Reclaim The Streets and had relationships with three women. Det Con Boyling has accused Scotland Yard of having ""selective amnesia"" about what he had previously told them. It is the first time such a finding has been made in relation to an undercover officer. The Met said his actions had been ""unacceptable"". This video can not be played 'Rosa' says her sense of reality has been taken away from her (picture posed by model) Posing as a fellow anti-roads protester, the officer had relationships with women in the group. When the third woman, known only as Rosa for legal reasons, tracked him down in 2001 they resumed the relationship and the officer subsequently revealed his true identity. They married and had two children but she left him six years later, accusing the officer of not only tricking her into the first relationship, but psychologically manipulating her into getting back together and forming a family. Det Con Boyling used the name Jim Sutton when he infiltrated the anti-roads campaign group During the week-long disciplinary hearing, a panel heard allegations the officer had begun a sexual relationship with Rosa ""without authorisation and without a policing purpose"". The panel ruled this amounted to gross misconduct. It further ruled the officer had failed to disclose the relationship to his superiors and he broke strict police rules by admitting to Rosa he was an undercover officer. ""Undercover policing is an important and lawful tactic, but it must never be abused,"" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin said. This video can not be played Environmental campaigner ""Monica"" said she was tricked into a sexual relationship with Det Con Boyling Det Con Boyling, who was an officer for 30 years, said: ""The disciplinary charge from the Met specifies that I had a relationship which constituted misconduct because it was 'without a police purpose'. ""The position of the Met appears to be that a relationship entered into as an operational tactic is acceptable, but a genuine one resulting in marriage and children constitutes misconduct."" He said he used his real name and registered his occupation as a police officer on the marriage certificate and both birth certificates, and that Rosa knew he had worked undercover. He also made a written declaration of his marriage to the Met's vetting unit. ""The Met does a good line in selective amnesia, as indeed they do in selective disclosure,"" he added. Det Con Boyling said he did not contest the Met disciplinary hearing because he could not afford to stay in London during the proceedings, and did not wish to drag former colleagues and his ex-wife through the process. However, he said he would give evidence to the public inquiry into undercover policing. The Metropolitan Police has already made an unreserved apology to Rosa and 11 other women who had relationships with undercover officers and has paid out substantial sums in settlements to the women.

"This video can not be played The storms destroyed homes and uprooted trees At least 125 people are now reported to have died in fierce dust storms in northern India, with officials warning of more bad weather to come. High-speed winds and lightning devastated many villages, bringing down walls and leaving dozens injured. An Uttar Pradesh relief commissioner's office spokesperson told AFP news agency the death toll was the highest from such storms in at least 20 years. Officials have said the death toll could rise as more bodies are found. Wind speeds were around 132 km/h (82mph) accompanied by hail storms and heavy lightning, officials said. India's Meteorological Department said more storms were likely,externalacross a wider area before the weekend. How a 'downburst' made India's storms more deadly Salman Ravi, BBC Hindi Villagers in Badhera, in the worst affected district of Agra in Uttar Pradesh, say they had had absolutely no warning of the storm that devastated their homes. This is despite senior police officials saying that an alert was issued across the northern state. The storm killed three people in the village, while several others were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Ten-year-old Abhishek Kumar was asleep with his family when the storm struck. Their house collapsed, trapping him and his brother in the debris. Villagers dug them out but while Abhishek survived, his brother did not. Dhambi Singh also suffered injuries but had to leave hospital to perform the last rites for his father who died when the roof of their house caved in. Villagers are now worried as they have been warned that a similar storm could strike the region again in the next 72 hours. ""People should be alert,"" the relief commissioner's office told AFP. In the two states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, the storm brought down electricity, uprooted trees, destroyed houses and killed livestock. The district of Agra in Uttar Pradesh, home of the Taj Mahal monument, was one of the areas worst hit. The storms also affected three districts in neighbouring Rajasthan state - Alwar, Bharatpur and Dholpur. Many of the dead were sleeping indoors when their houses collapsed after being struck by lightning or gusts of wind. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter that he was saddened by the loss of life. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Passwords that should have been scrambled were exposed on Twitter's network Twitter's 330 million users are being urged to change their passwords after some were exposed in plain text on its internal network. An error in the way the passwords were handled meant some were stored in easily readable form, said Twitter. The passwords should have been put through a procedure called ""hashing"" making them very difficult to read. Security experts said the way Twitter handled the potential breach was ""encouraging"". The bug caused the passwords to be stored on an internal computer log before the hashing process was completed. In a blog,the social network said once the mistake was uncovered,externalit carried out an internal investigation which found no indication passwords were stolen or misused by insiders. However, it still urged all users to consider changing their passwords ""out of an abundance of caution"". Twitter did not say how many passwords were affected but it is understood the number was ""substantial"" and that they were exposed for ""several months"". Twitter discovered the bug a few weeks ago and has reported it to some regulators, an insider told Reuters. Chief executive Jack Dorsey tweeted to say the ""bug"" had been fixed.

Independent security expert Graham Cluley said: ""It's quite encouraging that Twitter both found the problem internally, and informed its users quickly and transparently. ""Something similar just happened to Github and I wonder if Twitter's discovery was caused by them asking: 'Hey, see that Github problem? Do you think something like that could happen to us?'."" Users receive a warning message when logging in to Twitter Security expert Per Thorsheim, who regularly advises firms about the best password practices, said Twitter should be ""applauded for its transparency"". ""The problem they discovered is known since the dawn of logins with passwords,"" he told the BBC. ""The chance of passwords (or failed passwords) getting logged, in plain text logs available for staff or in worst case, complete strangers, is well known."" Troy Hunt, who runs the Have I Been Pwned website, which logs breaches, said the error was not something that would worry him because there was no indication that the login passwords were seen outside the company. Mr Hunt added: ""We've certainly seen many precedents of simply flaws resulting in data breaches. ""The Red Cross Blood Service in Australia used an outsourcing provider who inadvertently published their entire database to a public web server resulting in Australia's largest ever data breach,"" he said. All three experts urged users to act on Twitter's advice and change their password. Mr Cluley said enabling two-factor authentication that adds another ID check to login attempts would help ""harden"" accounts.

"Police say they have got to the bottom of the ""mystery pooper"" investigation Police hunting a suspect who relieved himself on school grounds ""on a daily basis"" in the US state of New Jersey have arrested a top education official. Kenilworth school superintendent Thomas Tramaglini, 42, was detained after investigators set up a sting operation to snare the ""mystery pooper"". Police were called after students complained of frequent excrement near their school running track and field. Mr Tramaglini is charged with lewdness, littering and defecating in public. In a statement,external, the Holmdel Township Police Department said they opened an investigation after high school staff and sports coaches reported ""they were finding human faeces, on or near the area of the High School track / football field on a daily basis"". According to local media, the superintendent lives about three miles (4.8km) from the Holmdel High School in Monmouth County, 40 miles from New York City. On Monday at 05:50 local time (09:50 GMT), officers approached the superintendent while he was running at the school track, the scene of the alleged crime. Mr Tramaglini, who earns nearly $150,000 (Â£110,000) per year as head of the local education authority, was arrested. Police officers said they had just observed him in the act. Vito Gagliardi, a lawyer for the school board, told APP.com that Mr Tramaglini has been ""highly regarded"" during his three years as head of the local schools. Allow Facebook content?

The superintendent has been placed on paid leave, according to the Kenilworth Public School district. ""Given the nature of those charges, he asked for and was granted a paid leave of absence,"" the school boardwrote on Facebook,external. ""Leaves can only be without pay in the face of indictments or tenure charges, as a matter of state law."" It is unclear why Mr Tramaglini allegedly did not use toilet facilities. On Facebook, local residents speculated on his potential motive, with some arguing he should not be punished unless his intent was malicious. Others questioned whether Mr Tramaglini, if guilty, could have a condition that left him unable to restrain his bowel movements.

"Victor Manuelle rebuffs claims he has disrespected MedellÃ­n's bloody past with his hit song Amarte Duro The mayor of the Colombian city of MedellÃ­n has demanded an apology from two Puerto Rican pop stars over their latest hit - which refers to the city's infamous past under the control of the drug lord Pablo Escobar. Federico GutiÃ©rrez accused Victor Manuelle and Farruko of celebrating drugs and Escobar. The salsa number, Amarte Duro, or Love You Hard, was released last month. The mayor said the song ignored the 20,000 victims of the Escobar era. At the height of his career, Escobar's cartel supplied an estimated 80% of the cocaine smuggled into the United States. He was killed in a shoot-out with police in MedellÃ­n in 1993. US rapper Wiz Khalifa in drug lord row Atoning for the sins of a brother Escobar's brother asks to review Narcos In an open letter, Mr GutiÃ©rrez said the two men had been irresponsible.

He said many young children still dream of being ""drug lords in their neighbourhoods because of the TV series [Narcos, shown on Netflix] where Escobar is the hero and songs, like theirs, which glorify him. ""Don't underestimate the influence they have on younger generations. ""They have no respect for our pain. This is a city which is trying to move forward, and the minimum they could do, in fact, is to respect it."" Amarte Duro includes the verses in Spanish, ""Where I let my eye fall, I put a bullet and never fail"" and ""What I feel for you is like the coca of MedellÃ­n, I am no Pablo [Escobar], but you know what I am talking about."" Mr GutiÃ©rrez also complained that the song celebrated violence against women and demanded a public apology from the two artists to both the city of MedellÃ­n and women. In an open letter posted on Twitter, Victor Manuelle said he had not intended to cause offence. ""I would never be capable of deliberately offending anyone, let alone Medellin, the city which has given me so much love throughout my career,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

In previous statements he has denied promoting gender violence with lyrics such as ""I'm going to give it hard to you the way Chris did to Rihanna"", recallingthe star's 2009 assault at the hands of her ex-boyfriend, insisting the song is about an intense love relationship. Since the 1990s, successive MedellÃ­n mayors have worked hard to break the power of the cartels and paramilitary gangs with social and education programmes. Although the violence is much reduced, there are still small drug gangs and drug traffickers operating in the city. Escobar's drug wealth catapulted him into the Forbes list of global billionaires for seven years, ending with his 1993 death The same year, he was responsible for the bombing of Avianca Flight 203, killing 107 people In all, Escobar is thought to be responsible for some 4,000 deaths His gang targeted politicians, the police and journalists After he was arrested in 1991, Escobar was housed in a prison of his own design, nicknamed the Cathedral, where he continued to oversee the Medellin Cartel This is not the first time the MedellÃ­n mayor has complained of the glorification of drugs and Pablo Escobar. Last monthhe said US rap artist Wiz Khalifa should apologise for ""advocating crime""after he laid flowers on Escobar's grave. And last year he gave the reggaeton artist J Ãlvarez a lecture on who Escobar really was after he wore a shirt carrying references to Pablo Escobar during the inauguration of the local MedellÃ­n flower fair. He also sent a letter to the airline Air Panama which has offered a ""MedellÃ­n Narco Tour"" for $499 (Â£370) per passenger, which includes three nights in a hotel and a visit to Pablo Escobar's abandoned ranch, Napoles.
