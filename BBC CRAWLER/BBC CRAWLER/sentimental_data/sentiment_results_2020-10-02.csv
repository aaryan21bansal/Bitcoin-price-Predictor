"President Trump's treatment for Covid-19 has spawned baseless rumours and conspiracy theories - about body doubles, oxygen tanks and more. Many appear to be politically motivated and conflicting information from the White House over the weekend hasn't helped. Officials gave varying answers on when the president had been given oxygen.Unanswered questions remainover when Mr Trump last tested negative for the virus. This left the internet to fill in the gaps with unfounded speculation. Here are some of the most viral rumours - and what we know about them. Republican supporters - in some cases tweeting from verified accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers - have spread a baseless rumour that the president was somehow deliberately infected with Covid-19 at some point during last week's debate. This goes well against the tide of early evidence showing that several top officials who have been infected, all attended a White House event announcing Mr Trump's supreme court nominee, held several days before the debate. Meanwhile, the suggestion that Mr Trump tested positive earlier than was originally suggested has led to rumours that he's more ill than doctors have let on - and even that his most recent public appearances were staged with a body double. Tweets to this effect from accounts mostly supporting the Democratic Party accumulated thousands of retweets. ""Body double"" conspiracy theories are fairly common - in 2016, similar allegationswere hurled at the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. A video which claims to show bikers praying for President Donald Trump outside the Walter Reed Medical Center in suburban Washington isn't from this weekend, and wasn't even filmed in the United States. The clip, shared more than 25,000 times on Twitter and viewed over 1.3 million times, was uploaded onto video-sharing platform TikTok on Friday. However,detective work by fact-checking website Lead Stories,external, verified by the BBC, reveals that the video was actually shot in South Africa and shows bikers protesting against farm murders. The original clip wasuploaded to TikTok,externalon 29 August, and comparison with Google Street View shows it was shot outside the Union Building in Pretoria. Another rumour being spread suggested that the president was wearing a secret oxygen tank when he was seen leaving the White House on Friday. A number of accounts supporting the Democrats circled close-up images of Trump claiming they could see he was hooked up to some kind of device - and using it as evidence that the White House was downplaying how ill the President really is. President Donald Trump waves to supporters as he briefly rides in front of Walter Reed Medical Center Like the baseless claim that Joe Biden was wearing an ear piece to help him during last week's debate -which was used by Trump's campaign in a series of Facebook adverts- this particular rumour appears to have been started by people getting overly excited by folds and creases. But even if he wasn't toting a hidden tank, we do now know that the president was given supplemental oxygen at several points over the weekend. Rumours that the President is pretending to be ill for votes continue to spread online, pushed by somehigh-profile opponents,externalof Mr Trump. And at the extreme fringes, some QAnon supporters have gathered outside the hospital. They are pushing the baseless conspiracy that Trump is ""pretending"" to have Covid-19 in a bid to trick the ""deep state"" and have powerful people arrested. What is QAnon? How can you spot disinformation on your social media feed when there are conflicting messages coming from the top and various political agendas online? 1) Think about bias. Why was a post shared? Remember, this is happening during a hotly contested election. 2) How does it make you feel? Big news events can lead to worry, confusion, panic and anger - especially when those we would expect to inform us are not doing so. Pause before sharing. 3) Interrogate the source. Where has a post come from? If something is unconfirmed or there's no evidence to support it, it's often better not to share potential misinformation. Coins commemorating ""Donald Trump defeating Covid"" on sale from an online outlet called the White House Gift Shop have no connection with the US President. Much-shared but false posts on social media suggest that President Trump is selling the $100 (Â£77) coins to make money on the back of his diagnosis. In fact, the White House Gift Shop has nothing to do with the President nor the Trump family. The website came to our attention in May when it sold coins ""commemorating"" the Covid-19 outbreak, anda BBC Reality Check investigation foundit was not an official product. The store was set up in 1946 by President Harry S Truman in the basement of the White House, but it was subsequently transferred to a private company which now holds the ""White House Gift Shop"" trademark.

"This video can not be played President Trump's seven days before his Covid-positive test President Donald Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. The president announced that he and his wife and his wife,Melaniahas tested positive for Covid-19, in a tweet sent on Friday at around 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT). This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? Who is Hope Hicks? How will this affect US election? So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact-tracing. Here's a look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"": President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, JudgeAmy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn. This video can not be played Senator Mike Lee, who later tested positive for Covid-19, seen hugging other attendees Judge Coney Barrett said on Friday that she had tested negative. Sources told US media she had the virus earlier this year. Along with Mr Trump and his wife, at least seven other people who attended the Rose Garden event say they have tested positive - although it's not known where they caught the virus. They are: White House Press SecretaryKayleigh McEnany; former White House counsellorKellyanne Conway; SenatorMike Leeof Utah and SenatorThom Tillisof North Carolina, who are both on the judiciary committee; the president of the University of Notre Dame,John Jenkins; and former New Jersey GovernorChris Christie,who said he checked himself into a hospital on Saturday as a precaution. The White House Correspondents' Association said anunnamed reporterat the event had also tested positive with symptoms. During the evening, President Trump held a rally at Harrisburg International Airport in Middletown, Pennsylvania. Since the afternoon's ceremony, Judge Coney Barrett has held meetings with various senators - including Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell- ahead of her much-anticipated confirmation hearing, due to take place on 12 October. The president played golf at his club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, in the morning and led a White House reception for the families of military veterans during the evening. On Monday, President Trump held a news briefing in the White House Rose Garden - giving an update on his administration's coronavirus testing strategy. It was attended by Vice-PresidentMike Pence,Health SecretaryAlex Azar,Education SecretaryBetsy DeVos, and the chief executive of Abbott Laboratories,Robert Ford, among others. Later, Trump viewed a model of a new pickup truck - being built at a factory in Ohio - on the White House lawn. Representatives from the company, Lordstown Motors, attended, as well as two members of Congress. The White House regularly tests officials who come in contact with the president. However, US media has noted that mask-wearing and social distancing around him is less common - suggesting that people may be too reliant on the testing system, which is not foolproof. The president faced his election rival,Joe Biden, at their first face-to-face debate in Cleveland, Ohio on Tuesday evening. President Trump flew there on his presidential plane, Air Force One, alongside his wife, adult children and multiple aides. Many were seen not wearing masks when boarding or disembarking. Also on the plane were: White House Chief of staffMark Meadows; campaign strategistJason Miller; policy adviserStephen Miller;Robert C O'Brien, the national security adviser who tested positive for the virus in July; and Ohio CongressmanJim Jordan. After landing, the president's campaign manager,Bill Stepien, was spotted getting into a staff van with Ms Hicks, the New York Times reports. Late on Friday, it was announced that Mr Stepien had tested positive for Covid-19 and was experiencing mild flu-like symptoms. The debate was held at Cleveland Clinic's Health Education Campus, a shared facility with Case Western Reserve University. The organisers, the Commission on Presidential Debates, brought in numerous Covid-era safety precautions. There were no handshakes between the two candidates and everyone attending - including the 80 or so audience members - was tested before the event and asked to wear masks throughout. In the run-up, Mr Trump's eldest daughter,Ivanka, posted a picture of herself backstage in a mask, alongside her sisterTiffany, sister-in-lawLaraand stepmotherMelania. Allow Instagram content?

However, during the event itself, Ivanka Trump and other family members, including siblingsDon JrandEric, were pictured mask-less. ModeratorChris Wallacehas since told Fox News that they were offered masks by event staff but they refused them. Observers said those on Mr Biden's side of the room kept their masks on. Mr Trump and Mr Biden kept a distance during the debate, at podiums on opposite sides of the stage. Mr Trump and Mr Biden loudly spoke over each other throughout the contentious debate When the candidates were greeted by the wives on stage afterwards,Jill Bidenwore a mask and Melania Trump didn't. At a separate campaign event in Pennsylvania, Vice-PresidentMike Pencesaid he had been in the Oval Office with President Trump earlier that day. It is thought to be their last in-person meeting. President Trump and much of his entourage flew back to Washington DC on Tuesday night. The day after the debate, President Trump was straight back into campaign business, flying to Minnesota. Ms Hicks was among those accompanying him. At a press conference on Saturday, the president's physician Dr Sean Conley said Mr Trump had been diagnosed 72 hours previously, which would place his diagnosis on Wednesday. But the White House later clarified that he was diagnosed on Thursday. He attended a closed-door fundraiser at a private home in Minneapolis, and later held a rally at an airport in Duluth, in front of a crowd of thousands. Few wore masks but there was distance between them and the president. Minnesota CongressmanKurt Daudttweeted a picture of himself close to Mr Trump, with neither wearing masks. Allow Twitter content?

The president's rally at Duluth airport On Wednesday evening, Mr Trump and various aides returned to Washington DC on Air Force One again. Meanwhile Ms Hicks, who was feeling unwell, was isolated in a separate cabin, according to US media. She reportedly disembarked from the back of the plane, instead of the front alongside the other passengers. The following day, Ms Hicks tested positive for coronavirus. President Trump flew to his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey for a private fundraiser. Several aides who were in proximity to Ms Hicks scrapped their plans to accompany the president, according to the Associated Press. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, is thought to have been in close contact with Ms Hicks. Ms McEnany held a briefing for reporters at the White House on Thursday, without mentioning her colleague's test and without wearing a mask. She has since said she did not know about the diagnosis. That night, in pre-taped remarks to the annual Al Smith dinner in New York City - held virtually this year - Mr Trump said that ""the end of the pandemic is in sight"". This video can not be played ""The end of the pandemic is in sight,"" President Trump told a dinner on Thursday He later announced in an interview on Fox News that he and the first lady were being tested for the virus. It is not known how many supporters he came into contact with in recent days, he but told Fox presenter Sean Hannity that people were always wanting to get close to him. ""They want to hug you, and they want to kiss you,"" he said. President Trump announced that he and Mrs Trump had tested positive, adding that they will begin the ""quarantine and recovery process immediately"". Just before 11:00, his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, told reporters the president has ""mild symptoms"" but remains in ""good spirits"". Mrs Trump tweeted to say she also had mild symptoms. This video can not be played The president has ""mild symptoms"" but will ""remain on the job"", says White House chief of staff Mark Meadows That day, several other people announce that they've tested positive:Kellyanne Conway, former White House counsellor;Bill Stepien, Mr Trump's campaign manager;Mike Lee, Utah senator;Thom Tillis, a senator for North Carolina;Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee;Rev John Jenkins, president of Notre Dame University; and SenatorRon Johnson, head of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. MeanwhileJoe Biden, the Democrats' presidential candidate, tests negative, as does:Jill Biden, his wife; Vice PresidentMike Penceand his wifeKaren Pence;Kamala Harris, the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate;Amy Coney Barrett, Supreme Court nominee;Mike Pompeo, secretary of state;Steve Mnuchin, treasury secretary;Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services;William Barr, attorney general;Ivanka TrumpandDonald Trump Jr, the president's daughter and son; andJared Kushner, the president's son-in-law. Former New Jersey governorChris ChristieandNicholas Luna, a White House presidential aide, both test positive. Mr Trump waved to well-wishers from behind the glass of a sealed car after tweeting that he would pay a ""surprise visit"" to ""patriots"" outside the hospital. Inside the car, at least two people could be seen wearing protective gear in the front seats, with Mr Trump sat in the back. There were concerns that the president who wore a mask, may have endangered others inside the car. But White House spokesperson Judd Deere said the trip had been ""cleared by the medical team as safe"". White House Press SecretaryKayleigh McEnanyannounces on Twitter that she has tested positive.

"No Time To Die marks Daniel Craig's swansong as James Bond The release of the new James Bond film has been delayed again. The premiere of No Time To Diehad already been movedfrom April to November because of the pandemic. The film has now been further delayed until 2 April 2021 ""in order to be seen by a worldwide theatrical audience"",a statement on the film's website said.,external ""We understand the delay will be disappointing to our fans but we now look forward to sharing No Time To Die next year."" No Time To Die, the 25th instalment in the Bond franchise, marks Daniel Craig's final appearance as British secret service agent, 007. Trailers for the film, as well as Billie Eilish's title song, have already been released - with the Eilish video debuting mere days ago - before Friday's last-minute decision to delay. Industry insiders had been speculating whether the studio would stand by the November release date, following lacklustre box office returns for the Christopher Nolan blockbuster Tenet, which was released last month. The sci-fi epic, which cost approximately $200m to make, has so far made $243 million internationally, but only $41m in the US - where cinemas in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco largely remain closed. A significant part of Bond film earnings come from the UK and European market, where coronavirus is once again on the rise and there may be been concern by the studio that potential restrictions could limit box office earnings in November. The previous Bond film, 2015's Spectre, took almost $900m (Â£690m) at worldwide box offices - winning an Oscar for best original song. The latest film will no longer be in contention for the 2021 Oscarsunder current guidelines,external. The postponement of No Time to Die comes after both two major autumn releases, Wonder Woman: 1984 and Marvel Studios' Black Widow - starring Scarlett Johansson - were both pushed back. With Steven Spielberg's West Side Story and Kenneth Branagh's Death of the Nile remake also delayed, it could spell disaster for many struggling cinema chains, which rely on big budget releases for much of their income. Oscar-winning Rami Malek plays the latest Bond villain Safin in the forthcoming film. In the US, the National Association of Theatre Owners, the Directors Guild of America and the Motion Picture Association wrote an open letter last week calling on Congress to bail out ""our country's beloved movie theatres"". The letter stated that if the current situation continued without additional support, 69% of small and mid-sized cinemas in the US would likely go bankrupt or close. The letter was signed by a string of Hollywood directors, including James Cameron, Clint Eastwood and Britain's Steve McQueen. But John Fithian, head of the National Association of Theatre Owners,told Variety,externalit was also essential that the studios played their part in supporting cinemas - by continuing to release films. ""If we don't have any movies until we're fully vaccinated as a world, a lot of the theatre companies are going to be gone and the theatres themselves won't be there,"" he said. ""This idea of waiting out the pandemic to make your movies more profitable doesn't make sense to me. There won't be as much of an industry left to play your movies in if you do that."" In China, cinemas reopened in July - with restricted numbers - whilein India they are due to partially reopen in mid-October,external, ahead of the Diwali holiday in November. Cinemas in the UK were given the go-ahead to reopen in July, with social distancing measures in place, staggered start and finish times and pre-ordered popcorn,among the measures. However many sites did not open immediately. Cineworld, the world's second-largest cinema chain, reopened many of its locations across the UK in early September. It recently reported a $1.6bn loss in the first six months of the year. On Friday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden urged the British public to ""support your local cinema"" as he announced a government cash boost of Â£650,000 to 42 independent cinemas across England as part of the  Â£1.57 billion Culture Recovery Fund. Some fans on Twitter have called for the latest franchise to be released digitally rather than delaying the release date to next Easter. Earlier this week, Warner announced that the big budget remake of Roald Dahl's The Witches, starring Anne Hathaway, will debut on the streaming platform HBO Max in the US.

"Two billionaire brothers from Blackburn have won the battle to buy Asda from Walmart of the US, in a deal valuing the supermarket chain at Â£6.8bn. A consortium of Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital will take a majority stake in Asda. It means the grocer will return to majority UK ownership for the first time in two decades. The Issa brothers own EG Group, which has more than 5,200 petrol stations across the UK and Europe. A spokesperson for the Issa brothers and TDR Capital declined to comment on how they are funding the deal. Walmart said that, under the new owners, Asda will invest Â£1bn in the supermarket over the next three years. The auction process for Asda has lasted for several months. Walmart decided to sell a controlling stake in Asda after shelving plans to float the business following a failed Â£7.3bn merger with Sainsbury's,which was blocked on competition grounds. Walmart bought Asda in 1999 for Â£6.7bn and it will retain a minority stake in the supermarket chain. This video can not be played Issa brothers: Asda deal an 'exciting opportunity' Announcing the deal, Walmart said Asda would keep its headquarters in Leeds and its chief executive, Roger Burnley, would remain in place. Asda already has a relationship with the Issa brothers through their petrol forecourt business. The supermarket recently announced its expansion into convenience stores and will initially trial ""Asda On the Move"" at three of EG Group's fuel station forecourts in the Midlands. Mohsin and Zuber Issa said they wanted to support Asda's management to achieve long-term growth. ""We believe that our experience with EG Group, including our expertise around convenience and brand partnerships and our successful partnership with TDR Capital, can help to accelerate and execute that growth strategy,"" they said. Zuber and Mohsin Issa The speed of growth of their petrol station business marks the Issa brothers out as ""remarkable entrepreneurs"", according to Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), of which their EG Group is a member. The rapid expansion came as the major oil companies sold off or closed their High Street petrol outlets to concentrate on production and refining. Industry insiders describe the brothers as softly spoken and modest. At one industry awards ceremony several years ago, the brothers were present but were said to be too shy to claim their award on stage. People who know them say that part of their success is in remaining curious about competitors and being willing to learn and pick up new ideas. The Sunday Times values their fortune at Â£3.56bn. Read more about Zuber and Mohsin Issa here. Initially called Euro Garages, the Issa brothers founded EG in 2001, expanding it from a single site in Bury, Greater Manchester. TDR Capital now owns half of the group, with Zuber Issa controlling 25% and Mohsin Issa the remaining 25%. Walmart said it expected to report a $2.5bn (Â£1.9bn) loss for its next financial year ""reflecting the absence of net income associated with the Asda business"". It added that the ""use of cash proceeds"" from the sale ""will be determined at a later date"". Who are the billionaire Issa brothers?

"Dozens of former sub-postmasters and postmistresses should get a clear path in quashing their convictions for fraud, theft and false accounting. They were convicted of stealing money after the Post Office installed a new computer system, with some imprisoned. Many have now been told the Post Office will not contest their appeals against conviction. For years, their criminal record put some of those affected in dire financial circumstances. Some struggled to secure work, lost their homes, and even failed to get insurance owing to their convictions, but they always said the fault was in the computer system. The Post Office said it would not oppose 44 out of 47 appeals. The decision makes it almost certain that convictions will be quashed, although Court of Appeal judges must decide and the Post Office can seek a retrial. More cases remain under scrutiny. Jo Hamilton says she is ""drained"" by the battle Jo Hamilton is one of the people who has been told that the appeal against her conviction will not be contested. ""Twelve years I've been battling and it's just drained us. We've been fighting to prove we were innocent. There it is in black and white. I'm not a criminal,"" she said. ""It's just gone on for so long. It's been a massive part of my life."" Mrs Hamilton was accused by the Post Office of taking Â£36,000 from the village shop she ran in Hampshire. She said issues in the Horizon computer system led to big discrepancies in her accounts, which she reported to her Post Office area manager. But that manager could find nothing wrong with the system, and she was put in a situation where ""you had to prove your innocence"". After a distressing two-year process, she eventually pleaded guilty to false accounting at Winchester Crown Court in order to escape a more serious charge of theft. She had to give up her shop and found it difficult to get a new job due to her criminal record. Declaring the criminal record also  affected everyday life, such as failing to get car insurance. She made ends meet by doing cleaning jobs for people in her village who did not believe she was guilty. Many of them, including the local vicar, came to support her at her sentencing hearing. This video can not be played Seema Misra: ""I'm not a convicted criminal anymore"" Another former sub-postmistress, Seema Misra, was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She was in tears after being told her appeal would not be contested, saying that she had been ""suffering"" for 15 years as a result of the case. ""Prison was my worst nightmare. I never thought of giving up,"" she said. ""I'm so, so happy. Justice has been done. I can now proudly say my name."" Scottish probe into sub-postmasters' convictions Postmasters were prosecuted using unreliable evidence 'Post Office false theft claim left me bankrupt' ThePost Office agreed in December to pay almost Â£58mto settle the long-running dispute with more than 500 sub-postmasters and postmistresses affected by the scandal, many of whom had been fired or made bankrupt as a result. The settlement brought an end to a mammoth series of court cases over the Horizon IT system used to manage local post office finances since 1999. Earlier this week, the government announced that retired judge Sir Wyn Williams would lead the inquiry into the Post Office's failings after repeated calls for a judge-led, full public inquiry. The Horizon system is designed to record the transactions carried out in a post office branch The Horizon system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was first rolled out in 1999 to some post offices to be used for a variety of tasks including accounting and stocktaking. But from an early stage it appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money. It was difficult for sub-postmasters to challenge errors because they were unable to access information about the software to do so. After more than 900 prosecutions, 550 sub-postmasters raised civil actions against the Post Office whichagreed to pay Â£58m damages. The English Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) has referred 47 convictions brought under Horizon evidence to the Appeal Court. The Director of Public Prosecutions is also considering whether there should be charges of perjury against officials who claimed in court there were no problems with Horizon, even though emails and other documents now suggest they knew there were. Listen to the background of the saga -The Great Post Office Trial on BBC Sounds Solicitor Neil Hudgell, who represented 33 of the sub-postmasters, said the Post Office's decision not to contest appeals would have wider implications. ""[This] is a landmark moment, not only for these individuals, but in time, potentially hundreds of others. The door to justice has been opened,"" he said. ""We are today obviously delighted for the people we represent. Clearing their names has been their driving goal from day one, as their reputations and livelihoods were so unfairly destroyed."" Six cases which were only heard by magistrates do not go to the Court of Appeal but instead to another hearing at the Crown Court, but the Post Office will not offer any evidence, which will mean they will be cleared. Tim Parker, chairman of the Post Office, said: ""I am sincerely sorry on behalf of the Post Office for historical failings which seriously affected some postmasters.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Itâs just up to them' Boris Johnson has said it is now up to the EU to avoid a no-deal scenario over post-Brexit trade. After the final round of formal talks between officials, the prime minister said a deal was ""all there"". But the prime minister said Brussels had to be ""commonsensical"" to get it across the line, with both sides setting an October deadline to settle their differences. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for talks to ""intensify"". She is due to meet Mr Johnson on Saturday via video call to ""take stock"" of the situation and decide the next steps. Talks between chief negotiators Lord David Frost and Michel Barnier broke up earlier, without an agreement. Mr Barnier said ""persistent serious divergences"" remained between the two sides, while Lord Frost said there was ""very little time now to resolve these issues"". What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit deal must be made, says business boss Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? The UK formally left the EU in January, but entered a transition period - where the UK has kept to EU trading rules and remained inside its customs union and single market - to allow the two sides to negotiate a trade deal. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, but there has been concerns over whether a plan would be agreed before that period runs out on 31 December. Issues that have become particular sticking points between negotiators are state aid - where governments give financial support to businesses - and fishing rules. The EU has said a deal must be reached before the end of October to allow it to be signed off by the member states before the end of the year, while Mr Johnson has said both sides should ""move on"" if agreement was not reached by the middle of the month. If a deal is not done, the UK will go on to trade with the bloc on World Trade Organisation rules. In a round of interviews with the BBC, Mr Johnson said: ""I hope that we get a deal, it's up to our friends."" He told BBC Northern Ireland's Mark Devenport: ""They've done a deal with Canada of a kind that we want, why shouldn't they do it with us? ""We're so near, we've been members for 45 years. It's all there, it's just up to them."" The PM also said to BBC Midlands Today's Elizabeth Glinka there was ""every chance to get a deal"", but added: ""It's up to our friends and partners to be commonsensical."" Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen will speak via video conference on Saturday Speaking ahead of her call with the UK prime minister, Mrs von der Leyen said: ""We should not forget we have made progress in many many different fields, but of course the most difficult ones are still completely open."" She pointed to the problems with the so-called ""level playing field"" with state aid - calling it ""a question of fairness"" - as well as the issue of fishing, But, she added: ""Overall, where there is a will there is a way, so I think we should intensify the negotiations because it is worth working hard on it."" News of the talks between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen is significant and Saturday cannot be dismissed as more blah blah in the Brexit process. Speculation is rife, of course, as to why the prime minister and the EU Commission president have suddenly scheduled their digital tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte. In general, it's interpreted as a positive sign. The accepted wisdom has always been that negotiating teams can only make so much progress. And that the final push - the politically tough decisions on how much to compromise on the final sticking points - would have to come from up high. But we're not there yet. It's possible the prime minister and Mrs von der Leyen are talking tomorrow to explore who is really willing to make what compromises on the final outstanding issues. For now, the why's and what's of Saturday's talks are pure speculation. The only thing we know for sure: the UK and EU say they want a deal - though not at any price. Yet if and when a deal eventually emerges, both sides will have had to make compromises. Read more from Katya here. In a statement, Lord Frost said the final round of negotiations had been ""constructive"" but ""familiar differences remain"". On fishing, he said the gap was ""unfortunately very large"", and he called for the EU to ""move further before an understanding can be reached"" on state aid. The negotiator added: ""I am concerned that there is very little time now to resolve these issues ahead of the European Council on 15 October [the deadline set by the PM to reach a deal]. ""For our part, we continue to be fully committed to working hard to find solutions, if they are there to be found."" Mr Barnier agreed the negotiations had been conducted in a ""constructive and respectful atmosphere"", with some ""positive new developments on some topics"" - such as aviation safety and police cooperation. But he said there was ""a lack of progress on some important topics"", such as climate change commitments, ""as well as persistent serious divergences on matters of major importance for the European Union"", including state aid and fishing. He added: ""We will continue to maintain a calm and respectful attitude, and we will remain united and determined until the end of these negotiations.""

"This video can not be played President Trump's seven days before his Covid-positive test President Donald Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. The president announced that he and his wife and his wife,Melaniahas tested positive for Covid-19, in a tweet sent on Friday at around 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT). This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? Who is Hope Hicks? How will this affect US election? So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact-tracing. Here's a look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"": President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, JudgeAmy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn. This video can not be played Senator Mike Lee, who later tested positive for Covid-19, seen hugging other attendees Judge Coney Barrett said on Friday that she had tested negative. Sources told US media she had the virus earlier this year. Along with Mr Trump and his wife, at least seven other people who attended the Rose Garden event say they have tested positive - although it's not known where they caught the virus. They are: White House Press SecretaryKayleigh McEnany; former White House counsellorKellyanne Conway; SenatorMike Leeof Utah and SenatorThom Tillisof North Carolina, who are both on the judiciary committee; the president of the University of Notre Dame,John Jenkins; and former New Jersey GovernorChris Christie,who said he checked himself into a hospital on Saturday as a precaution. The White House Correspondents' Association said anunnamed reporterat the event had also tested positive with symptoms. During the evening, President Trump held a rally at Harrisburg International Airport in Middletown, Pennsylvania. Since the afternoon's ceremony, Judge Coney Barrett has held meetings with various senators - including Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell- ahead of her much-anticipated confirmation hearing, due to take place on 12 October. The president played golf at his club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, in the morning and led a White House reception for the families of military veterans during the evening. On Monday, President Trump held a news briefing in the White House Rose Garden - giving an update on his administration's coronavirus testing strategy. It was attended by Vice-PresidentMike Pence,Health SecretaryAlex Azar,Education SecretaryBetsy DeVos, and the chief executive of Abbott Laboratories,Robert Ford, among others. Later, Trump viewed a model of a new pickup truck - being built at a factory in Ohio - on the White House lawn. Representatives from the company, Lordstown Motors, attended, as well as two members of Congress. The White House regularly tests officials who come in contact with the president. However, US media has noted that mask-wearing and social distancing around him is less common - suggesting that people may be too reliant on the testing system, which is not foolproof. The president faced his election rival,Joe Biden, at their first face-to-face debate in Cleveland, Ohio on Tuesday evening. President Trump flew there on his presidential plane, Air Force One, alongside his wife, adult children and multiple aides. Many were seen not wearing masks when boarding or disembarking. Also on the plane were: White House Chief of staffMark Meadows; campaign strategistJason Miller; policy adviserStephen Miller;Robert C O'Brien, the national security adviser who tested positive for the virus in July; and Ohio CongressmanJim Jordan. After landing, the president's campaign manager,Bill Stepien, was spotted getting into a staff van with Ms Hicks, the New York Times reports. Late on Friday, it was announced that Mr Stepien had tested positive for Covid-19 and was experiencing mild flu-like symptoms. The debate was held at Cleveland Clinic's Health Education Campus, a shared facility with Case Western Reserve University. The organisers, the Commission on Presidential Debates, brought in numerous Covid-era safety precautions. There were no handshakes between the two candidates and everyone attending - including the 80 or so audience members - was tested before the event and asked to wear masks throughout. In the run-up, Mr Trump's eldest daughter,Ivanka, posted a picture of herself backstage in a mask, alongside her sisterTiffany, sister-in-lawLaraand stepmotherMelania. Allow Instagram content?

However, during the event itself, Ivanka Trump and other family members, including siblingsDon JrandEric, were pictured mask-less. ModeratorChris Wallacehas since told Fox News that they were offered masks by event staff but they refused them. Observers said those on Mr Biden's side of the room kept their masks on. Mr Trump and Mr Biden kept a distance during the debate, at podiums on opposite sides of the stage. Mr Trump and Mr Biden loudly spoke over each other throughout the contentious debate When the candidates were greeted by the wives on stage afterwards,Jill Bidenwore a mask and Melania Trump didn't. At a separate campaign event in Pennsylvania, Vice-PresidentMike Pencesaid he had been in the Oval Office with President Trump earlier that day. It is thought to be their last in-person meeting. President Trump and much of his entourage flew back to Washington DC on Tuesday night. The day after the debate, President Trump was straight back into campaign business, flying to Minnesota. Ms Hicks was among those accompanying him. At a press conference on Saturday, the president's physician Dr Sean Conley said Mr Trump had been diagnosed 72 hours previously, which would place his diagnosis on Wednesday. But the White House later clarified that he was diagnosed on Thursday. He attended a closed-door fundraiser at a private home in Minneapolis, and later held a rally at an airport in Duluth, in front of a crowd of thousands. Few wore masks but there was distance between them and the president. Minnesota CongressmanKurt Daudttweeted a picture of himself close to Mr Trump, with neither wearing masks. Allow Twitter content?

The president's rally at Duluth airport On Wednesday evening, Mr Trump and various aides returned to Washington DC on Air Force One again. Meanwhile Ms Hicks, who was feeling unwell, was isolated in a separate cabin, according to US media. She reportedly disembarked from the back of the plane, instead of the front alongside the other passengers. The following day, Ms Hicks tested positive for coronavirus. President Trump flew to his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey for a private fundraiser. Several aides who were in proximity to Ms Hicks scrapped their plans to accompany the president, according to the Associated Press. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, is thought to have been in close contact with Ms Hicks. Ms McEnany held a briefing for reporters at the White House on Thursday, without mentioning her colleague's test and without wearing a mask. She has since said she did not know about the diagnosis. That night, in pre-taped remarks to the annual Al Smith dinner in New York City - held virtually this year - Mr Trump said that ""the end of the pandemic is in sight"". This video can not be played ""The end of the pandemic is in sight,"" President Trump told a dinner on Thursday He later announced in an interview on Fox News that he and the first lady were being tested for the virus. It is not known how many supporters he came into contact with in recent days, he but told Fox presenter Sean Hannity that people were always wanting to get close to him. ""They want to hug you, and they want to kiss you,"" he said. President Trump announced that he and Mrs Trump had tested positive, adding that they will begin the ""quarantine and recovery process immediately"". Just before 11:00, his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, told reporters the president has ""mild symptoms"" but remains in ""good spirits"". Mrs Trump tweeted to say she also had mild symptoms. This video can not be played The president has ""mild symptoms"" but will ""remain on the job"", says White House chief of staff Mark Meadows That day, several other people announce that they've tested positive:Kellyanne Conway, former White House counsellor;Bill Stepien, Mr Trump's campaign manager;Mike Lee, Utah senator;Thom Tillis, a senator for North Carolina;Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee;Rev John Jenkins, president of Notre Dame University; and SenatorRon Johnson, head of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. MeanwhileJoe Biden, the Democrats' presidential candidate, tests negative, as does:Jill Biden, his wife; Vice PresidentMike Penceand his wifeKaren Pence;Kamala Harris, the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate;Amy Coney Barrett, Supreme Court nominee;Mike Pompeo, secretary of state;Steve Mnuchin, treasury secretary;Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services;William Barr, attorney general;Ivanka TrumpandDonald Trump Jr, the president's daughter and son; andJared Kushner, the president's son-in-law. Former New Jersey governorChris ChristieandNicholas Luna, a White House presidential aide, both test positive. Mr Trump waved to well-wishers from behind the glass of a sealed car after tweeting that he would pay a ""surprise visit"" to ""patriots"" outside the hospital. Inside the car, at least two people could be seen wearing protective gear in the front seats, with Mr Trump sat in the back. There were concerns that the president who wore a mask, may have endangered others inside the car. But White House spokesperson Judd Deere said the trip had been ""cleared by the medical team as safe"". White House Press SecretaryKayleigh McEnanyannounces on Twitter that she has tested positive.

"President Trump and his wife Melania plan to recover at the White House As news emerged that US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania had tested positive for coronavirus, the story shot to the top of every news agenda worldwide. It's just 32 days until Americans cast their votes in the race for the White House - and this is a seismic development. World leaders were quick to send the Trumps their well-wishes, with India's Twitter-loving Prime Minister Narendra Modi among the first. ""Wishing my friend @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS a quick recovery and good health,"" he wrote. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted: ""Like millions of Israelis, Sara and I are thinking of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump and wish our friends a full and speedy recovery.""

Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? LIVE: latest updates In much international media, however, the news was accompanied bycriticism of what was said to be the US president's ""botched"" response to the coronavirus pandemic,external, and his ""open scepticism"" over the use of face masks and social distancing. German media seemed somewhat unsurprised.""Trump usually does not wear a mask in public"", wrote the centre-right Die Welt,external, whilethe centrist Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung pointed out,externalthat the pandemic did not deter him from making numerous major election campaign appearances. Media in France echoed the sentiment that Mr Trump undermined his own health by underestimating the virus. ""After months of catastrophic handling of the pandemic in the USA, after months of lies and contradictory messages to his supportersâ¦ Donald Trump has tested positive for Covid-19,""wrote LibÃ©ration.,external Iran's international-facing English-language Press TV observed that Trump ""has been somewhat cavalier"" about the Covid-19 threat, adding that ""it was only a matter of time"" before the US president caught the virus. An anchor on Iranian state television broke the news ""with an unflattering image of the US president surrounded by what appeared to be giant coronaviruses"", the Associated Press reports. Elsewhere, questions have been asked about what the news could actually mean for the US presidential election.The India Today website anticipated that Trump's quarantine would bring his election campaign to a standstill,external, stating: ""The [presidential] debates and the entire Republican campaign now comes under a shadow."" The website quoted predictions by analysts that Trump may hope to get sympathy votes now that he has tested positive himself. But others, like Hindi-language daily the Navbharat Times, predicted that ""Trump's diagnosis and his attitude towards the pandemic will harm him in the election."" An artist in Mumbai, India, paints a mural of the ailing couple Pakistan's Geo News carried an online report,externalreading: ""The future of Trump's re-election campaign is in doldrums due to his illness and inability to address the rallies before the crucial November 3 vote.""

Fact-checking Trump on coronavirus In China, which Mr Trump has repeatedly blamed for the spread of the coronavirus, news of his illness was one of the most searched topics on Weibo, the popular (if heavily censored) social media app. The editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, tweeted in English: ""President Trump and the First Lady have paid the price for his gamble to play down the Covid-19."" This video can not be played Trump, Xi Jinping and Guterres address the UN General Assembly Domestically, some of Mr Trump's favoured outlets took a gentler tone. ""Get through this together!"" reads a headline on Fox News's website, where the story is leading the news. ""Trump, first lady send messages of calm, resilience from White House after testing positive for Covid,"" it adds. The site's sympathetic coverage includesan article on people it calls ""a number of the president's fiercest critics"", sending their best wishes,externalfor his recovery. The network's medical expert Marc Siegel said his sources had described the couple as ""absolutely asymptomatic"". Elsewhere in the US press, the Wall Street Journal noted a fall in US stock futures and said ""the diagnosis throws up a host of uncertainties for markets to process"", including the question ""will the US government be able to function normally?"" The Washington Post has dropped its paywall to allow people to read its live updates on the situation. Politico described Mr Trump as ""the world's highest-profile patient of a disease that has killed more than one million people"". ""A person familiar with the situation said the president was not showing symptoms yet on Thursday,"" the site reported. ""Still, Vice-President Mike Pence may need to step in for some tasks if Trump is confined to the White House grounds,"" it quoted the source as saying.

"Hundreds of students at Northumbria University are self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19 Hundreds of students at Northumbria University are self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19. A spokesman for the university, in Newcastle, confirmed 770 students had tested positive since returning in mid-September, 78 of whom are symptomatic. All infected students, and their close contacts, have self-isolated for 14 days in line with government guidance. Meanwhile, Newcastle University confirmed it has had 94 students and seven staff test positive. A Newcastle spokeswoman said the ""overwhelming majority of cases"" were from ""social and domestic settings"". University and College Union (UCU) said it warned Northumbria University it was ""far too soon for a mass return to campus"". In a statement the UCU, which represents lecturers, said: ""We told Northumbria University they had a civic duty to put the health of staff, students and the local community first and we take no pleasure in now seeing another preventable crisis play out. ""We warned last month that, given the current restrictions in the region, the direction of the infection rate and the problems with test and trace, it was clearly far too soon for a mass return to campus."" Northumbria University said self-isolating students were being provided with food, laundry, cleaning materials and welfare support by the university, working alongside the students' union and Newcastle City Council. Ellie Burgoyne, 19, who studies social sciences, has been isolating since one of her flatmates tested positive a week ago. She said: ""The uni and accommodation have been great in providing support and keeping us as comfortable as possible as not leaving our flat for two weeks isn't the most fun. ""I moved a couple of weeks ago and immediately noticed how strict our accommodation was being when it came to students meeting with other flats, trying to have parties. ""I think it's a common misconception that students haven't been listening to the guideline, my accommodation has been quiet aside from the odd flat having a few people over."" Meanwhile, students will also receive additional academic support if they miss out on face-to-face tuition during their isolation period. The university spokesman added: ""The increase in numbers comes in the week after students returned to university and reflects the good access to and availability of testing, as well as rigorous and robust reporting systems. ""In parts of the UK where universities started term earlier, numbers of student cases surged in induction week, and then reduced. ""We are making it clear to students that if they break the rules they will be subject to fines from police and disciplinary action by the universities which may include fines, final warnings or expulsion. ""Both Northumbria and Newcastle universities have Covid response teams on call that are working closely with NHS Test and Trace, Public Health England North East and the City to identify and get in touch with anyone who has been in close contact with those affected."" Around 56 universities across the UK have had at least one confirmed case of Covid-19. There have been more than 200 cases at the University of Sheffield and 177 University of Liverpool staff and students have tested positive, according to a PA news agency survey which contacted 140 institutions.

"Two billionaire brothers from Blackburn have won the battle to buy Asda from Walmart of the US, in a deal valuing the supermarket chain at Â£6.8bn. A consortium of Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital will take a majority stake in Asda. It means the grocer will return to majority UK ownership for the first time in two decades. The Issa brothers own EG Group, which has more than 5,200 petrol stations across the UK and Europe. A spokesperson for the Issa brothers and TDR Capital declined to comment on how they are funding the deal. Walmart said that, under the new owners, Asda will invest Â£1bn in the supermarket over the next three years. The auction process for Asda has lasted for several months. Walmart decided to sell a controlling stake in Asda after shelving plans to float the business following a failed Â£7.3bn merger with Sainsbury's,which was blocked on competition grounds. Walmart bought Asda in 1999 for Â£6.7bn and it will retain a minority stake in the supermarket chain. This video can not be played Issa brothers: Asda deal an 'exciting opportunity' Announcing the deal, Walmart said Asda would keep its headquarters in Leeds and its chief executive, Roger Burnley, would remain in place. Asda already has a relationship with the Issa brothers through their petrol forecourt business. The supermarket recently announced its expansion into convenience stores and will initially trial ""Asda On the Move"" at three of EG Group's fuel station forecourts in the Midlands. Mohsin and Zuber Issa said they wanted to support Asda's management to achieve long-term growth. ""We believe that our experience with EG Group, including our expertise around convenience and brand partnerships and our successful partnership with TDR Capital, can help to accelerate and execute that growth strategy,"" they said. Zuber and Mohsin Issa The speed of growth of their petrol station business marks the Issa brothers out as ""remarkable entrepreneurs"", according to Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), of which their EG Group is a member. The rapid expansion came as the major oil companies sold off or closed their High Street petrol outlets to concentrate on production and refining. Industry insiders describe the brothers as softly spoken and modest. At one industry awards ceremony several years ago, the brothers were present but were said to be too shy to claim their award on stage. People who know them say that part of their success is in remaining curious about competitors and being willing to learn and pick up new ideas. The Sunday Times values their fortune at Â£3.56bn. Read more about Zuber and Mohsin Issa here. Initially called Euro Garages, the Issa brothers founded EG in 2001, expanding it from a single site in Bury, Greater Manchester. TDR Capital now owns half of the group, with Zuber Issa controlling 25% and Mohsin Issa the remaining 25%. Walmart said it expected to report a $2.5bn (Â£1.9bn) loss for its next financial year ""reflecting the absence of net income associated with the Asda business"". It added that the ""use of cash proceeds"" from the sale ""will be determined at a later date"". Who are the billionaire Issa brothers?

"Hundreds of students at Northumbria University are self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19 Hundreds of students at Northumbria University are self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19. A spokesman for the university, in Newcastle, confirmed 770 students had tested positive since returning in mid-September, 78 of whom are symptomatic. All infected students, and their close contacts, have self-isolated for 14 days in line with government guidance. Meanwhile, Newcastle University confirmed it has had 94 students and seven staff test positive. A Newcastle spokeswoman said the ""overwhelming majority of cases"" were from ""social and domestic settings"". University and College Union (UCU) said it warned Northumbria University it was ""far too soon for a mass return to campus"". In a statement the UCU, which represents lecturers, said: ""We told Northumbria University they had a civic duty to put the health of staff, students and the local community first and we take no pleasure in now seeing another preventable crisis play out. ""We warned last month that, given the current restrictions in the region, the direction of the infection rate and the problems with test and trace, it was clearly far too soon for a mass return to campus."" Northumbria University said self-isolating students were being provided with food, laundry, cleaning materials and welfare support by the university, working alongside the students' union and Newcastle City Council. Ellie Burgoyne, 19, who studies social sciences, has been isolating since one of her flatmates tested positive a week ago. She said: ""The uni and accommodation have been great in providing support and keeping us as comfortable as possible as not leaving our flat for two weeks isn't the most fun. ""I moved a couple of weeks ago and immediately noticed how strict our accommodation was being when it came to students meeting with other flats, trying to have parties. ""I think it's a common misconception that students haven't been listening to the guideline, my accommodation has been quiet aside from the odd flat having a few people over."" Meanwhile, students will also receive additional academic support if they miss out on face-to-face tuition during their isolation period. The university spokesman added: ""The increase in numbers comes in the week after students returned to university and reflects the good access to and availability of testing, as well as rigorous and robust reporting systems. ""In parts of the UK where universities started term earlier, numbers of student cases surged in induction week, and then reduced. ""We are making it clear to students that if they break the rules they will be subject to fines from police and disciplinary action by the universities which may include fines, final warnings or expulsion. ""Both Northumbria and Newcastle universities have Covid response teams on call that are working closely with NHS Test and Trace, Public Health England North East and the City to identify and get in touch with anyone who has been in close contact with those affected."" Around 56 universities across the UK have had at least one confirmed case of Covid-19. There have been more than 200 cases at the University of Sheffield and 177 University of Liverpool staff and students have tested positive, according to a PA news agency survey which contacted 140 institutions. Approximately 2,500 positive cases of Covid-19 have been identified at these universities, the analysis suggests. Are you a student at Northumbria University?

"This video can not be played President Trump's seven days before his Covid-positive test President Donald Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. The president announced that he and his wife and his wife,Melaniahas tested positive for Covid-19, in a tweet sent on Friday at around 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT). This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? Who is Hope Hicks? How will this affect US election? So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact-tracing. Here's a look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"": President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, JudgeAmy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn. This video can not be played Senator Mike Lee, who later tested positive for Covid-19, seen hugging other attendees Judge Coney Barrett said on Friday that she had tested negative. Sources told US media she had the virus earlier this year. Along with Mr Trump and his wife, at least seven other people who attended the Rose Garden event say they have tested positive - although it's not known where they caught the virus. They are: White House Press SecretaryKayleigh McEnany; former White House counsellorKellyanne Conway; SenatorMike Leeof Utah and SenatorThom Tillisof North Carolina, who are both on the judiciary committee; the president of the University of Notre Dame,John Jenkins; and former New Jersey GovernorChris Christie,who said he checked himself into a hospital on Saturday as a precaution. The White House Correspondents' Association said anunnamed reporterat the event had also tested positive with symptoms. During the evening, President Trump held a rally at Harrisburg International Airport in Middletown, Pennsylvania. Since the afternoon's ceremony, Judge Coney Barrett has held meetings with various senators - including Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell- ahead of her much-anticipated confirmation hearing, due to take place on 12 October. The president played golf at his club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, in the morning and led a White House reception for the families of military veterans during the evening. On Monday, President Trump held a news briefing in the White House Rose Garden - giving an update on his administration's coronavirus testing strategy. It was attended by Vice-PresidentMike Pence,Health SecretaryAlex Azar,Education SecretaryBetsy DeVos, and the chief executive of Abbott Laboratories,Robert Ford, among others. Later, Trump viewed a model of a new pickup truck - being built at a factory in Ohio - on the White House lawn. Representatives from the company, Lordstown Motors, attended, as well as two members of Congress. The White House regularly tests officials who come in contact with the president. However, US media has noted that mask-wearing and social distancing around him is less common - suggesting that people may be too reliant on the testing system, which is not foolproof. The president faced his election rival,Joe Biden, at their first face-to-face debate in Cleveland, Ohio on Tuesday evening. President Trump flew there on his presidential plane, Air Force One, alongside his wife, adult children and multiple aides. Many were seen not wearing masks when boarding or disembarking. Also on the plane were: White House Chief of staffMark Meadows; campaign strategistJason Miller; policy adviserStephen Miller;Robert C O'Brien, the national security adviser who tested positive for the virus in July; and Ohio CongressmanJim Jordan. After landing, the president's campaign manager,Bill Stepien, was spotted getting into a staff van with Ms Hicks, the New York Times reports. Late on Friday, it was announced that Mr Stepien had tested positive for Covid-19 and was experiencing mild flu-like symptoms. The debate was held at Cleveland Clinic's Health Education Campus, a shared facility with Case Western Reserve University. The organisers, the Commission on Presidential Debates, brought in numerous Covid-era safety precautions. There were no handshakes between the two candidates and everyone attending - including the 80 or so audience members - was tested before the event and asked to wear masks throughout. In the run-up, Mr Trump's eldest daughter,Ivanka, posted a picture of herself backstage in a mask, alongside her sisterTiffany, sister-in-lawLaraand stepmotherMelania. Allow Instagram content?

Ms Hicks was among those accompanying him. At a press conference on Saturday, the president's physician Dr Sean Conley said Mr Trump had been diagnosed 72 hours previously, which would place his diagnosis on Wednesday. But the White House later clarified that he was diagnosed on Thursday. He attended a closed-door fundraiser at a private home in Minneapolis, and later held a rally at an airport in Duluth, in front of a crowd of thousands.

President Trump flew to his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey for a private fundraiser. Several aides who were in proximity to Ms Hicks scrapped their plans to accompany the president, according to the Associated Press. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, is thought to have been in close contact with Ms Hicks. Ms McEnany held a briefing for reporters at the White House on Thursday, without mentioning her colleague's test and without wearing a mask. She has since said she did not know about the diagnosis.

"The government looked into putting floating barriers in the English Channel to stop asylum seekers crossing to the UK, a leaked document shows. The Home Office approached the trade group Maritime UK over the possible use of temporary ""marine fencing"", in a request for ideas sent over the summer. This, it said, must be able to ""prevent a slow-moving, heavily overloaded migrant boat from making progress"". The government said it did not ""comment on leaks"". But Maritime UK said it was its ""clear view"" that building a wall in the Channel was ""not legally possible"" under the terms of theInternational Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea.,external Asylum seekers could be processed on old ferries Smugglers 'cut cost of migrant Channel crossings' Three migrant boats intercepted in Channel This year, almost 7,000 people have reached the UK in more than 500 small boats, often totally unsuited to the conditions. Home Secretary Priti Patel has declared she is""determined to stop this criminal trade"". The government has looked at setting up a processing centre for asylum seekers on Ascension Island, 4,000 miles from the UK - or on disused ferries moored off the coast of England. Meanwhile,the Times has reported,externalthat other proposals drawn up by the Home Office include the use of a water cannon in the Channel to create waves to push back vessels. On Thursday, the most senior civil servant at the Home Office, Matthew Rycroft, told MPs that ""everything is on the table"" when it comes to ""improving"" the UK's asylum system. He added that the UK had been ""looking at what a whole host of other countries do in order to bring innovation into our own system"". An email from Maritime UK - sent on 17 September andfirst seen by the Financial Times,external- included the request put out by the government over the summer, asking ""what options are available for marine fencing and other water-based technologies that would inhibit passage to UK territorial waters"". These needed ""the capability to fully prevent a slow-moving, heavily overloaded migrant boat from making progress"" and had to be ""deployable to a precise location, and capable of remaining in that position"". The request added that the technology had to be ""rapidly deployable and rapidly removable"", while being ""safe for those who come into contact with it"" and ""for those operating it"". The Strait of Dover - separating the Channel and the North Sea - is theworld's busiest shipping lane.,external The Home Office suggested that any fencing be placed ""on the median line"", which separates French and UK territorial waters, but ""without the equipment entering French waters"". It was reported earlier this year that the Greek government was planning toconstruct a barrier of nets,externalto deter people crossing the Aegean by boat from Turkey. These would use pylons connected to the seabed, leaving half a metre - topped by flashing lights - above the surface, the magazine Dezeen said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has described some of the ideas being considered by the Home Office as ""inhuman"" and ""ridiculous"". When asked about the possibility of a floating wall in the Channel, a Home Office spokeswoman said the department ""does not comment on leaks"". They also said: ""As the public will fully understand, we do not comment on operational matters because to do so could provide an advantage to the exploitative and ruthless criminals who facilitate these dangerous crossings, as they look for new ways to beat the system."" Ben Murray, director of Maritime UK, said: ""As the umbrella organisation for UK maritime we are a conduit between industry and government and are often asked by government for advice or input on policy matters. ""The Home Office engaged us to pass on a question around options to inhibit passage to UK territorial waters, which we gave to our members.

"President Trump and his wife Melania plan to recover at the White House As news emerged that US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania had tested positive for coronavirus, the story shot to the top of every news agenda worldwide. It's just 32 days until Americans cast their votes in the race for the White House - and this is a seismic development. World leaders were quick to send the Trumps their well-wishes, with India's Twitter-loving Prime Minister Narendra Modi among the first. ""Wishing my friend @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS a quick recovery and good health,"" he wrote.

LIVE: latest updates In much international media, however, the news was accompanied bycriticism of what was said to be the US president's ""botched"" response to the coronavirus pandemic,external, and his ""open scepticism"" over the use of face masks and social distancing. German media seemed somewhat unsurprised.""Trump usually does not wear a mask in public"", wrote the centre-right Die Welt,external, whilethe centrist Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung pointed out,externalthat the pandemic did not deter him from making numerous major election campaign appearances. Media in France echoed the sentiment that Mr Trump undermined his own health by underestimating the virus. ""After months of catastrophic handling of the pandemic in the USA, after months of lies and contradictory messages to his supportersâ¦ Donald Trump has tested positive for Covid-19,""wrote LibÃ©ration.,external Iran's international-facing English-language Press TV observed that Trump ""has been somewhat cavalier"" about the Covid-19 threat, adding that ""it was only a matter of time"" before the US president caught the virus. An anchor on Iranian state television broke the news ""with an unflattering image of the US president surrounded by what appeared to be giant coronaviruses"", the Associated Press reports. Elsewhere, questions have been asked about what the news could actually mean for the US presidential election.The India Today website anticipated that Trump's quarantine would bring his election campaign to a standstill,external, stating: ""The [presidential] debates and the entire Republican campaign now comes under a shadow."" The website quoted predictions by analysts that Trump may hope to get sympathy votes now that he has tested positive himself. But others, like Hindi-language daily the Navbharat Times, predicted that ""Trump's diagnosis and his attitude towards the pandemic will harm him in the election."" An artist in Mumbai, India, paints a mural of the ailing couple Pakistan's Geo News carried an online report,externalreading: ""The future of Trump's re-election campaign is in doldrums due to his illness and inability to address the rallies before the crucial November 3 vote."" ""The president, who is tested regularly for Covid-19, has kept up a rigorous travel schedule across the country in recent weeks, holding rallies with thousands of people in the run-up to the November 3 election, despite warnings from public health professionals against having events with large crowds."" Fact-checking Trump on coronavirus In China, which Mr Trump has repeatedly blamed for the spread of the coronavirus, news of his illness was one of the most searched topics on Weibo, the popular (if heavily censored) social media app. The editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, tweeted in English: ""President Trump and the First Lady have paid the price for his gamble to play down the Covid-19.""

The site's sympathetic coverage includesan article on people it calls ""a number of the president's fiercest critics"", sending their best wishes,externalfor his recovery. The network's medical expert Marc Siegel said his sources had described the couple as ""absolutely asymptomatic"". Elsewhere in the US press, the Wall Street Journal noted a fall in US stock futures and said ""the diagnosis throws up a host of uncertainties for markets to process"", including the question ""will the US government be able to function normally?"" The Washington Post has dropped its paywall to allow people to read its live updates on the situation. Politico described Mr Trump as ""the world's highest-profile patient of a disease that has killed more than one million people"".

"The president says: ""We will get through this together"" US President Donald Trump has said he and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for coronavirus and are now self-isolating. Mr Trump, aged 74 and therefore in a high-risk group, wrote on Twitter: ""We will get through this together."" The president has ""mild symptoms"" of coronavirus, White House officials say. Mr Trump's announcement comes just over a month before the presidential elections on 3 November, where he faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden. The development comes after Hope Hicks, one of Mr Trump's closest aides, tested positive. Latest updates Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? How will this affect US election?

In a tweet,Mr Biden and his wife Jill wished the first couple a swift recovery,external: ""We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family,"" he said. It is not clear whether Mr Biden is also being tested, and whether he will continue his campaign on Friday with a scheduled visit to Michigan. He stood approximately 10ft (3m) away from Mr Trump during the debate. Debate moderator Chris Wallace said on Friday he was getting tested. A person is required to self-isolate after either showing coronavirus symptoms or a positive test. Meanwhile, quarantine restricts the movements of those who have been in contact with an infected person, but are not themselves positive or symptomatic. Mr Trump has mostly spurned mask-wearing and has often been pictured not socially distanced with aides or others during official engagements. The coronavirus has infected more than 7.2 million Americans, killing more than 200,000 of them. Mr Trump's physician, Dr Sean Conley, released a statement late on Thursday,,externalsaying the president and the first lady were ""both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence"". ""Rest assured I expect the president to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering, and I will keep you updated on any future developments,"" the statement said. The physician provided no further details. However, White House officials and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin later said Mr Trump was experiencing mild Covid-19 symptoms. According to Mr Trump's most recent physical examination earlier this year, he weighed 244lbs (110.7kg). This is considered to be obese for his height of 6ft 3ins. But Dr Conley stated at the time that the president ""remains healthy"". Mr Trump will also have the best medical care available. America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says a person must self-isolate for 10 days after a positive test. What is the risk to men over 50? US shares set to drop after Trump tests positive Trump has Covid: How the world's media responded It is dangerous to speculate about how the virus will affect any individual person. There are clear risk factors - the older you are, the greater the risk of a coronavirus infection becoming life-threatening. People aged 64-74 with Covid in the US are five times more likely to need hospital care,externaland 90 times more likely to die than somebody in their 20s. The CDC says eight out of 10 Covid deaths in the country have been in the over-65s. The virus also seems to hit men and people who are overweight harder. But that is the big picture - a pattern seen across the whole population - it is not a way of saying this is what will happen to the US president. The health of any two 74-year-olds can be wildly different and other medical conditions massively alter how big a threat this virus poses. Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? Earlier on Thursday, Mr Trump said he and his wife, who is 50, were going to self-isolate after Ms Hicks's positive test. Hope Hicks has been at Mr Trump's side for years He tweeted: ""Hope Hicks, who has been working so hard without even taking a small break, has just tested positive for Covid 19. Terrible! ""The First Lady and I are waiting for our test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!"" According to Bloomberg News, Ms Hicks is experiencing symptoms of the disease. Who is Hope Hicks? It is not clear how Mr Trump's positive test will affect arrangements for the second presidential debate, which is scheduled for 15 October in Miami, Florida. Mr Trump is not the first world leader to have tested positive. Earlier this year, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro were infected. They both have since recovered, although Mr Johnson had to receive regular oxygen treatment to help his breathing during hospitalisation. A week after Donald Trump told Americans not to worry about Covid-19 because ""it affects virtually nobody"" except the elderly and those with heart conditions, the president himself has tested positive for the virus. It is difficult to overstate exactly how earth-shaking a development this is, just 32 days before the US elections. The president will have to quarantine for treatment. Campaign rallies are off. The next presidential debate, in two weeks, is in question. The recurring message from the president, that the nation is ""rounding the turn"" in its handling of the virus, has been undermined by his own illness. Just two days ago, during the first debate, Trump belittled his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, for frequently wearing masks and not having campaign rallies that matched his own in size. Now, the White House and the campaign will have to answer why the president took such a seemingly cavalier attitude toward protecting himself - and how many others in the White House and the higher echelons of the US government may have been exposed. During times of national turmoil, the American public tends to rally in support of the president. It may not be enough to insulate him from the questions that follow, however. Vice-President Mike Pence and his wife were tested on Friday morning, and the results were negative,Mr Pence's press secretary Devin O'Malley tweeted.,external Later on Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who would in theory take charge of government if both the president and vice-president were incapacitated, said she had been tested on Friday morning and had not yet received the results. Ms Pelosi, a Democrat, said ""continuity plans were in place"", but she herself had not been contacted by the White House about this. Other members of the Trump family - his daughter Ivanka, son Barron and son-in-law Jared Kushner - have all tested negative. Several White House officials have been infected previously. In May,vice-presidential spokeswoman Katie Miller tested positive, as well as a member of the US Navy who was serving as one of Mr Trump's personal valets. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, a number of Secret Service agents, a Marine One pilot and a White House cafeteria worker have also tested positive.

"This video can not be played President Trump's seven days before his Covid-positive test US President Donald Trump has mild symptoms of Covid-19 after he and his wife Melania tested positive for the coronavirus, the White House says. Mr Trump's chief of staff said the president was ""on the job"" and ""in good spirits"", but his physician also said he was ""fatigued"".

But he pulled out of a video conference call with vulnerable seniors scheduled for Friday, leaving Vice-President Mike Pence to chair the meeting. On Thursday, the first couple said they intended to self-isolate after one of Mr Trump's closest aides, Hope Hicks, tested positive. Soon afterwards, they too received positive test results. There has been criticism of Mr Trump's decision to go to a fundraiser attended by dozens of people in New Jersey on Thursday, apparently when officials already knew about Ms Hicks's symptoms. Ms Hicks (R) is said to be experiencing symptoms Ms Hicks, 31, travelled with Mr Trump on Air Force One to the first presidential TV debate with Mr Biden in Ohio on Tuesday.

It is not clear how Mr Trump's positive test will affect arrangements for the second presidential debate, which is scheduled for 15 October in Miami, Florida. The Trump campaign issued a statement saying Mr Trump's campaign events would be temporarily postponed or turned virtual, but Mr Pence will continue campaigning as he tested negative. Mr Trump is not the first world leader to have tested positive. Earlier this year, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro were infected. They both have since recovered, although Mr Johnson had to receive regular oxygen treatment to help his breathing during hospitalisation. The US presidential election has been turned on its head. That sentence could have been written about any number of moments in a tumultuous year in American politics, but nothing quite like this has occurred this year, this decade, this century. Just 32 days before the presidential election, Donald Trump has tested positive for Covid-19. Given his age, 74, he is in a high-risk category for complications from the disease. At the very least, he will have to quarantine while he is treated, meaning the US presidential contest - at least his side of it - has been fundamentally altered. The initial implications are obvious. The president's rigorous campaign schedule - which included visits to Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia, Florida and North Carolina in just the past week - is on indefinite hold. Trump will certainly have surrogates on the trail for him, but given that he has relied heavily on his family and senior administration and campaign officials for such tasks in the past, and many of them may have to quarantine because of their own exposure to the virus, that campaign operation will be disrupted as well.

"The government looked into putting floating barriers in the English Channel to stop asylum seekers crossing to the UK, a leaked document shows. The Home Office approached the trade group Maritime UK over the possible use of temporary ""marine fencing"", in a request for ideas sent over the summer. This, it said, must be able to ""prevent a slow-moving, heavily overloaded migrant boat from making progress"". The government said it did not ""comment on leaks"". But Maritime UK said it was its ""clear view"" that building a wall in the Channel was ""not legally possible"" under the terms of theInternational Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea.,external Asylum seekers could be processed on old ferries Smugglers 'cut cost of migrant Channel crossings' Three migrant boats intercepted in Channel This year, almost 7,000 people have reached the UK in more than 500 small boats, often totally unsuited to the conditions. Home Secretary Priti Patel has declared she is""determined to stop this criminal trade"". The government has looked at setting up a processing centre for asylum seekers on Ascension Island, 4,000 miles from the UK - or on disused ferries moored off the coast of England. Meanwhile,the Times has reported,externalthat other proposals drawn up by the Home Office include the use of a water cannon in the Channel to create waves to push back vessels. On Thursday, the most senior civil servant at the Home Office, Matthew Rycroft, told MPs that ""everything is on the table"" when it comes to ""improving"" the UK's asylum system. He added that the UK had been ""looking at what a whole host of other countries do in order to bring innovation into our own system"". An email from Maritime UK - sent on 17 September andfirst seen by the Financial Times,external- included the request put out by the government over the summer, asking ""what options are available for marine fencing and other water-based technologies that would inhibit passage to UK territorial waters"". These needed ""the capability to fully prevent a slow-moving, heavily overloaded migrant boat from making progress"" and had to be ""deployable to a precise location, and capable of remaining in that position"". The request added that the technology had to be ""rapidly deployable and rapidly removable"", while being ""safe for those who come into contact with it"" and ""for those operating it"". The Strait of Dover - separating the Channel and the North Sea - is theworld's busiest shipping lane.,external The Home Office suggested that any fencing be placed ""on the median line"", which separates French and UK territorial waters, but ""without the equipment entering French waters"". It was reported earlier this year that the Greek government was planning toconstruct a barrier of nets,externalto deter people crossing the Aegean by boat from Turkey. These would use pylons connected to the seabed, leaving half a metre - topped by flashing lights - above the surface, the magazine Dezeen said.

When asked about the possibility of a floating wall in the Channel, a Home Office spokeswoman said the department ""does not comment on leaks"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Itâs just up to them' Boris Johnson has said it is now up to the EU to avoid a no-deal scenario over post-Brexit trade. After the final round of formal talks between officials, the prime minister said a deal was ""all there"". But the prime minister said Brussels had to be ""commonsensical"" to get it across the line, with both sides setting an October deadline to settle their differences. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for talks to ""intensify"". She is due to meet Mr Johnson on Saturday via video call to ""take stock"" of the situation and decide the next steps. Talks between chief negotiators Lord David Frost and Michel Barnier broke up earlier, without an agreement. Mr Barnier said ""persistent serious divergences"" remained between the two sides, while Lord Frost said there was ""very little time now to resolve these issues"". What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit deal must be made, says business boss Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? The UK formally left the EU in January, but entered a transition period - where the UK has kept to EU trading rules and remained inside its customs union and single market - to allow the two sides to negotiate a trade deal. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, but there has been concerns over whether a plan would be agreed before that period runs out on 31 December. Issues that have become particular sticking points between negotiators are state aid - where governments give financial support to businesses - and fishing rules. The EU has said a deal must be reached before the end of October to allow it to be signed off by the member states before the end of the year, while Mr Johnson has said both sides should ""move on"" if agreement was not reached by the middle of the month. If a deal is not done, the UK will go on to trade with the bloc on World Trade Organisation rules. In a round of interviews with the BBC, Mr Johnson said: ""I hope that we get a deal, it's up to our friends."" He told BBC Northern Ireland's Mark Devenport: ""They've done a deal with Canada of a kind that we want, why shouldn't they do it with us? ""We're so near, we've been members for 45 years. It's all there, it's just up to them."" The PM also said to BBC Midlands Today's Elizabeth Glinka there was ""every chance to get a deal"", but added: ""It's up to our friends and partners to be commonsensical."" Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen will speak via video conference on Saturday Speaking ahead of her call with the UK prime minister, Mrs von der Leyen said: ""We should not forget we have made progress in many many different fields, but of course the most difficult ones are still completely open."" She pointed to the problems with the so-called ""level playing field"" with state aid - calling it ""a question of fairness"" - as well as the issue of fishing, But, she added: ""Overall, where there is a will there is a way, so I think we should intensify the negotiations because it is worth working hard on it."" News of the talks between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen is significant and Saturday cannot be dismissed as more blah blah in the Brexit process. Speculation is rife, of course, as to why the prime minister and the EU Commission president have suddenly scheduled their digital tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte. In general, it's interpreted as a positive sign. The accepted wisdom has always been that negotiating teams can only make so much progress. And that the final push - the politically tough decisions on how much to compromise on the final sticking points - would have to come from up high. But we're not there yet. It's possible the prime minister and Mrs von der Leyen are talking tomorrow to explore who is really willing to make what compromises on the final outstanding issues. For now, the why's and what's of Saturday's talks are pure speculation. The only thing we know for sure: the UK and EU say they want a deal - though not at any price. Yet if and when a deal eventually emerges, both sides will have had to make compromises. Read more from Katya here. In a statement, Lord Frost said the final round of negotiations had been ""constructive"" but ""familiar differences remain"". On fishing, he said the gap was ""unfortunately very large"", and he called for the EU to ""move further before an understanding can be reached"" on state aid. The negotiator added: ""I am concerned that there is very little time now to resolve these issues ahead of the European Council on 15 October [the deadline set by the PM to reach a deal]. ""For our part, we continue to be fully committed to working hard to find solutions, if they are there to be found."" Mr Barnier agreed the negotiations had been conducted in a ""constructive and respectful atmosphere"", with some ""positive new developments on some topics"" - such as aviation safety and police cooperation. But he said there was ""a lack of progress on some important topics"", such as climate change commitments, ""as well as persistent serious divergences on matters of major importance for the European Union"", including state aid and fishing. He added: ""We will continue to maintain a calm and respectful attitude, and we will remain united and determined until the end of these negotiations.""

"Lamu was allegedly live streaming when she was attacked A Chinese influencer has died after her ex-husband allegedly doused her in petrol and set fire to her as she was attempting to live stream, said local media reports. Lamu was popular on Douyin, China's version of TikTok, where she had hundreds of thousands of followers. Lamu suffered burns on 90% of her body and died two weeks after the attack. The case has prompted conversation on social media about violence against women in China. Lamu, 30, from China's Sichuan province, was known for her happy posts on rural life and was praised for not using make up in her videos, which had millions of likes. According to state-media outlet the Beijing Youth Daily, Lamu's screen went black soon after she started livestreaming on 14 September. Her ex-husband, identified only by his surname Tang, had allegedly broken into her house armed with a knife and petrol. A statement from Jinchuan County Public Security Bureau said that after the attack on 14 September, she was taken to a local hospital and later transferred to Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital for further treatment. Her family asked her followers for financial help and more than one million yuan (Â£114,280)was raised in just 24 hours,external, according to The Paper. Lamu died on 30 September. According to the Beijing Youth Daily, Tang reportedly had a history of domestic violence. Lamu's brother-in-law, identified as Mr Luo, said he had heard his wife ""mention that her sister was often beaten by Tang"". Lamu reportedly divorced Tang earlier this year in May - the pair have two children, and each gained custody of one child. Shortly afterwards, Tang threatened to kill one child if Lamu did not re-marry him, said the news report. She did, but ended up running away from him. Unable to find her, he reportedly questioned her relatives - Lamu's sister, who refused to reveal her whereabouts, was also beaten by Tang. Family members said this incident was reported to the police who, according to them, took no action. She eventually divorced him again and he gained custody of both children. Police said Tang was detained on 14 September on suspicion of ""intentional homicide"". A team is continuing to investigate,the statement said,external. The case has prompted discussion onChina's social media site Weibo,external. More than 70 million people have used a hashtag mentioning her death. One user said she hopes ""women are given more security"". Another attacked police officials saying: ""Where were you when a report was made? Why didn't you care?"" Chinese city lets people see partner's abuse history Vlogger reignites Chinese domestic violence debate This is not the first time a victim of domestic violence has met with difficulty in China's legal system. Earlier this year, a Chinese woman was beaten by her husband so brutally that she jumped from a window to escape. She later attempted to divorce him, providing CCTV footage of the event as proof. The court refused to grant the divorce. She later uploaded the video on to social media where thousands rushed to her defence - the court later granted her divorce. Earlier this year, China introduced a new 30-day ""cool-off"" period before couples are granted a divorce, to allow both parties time to rethink their decision. But this has sparked some concern that victims of domestic abuse could be coerced during that period to reconsider. The law, which will come into effect in 2021, is not applicable to families with a history of domestic violence, though rights groups say many cases are not reported to police.

"E-scooters should be legalised on roads but riding on pavements should be prohibited, the Transport Committee of MPs has said. Currently, privately-owned e-scooters are banned to use in the UK anywhere except on private land. The committee argues the vehicles, which usually travel 9-15mph, could offer a green alternative to the car. Official trials of rented e-scooters have already been announced in some places in England. When can I ride an e-scooter legally? E-scooter trial put on hold days after rollout Electric scooter rider injured in hit-and-run While supporting the introduction of e-scooters, the Transport Committee said the government should use trials to monitor the numbers and types of collisions that take place. Describing riding e-scooters on pavements as ""dangerous and anti-social"", the committee said the law should ""prohibit their use on pavements"" and that ""robust enforcement measures"" would be needed. Further committee recommendations include allowing local authorities to determine the speed of e-scooters and encouraging users to wear helmets. It also said there are ""valid environmental concerns"" about the processes used to recharge e-scooter batteries and advised the Department for Transport to monitor the environmental impact. The Tees Valley, Milton Keynes Borough, Northamptonshire, and the West Midlands have signed up to trial the use of rental e-scooters. However a trial in Coventry was paused after five days following concerns over pedestrian safety and e-scooters being abandoned on the streets. Committee chair Huw Merriman said: ""E-scooters have the potential to become an exciting and ingenious way to navigate our streets and get from place to place. ""If this gets people out of the car, reducing congestion and exercising in the open air, then even better."" But he added: ""We need to ensure that their arrival on our streets doesn't make life more difficult for pedestrians, and especially disabled people."" RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said e-scooters could ""transform how many of us get around"" but added ""the path to introducing them safely is fraught with difficulties"". He called for effective regulation and education of riders to ensure ""limited road space"" could be shared safely by drivers, cyclists and e-scooter riders. And Roger Geffen from Cycling UK said the maximum speed and weight of e-scooters should be reduced before legalisation. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We welcome the outcome of the committee's report today and believe that e-scooters can offer an affordable, reliable and sustainable way to travel. ""Safety will always be our top priority and our current trials are allowing us to better understand the benefits of e-scooters and their impact on public space, helping us to design future regulations.""

"Tensions rose after Turkey sent a research ship to waters near Greek islands The EU says it could impose sanctions on Turkey over ""provocations and pressures"" in a row with Greece over energy resources and maritime borders. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on Ankara to ""abstain from unilateral actions"" in the eastern Mediterranean. She spoke early on Friday during a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels. Earlier,Turkey and Greece set up a military hotlineto try to reduce the risk of clashes in the region. Tensions rose earlier this year when Turkey sent a ship into a disputed area to search for potentially rich oil and gas deposits. Why Turkey-Greece tensions have flared in Med The Eastern Mediterranean tinderbox Mrs von der Leyen told reporters that the EU wanted ""a positive and constructive relationship with Turkey and this would be also be very much in Ankara's interest"". ""But it will only work if the provocations and pressures stop,"" she said. ""We therefore expect that Turkey from now on abstains from unilateral actions. In case of such renewed actions by Ankara, the EU will use all its instruments and options available. We have a toolbox that we can apply immediately."" European Council President Charles Michel and Mrs von der Leyen are taking part in the socially distanced summit After their late-night meeting, EU members agreed to review Turkey's behaviour in December and impose sanctions if ""provocations"" had not stopped. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, posting on Twitter after the meeting, said: ""The EU issues a clear threat of sanctions against Turkey should it continue to violate international law."" European Council President Charles Michel said the EU was offering Turkey closer relations on trade and other areas, but holding out the threat of sanctions if tensions in the Mediterranean did not de-escalate. ""We very much want to give political dialogue a chance to move toward greater stability,"" he said. Arriving for the second day of the EU summit in Brussels, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the EU had sent ""a message of unity, solidarity and determination"" to Ankara, which made clear the consequences of its ""aggressive behaviour"". But a Turkish official said it was hoped talks with Greece would resume soon and that sanctions would put dialogue at risk. ""If the EU applies sanctions, this will not deter us. On the contrary this would increase our resolve,"" the official told Reuters news agency. The European Union and Turkey have long held a fragile relationship. Turkey has been a long-term candidate for membership of the EU, but efforts have stalled. EU leaders have criticised Turkey's record on human rights and the rule of law, in particular in the wake of the 2016 failed military coup. Despite the strains, Turkey remains an important partner for the EU. Turkey hosts millions of migrants and struck a deal with the EU that limited the numbers arriving in Greece. Greece and Turkey are both Nato members, but have a history of border disputes and competing claims over maritime rights. Tensions flared in August when Ankara sent the research shipinto an area south of the Greek island of Kastellorizo which is claimed by Greece, Turkey and Cyprus. Greece called the move a ""new serious escalation"" and the EU has backed its members Cyprus and Greece against Turkey. Tensions eased somewhat when the research ship returned to Turkish waters last month and both sides said they were prepared to resume talks. The announcement of the hotline on Thursday followed talks between Turkey and Greece at the Nato headquarters in Brussels. ""I welcome the establishment of a military de-confliction mechanism, achieved through the constructive engagement of Greece and Turkey, both valued Nato allies,"" said Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. ""This safety mechanism can help to create the space for diplomatic efforts to address the underlying dispute and we stand ready to develop it further."" Such mechanisms enable direct communication between two sides. Russia and the US set one up during the Cold War and it has been in operation ever since.

"Dozens of former sub-postmasters and postmistresses should get a clear path in quashing their convictions for fraud, theft and false accounting. They were convicted of stealing money after the Post Office installed a new computer system, with some imprisoned. Many have now been told the Post Office will not contest their appeals against conviction. For years, their criminal record put some of those affected in dire financial circumstances. Some struggled to secure work, lost their homes, and even failed to get insurance owing to their convictions, but they always said the fault was in the computer system. The Post Office said it would not oppose 44 out of 47 appeals. The decision makes it almost certain that convictions will be quashed, although Court of Appeal judges must decide and the Post Office can seek a retrial. More cases remain under scrutiny. Jo Hamilton says she is ""drained"" by the battle Jo Hamilton is one of the people who has been told that the appeal against her conviction will not be contested. ""Twelve years I've been battling and it's just drained us. We've been fighting to prove we were innocent. There it is in black and white. I'm not a criminal,"" she said. ""It's just gone on for so long. It's been a massive part of my life."" Mrs Hamilton was accused by the Post Office of taking Â£36,000 from the village shop she ran in Hampshire. She said issues in the Horizon computer system led to big discrepancies in her accounts, which she reported to her Post Office area manager. But that manager could find nothing wrong with the system, and she was put in a situation where ""you had to prove your innocence"". After a distressing two-year process, she eventually pleaded guilty to false accounting at Winchester Crown Court in order to escape a more serious charge of theft. She had to give up her shop and found it difficult to get a new job due to her criminal record. Declaring the criminal record also  affected everyday life, such as failing to get car insurance. She made ends meet by doing cleaning jobs for people in her village who did not believe she was guilty. Many of them, including the local vicar, came to support her at her sentencing hearing. This video can not be played Seema Misra: ""I'm not a convicted criminal anymore"" Another former sub-postmistress, Seema Misra, was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She was in tears after being told her appeal would not be contested, saying that she had been ""suffering"" for 15 years as a result of the case. ""Prison was my worst nightmare. I never thought of giving up,"" she said. ""I'm so, so happy. Justice has been done. I can now proudly say my name."" Scottish probe into sub-postmasters' convictions Postmasters were prosecuted using unreliable evidence 'Post Office false theft claim left me bankrupt' ThePost Office agreed in December to pay almost Â£58mto settle the long-running dispute with more than 500 sub-postmasters and postmistresses affected by the scandal, many of whom had been fired or made bankrupt as a result. The settlement brought an end to a mammoth series of court cases over the Horizon IT system used to manage local post office finances since 1999. Earlier this week, the government announced that retired judge Sir Wyn Williams would lead the inquiry into the Post Office's failings after repeated calls for a judge-led, full public inquiry. The Horizon system is designed to record the transactions carried out in a post office branch The Horizon system, developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu, was first rolled out in 1999 to some post offices to be used for a variety of tasks including accounting and stocktaking. But from an early stage it appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money. It was difficult for sub-postmasters to challenge errors because they were unable to access information about the software to do so. After more than 900 prosecutions, 550 sub-postmasters raised civil actions against the Post Office whichagreed to pay Â£58m damages. The English Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) has referred 47 convictions brought under Horizon evidence to the Appeal Court. The Director of Public Prosecutions is also considering whether there should be charges of perjury against officials who claimed in court there were no problems with Horizon, even though emails and other documents now suggest they knew there were. Listen to the background of the saga -The Great Post Office Trial on BBC Sounds Solicitor Neil Hudgell, who represented 33 of the sub-postmasters, said the Post Office's decision not to contest appeals would have wider implications. ""[This] is a landmark moment, not only for these individuals, but in time, potentially hundreds of others. The door to justice has been opened,"" he said. ""We are today obviously delighted for the people we represent. Clearing their names has been their driving goal from day one, as their reputations and livelihoods were so unfairly destroyed."" Six cases which were only heard by magistrates do not go to the Court of Appeal but instead to another hearing at the Crown Court, but the Post Office will not offer any evidence, which will mean they will be cleared. Tim Parker, chairman of the Post Office, said: ""I am sincerely sorry on behalf of the Post Office for historical failings which seriously affected some postmasters. ""Post Office is resetting its relationship with postmasters with reforms that prevent such past events ever happening again.""

"The Gender Identity Service is based at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust Doctors at a child gender clinic raised concerns about the use of puberty blockers 15 years ago - an issue that was also discussed by staff last year. An internal review conducted in 2005, obtained by BBC Newsnight, says some clinicians felt pressured to refer patients for the treatment too quickly. Staff at the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS)raised serious safeguarding issueslast year. The Trust which runs the clinic said the report was ""no longer relevant"". GIDS, which is run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, is a specialised unit for young people who have difficulties with their gender identity. What does transgender mean and what does the law say? In 2005, the Trust's then medical director, adult psychiatrist Dr David Taylor, conducted a review into the service - then called the Gender Identity Development Unit. He reported that colleagues at the Trust were working hard to provide good care for patients, but highlighted concerns about some aspects of their treatment. The document details concerns raised by some clinicians at that time about alleged pressure on staff to refer patients for treatment with puberty blockers, a lack of a robust evidence base underpinning this treatment, and the apparently troubled backgrounds of some young people referred. These included past sexual abuse and trauma. Staff concerns 'shut down' at child gender clinic NHS gender clinic 'should have challenged me more' Newsnight obtained the 2005 review via the Freedom of Information Act, a move which the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust resisted. It argued disclosure of the document would ""adversely impact on the Trust's ability to provide effective and safe services to its patients"". But theInformation Commissioner's Office ruled,externalthat the document's publication was in the public interest. In his 2005 report Dr Taylor, who left in 2011 after 30 years, made a series of recommendations for improvements to the service - which in 2005 was much smaller, receiving tens of referrals per year rather than thousands. Dr Taylor called for the service to monitor patients after leaving, for more research into this area of healthcare, and for staff to be supported if faced with pressure to refer for treatments when they thought it was inappropriate. In his report, which was published in 2006, he said puberty blockers might be the best course of action for some, but added that in his view young people needed a period of explorative therapy first. The document also detailed concerns from some staff about the speed at which some young people were being referred for treatment with puberty blockers. These drugs stop a young person's body developing, with the aim of helping to relieve gender dysphoria - distress caused when a person's gender identity does not match their biological sex. The NHSnow recognises,externalthat little is known about their long term side effects. Concerns about the use of puberty blockers were subsequently raised by other staff in the internal 2019 review of the service. It is unclear why some recommendations made in 2005 were not implemented, but Dr Taylor told Newsnight there may be several reasons, and said the demand for the service was ""greater than the capacity of the unit to cope."" Society's shifting attitudes towards gender identity, and the underfunding of other adolescent mental health services are also important, he told the BBC. Last month the NHSannounced an independent review,externalinto gender identity services for young people. In a statement the Trust said: ""This report from 2006 is not relevant to the circumstances and issues faced by the GIDS service today. The service had been nationally commissioned since 2009, with NHS England (NHSE) taking responsibility for it in 2013. The service specifications were reviewed in 2016 and are currently under review again, as scheduled. ""Some of the young people we see in the service experience difficulties which may or may not be related to gender dysphoria. GIDS is a specialist service and relies on an integrated care model in which it works closely with local CAMHS to support ongoing difficulties. ""It is important to recognise that not all co-occurring difficulties will be resolved by accessing specialist psychosocial exploration of gender identity and related issues."" The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust welcomed the NHS review of gender services, to be conducted by Dr Hilary Cass, the former President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. ""We welcome this and hope this will lead to better and quicker access to support for these young people.""

"US President Donald Trump is discharged from the Walter Reed medical centre following three days of Covid treatment His doctors say he is safe to return to the White House but ""may not be entirely out of the woods yet"" In a tweet, he said we was feeling ""really good"", and added: ""Don't be afraid of Covid"" Questions remain about the seriousness of the president's illness after conflicting statements In the UK, a technical glitch which meant nearly 16,000 cases went unreported has caused delays to its track and trace system UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will ""always balance the books"" as coronavirus costs rise All bars in the French capital Paris will shut from Tuesday as the city's coronavirus alert is raised to maximum More than 35.1 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed globally, with over one million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Henri Astier and Lauren Turner Marine One delivers US President Donald Trump to the White House We're pausing our live coverage for now. We'll be back in a few hours with more updates from the UK and around the world. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the key moments from the day's swift-moving events:  We will continue to update our main story aboutPresident Trump's health and treatment here. And you can findmore of our coronavirus coverage here. Thanks for reading. President Trump raised a fist as left the military hospital, before walking to his vehicle and giving a thumbs-up. He was then driven to the Marine One helicopter to be transported to the White House. US President Donald Trump has left Walter Reed hospital, where he has been treated for Covid-19 over the last three days. He is now on his way back to the White House to continue his treatment there. Biden has called on Trump to ""support masks"" Now some reaction to President Trumpâs condition from Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger in Novemberâs presidential election. Biden has shown restraint since Trumpâs diagnosis, toning down his political rhetoric and suspending adverts attacking the president. But tonight, Biden struck a more combative tone, signalling a change in the dynamic of the election campaign. ""I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,â Biden said at a rally in Little Havana in Miami on Monday. âNow that he's busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.â President Trump has eschewed face masks in the past and mocked Biden for wearing one in the first presidential debate. With Trump getting ready to leave Walter Reed Medical Center tonight, his daughter Ivanka has tweeted her thanks to the hospital's staff. Trump tweeted earlier that he would be discharged from hospital at about 18:30 local time - 23:30 BST. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a tweet announcing his imminent departure from hospital,external, President Trump played down the threat of Covid-19, as he has done throughout the pandemic. âDonât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life,â he wrote after receiving four days of round-the-clock medical care for the virus. However 209,000 Americans have died of the virus so far. Covid-19 treatments are improving and becoming more readily available, but the risk of death remains, especially in the US, where measures to contain the virus have been patchy. Since the beginning of April, there have been hundreds - sometimes thousands - of daily coronavirus deaths in the US,World Health Organization figures show,external. At 64.10 per 100,000 people, the Covid-19 death rate in the US is the 10th-highest in the world,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. Nancy Pelosi has been a vocal critic of the president's handling of the pandemic We have just heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected Democrat. She told MSNBC: ""[Trump] should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he's had such good policies. Because in fact, he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country."" Hours earlier, the president tweeted he would be discharged from hospital, saying: ""Donât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge."" Pelosi also said the White House's testing protocol for Covid-19 ""apparently...doesn't work"". Since President Trumpâs Covid-19 diagnosis, his personal physician Dr Conley has been thrust into the spotlight. Conley has given daily briefings since on the president's condition since Saturday. But what do we know about the White House physician? The 40-year-old has been in the position since March 2018. Like most medical staff at the White House, Conley is a military officer. Conley is from Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2002 before studying at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He received his degree in 2006. After further courses, Conley served with a Nato medical unit in Afghanistan. He received a Romanian Emblem of Honour for saving a Romanian soldier wounded by a homemade explosive device. The US Navy officer was later assigned to the White House Medical Unit. He then became Trump's acting personal doctor when the president nominated his then-physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, to head the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Read more about Conley here Cohen testified to Congress in 2019 Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has sharply criticised his ex-boss for visiting supporters during his hospital stay while being treated for coronavirus. ""Heâs potentially infecting these people. And he doesnât care, because again, Donald Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Cohen tells BBC World, adding that the Secret Service agents who rode in the heavily fortified car with him are now at higher risk of infection. ""They vow to take a bullet for him, as I once did,"" Cohen says, referring to probably his most famous quote from back when he was still a Trump loyalist. ""I would have taken a bullet for him but not if heâs the one pulling the trigger,"" he added. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and I do not understand what the man was thinking... But Donald Trump is an uncaged animal. ""He thinks he's completely autonomous. Heâs not going to answer to anyone."" The debate will take place in Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday On Wednesday night, Republican Vice-President Mike Pence will face Democratic Senator Kamala Harris for the only vice-presidential debate ahead of November's election. This election cycle has seen increased scrutiny on Pence and Harris, as they support the campaign of two presidential candidates in their 70s. With President Trump now receiving treatment for Covid-19, and more members of the White House announcing positive virus tests, thereâs a new emphasis on precautions from event organisers. For one, the vice-presidential candidates will stand more than 3m (9.8ft) apart (podiums at the first Trump-Biden debate last week were 2m apart). They will be separated by plexiglass, CNN reports. Covid testing is already under way for reporters and others planning on attending the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Whether everyone will be required to wear a mask this time remains to be seen. Now, we want to know:What questions do you have about the vice-presidential debate?You tell us hereand weâll get to work finding the answers. This video can not be played Trump's health team at Walter Reed say he is ready to leave White House physician Sean Conley said the president's health team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his recovery. Less than an hour before Monday's briefing by doctors, Trump tweeted that he planned to leave hospital before the end of the day. White House physician Sean Conley said the team was 'cautiously optimistic' about the president's recovery. A little bit more now on what Dr Conley said at the briefing. He said Trump was a ""phenomenal patient"" during his four-day stay at the Walter Reed military hospital. ""He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond
safe and reasonable practice,"" he said. When commenting on the president's recent video and tweets, he said: ""He's back!"" But Dr Conley did not answer questions about the findings of scans of the president's lungs, which can be affected by the virus, citing rules and regulations about the sharing of information. He also said there was no evidence of ""live virus still present"" that Trump could transmit to others. Dr Conley said Trump âcontinued to improveâ After four days in hospital, President Trump has been cleared to return to the White House, with his physician deeming it âsafeâ to discharge him. Hereâs a timeline of some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Read more:Who Trump met and who's tested positive Here's a recap of what the doctors treating the president said at their briefing moments ago: Trump's campaign ran a series of attack ads against his Democratic rival Joe Biden on Monday. This is despite the fact that the Biden team removed attack ads after Trump went into hospital last week. The move puts the Democrats in a difficult position. The Biden campaign press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"". Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump is going âhomeâ. Of course, in this case, home is a secure government compound with
top-notch medical facilities. Still, the decision that the president can return to
the White House is being hailed by him and his medical team as an important
indication of his improving condition. âHeâs back,â White House physician Sean Conley said during his Monday
afternoon briefing. Conley and his fellow physicians shared positive details about the
presidentâs condition - a lack of fever, good blood-oxygen levels and âno
respiratory complaintsâ. But he once again refused to disclose when the
president last tested negative for the coronavirus â information that would
help determine if Trump exposed anyone else to the virus. And when
pressed for more details on the presidentâs condition, such as evidence of
longer-term damage to the his lungs, Conley cited patient privacy. This patient is the president of the United States, however, and
Americans may demand more details about his long-term health and prognosis,
particularly as they head to the polls in a month to decide whether to give him
another four-year term in office. Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact tracing. We have had a closer look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"".   President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn on 26 September Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Since testing positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump has been receiving a number of different drugs, as revealed by his doctors. It is unclear when the president contracted the virus, but there are two broad phases of a coronavirus infection - the first where the virus is the problem and the second, deadly phase, when our immune system goes into overdrive and starts causing massive collateral damage to other organs. Treatments fall into two camps - those that directly attack the virus and are more likely to be useful in the first phase and drugs to calm the immune system which are more likely to work in the second. So what drugs are being used and what do they tell us about his condition? Read more about his treatment here. The doctors' briefing has now ended, with the president saying he expects to leave hospital at 18:30 Eastern time (22:30 GMT). Stay with us as we bring you more details about what the doctors said and analysis. Dr Conley has also revealed that the president was given extra oxygen twice after experiencing a drop in oxygen levels. On Sunday, the doctor had confirmed that the president had been given supplemental oxygen on Friday at the White House, hours before he was flown to the hospital. But he did not say whether the president had been given oxygen after his levels dropped again on Saturday. The doctor also said that the president appeared to be a little dehydrated on Friday, when he had a high fever. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The president says: ""We will get through this together"" US President Donald Trump has said he and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for coronavirus and are now self-isolating. Mr Trump, aged 74 and therefore in a high-risk group, wrote on Twitter: ""We will get through this together."" The president has ""mild symptoms"" of coronavirus, White House officials say. Mr Trump's announcement comes just over a month before the presidential elections on 3 November, where he faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden. The development comes after Hope Hicks, one of Mr Trump's closest aides, tested positive. Latest updates Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? How will this affect US election?

In a tweet,Mr Biden and his wife Jill wished the first couple a swift recovery,external: ""We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family,"" he said. It is not clear whether Mr Biden is also being tested, and whether he will continue his campaign on Friday with a scheduled visit to Michigan. He stood approximately 10ft (3m) away from Mr Trump during the debate. Debate moderator Chris Wallace said on Friday he was getting tested. A person is required to self-isolate after either showing coronavirus symptoms or a positive test. Meanwhile, quarantine restricts the movements of those who have been in contact with an infected person, but are not themselves positive or symptomatic. Mr Trump has mostly spurned mask-wearing and has often been pictured not socially distanced with aides or others during official engagements. The coronavirus has infected more than 7.2 million Americans, killing more than 200,000 of them. Mr Trump's physician, Dr Sean Conley, released a statement late on Thursday,,externalsaying the president and the first lady were ""both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence"". ""Rest assured I expect the president to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering, and I will keep you updated on any future developments,"" the statement said. The physician provided no further details. However, White House officials and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin later said Mr Trump was experiencing mild Covid-19 symptoms. According to Mr Trump's most recent physical examination earlier this year, he weighed 244lbs (110.7kg). This is considered to be obese for his height of 6ft 3ins. But Dr Conley stated at the time that the president ""remains healthy"". Mr Trump will also have the best medical care available. America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says a person must self-isolate for 10 days after a positive test. What is the risk to men over 50? US shares set to drop after Trump tests positive Trump has Covid: How the world's media responded It is dangerous to speculate about how the virus will affect any individual person. There are clear risk factors - the older you are, the greater the risk of a coronavirus infection becoming life-threatening. People aged 64-74 with Covid in the US are five times more likely to need hospital care,externaland 90 times more likely to die than somebody in their 20s. The CDC says eight out of 10 Covid deaths in the country have been in the over-65s. The virus also seems to hit men and people who are overweight harder. But that is the big picture - a pattern seen across the whole population - it is not a way of saying this is what will happen to the US president. The health of any two 74-year-olds can be wildly different and other medical conditions massively alter how big a threat this virus poses. Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? Earlier on Thursday, Mr Trump said he and his wife, who is 50, were going to self-isolate after Ms Hicks's positive test. Hope Hicks has been at Mr Trump's side for years He tweeted: ""Hope Hicks, who has been working so hard without even taking a small break, has just tested positive for Covid 19. Terrible! ""The First Lady and I are waiting for our test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!"" According to Bloomberg News, Ms Hicks is experiencing symptoms of the disease. Who is Hope Hicks? It is not clear how Mr Trump's positive test will affect arrangements for the second presidential debate, which is scheduled for 15 October in Miami, Florida. Mr Trump is not the first world leader to have tested positive. Earlier this year, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro were infected. They both have since recovered, although Mr Johnson had to receive regular oxygen treatment to help his breathing during hospitalisation. A week after Donald Trump told Americans not to worry about Covid-19 because ""it affects virtually nobody"" except the elderly and those with heart conditions, the president himself has tested positive for the virus. It is difficult to overstate exactly how earth-shaking a development this is, just 32 days before the US elections. The president will have to quarantine for treatment. Campaign rallies are off. The next presidential debate, in two weeks, is in question. The recurring message from the president, that the nation is ""rounding the turn"" in its handling of the virus, has been undermined by his own illness. Just two days ago, during the first debate, Trump belittled his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, for frequently wearing masks and not having campaign rallies that matched his own in size. Now, the White House and the campaign will have to answer why the president took such a seemingly cavalier attitude toward protecting himself - and how many others in the White House and the higher echelons of the US government may have been exposed. During times of national turmoil, the American public tends to rally in support of the president. It may not be enough to insulate him from the questions that follow, however.

We'll be back in a few hours with more updates from the UK and around the world. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the key moments from the day's swift-moving events:  We will continue to update our main story aboutPresident Trump's health and treatment here. And you can findmore of our coronavirus coverage here. Thanks for reading. President Trump raised a fist as left the military hospital, before walking to his vehicle and giving a thumbs-up. He was then driven to the Marine One helicopter to be transported to the White House. US President Donald Trump has left Walter Reed hospital, where he has been treated for Covid-19 over the last three days. He is now on his way back to the White House to continue his treatment there. Biden has called on Trump to ""support masks"" Now some reaction to President Trumpâs condition from Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger in Novemberâs presidential election. Biden has shown restraint since Trumpâs diagnosis, toning down his political rhetoric and suspending adverts attacking the president. But tonight, Biden struck a more combative tone, signalling a change in the dynamic of the election campaign. ""I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,â Biden said at a rally in Little Havana in Miami on Monday. âNow that he's busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.â President Trump has eschewed face masks in the past and mocked Biden for wearing one in the first presidential debate. With Trump getting ready to leave Walter Reed Medical Center tonight, his daughter Ivanka has tweeted her thanks to the hospital's staff. Trump tweeted earlier that he would be discharged from hospital at about 18:30 local time - 23:30 BST. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a tweet announcing his imminent departure from hospital,external, President Trump played down the threat of Covid-19, as he has done throughout the pandemic. âDonât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life,â he wrote after receiving four days of round-the-clock medical care for the virus. However 209,000 Americans have died of the virus so far. Covid-19 treatments are improving and becoming more readily available, but the risk of death remains, especially in the US, where measures to contain the virus have been patchy. Since the beginning of April, there have been hundreds - sometimes thousands - of daily coronavirus deaths in the US,World Health Organization figures show,external. At 64.10 per 100,000 people, the Covid-19 death rate in the US is the 10th-highest in the world,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. Nancy Pelosi has been a vocal critic of the president's handling of the pandemic We have just heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected Democrat. She told MSNBC: ""[Trump] should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he's had such good policies. Because in fact, he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country."" Hours earlier, the president tweeted he would be discharged from hospital, saying: ""Donât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge."" Pelosi also said the White House's testing protocol for Covid-19 ""apparently...doesn't work"". Since President Trumpâs Covid-19 diagnosis, his personal physician Dr Conley has been thrust into the spotlight. Conley has given daily briefings since on the president's condition since Saturday. But what do we know about the White House physician? The 40-year-old has been in the position since March 2018. Like most medical staff at the White House, Conley is a military officer. Conley is from Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2002 before studying at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He received his degree in 2006. After further courses, Conley served with a Nato medical unit in Afghanistan. He received a Romanian Emblem of Honour for saving a Romanian soldier wounded by a homemade explosive device. The US Navy officer was later assigned to the White House Medical Unit. He then became Trump's acting personal doctor when the president nominated his then-physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, to head the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Read more about Conley here Cohen testified to Congress in 2019 Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has sharply criticised his ex-boss for visiting supporters during his hospital stay while being treated for coronavirus. ""Heâs potentially infecting these people. And he doesnât care, because again, Donald Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Cohen tells BBC World, adding that the Secret Service agents who rode in the heavily fortified car with him are now at higher risk of infection. ""They vow to take a bullet for him, as I once did,"" Cohen says, referring to probably his most famous quote from back when he was still a Trump loyalist. ""I would have taken a bullet for him but not if heâs the one pulling the trigger,"" he added. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and I do not understand what the man was thinking... But Donald Trump is an uncaged animal. ""He thinks he's completely autonomous. Heâs not going to answer to anyone."" The debate will take place in Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday On Wednesday night, Republican Vice-President Mike Pence will face Democratic Senator Kamala Harris for the only vice-presidential debate ahead of November's election. This election cycle has seen increased scrutiny on Pence and Harris, as they support the campaign of two presidential candidates in their 70s. With President Trump now receiving treatment for Covid-19, and more members of the White House announcing positive virus tests, thereâs a new emphasis on precautions from event organisers. For one, the vice-presidential candidates will stand more than 3m (9.8ft) apart (podiums at the first Trump-Biden debate last week were 2m apart). They will be separated by plexiglass, CNN reports. Covid testing is already under way for reporters and others planning on attending the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Whether everyone will be required to wear a mask this time remains to be seen. Now, we want to know:What questions do you have about the vice-presidential debate?You tell us hereand weâll get to work finding the answers. This video can not be played Trump's health team at Walter Reed say he is ready to leave White House physician Sean Conley said the president's health team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his recovery. Less than an hour before Monday's briefing by doctors, Trump tweeted that he planned to leave hospital before the end of the day. White House physician Sean Conley said the team was 'cautiously optimistic' about the president's recovery. A little bit more now on what Dr Conley said at the briefing. He said Trump was a ""phenomenal patient"" during his four-day stay at the Walter Reed military hospital. ""He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond
safe and reasonable practice,"" he said. When commenting on the president's recent video and tweets, he said: ""He's back!"" But Dr Conley did not answer questions about the findings of scans of the president's lungs, which can be affected by the virus, citing rules and regulations about the sharing of information. He also said there was no evidence of ""live virus still present"" that Trump could transmit to others. Dr Conley said Trump âcontinued to improveâ After four days in hospital, President Trump has been cleared to return to the White House, with his physician deeming it âsafeâ to discharge him. Hereâs a timeline of some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Read more:Who Trump met and who's tested positive Here's a recap of what the doctors treating the president said at their briefing moments ago: Trump's campaign ran a series of attack ads against his Democratic rival Joe Biden on Monday. This is despite the fact that the Biden team removed attack ads after Trump went into hospital last week. The move puts the Democrats in a difficult position. The Biden campaign press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"". Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump is going âhomeâ. Of course, in this case, home is a secure government compound with
top-notch medical facilities. Still, the decision that the president can return to
the White House is being hailed by him and his medical team as an important
indication of his improving condition. âHeâs back,â White House physician Sean Conley said during his Monday
afternoon briefing. Conley and his fellow physicians shared positive details about the
presidentâs condition - a lack of fever, good blood-oxygen levels and âno
respiratory complaintsâ. But he once again refused to disclose when the
president last tested negative for the coronavirus â information that would
help determine if Trump exposed anyone else to the virus. And when
pressed for more details on the presidentâs condition, such as evidence of
longer-term damage to the his lungs, Conley cited patient privacy. This patient is the president of the United States, however, and
Americans may demand more details about his long-term health and prognosis,
particularly as they head to the polls in a month to decide whether to give him
another four-year term in office. Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact tracing. We have had a closer look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"".   President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn on 26 September Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Since testing positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump has been receiving a number of different drugs, as revealed by his doctors. It is unclear when the president contracted the virus, but there are two broad phases of a coronavirus infection - the first where the virus is the problem and the second, deadly phase, when our immune system goes into overdrive and starts causing massive collateral damage to other organs. Treatments fall into two camps - those that directly attack the virus and are more likely to be useful in the first phase and drugs to calm the immune system which are more likely to work in the second. So what drugs are being used and what do they tell us about his condition? Read more about his treatment here. The doctors' briefing has now ended, with the president saying he expects to leave hospital at 18:30 Eastern time (22:30 GMT). Stay with us as we bring you more details about what the doctors said and analysis. Dr Conley has also revealed that the president was given extra oxygen twice after experiencing a drop in oxygen levels. On Sunday, the doctor had confirmed that the president had been given supplemental oxygen on Friday at the White House, hours before he was flown to the hospital. But he did not say whether the president had been given oxygen after his levels dropped again on Saturday. The doctor also said that the president appeared to be a little dehydrated on Friday, when he had a high fever. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lamu was allegedly live streaming when she was attacked A Chinese influencer has died after her ex-husband allegedly doused her in petrol and set fire to her as she was attempting to live stream, said local media reports. Lamu was popular on Douyin, China's version of TikTok, where she had hundreds of thousands of followers. Lamu suffered burns on 90% of her body and died two weeks after the attack. The case has prompted conversation on social media about violence against women in China. Lamu, 30, from China's Sichuan province, was known for her happy posts on rural life and was praised for not using make up in her videos, which had millions of likes. According to state-media outlet the Beijing Youth Daily, Lamu's screen went black soon after she started livestreaming on 14 September. Her ex-husband, identified only by his surname Tang, had allegedly broken into her house armed with a knife and petrol. A statement from Jinchuan County Public Security Bureau said that after the attack on 14 September, she was taken to a local hospital and later transferred to Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital for further treatment. Her family asked her followers for financial help and more than one million yuan (Â£114,280)was raised in just 24 hours,external, according to The Paper. Lamu died on 30 September. According to the Beijing Youth Daily, Tang reportedly had a history of domestic violence. Lamu's brother-in-law, identified as Mr Luo, said he had heard his wife ""mention that her sister was often beaten by Tang"". Lamu reportedly divorced Tang earlier this year in May - the pair have two children, and each gained custody of one child. Shortly afterwards, Tang threatened to kill one child if Lamu did not re-marry him, said the news report. She did, but ended up running away from him. Unable to find her, he reportedly questioned her relatives - Lamu's sister, who refused to reveal her whereabouts, was also beaten by Tang. Family members said this incident was reported to the police who, according to them, took no action. She eventually divorced him again and he gained custody of both children. Police said Tang was detained on 14 September on suspicion of ""intentional homicide"". A team is continuing to investigate,the statement said,external. The case has prompted discussion onChina's social media site Weibo,external. More than 70 million people have used a hashtag mentioning her death. One user said she hopes ""women are given more security"". Another attacked police officials saying: ""Where were you when a report was made? Why didn't you care?"" Chinese city lets people see partner's abuse history Vlogger reignites Chinese domestic violence debate This is not the first time a victim of domestic violence has met with difficulty in China's legal system. Earlier this year, a Chinese woman was beaten by her husband so brutally that she jumped from a window to escape. She later attempted to divorce him, providing CCTV footage of the event as proof. The court refused to grant the divorce. She later uploaded the video on to social media where thousands rushed to her defence - the court later granted her divorce. Earlier this year, China introduced a new 30-day ""cool-off"" period before couples are granted a divorce, to allow both parties time to rethink their decision. But this has sparked some concern that victims of domestic abuse could be coerced during that period to reconsider. The law, which will come into effect in 2021, is not applicable to families with a history of domestic violence, though rights groups say many cases are not reported to police.

"Lamu was allegedly live streaming when she was attacked A Chinese influencer has died after her ex-husband allegedly doused her in petrol and set fire to her as she was attempting to live stream, said local media reports. Lamu was popular on Douyin, China's version of TikTok, where she had hundreds of thousands of followers. Lamu suffered burns on 90% of her body and died two weeks after the attack. The case has prompted conversation on social media about violence against women in China. Lamu, 30, from China's Sichuan province, was known for her happy posts on rural life and was praised for not using make up in her videos, which had millions of likes. According to state-media outlet the Beijing Youth Daily, Lamu's screen went black soon after she started livestreaming on 14 September. Her ex-husband, identified only by his surname Tang, had allegedly broken into her house armed with a knife and petrol. A statement from Jinchuan County Public Security Bureau said that after the attack on 14 September, she was taken to a local hospital and later transferred to Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital for further treatment. Her family asked her followers for financial help and more than one million yuan (Â£114,280)was raised in just 24 hours,external, according to The Paper. Lamu died on 30 September. According to the Beijing Youth Daily, Tang reportedly had a history of domestic violence. Lamu's brother-in-law, identified as Mr Luo, said he had heard his wife ""mention that her sister was often beaten by Tang"". Lamu reportedly divorced Tang earlier this year in May - the pair have two children, and each gained custody of one child. Shortly afterwards, Tang threatened to kill one child if Lamu did not re-marry him, said the news report. She did, but ended up running away from him. Unable to find her, he reportedly questioned her relatives - Lamu's sister, who refused to reveal her whereabouts, was also beaten by Tang. Family members said this incident was reported to the police who, according to them, took no action. She eventually divorced him again and he gained custody of both children. Police said Tang was detained on 14 September on suspicion of ""intentional homicide"". A team is continuing to investigate,the statement said,external. The case has prompted discussion onChina's social media site Weibo,external. More than 70 million people have used a hashtag mentioning her death. One user said she hopes ""women are given more security"". Another attacked police officials saying: ""Where were you when a report was made? Why didn't you care?"" Chinese city lets people see partner's abuse history Vlogger reignites Chinese domestic violence debate This is not the first time a victim of domestic violence has met with difficulty in China's legal system. Earlier this year, a Chinese woman was beaten by her husband so brutally that she jumped from a window to escape. She later attempted to divorce him, providing CCTV footage of the event as proof. The court refused to grant the divorce. She later uploaded the video on to social media where thousands rushed to her defence - the court later granted her divorce. Earlier this year, China introduced a new 30-day ""cool-off"" period before couples are granted a divorce, to allow both parties time to rethink their decision. But this has sparked some concern that victims of domestic abuse could be coerced during that period to reconsider. The law, which will come into effect in 2021, is not applicable to families with a history of domestic violence, though rights groups say many cases are not reported to police.

In a tweet announcing his imminent departure from hospital,external, President Trump played down the threat of Covid-19, as he has done throughout the pandemic. âDonât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life,â he wrote after receiving four days of round-the-clock medical care for the virus. However 209,000 Americans have died of the virus so far. Covid-19 treatments are improving and becoming more readily available, but the risk of death remains, especially in the US, where measures to contain the virus have been patchy. Since the beginning of April, there have been hundreds - sometimes thousands - of daily coronavirus deaths in the US,World Health Organization figures show,external. At 64.10 per 100,000 people, the Covid-19 death rate in the US is the 10th-highest in the world,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. Nancy Pelosi has been a vocal critic of the president's handling of the pandemic We have just heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected Democrat. She told MSNBC: ""[Trump] should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he's had such good policies. Because in fact, he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country."" Hours earlier, the president tweeted he would be discharged from hospital, saying: ""Donât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge."" Pelosi also said the White House's testing protocol for Covid-19 ""apparently...doesn't work"". Since President Trumpâs Covid-19 diagnosis, his personal physician Dr Conley has been thrust into the spotlight. Conley has given daily briefings since on the president's condition since Saturday. But what do we know about the White House physician? The 40-year-old has been in the position since March 2018. Like most medical staff at the White House, Conley is a military officer. Conley is from Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2002 before studying at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He received his degree in 2006. After further courses, Conley served with a Nato medical unit in Afghanistan. He received a Romanian Emblem of Honour for saving a Romanian soldier wounded by a homemade explosive device. The US Navy officer was later assigned to the White House Medical Unit. He then became Trump's acting personal doctor when the president nominated his then-physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, to head the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Read more about Conley here Cohen testified to Congress in 2019 Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has sharply criticised his ex-boss for visiting supporters during his hospital stay while being treated for coronavirus. ""Heâs potentially infecting these people. And he doesnât care, because again, Donald Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Cohen tells BBC World, adding that the Secret Service agents who rode in the heavily fortified car with him are now at higher risk of infection. ""They vow to take a bullet for him, as I once did,"" Cohen says, referring to probably his most famous quote from back when he was still a Trump loyalist. ""I would have taken a bullet for him but not if heâs the one pulling the trigger,"" he added. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and I do not understand what the man was thinking... But Donald Trump is an uncaged animal. ""He thinks he's completely autonomous. Heâs not going to answer to anyone."" The debate will take place in Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday On Wednesday night, Republican Vice-President Mike Pence will face Democratic Senator Kamala Harris for the only vice-presidential debate ahead of November's election. This election cycle has seen increased scrutiny on Pence and Harris, as they support the campaign of two presidential candidates in their 70s. With President Trump now receiving treatment for Covid-19, and more members of the White House announcing positive virus tests, thereâs a new emphasis on precautions from event organisers. For one, the vice-presidential candidates will stand more than 3m (9.8ft) apart (podiums at the first Trump-Biden debate last week were 2m apart). They will be separated by plexiglass, CNN reports. Covid testing is already under way for reporters and others planning on attending the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Whether everyone will be required to wear a mask this time remains to be seen. Now, we want to know:What questions do you have about the vice-presidential debate?You tell us hereand weâll get to work finding the answers. This video can not be played Trump's health team at Walter Reed say he is ready to leave White House physician Sean Conley said the president's health team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his recovery. Less than an hour before Monday's briefing by doctors, Trump tweeted that he planned to leave hospital before the end of the day. White House physician Sean Conley said the team was 'cautiously optimistic' about the president's recovery. A little bit more now on what Dr Conley said at the briefing. He said Trump was a ""phenomenal patient"" during his four-day stay at the Walter Reed military hospital. ""He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond
safe and reasonable practice,"" he said. When commenting on the president's recent video and tweets, he said: ""He's back!"" But Dr Conley did not answer questions about the findings of scans of the president's lungs, which can be affected by the virus, citing rules and regulations about the sharing of information. He also said there was no evidence of ""live virus still present"" that Trump could transmit to others. Dr Conley said Trump âcontinued to improveâ After four days in hospital, President Trump has been cleared to return to the White House, with his physician deeming it âsafeâ to discharge him.

Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump is going âhomeâ. Of course, in this case, home is a secure government compound with
top-notch medical facilities. Still, the decision that the president can return to
the White House is being hailed by him and his medical team as an important
indication of his improving condition. âHeâs back,â White House physician Sean Conley said during his Monday
afternoon briefing. Conley and his fellow physicians shared positive details about the
presidentâs condition - a lack of fever, good blood-oxygen levels and âno
respiratory complaintsâ. But he once again refused to disclose when the
president last tested negative for the coronavirus â information that would
help determine if Trump exposed anyone else to the virus. And when
pressed for more details on the presidentâs condition, such as evidence of
longer-term damage to the his lungs, Conley cited patient privacy. This patient is the president of the United States, however, and
Americans may demand more details about his long-term health and prognosis,
particularly as they head to the polls in a month to decide whether to give him
another four-year term in office. Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact tracing. We have had a closer look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"".

James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Since testing positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump has been receiving a number of different drugs, as revealed by his doctors. It is unclear when the president contracted the virus, but there are two broad phases of a coronavirus infection - the first where the virus is the problem and the second, deadly phase, when our immune system goes into overdrive and starts causing massive collateral damage to other organs. Treatments fall into two camps - those that directly attack the virus and are more likely to be useful in the first phase and drugs to calm the immune system which are more likely to work in the second. So what drugs are being used and what do they tell us about his condition? Read more about his treatment here. The doctors' briefing has now ended, with the president saying he expects to leave hospital at 18:30 Eastern time (22:30 GMT).

"Delayed repairs to the Palace of Westminster cost taxpayers Â£2m a week, a government spending watchdog says. Politicians had been scheduled to leave the building for at least six years while building work is completed at an estimated cost of Â£4bn. But in May the body overseeing the work said the move should be reviewed due to the financial pressures of coronavirus. The Public Accounts Committee said the ""few decisions"" that have been taken so far did not need reviewing. Will Â£4bn Parliament refit be scrapped? Review of plans to restore Parliament How stand-in Commons chamber will look The committee's Labour chair Meg Hillier also warned that ""excessive political interference"" in the process ""may muddy the waters"" and make delivery of the project more difficult. Earlier this year, the prime minister suggested the House of Lords could be moved to York on a permanent basis. This ideawas later rejected.but the government said it would continue to push for a move out of London, even though the final decision will be down to MPs and peers. Ms Hillier said: ""Parliament is literally falling apart around the thousands of people who work there and the million or so who, in better times, visit every year. It poses a very real risk to health and safety in its current state,"" ""After nearly 20 years of discussion and costs to the taxpayer of just maintaining Parliament now rising by Â£2m a week, what we don't need is for the authorities to keep reopening and reviewing what few decisions have been taken. ""The cost of the project will be high but doing nothing is not an option and is certainly not a cost-free option - without action we are just ratcheting up the bill to the taxpayer."" The Labour MP also suggested the coronavirus pandemic meant Parliament was quieter than usual, providing an opportunity for building work to go ahead. ""It's time for those responsible to get creative and get to work,"" she said. Responding to the committee's report Sarah Johnson, CEO of the Houses of Parliament Restoration and Renewal Sponsor Body, said the review was aimed at securing value for money and providing ""certainty about the way forward"". ""The work to save our Parliament buildings for the nation is essential and urgent, and the Palace of Westminster continues to be at a high risk of catastrophic damage, be that a major fire, flood or falling masonry,"" she added. Computer-generated image of proposed new Commons chamber The Palace of Westminster, which houses the Houses of Commons and Lords, has long been in need of repair and in 2018 MPs voted for refurbishment work to go ahead. Under current plans, parliamentarians will move into temporary accommodation while the major repairs are carried out. However, the Sponsor Body - a panel of politicians and building experts set up to oversee restoration - said it would review the project, looking at ways of cutting costs, including alternatives to decanting Parliament to a different building. Renovation could happen around politicians as they continue working in the building, although the process could take longer and cost more. In its report, the Public Accounts Committee warned that ""excessive political interference may muddy the waters of the Sponsor Body's work and has the potential to make delivery of the programme more difficult"". It advised the body to publish details of ""what it considers are the main risks to building political consensus"" and how it plans to mitigate those risks. And it suggested the Sponsor Body launch an ""engagement strategy"" to ensure the public can feed into decisions. Will Â£4bn Parliament refit be scrapped?

"US President Donald Trump is discharged from the Walter Reed medical centre following three days of Covid treatment His doctors say he is safe to return to the White House but ""may not be entirely out of the woods yet"" In a tweet, he said we was feeling ""really good"", and added: ""Don't be afraid of Covid"" Questions remain about the seriousness of the president's illness after conflicting statements In the UK, a technical glitch which meant nearly 16,000 cases went unreported has caused delays to its track and trace system UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will ""always balance the books"" as coronavirus costs rise All bars in the French capital Paris will shut from Tuesday as the city's coronavirus alert is raised to maximum More than 35.1 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed globally, with over one million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Henri Astier and Lauren Turner Marine One delivers US President Donald Trump to the White House We're pausing our live coverage for now. We'll be back in a few hours with more updates from the UK and around the world. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the key moments from the day's swift-moving events:  We will continue to update our main story aboutPresident Trump's health and treatment here. And you can findmore of our coronavirus coverage here. Thanks for reading. President Trump raised a fist as left the military hospital, before walking to his vehicle and giving a thumbs-up. He was then driven to the Marine One helicopter to be transported to the White House. US President Donald Trump has left Walter Reed hospital, where he has been treated for Covid-19 over the last three days. He is now on his way back to the White House to continue his treatment there. Biden has called on Trump to ""support masks"" Now some reaction to President Trumpâs condition from Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger in Novemberâs presidential election. Biden has shown restraint since Trumpâs diagnosis, toning down his political rhetoric and suspending adverts attacking the president. But tonight, Biden struck a more combative tone, signalling a change in the dynamic of the election campaign. ""I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,â Biden said at a rally in Little Havana in Miami on Monday. âNow that he's busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.â President Trump has eschewed face masks in the past and mocked Biden for wearing one in the first presidential debate. With Trump getting ready to leave Walter Reed Medical Center tonight, his daughter Ivanka has tweeted her thanks to the hospital's staff. Trump tweeted earlier that he would be discharged from hospital at about 18:30 local time - 23:30 BST. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a tweet announcing his imminent departure from hospital,external, President Trump played down the threat of Covid-19, as he has done throughout the pandemic. âDonât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life,â he wrote after receiving four days of round-the-clock medical care for the virus. However 209,000 Americans have died of the virus so far. Covid-19 treatments are improving and becoming more readily available, but the risk of death remains, especially in the US, where measures to contain the virus have been patchy. Since the beginning of April, there have been hundreds - sometimes thousands - of daily coronavirus deaths in the US,World Health Organization figures show,external. At 64.10 per 100,000 people, the Covid-19 death rate in the US is the 10th-highest in the world,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. Nancy Pelosi has been a vocal critic of the president's handling of the pandemic We have just heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected Democrat. She told MSNBC: ""[Trump] should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he's had such good policies. Because in fact, he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country."" Hours earlier, the president tweeted he would be discharged from hospital, saying: ""Donât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge."" Pelosi also said the White House's testing protocol for Covid-19 ""apparently...doesn't work"". Since President Trumpâs Covid-19 diagnosis, his personal physician Dr Conley has been thrust into the spotlight. Conley has given daily briefings since on the president's condition since Saturday. But what do we know about the White House physician? The 40-year-old has been in the position since March 2018. Like most medical staff at the White House, Conley is a military officer. Conley is from Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2002 before studying at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He received his degree in 2006. After further courses, Conley served with a Nato medical unit in Afghanistan. He received a Romanian Emblem of Honour for saving a Romanian soldier wounded by a homemade explosive device. The US Navy officer was later assigned to the White House Medical Unit. He then became Trump's acting personal doctor when the president nominated his then-physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, to head the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Read more about Conley here Cohen testified to Congress in 2019 Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has sharply criticised his ex-boss for visiting supporters during his hospital stay while being treated for coronavirus. ""Heâs potentially infecting these people. And he doesnât care, because again, Donald Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Cohen tells BBC World, adding that the Secret Service agents who rode in the heavily fortified car with him are now at higher risk of infection. ""They vow to take a bullet for him, as I once did,"" Cohen says, referring to probably his most famous quote from back when he was still a Trump loyalist. ""I would have taken a bullet for him but not if heâs the one pulling the trigger,"" he added. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and I do not understand what the man was thinking... But Donald Trump is an uncaged animal. ""He thinks he's completely autonomous. Heâs not going to answer to anyone."" The debate will take place in Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday On Wednesday night, Republican Vice-President Mike Pence will face Democratic Senator Kamala Harris for the only vice-presidential debate ahead of November's election. This election cycle has seen increased scrutiny on Pence and Harris, as they support the campaign of two presidential candidates in their 70s. With President Trump now receiving treatment for Covid-19, and more members of the White House announcing positive virus tests, thereâs a new emphasis on precautions from event organisers. For one, the vice-presidential candidates will stand more than 3m (9.8ft) apart (podiums at the first Trump-Biden debate last week were 2m apart). They will be separated by plexiglass, CNN reports. Covid testing is already under way for reporters and others planning on attending the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Whether everyone will be required to wear a mask this time remains to be seen. Now, we want to know:What questions do you have about the vice-presidential debate?You tell us hereand weâll get to work finding the answers. This video can not be played Trump's health team at Walter Reed say he is ready to leave White House physician Sean Conley said the president's health team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his recovery. Less than an hour before Monday's briefing by doctors, Trump tweeted that he planned to leave hospital before the end of the day. White House physician Sean Conley said the team was 'cautiously optimistic' about the president's recovery. A little bit more now on what Dr Conley said at the briefing. He said Trump was a ""phenomenal patient"" during his four-day stay at the Walter Reed military hospital. ""He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond
safe and reasonable practice,"" he said. When commenting on the president's recent video and tweets, he said: ""He's back!"" But Dr Conley did not answer questions about the findings of scans of the president's lungs, which can be affected by the virus, citing rules and regulations about the sharing of information. He also said there was no evidence of ""live virus still present"" that Trump could transmit to others. Dr Conley said Trump âcontinued to improveâ After four days in hospital, President Trump has been cleared to return to the White House, with his physician deeming it âsafeâ to discharge him. Hereâs a timeline of some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Read more:Who Trump met and who's tested positive Here's a recap of what the doctors treating the president said at their briefing moments ago: Trump's campaign ran a series of attack ads against his Democratic rival Joe Biden on Monday. This is despite the fact that the Biden team removed attack ads after Trump went into hospital last week. The move puts the Democrats in a difficult position. The Biden campaign press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"". Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump is going âhomeâ. Of course, in this case, home is a secure government compound with
top-notch medical facilities. Still, the decision that the president can return to
the White House is being hailed by him and his medical team as an important
indication of his improving condition. âHeâs back,â White House physician Sean Conley said during his Monday
afternoon briefing. Conley and his fellow physicians shared positive details about the
presidentâs condition - a lack of fever, good blood-oxygen levels and âno
respiratory complaintsâ. But he once again refused to disclose when the
president last tested negative for the coronavirus â information that would
help determine if Trump exposed anyone else to the virus. And when
pressed for more details on the presidentâs condition, such as evidence of
longer-term damage to the his lungs, Conley cited patient privacy. This patient is the president of the United States, however, and
Americans may demand more details about his long-term health and prognosis,
particularly as they head to the polls in a month to decide whether to give him
another four-year term in office. Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact tracing. We have had a closer look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"".   President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn on 26 September Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Since testing positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump has been receiving a number of different drugs, as revealed by his doctors. It is unclear when the president contracted the virus, but there are two broad phases of a coronavirus infection - the first where the virus is the problem and the second, deadly phase, when our immune system goes into overdrive and starts causing massive collateral damage to other organs. Treatments fall into two camps - those that directly attack the virus and are more likely to be useful in the first phase and drugs to calm the immune system which are more likely to work in the second. So what drugs are being used and what do they tell us about his condition? Read more about his treatment here. The doctors' briefing has now ended, with the president saying he expects to leave hospital at 18:30 Eastern time (22:30 GMT). Stay with us as we bring you more details about what the doctors said and analysis. Dr Conley has also revealed that the president was given extra oxygen twice after experiencing a drop in oxygen levels. On Sunday, the doctor had confirmed that the president had been given supplemental oxygen on Friday at the White House, hours before he was flown to the hospital. But he did not say whether the president had been given oxygen after his levels dropped again on Saturday. The doctor also said that the president appeared to be a little dehydrated on Friday, when he had a high fever. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Peter Webster is honoured by other players at a match earlier this year A British football fanatic will retire from the game on Friday, playing his last competitive match at the age of 80. Peter Webster, who lives in Wollongong, Australia, said he had known for a while that he did not contribute to matches as much as he once did. ""It has been on the cards for quite a few years,"" he told the BBC. ""You get more and more game when you think, 'I'm wasting the shirt out there'. You know yourself."" Mr Webster was born in Preston, England, but moved to Wales in 1948. He only started playing the game competitively at 15, having gone to a school where rugby dominated. 'I'm 72. My age is my biggest asset' The former steelworker played for many teams in Welsh leagues in his 20s and 30s, before moving to Australia with his wife Moira and three children in 1981. Mr Webster said he had been surprised to find football was so advanced in Australia, and that he ""would rather play in 38 degrees Celsius than 38 degrees Fahrenheit"". As well as playing his last match for Wollongong's Figtree Football Cub, Mr Webster was also retiring as the club's groundsman. Mr Webster has shared his love of football with his grandchildren He planned to arrive early for Friday night's game against Russell Vale, the league leaders, so he could help put up the goal nets. He would also have a word with the opposition to make sure they did not take it easy on him, he added. ""In my first few years when you're playing, you wake up on Sunday all bruised and it's gone by Monday. Now it's Monday before I feel the bruises and it's the following Saturday until they're gone."" Mr Webster is such a legend in the local game that there is even a competition named after him - the Peter Webster Cup. Football fan Finley's Fifa 20 joy spreads online What was the first Fifa like? ""Usually you've got to pay for it, or be dead. But I'm not paying for it and I'm not dead so I thought I'll see if I can play in it,"" he said. The secret to his longevity had been keeping up with playing, he said. While he used to run and cycle, most of his exercise these days came from walking his granddaughter's dog. ""I'm not a good runner. I've bumped into players from other teams and they say: 'This is the third time we've seen you running this week - you must enjoy running. But I say, 'no - I enjoy playing football.'"" Mr Webster is to become a more regular fixture on the sidelines Mr Webster said he was not sure how he would feel after his final match, but he hoped to continue having a kick-about with players at the club. He also intended to watch more of his grandson and granddaughter play football - he had often missed games previously because he was playing himself. His wife said she was looking forward to her husband doing more jobs around the house. Figtree Football Cub president Mike Dodd said Mr Webster's contribution had been ""immense"".

"Delayed repairs to the Palace of Westminster cost taxpayers Â£2m a week, a government spending watchdog says. Politicians had been scheduled to leave the building for at least six years while building work is completed at an estimated cost of Â£4bn. But in May the body overseeing the work said the move should be reviewed due to the financial pressures of coronavirus. The Public Accounts Committee said the ""few decisions"" that have been taken so far did not need reviewing. Will Â£4bn Parliament refit be scrapped? Review of plans to restore Parliament How stand-in Commons chamber will look The committee's Labour chair Meg Hillier also warned that ""excessive political interference"" in the process ""may muddy the waters"" and make delivery of the project more difficult. Earlier this year, the prime minister suggested the House of Lords could be moved to York on a permanent basis. This ideawas later rejected.but the government said it would continue to push for a move out of London, even though the final decision will be down to MPs and peers. Ms Hillier said: ""Parliament is literally falling apart around the thousands of people who work there and the million or so who, in better times, visit every year. It poses a very real risk to health and safety in its current state,"" ""After nearly 20 years of discussion and costs to the taxpayer of just maintaining Parliament now rising by Â£2m a week, what we don't need is for the authorities to keep reopening and reviewing what few decisions have been taken. ""The cost of the project will be high but doing nothing is not an option and is certainly not a cost-free option - without action we are just ratcheting up the bill to the taxpayer."" The Labour MP also suggested the coronavirus pandemic meant Parliament was quieter than usual, providing an opportunity for building work to go ahead. ""It's time for those responsible to get creative and get to work,"" she said. Responding to the committee's report Sarah Johnson, CEO of the Houses of Parliament Restoration and Renewal Sponsor Body, said the review was aimed at securing value for money and providing ""certainty about the way forward"". ""The work to save our Parliament buildings for the nation is essential and urgent, and the Palace of Westminster continues to be at a high risk of catastrophic damage, be that a major fire, flood or falling masonry,"" she added. Computer-generated image of proposed new Commons chamber The Palace of Westminster, which houses the Houses of Commons and Lords, has long been in need of repair and in 2018 MPs voted for refurbishment work to go ahead. Under current plans, parliamentarians will move into temporary accommodation while the major repairs are carried out. However, the Sponsor Body - a panel of politicians and building experts set up to oversee restoration - said it would review the project, looking at ways of cutting costs, including alternatives to decanting Parliament to a different building. Renovation could happen around politicians as they continue working in the building, although the process could take longer and cost more. In its report, the Public Accounts Committee warned that ""excessive political interference may muddy the waters of the Sponsor Body's work and has the potential to make delivery of the programme more difficult"". It advised the body to publish details of ""what it considers are the main risks to building political consensus"" and how it plans to mitigate those risks. And it suggested the Sponsor Body launch an ""engagement strategy"" to ensure the public can feed into decisions. Will Â£4bn Parliament refit be scrapped?

"The president says: ""We will get through this together"" US President Donald Trump has said he and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for coronavirus and are now self-isolating. Mr Trump, aged 74 and therefore in a high-risk group, wrote on Twitter: ""We will get through this together."" The president has ""mild symptoms"" of coronavirus, White House officials say. Mr Trump's announcement comes just over a month before the presidential elections on 3 November, where he faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden. The development comes after Hope Hicks, one of Mr Trump's closest aides, tested positive. Latest updates Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? How will this affect US election?

It is not clear whether Mr Biden is also being tested, and whether he will continue his campaign on Friday with a scheduled visit to Michigan. He stood approximately 10ft (3m) away from Mr Trump during the debate. Debate moderator Chris Wallace said on Friday he was getting tested. A person is required to self-isolate after either showing coronavirus symptoms or a positive test. Meanwhile, quarantine restricts the movements of those who have been in contact with an infected person, but are not themselves positive or symptomatic. Mr Trump has mostly spurned mask-wearing and has often been pictured not socially distanced with aides or others during official engagements. The coronavirus has infected more than 7.2 million Americans, killing more than 200,000 of them. Mr Trump's physician, Dr Sean Conley, released a statement late on Thursday,,externalsaying the president and the first lady were ""both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence"". ""Rest assured I expect the president to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering, and I will keep you updated on any future developments,"" the statement said. The physician provided no further details. However, White House officials and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin later said Mr Trump was experiencing mild Covid-19 symptoms. According to Mr Trump's most recent physical examination earlier this year, he weighed 244lbs (110.7kg). This is considered to be obese for his height of 6ft 3ins. But Dr Conley stated at the time that the president ""remains healthy"". Mr Trump will also have the best medical care available. America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says a person must self-isolate for 10 days after a positive test. What is the risk to men over 50? US shares set to drop after Trump tests positive Trump has Covid: How the world's media responded It is dangerous to speculate about how the virus will affect any individual person. There are clear risk factors - the older you are, the greater the risk of a coronavirus infection becoming life-threatening. People aged 64-74 with Covid in the US are five times more likely to need hospital care,externaland 90 times more likely to die than somebody in their 20s. The CDC says eight out of 10 Covid deaths in the country have been in the over-65s. The virus also seems to hit men and people who are overweight harder. But that is the big picture - a pattern seen across the whole population - it is not a way of saying this is what will happen to the US president. The health of any two 74-year-olds can be wildly different and other medical conditions massively alter how big a threat this virus poses. Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? Earlier on Thursday, Mr Trump said he and his wife, who is 50, were going to self-isolate after Ms Hicks's positive test. Hope Hicks has been at Mr Trump's side for years He tweeted: ""Hope Hicks, who has been working so hard without even taking a small break, has just tested positive for Covid 19. Terrible! ""The First Lady and I are waiting for our test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!"" According to Bloomberg News, Ms Hicks is experiencing symptoms of the disease. Who is Hope Hicks? It is not clear how Mr Trump's positive test will affect arrangements for the second presidential debate, which is scheduled for 15 October in Miami, Florida. Mr Trump is not the first world leader to have tested positive. Earlier this year, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro were infected. They both have since recovered, although Mr Johnson had to receive regular oxygen treatment to help his breathing during hospitalisation. A week after Donald Trump told Americans not to worry about Covid-19 because ""it affects virtually nobody"" except the elderly and those with heart conditions, the president himself has tested positive for the virus. It is difficult to overstate exactly how earth-shaking a development this is, just 32 days before the US elections. The president will have to quarantine for treatment. Campaign rallies are off. The next presidential debate, in two weeks, is in question. The recurring message from the president, that the nation is ""rounding the turn"" in its handling of the virus, has been undermined by his own illness. Just two days ago, during the first debate, Trump belittled his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, for frequently wearing masks and not having campaign rallies that matched his own in size. Now, the White House and the campaign will have to answer why the president took such a seemingly cavalier attitude toward protecting himself - and how many others in the White House and the higher echelons of the US government may have been exposed. During times of national turmoil, the American public tends to rally in support of the president. It may not be enough to insulate him from the questions that follow, however. Vice-President Mike Pence and his wife were tested on Friday morning, and the results were negative,Mr Pence's press secretary Devin O'Malley tweeted.,external Later on Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who would in theory take charge of government if both the president and vice-president were incapacitated, said she had been tested on Friday morning and had not yet received the results. Ms Pelosi, a Democrat, said ""continuity plans were in place"", but she herself had not been contacted by the White House about this. Other members of the Trump family - his daughter Ivanka, son Barron and son-in-law Jared Kushner - have all tested negative. Several White House officials have been infected previously. In May,vice-presidential spokeswoman Katie Miller tested positive, as well as a member of the US Navy who was serving as one of Mr Trump's personal valets. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, a number of Secret Service agents, a Marine One pilot and a White House cafeteria worker have also tested positive.
