"US President-elect Joe Biden has said he will ask Americans to wear masks for his first 100 days in office to curtail the spread of coronavirus. He told CNN he believed there would be a ""significant reduction"" in Covid-19 cases if every American wore a face covering. Mr Biden also said he would order masks to be worn in all government buildings. The US has recorded 14.1 million cases and 276,000 deaths from Covid-19 - the highest of any country in the world. Mr Biden is preparing to take office as pharmaceutical giants are poised to ship millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines to the American public. The UK on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine. In his first joint interview with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris since the election, Mr Biden said,external: ""The first day I'm inaugurated to say I'm going to ask the public for 100 days to mask. Just 100 days to mask, not forever. One hundred days. ""And I think we'll see a significant reduction if we occur that, if that occurs with vaccinations and masking to drive down the numbers considerably.""Â The first 100 days of a new presidency is symbolically important in the US and is seen as a gauge of how a president will get things done. 'Coronavirus ended our marriage' Dr Fauci apologises for saying UK 'rushed' vaccine US ex-presidents pledge to get vaccinated on film Constitutional experts say a US president has no legal authority to order Americans to wear masks, but Mr Biden said during the interview he and his Vice-President Kamala Harris would set an example by donning face coverings. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading The president's executive authority does cover US government property, and Mr Biden told CNN he intended to exercise such power. ""I'm going to issue a standing order that in federal buildings you have to be masked."" He added: ""Transportation, interstate transportation, you must be masked, airplanes and buses, et cetera."" US airlines, airports and most public transit systems already require all passengers and workers to wear face coverings. The Trump White House has rejected calls from American health experts to mandate masks in transportation as ""overly restrictive"". Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? A user's guide to wearing a face mask to the shops Is the Covid vaccine safe? No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunked Did Brexit speed up the UK's vaccine approval? The Democratic president-elect said he would be ""happy"" to take a vaccine in public to allay any concerns about its safety. Three former presidents - Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton - have said they are also prepared to be inoculated publicly to show that it is safe. ""People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work,"" Mr Biden said, adding that ""it matters what a president and the vice-president do."" This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Mr Biden's Vice-President-elect Harris, who joined him at the CNN interview, received some criticism from Republicans in September after she said she would not trust Mr Trump's word on a potential vaccine and the assessment of public health experts would be ""suppressed"" under his administration. The Pew Research Center says just 60% of Americans are currently prepared to take a coronavirus vaccine, up from 51% who said the same in September. Pfizer, which says its vaccine is 95% effective in clinical trials, and Moderna, which says its jab is 94% effective, have both applied to the Food and Drug Administration to distribute their drugs in the US. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? In the CNN interview, Mr Biden said he would retain Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, as chief medical adviser to the new administration's Covid-19 team. ""When Dr Fauci says we have a vaccine that is safe, that's the moment in which I will stand before the public and say that,"" Mr Biden said. Earlier on Thursday, Dr Fauci apologised in an interview with the BBC for critical remarks he made about the UK's vaccine approval process. ""I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way,"" he said. A day earlier, Dr Fauci told US networks that UK regulators had ""rushed"" the vaccine approval. This video can not be played Dr Fauci told the BBC: ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint"" The incoming president also mentioned Dr Fauci's stance that ""you don't have to close down the economy"" if Americans follow other safety measures to stop the spread of the virus. He spoke as California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order for much of his state. On Wednesday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an order restricting allÂ public travel on foot or vehicle, adding: ""It's time to cancel everything.""

"Irish airline Ryanair has placed an order for 75 more Boeing 737 Max aircraft as the plane is set to return to the skies after two fatal crashes. Ryanair had already agreed to buy 135 jets. The extra planes take the list value of the order to $22bn (Â£16.3bn). The US Federal Aviation Administrationrecently certified the Boeing 737 Max for a return to serviceafter it had been grounded since March 2019. Ryanair said it would take delivery of the planes early next year. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is yet to give the Boeing 737 Max the go-ahead to return to service. EASA is in charge of re-certification for EU member states, as well as the UK. If Boeing wanted to appoint a new chief salesman, it should just call in Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary. The 737 Max, he said, was a wonderful aircraft. A game-changer. More efficient than older planes. More environmentally friendly. Passengers would love it. Except he didn't call it the 737 Max. He repeatedly referred to the ""737 8200"". A sly rebranding exercise? Not according to Mr O'Leary. The plane was brilliant, and whatever you called it, passengers would want to fly on it. Boeing's more world-weary Dave Calhoun also insisted there was no rebranding going on. And yet... his company was once heartily proud of the Max, and liked to flaunt the new name at every opportunity. Today, he was eager to downplay it as just another run-of-the-mill member of the 737 family. Boeing was forced to take the 737 Max out of service following two crashes within five months of each other, which together killed 346 people. Its clearance to fly again comes after Boeing implemented a series of modifications including updating flight control software, revising crew procedures and rerouting internal wiring. At a news conference in Washington to announce the deal, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary described the 737 Max as ""a fabulous aircraft"". Boeing's chief executive, David Calhoun, said it was ""the beginning of the fulfilment of a more robust order book"". Neither side disclosed the exact price that Ryanair will pay for the planes, but the airline will benefit from what the firms described as a ""modest"" discount on the cost. Mr Calhoun said Boeing did not expect to have to slash prices to bring back customers. ""We believe strongly in the recovery and therefore we will stay patient,"" Mr Calhoun said. ""We don't feel a need to discount our way into the marketplace."" Mick Ryan, a married father of two, died when a Boeing 737 Max crashed in Ethiopia last year News of the deal was greeted with dismay by Naoise Ryan, of Cork in Ireland, whose husband Mick Ryan died when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 - a 737 Max - crashed in March 2019. ""Ryanair's purchase of the Max is an endorsement of Boeing's disregard of safety and human life. Like Boeing, they are prepared to gamble with people's lives in order to sell cheap flights on 'bargain-binned' planes,"" she said. ""It is horrific that Boeing can once again profit from this dangerous plane while still hiding documents and have not been held to account for the deaths of 346 people. Boeing's attitude and dismissiveness should give everyone pause before ever boarding a Max."" Boeing's 737 Max wins approval to fly in the US At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played The new rules are ""confusing"" says Veronica Gay People will be able to travel from Wales to tier one and two areas in England and Scotland from Friday. The new regulations prohibit travel into tier three zones in England, tiers three and four in Scotland and the whole of Northern Ireland. Previously people couldonly travel out of Wales if it was ""essential"". But the Welsh Government said it still strongly advised people against travelling to other parts of the UK to help control the spread of the virus. The new rules - which includes Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafesbanning serving alcoholand shutting daily at 18:00 GMT - will come into force at 18:00 on Friday. Q&A: Can people from Wales go to England to drink? Here's how to find out which tier an area of England is in England's lockdown ended on 2 December and it now has athree-tiered system. The Scottish government has afive-level alert systemof Covid-19 restrictions. It means for people in Wales, travel to London will be possible, but not Birmingham or Bristol. Large parts of the Midlands, North East and North West, including Manchester, as well as Kent,are in tier three. A majority of England is in the second highest level - tier two - including London and Liverpool city region. Wales has different coronavirus rules to England The new regulations were announced after the cabinet met on Wednesday to decide on the latest travel restrictions as England's lockdown came to an end. The rules will be reviewed on 17 December. Mandy Symonds has owned The Boat Inn in the border town of Chepstow in Monmouthshire for 18 months. She said she was ""gutted""  when she realised the new regulations meant her customers could go into England - ""a 20 second walk away"" - to drink alcohol in a pub when she could not serve them any. ""I'm closingâ¦ everything's stacked against you,"" she said. The owner of The Boat Inn in Chepstow says she feels like everything is stacked against Wales' pubs ""It's a mockery. I feel like he [First Minister Mark Drakeford] is deliberately trying to drive us out of business. ""The rules should be the same all over the countryâ¦ ""I've spent so much money here, invested in a marquee and put heating in there, lost half our tables, put screens up, staff are wearing masks, there's track and traceâ¦ I feel beaten down over it all now."" She said she did not know when she would reopen but it would depend on restrictions. Clare Davenport says the lifting of the travel rules will make little difference to her Boundary Lane in Saltney is the border between Wales and England. Claire Davenport lives in Flintshire but works on the English side of the border. She said the lifting of travel restrictions would not affect her too much. ""My family tend to keep within Wales and don't go into England really because we've got Broughton shopping park. But it was hectic there on Monday with people from England coming in,"" she said. Veronica Gay says the rules have been confusing for people on the border Veronica Gay, who represents Saltney on Flintshire council, said: ""My heart goes out to people who live on the border because you have a routine and you don't even think about it. ""You don't think 'now I'm in England' or 'now I'm in Wales'. It's been so confusing. ""But the people on Boundary Lane on the Welsh side haven't been able to go to Asda just across the road on the England side."" Conservative member of the Senedd (MS) Darren Millar said: ""While any lifting of travel restrictions between Wales and England is to be welcomed, there can be no doubt that this news will rub salt in the wounds of the Welsh hospitality industry. How many people can get together at Christmas? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales ""With Welsh pubs, cafes and restaurants being banned from selling alcohol on their premises from 6pm tomorrow, many of their customers will be taking their custom and cash across the border to enjoy a tipple with a meal in England instead."" He urged the Welsh Government to ""rethink its new rules"" and ""engage with leaders the hospitality industry"". Part of Broadstone Park campsite is in Gloucestershire, England, and half in Monmouthshire, Wales Jeff Revill owns the Broadstone Park campsite, half of which is in Gloucestershire, England, and half in Monmouthshire, Wales. He has faced issues such as guests on the English side of the site being unable to use the only shower block which is in Wales - after looking into it he was told it was an essential journey. He said the new regulations made things easier for the business: ""I can bounce between the two borders nowâ¦ it means we can get our glamping pods open again and there would be no issue [in people staying at the site] popping to Monmouth and back. ""It will be back to business as usualâ¦ hopefully we can pick up a little bit of business now heading into the spring."" The easing of restrictions comes ahead of additional rules for Christmas, whenthree households from around the UKwill be able to meet from 23 December until at least 27 December. The new regulations mean Frank and Margaret Clarke, who live in Mold, Flintshire, are able to travel to Churton in Cheshire - which is in tier two - where their son and his family live. But they said they were unsure what the new rules meant for seeing their grandchildren, aged six, four and six months. Frank and Margaret Clarke moved from Norfolk to Mold in Flintshire to be closer to their son who lives in Churton, Cheshire ""We have been on WhatsApp and FaceTime... our daughter in law had a baby but we haven't been able to go over and help,"" said Mr Clarke. ""It's been a difficult time for us - we can go and see them but we can't go inside and we're not sure if they can come into our house. ""We are trying to be sensible because of our age."" Geoffrey Shone, 65, from Rossett in Wrexham, said he found the rules too difficult to understand. ""I don't understand half the rules properly. It's the way they are put,"" he said. He said he did not know if the rules meant he could see his cousins over the border in Dodleston, Cheshire - that area is in tier two so under the new rules he could travel there. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""There will be no restrictions on travel within Wales but we need to have some restrictions on travel across the border to those parts of the UK where infection rates are high to prevent the spread of coronavirus."" He advised people in Wales not to travel into parts of England and Scotland where the infection rate is lower, ""to help prevent them taking coronavirus with them"". ""Coronavirus doesn't respect borders,"" he said. ""We all have a part to play in keeping Wales and the UK safe. ""Please think carefully about where you are going and what you are doing. This virus thrives wherever we come together with others."" The Welsh Government said the travel restrictions were likely to remain in place until at least January but will be kept under constant review. International travel restrictions will continue and are also likely to remain in place until at least January but will be kept under constant review, it added.

"This video can not be played Ch Insp Mark Runacres of Avon and Somerset Police: ""Sadly... there have been four fatalities"" Four people have died and another has been injured in a large explosion at a waste water treatment works. Firefighters were called to Wessex Water's premises in Avonmouth, Bristol, at about 11:20 GMT. Three of the people who died worked for the firm, and the other was a contractor. The injured person's condition is not life-threatening. The blast happened in a silo containing treated biosolids and was not terror related, police said. A witness reported hearing a ""very loud explosion"" that ""shook buildings"", and another said they saw about 10 ambulances driving to the scene. Police declared a major incident and are investigating the circumstances of the blast. This video can not be played Avonmouth explosion eyewitness describes the search for missing people Ch Insp Mark Runacres, from Avon and Somerset Police, said the explosion happened in a chemical tank at a water recycling centre. ""The fire service led the rescue operation but sadly, despite the best efforts of all those involved, there were four fatalities. ""This is a tragic incident and our thoughts and sympathies go out to them."" The families of those who died have been contacted. Police and paramedics were sent to the scene Luke Gazzard from Avon Fire and Rescue Service said the four people died at the scene and there was no report of a fire. He said emergency services had dealt with ""a very, very challenging incident"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet he was ""deeply saddened"" to learn of the loss of life in the explosion. ""Our hearts go out to the victims and their families. Thank you to the emergency services who attended the scene,"" he said. Colin Skellett, chief executive of Wessex Water, said the company's ""thoughts are with the families, friends and colleagues of those involved"". He said they were ""absolutely devastated that the tragic incident at our site earlier today has resulted in four fatalities"". The company is working with the Health and Safety Executive as part of the investigation. The silo holds treated biosolids before it is recycled as an organic soil conditioner, Ch Insp Runacres said. He said a ""thorough investigation involving a number of agencies"" would be carried out. ""I can reassure people living in the nearby area that there is not believed to be any ongoing public safety concerns."" Biosolids are ""treated sludge"", a by-product of the sewage treatment process. According to Wessex Water, the sludge is treated in anaerobic digesters, oxygen-free tanks, to produce agricultural fertiliser and renewable energy. People have been urged to avoid the area. An emergency services helicopter landed near the site Jawad Burhan, who took a photo appearing to show a tank that had exploded, said there was a ""helicopter looking for missing people"". ""I heard the sound, I'm working beside the building in another warehouse. ""After 10 minutes I saw the helicopter coming and the police."" Kieran Jenkins, who works nearby, said he was inside a warehouse when he heard a ""big bang"". ""The whole warehouse was shaking and we literally stood there in shock,"" he said. ""We thought everything was going to fall and we came out and all we could see was people running - it was a bit of a shock, really."" Bristol Waste, which runs the nearby Avonmouth recycling centre, tweeted it had closed the site temporarily. Lorry driver Ronan Doyle said he was parked off Kings Weston Lane about to enter the recycling plant when he heard the explosion. ""There was a quieter 'whoosh' first, followed by a much louder and more intense noise,"" he said. ""It sounded like someone had driven into the lorry - the noise was so loud it didn't sound like anything I've ever heard before and it was followed by a loud bang. ""I continued into the recycling centre and we have just locked ourselves in purely because our way out is blocked."" Sean Nolan, who witnessed the aftermath of the explosion, said he initially thought the noise was from a crash. ""I heard what I thought may have been two trucks colliding by the way it shook the ground... it was big. ""It was quite short-lived, I'd say about two or three seconds. Sort of a boom and echo and then it just went quiet. ""That was it. There was no smoke, there was no after-effects of it."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer gave his condolences on Twitter, writing: ""My thoughts are with all those who tragically lost their lives today in Avonmouth. My heart goes out to their friends and family."" Darren Jones, MP for Bristol North West, said: ""My family and I are keeping those affected in our thoughts and prayers, following the tragic consequences of the explosion in Avonmouth."" He was ""pleased that the situation has been contained and that there is no further risk to local people"". Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said: ""This has already been such a challenging year, and this news of further loss of life is another terrible blow. ""As a city we will mourn for them.""

"Bars and pubs in Wales are banned from serving alcohol from 18:00 BST on Friday This is usually party season but an office outing or drinks with friends could not be further from reality as Wales prepares for a Covid Christmas. Pubs, cafes and restaurants have beenbanned from selling alcoholand ordered to close at 18:00 GMT as the Welsh Government attempts to curb the rise of coronavirus cases. But cross-bordertravel restrictions to parts of England and Scotlandhas eased, although travel is not advised. So what areWales' latest rules,external? The regulations state groups of four people from different households are allowed to meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants but the Welsh Government said people should limit themselves to seeing thesame ""one or two friends"". However, on Wednesday Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said: ""My message on this is really very simple - don't mix with people outside your household between now and Christmas. ""Don't mix if you can avoid it"". All pubs, restaurants and cafes have to shut at 18:00. They also won't be serving alcoholic drinks and are ordered to close early every day for two weeks until guidance is reviewed on 17 December. How many people have died with Covid-19 in Wales? Q&A: Can people from Wales go to England to drink? Pubs, shops, travel: What can you do in each Covid tier? Larger groups of people who all live in the same house are allowed to eat out together - but groups of more than four people who are in the same bubble are not allowed in pubs, cafes or restaurants. The rule of four will also apply when meeting people from different households outdoors, away from your home, but meeting anyone from outside your household bubble in someone's garden is not allowed. Two families can form a bubble or an extended household - and they are the only people you're allowed to see inside your home. ""To help keep everyone as safe as possible at home, only people from your own household or your extended household can meet at home,"" said First Minister Mark Drakeford. Indoor organised events are allowed over the winter because the Welsh Government says it would be more difficult to meet outside. Up to 15 people can take part in activities indoors and up to 30 outdoors - providing social distancing, hand hygiene and other Covid safety measures are followed The requirement to work from home whenever possible still remains in Wales, according to thenew rules,external. And as work is considered ""essential"", people are permitted to travel to England's very high risk tiers, if they cannot work from home. Yes - but there are restrictions if you're heading to the worst affected areas. As cross-border travel rules are relaxed on Friday from 18:00, you can go toplaces in tiers one and two,external- but not to areas under the strictest measures in tier three. Border communities: Chester and Wrexham It means travel to places like London, Liverpool, Chester, Cheltenham and Bath will be possible within the new rules. However you cannot visit places such as Manchester, Birmingham or Bristol, unless for work, essential childcare or to see your extended household. While pubs inEngland's tier one and twocan now open, youcan only buy alcohol as part of a ""substantial meal"". But the Welsh Government is urging people against cross-border travel in an attempt to curb rising coronavirus rates. Travel into Scotland's top tiers,external- levels three and four - is not allowed, much like England's tier three areas, except for essential reasons or seeing people in your extended household. The government is advising people not to travel across borders if it is not essential So places like Glasgow, Stirling and Livingston are among the eleven local authority areas with the highest Covid measures. People on the border in a 'difficult situation' What do the new rules mean for pubs in Wales? Covid: You asked and we answered ""We are advising people in Wales not to travel into those parts of England and Scotland where the infection rate is lower, to help prevent them taking coronavirus with them,"" Mr Drakeford has said. ""Coronavirus doesn't respect borders - we all have a part to play in keeping Wales and the UK safe. ""Please think carefully about where you are going and what you are doing. This virus thrives wherever we come together with others."" No. Atwo-week circuit-breaker took effect on 27 November,externalto help reduce transmission of the virus and Welsh legislations prevents travel. All children can go to school unless they have been asked to stay at home and self-isolate due to a Covid case in their class, bubble or year group. Yes - but only in Wales or to those areas of England and Scotland not in the highest level of restrictions. You can't go abroad. There are a small number of flights from UK airports but for ""essential purposes"" only, such as work or education. TheWelsh Government has said,externalinternational travel restrictions will continue and have warned they are likely to remain in place until at least January but ""kept under constant review"". You can still visit parts of Wales and other areas of the UK under lower levels of restrictions For those wanting to drive home to see family and friends to celebrate over the festive period,new rules will be introduced. From 23 to 27 December, people from across the UK will be able to meet. But with numbers limited to three households, some larger families, and those who have relatives who have separated, may face difficult choices when arranging the dinner table.

"The vaccine is made in Belgium and has to be stored at around -70C The first consignment of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has arrived in the UK. It has been taken to a central hub at an undisclosed location, and will now be distributed to hospital vaccination centres around the UK. The UK has ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. England's deputy chief medical officer said the first wave of vaccinations could prevent up to 99% of Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths. Speaking to BBC News, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said that would be possible if everyone on the first priority list took the vaccine and it was highly effective. He said it was key to distribute the vaccine ""as fast"" and at the ""highest volume"" as possible, but he acknowledged there would need to be some flexibility in the list. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are made in Belgium and have travelled to the UK via the Eurotunnel. Who will get the Covid vaccine first? What are the safety checks for vaccines? Listen again: Prof Van-Tam answers your questions The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and decided by the government. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff. However, because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at the necessary -70C, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - to lower the risk of wasting doses. Prof Van-Tam told BBC News: ""If we can get through phase one [of the priority list] and it is a highly effective vaccine and there is very, very high up take, then we could in theory take out 99% of hospitalisations and deaths related to Covid 19. ""That is why the phase one list is what it is, that is the primary ambition."" This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? The UK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, hasapologised for remarks that seemed to criticise the UK's vaccine approval process. He initially told Fox News: ""The UK did not do it as carefully. If you go quickly and you do it superficially, people are not going to want to get vaccinated."" But the UK defended its process, and said the jab is safe and effective. And speaking later to the BBC, Dr Fauci said: ""There really has been a misunderstanding, and for that I'm sorry, and I apologise for that. ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint. ""Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK. And that's just the reality. I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way."" The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The UK's 40 million doses will be distributed as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, with the first load rolled out next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. But the bulk of the roll-out across the UK will be next year. And it could take until April for all those deemed most at-risk to receive the new vaccine, according to NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"EU negotiator Michel Barnier has been in London since face-to-face talks resumed The prospect of a breakthrough in post-Brexit trade negotiations between the UK and EU is ""receding"", according to a senior UK government source. They told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the EU team were ""bringing new elements into the negotiation"" at the ""eleventh hour"". But the source said a breakthrough was ""still possible in the next few days"". Talks were continuing into the night in London. Current trading rules expire on 31 December. Both sides are urgently seeking compromises in key areas, including fishing rights and competition rules. An EU source told the BBC's political editor that talks were ""extremely sluggish"" around the so-calledlevel playing fieldfor competition rules and standards. But another source from Brussels said there were ""never any surprises or new demands from the EU side"". Laura Kuenssberg said both sides were suggesting to her that the real sticking point was over how those rules would be policed. Have trade talks taken a turn for the worse? Are both sides running out of road for a Brexit deal? What happens next with Brexit? The UK and EU have been locked in talks since March to determine their future relations once the UK's Brexit transition period ends in less than four weeks' time. The BBC's political editor said: ""The stumbling blocks certainly aren't new, but the sense on the UK side is that talks have gone backwards 24 hours"". She added that there were ""still real problems to solve"". Earlier, Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney told Irish broadcaster RTE that talks were ""at the very end"". Speaking ahead of Brexit meetings in Paris with his French counterpart on Thursday, he said efforts were under way to close negotiations ""in the next few days"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Boris Johnson has said the UK remains ""absolutely committed"" to ""getting a deal if we can"". Speaking on Wednesday, the prime minister said the EU side ""know what the UK bottom line is,"" as talks continued in what is seen as a crucial week. Face-to-face talks between negotiators have been ongoing since the weekend after a week-long pause. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is expected to return to Brussels on Friday to brief the bloc on the state of play, but Laura Kuenssberg said he may come straight back to join the four new negotiators who arrived on Thursday night. To do business with each other from January, the UK and the EU agree there will have to be some shared rules. It's called the level playing field, if you want to use the jargon, andyou can read about it in all the detail you want here. But again and again, the two sides have clashed over who should be in charge of the rules and, particularly, what happens if things go wrong. Late on Wednesday, there were signs that a deal was nearly concluded. But after another day of talks on Thursday, just before 19:00 GMT, things seemed to take a turn for the worse. It's true that both sides want a deal. It's also true that both sides can see the shape of a possible deal. But when there is so much at stake, taking it for granted that it will happen is quite an assumption to make. Read more from Laura here. On Thursday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told reporters: ""If the choice is a deal or no deal, then a deal is obviously in the national interest."" He said he was ""consulting across the Labour Party"" on whether the party's MPs should back a deal if it comes to a vote in the Commons, and would decide after examining the contents of the deal. He denied Labour was split over the issue, after reports he wasplanning to ask his MPs to vote in favour,externalbut some shadow cabinet members want to abstain. ""We've pulled together incredibly over the last few months through difficult decisions, and we'll do so on this decision again,"" he added. The government has not confirmed how it intends to ratify a deal in Parliament. But the UK's chief negotiator Lord David Frost has said he assumed MPs would have to approve a law to implement ""at least some elements"" of a deal. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The negotiations are continuing ahead of a politically sensitive moment next week, when acontroversial piece of Brexit legislationreturns to the Commons. The Internal Market Bill, which would allow ministers to override sections of the UK's withdrawal agreement, will come back before MPs next Monday. The publication of the bill in September sent shockwaves through the talks, and led to the EU Commissionbeginning legal proceedingsagainst the UK. But on Thursday, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government intends to reinsert contentious clauses taken out of the bill by the House of Lords. The PM's spokesman added the bill was a ""legal safety net"" to protect the UK internal market, in case talks about detailed arrangements for the Irish border break down. On Wednesday, MPs are also set to vote on a new taxation bill that willreportedly contain similar powersto override the withdrawal agreement over the issues of customs and VAT. EU leaders are due to meet next Thursday in Brussels for a scheduled summit. What happens now that a deal's been done? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks?

"This video can not be played Dr Fauci told the BBC: ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint"" Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, has apologised for remarks that seemed to criticise the UK's vaccine approval process. ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint,"" Dr Fauci told the BBC on Thursday. The UK on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine for the coronavirus. It has defended the rapid approval and said the jab is safe and effective. Dr Fauci on Wednesday had told Fox News that the UK did not review the vaccine ""as carefully"" as US health regulators, although he implied that the US would quickly also be in a position to approve a vaccine. ""We'll be there. We'll be there very soon,"" he added. He later told CBS News that the UK had ""rushed"" the approval, but on Thursday he walked back the comments, and said there was  ""no judgement on the way the UK did it"". ""Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK. And that's just the reality,"" Dr Fauci told the BBC. ""I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way."" The UK medicines regulator - MHRA - said it had ""rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review"" - adding that it reviewed preliminary data on the vaccine trials dating back to June and had been running a ""rolling review"" since October which helped speed the process. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? The regulator said that Covid vaccines were being developed ""in a coordinated in a way that allows some stages of this process to happen in parallel to condense the time needed"" adding that it did not mean that ""the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness"" had been bypassed. ""Any vaccine must undergo robust clinical trials in line with international standards, with oversight provided by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,"" it said. ""No vaccine would be authorised for supply in the UK unless the expected standards of safety, quality and efficacy are met,"" the MHRA added. Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week On Thursday, the UK's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC he was ""very confident"" in the MHRA. He said there was more than ""100 years of medical experience"" between the UK regulator and the committee advising which groups of people are vaccinated first. Dr Fauci's remarks came as the US surpassed 14 million Covid-19 infections in total, with a recorded 276,325 deaths. A woman waits for a Covid-19 test in California, as cases mount across the US Analysis by Naomi Grimley, BBC health correspondent America's Food and Drug Administration does have a different approach to other regulators around the world - it often asks vaccine makers for their raw data, which it then spends time re-analysing. The UK's medicines regulator in London, on the other hand, relies more heavily on the companies' own reports as does the European Medicines Agency, based in Amsterdam. Politics may also explain why the FDA hasn't yet given the green light. Back in October, President Trump pressured health officials to approve the first vaccine candidates before election day on 3 November but they pushed back, fearing it might become a political football. The FDA said it wanted to see two months' extra safety data from the final phase vaccine trials before pharmaceutical companies could apply for emergency approval. That has inevitably left some arguing the US has got bogged down in a much more detailed review than might have been necessary. The head of the European Medicines Agency also appeared to raise eyebrows yesterday at the truncated timetable in London. But officials in the UK believe the US and EU are likely to approve the vaccine soon. The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, andthe first consignment of that vaccine has now arrived. It has been taken to a central hub at an undisclosed location, and will now be distributed to hospital vaccination centres around the UK. England's deputy chief medical officer said the first wave of vaccinations could prevent up to 99% of Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths. Did Brexit speed up the UK's vaccine approval? What does UK vaccine approval mean for US? Are countries under pressure to approve a vaccine? This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" The US FDA plans to meet on 10 December to discuss approval for the UK-approved vaccine, and will meet again on 17 December to discuss a second vaccine - Moderna. Dr Fauci had described the US Food and Drug Administration's approval process, slower than the UK, as the ""gold standard"". On Thursday he clarified, saying the US does ""things a little differently"" than the UK. ""That's all,"" he said. ""Not better, not worse, just differently."" An independent UK expert on the use and effects of drugs in populations - Prof Stephen Evans of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the approvals processes carried out by the FDA and the MHRA were ""basically very similar"". ""The only major difference is that the FDA may reproduce all the tables submitted by a company by re-analysing the data,"" he said. ""It is very clear that the UK assessment of this has followed all the usual processes, but has been working incredibly long hours and seven days a week both with MHRA staff and with their academic advisors for quite a long time on initial and interim data before the final data were submitted."" Dr Fauci has led the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH) for more than 30 years - covering five presidential transitions - and has become the most visible member of the White House's coronavirus task force. The EU, meanwhile, is eyeing a 29 December meeting of the European Medicines Agency to determine if there is adequate safety data on the vaccine for it to be approved in Europe. This timeline puts the EU weeks behind both the UK and US. After the agency approves the vaccine, it will probably also need a sign-off from the EU Commission.

"Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson star in Dune Odeon owner AMC is in ""urgent talks"" with Warner Bros after the film maker said all releases would be available to stream instantly in the US. The move will enable film fans to watch the forthcoming sci-fi epic Dune and the Matrix sequel on HBO Max at the same time as their cinema release. It has escalated tensions between Hollywood and US movie theatres. Both studios and chains are desperate to rebuild revenues after virus control measures closed cinemas. The new releases will be available on the service, which is not yet available in the UK, for one month after release. HBO Max is set to launch in Europe in the second half of next year, according to its global boss Andy Forssell. The releases are also expected to include Godzilla vs Kong, Mortal Kombat and The Suicide Squad. Earlier this year, assertive action by AMC successfully curbed a similar screening plan by rival Hollywood studio, Universal. Cinemas are desperate for content to lure viewers back with new entertainment that can initially only be seen on their screens. Typically, new releases are shown exclusively at cinemas for months. AMC had agreed to allow one film, Wonder Woman 1984, to be shown simultaneously on HBO Max, the streaming service owned by its ultimate parent company AT&T. Is the era of the Hollywood blockbuster over? Twelve films to watch in December AMC boss Adam Aron, said: ""These coronavirus-impacted times are uncharted waters for all of us, which is why AMC signed on to an HBO Max exception to customary practices for one film only, Wonder Woman 1984, being released by Warner Brothers at Christmas when the pandemic appears that it will be at its height."" Keanu Reeves will reprise his role as Neo in The Matrix 4 It accused Warner Bros of subsidising its HBO Max by its move: ""We will do all in our power to ensure that Warner does not do so at our expense. We will aggressively pursue economic terms that preserve our business. ""We have already commenced an immediate and urgent dialogue with the leadership of Warner on this subject."" This video can not be played As ever more people sign up to streaming services, are fewer going to the movies? Ann Sarnoff, chair and chief executive of WarnerMedia Studios, said the pandemic called for ""creative solutions"". ""No one wants films back on the big screen more than we do,"" she said. ""We know new content is the lifeblood of theatrical exhibition, but we have to balance this with the reality that most theatres in the US will likely operate at reduced capacity throughout 2021."" AMC banned all Universal films after the studio said it would release new movies at home and on the big screen on the same day. The two firms eventually agreed that Universal films can go to digital services after just 17 days of viewing in cinemas. Explaining Warner Bros' decision, Ms Sarnoff said the ""unique one-year plan"" would give ""moviegoers who may not have access to theatres, or aren't quite ready to go back to the movies, the chance to see our amazing 2021 films"". ""We see it as a win-win for film lovers and exhibitors, and we're extremely grateful to our filmmaking partners for working with us on this innovative response to these circumstances.""

"The inquest heard that Deborah Roberts - known as Deb - may have stumbled while wearing the leads around her neck A woman was strangled to death after two dogs pulled on their leads which were around her neck as she walked them, an inquest has heard. Deborah Roberts was fatally injured in Garden Village, Wrexham on 8 July. She had been walking two Staffordshire bull terriers when it is thought she may have stumbled, possibly due to her Huntington's disease. The coroner told the inquest at Ruthin that it was a ""tragic case"" and concluded the death was an accident. Ms Roberts, 47, had the two rope leads around her neck as she walked the animals. The inquest was told she usually placed the leads around her neck, but not normally in the way it would be attached to a dog. She had been suffering fromHuntington's disease,external, an inherited, degenerative condition, which had led to her mobility deteriorating. The inquest also heard the dogs may have been trying to get Ms Roberts up by pulling on the leads, and that the dogs - Tyson and Ruby - were ""loving and caring pets"". Ms Roberts's son, Robert, told the inquest: ""They are beautiful dogs. If you met them now they'd just jump up and lick you. All they were doing is trying to help my mum when she fell."" Another of her sons, Callum, said his mother had been walking with his young cousin, who raised the alarm when the accident happened. Two workmen rushed to help Ms Roberts. In a statement, one of them said: ""I noticed a young girl running towards me crying, saying 'can you help me, someone is choking'."" He said two dogs were pulling ""backwards"" and the force of the dogs was causing the body to move. His colleague said in a statement both of the choke areas which go around the dog's necks were around Ms Roberts's neck. He described how the two dogs were whimpering, adding that he could see Ms Roberts was unconscious. Assistant coroner, David Pojur, said she ""may have stumbled"" but ""we don't know"" why she had the leads around her neck. He recorded the cause of death as asphyxiation caused by strangulation by a lead. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"More than 60,000 people in the UK have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test,official figures show.,external A further 414 were recorded on Thursday, taking the total to 60,113. Two other ways of measuring deaths - where Covid is mentioned on the death certificate, and the number of ""excess deaths"" for this time of year - give higher total figures. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more deaths than the UK, according toJohns Hopkins University.,external However, the UK has had more deaths per 100,000 people than any of those nations. In terms of deaths per 100,000 people, the UK is the seventh-highest country globally, behind Belgium, San Marino, Peru, Andorra, Spain and Italy. Coronavirus: Your tributes to those who have died How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? Prime Minister Boris Johnson said every death was ""one too many"". ""While it's fantastic news that a vaccine is on its way, we must not lose sight of the fact that the fight against coronavirus is not yet won,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, meanwhile, described the milestone as ""heartbreaking"". ""My thoughts are with all those families who will spend Christmas remembering those loved ones who are no longer with us,"" he said. The latest daily figures for the UK also showed a further 14,879 people have tested positive for Covid-19, taking the UK's total cases to 1,674,134. Covid news comes in contrasting shades. In early November, Pfizer and Biontech announced the success of their vaccine trial, which increased hopes of a return to normality. Two days later, the UK's daily reported death toll hit 50,000. This week's news of regulatory approval for the vaccine is closely followed by that total passing 60,000. This covers those who have died within 28 days of a positive test. There is a broader definition that includes those who might have died after a longer period from the time of a test, or who weren't tested but whose death certificates involved Covid-19 - this shows around 70,000 have died with the virus. These are sobering statistics and underline even more the importance of the vaccine for charting a way towards saving lives. First vaccines 'could cut 99% of deaths' - Van-Tam Minister: UK got jab first as it's better country Quarantine rules to be relaxed for business bosses The government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest therehave been more than 69,000 deaths by this measure.,external The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland - which measure excess deaths - suggest the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. So far, the second wave has been lower and slower than the first wave. About 80% of deaths involving coronavirus happened before August, and most of those happened in just one month. Almost 10,000 coronavirus deaths a week were registered in consecutive weeks in April. In this second wave, it looks like the peak figures - assuming infections keep falling before widespread vaccination takes place - might be closer to 3,000 than 4,000. And, as in the first wave, those over 75 account for about 75% of the deaths, suggesting that vaccinating over-75s could stem the vast majority of future deaths. This time around, the spread of deaths around the country has looked quite different. In the spring and summer, London and the north-west of England each accounted for about 15% of coronavirus deaths in the UK. But in this wave, London's share is down, closer to 5%, whereas the North West is just under 25%. Meanwhile, bed occupancy rates have fallen in almost three-fifths of English hospitals since the week ending 8 November - the first week these figures were published. In the week to 29 November, 87% of beds in English hospitals were occupied, compared with 88% the previous week. The NHS is meant to keep at least 10% of its beds free so that it can be flexible, allowing it to admit patients and cope with surges in demand. The number of hospitals reporting more than 90% occupancy has fallen slightly since the first week of November - down from 52 to 45 of the 127trusts reporting data,external. This video can not be played Family's grief over mother's Covid-19 death However, Robert Cuffe, the BBC's head of statistics, said pressures on hospitals are not ""evenly spread"". Some hospitals like North Middlesex, Southport and Ormskirk, Surrey and Sussex, and Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh have more than 95% of beds taken. He said: ""More hospitals have seen capacity free up this month than have seen it tighten. ""But as we move into the months that, in any year, put the most stress on capacity within the NHS, all eyes will be on these figures."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

Earlier, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said the first wave of vaccinations could prevent up to 99% of Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths. Speaking to BBC News, he said that would be possible if everyone on the first priority list took the vaccine and it was highly effective. He said it was key to distribute the vaccine ""as fast"" and at the ""highest volume"" possible, but he acknowledged there would need to be some flexibility in the list.

"The announcement that the UK is to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, a full decade earlier than planned, has prompted hundreds of questions from anxious drivers. Iâm going to try to answer some of the main ones weâve had sent in to the BBC. The obvious answer is that you plug it into the mains but, unfortunately, it isnât always that simple. If you have a driveway and can park your car beside your house, then you can just plug it straight into your domestic mains electricity supply. The problem is this is slow. It will take many hours to fully charge an empty battery, depending of course on how big the battery is. Expect it to take a minimum of eight to 14 hours, but if youâve got a big car you could be waiting more than 24 hours. A faster option is to get a home fast-charging point installed. The government will pay up to 75% of the cost of installation (to a maximum of Â£500), though installation often costs around Â£1,000. A fast charger should typically take between four and 12 hours to fully charge a battery, again depending how big it is. Ban on new petrol and diesel cars in UK from 2030 This is where electric vehicles really show cost advantages over petrol and diesel.  It is significantly cheaper to charge an electric car than fill up a fuel tank. The cost will depend on what car youâve got. Those with small batteries â and therefore short ranges â will be much cheaper than those with big batteries that can travel for hundreds of kilometres without recharging. How much it will cost will also depend on what electricity tariff you are on. Most manufacturers recommend you switch to an Economy 7 tariff, which means you pay much less for electricity during the night â when most of us would want to charge our cars. The consumer organisation Which estimates the average driver will use between Â£450 and Â£750 a year of additional electricity charging an electric car. This video can not be played Will the UK be ready for a 2030 ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars? If you can find a parking space on the street outside your home you can run a cable out to it but you should make sure you cover the wires so people donât trip over them. Once again, you have the choice of using the mains or installing a home fast-charging point. Many local authorities are putting in street charging points.  Look out for lamp posts with a blue light on them.  These will have plugs where you can get power. Lots of new electric cars now have apps installed that will direct you to the nearest charging point. If not, there are a host of websites and downloadable apps that will do the job. There are already more than 30,000 charging stations in the UK, according to the electricity company EDF.  This means there are already more public places to charge than petrol stations.  Around 10,000 new charge points were added just in 2019. And you should expect that number to increase rapidly.  Today, the government announced a Â£1.3bn investment in electric vehicle infrastructure, including charging points across the country. Public charging points are pretty easy to use, but there are a number of different operators and you often have to be a member to use them. Some charge a flat fee each month for access; some offer pay-as-you-go charging. Typically, youâll need to use a swipecard or your mobile phone to unlock the charging point.  This will allow you to connect the charging cable from your car to the charging point. A few manufacturers, most notably Tesla, offer access to âsuperchargersâ.  These allow very rapid charging indeed, you might get an 80% charge in just 30 minutes â about the time it takes to go to the loo and buy and drink a cup of coffee. These used to be free to Tesla owners, but now most have to pay to use the Supercharger network. New charging points are going in all the time As you might expect, this depends on which car you choose. The rule of thumb is the more you spend, the further youâll go. The range you get depends on how you drive your car. If you drive fast, youâll get far fewer kilometres than listed below. Careful drivers should be able to squeeze even more kilometres out of their vehicles. These are some approximate ranges for different electric cars. Renault Zoe - 394km (245 miles) Hyundai IONIQ - 310km (193 miles) Nissan Leaf e+ - 384km (239 miles) Kia e Niro - 453km (281 miles) BMW i3 120Ah - 293km (182 miles) Tesla Model 3 SR+ - 409km (254 miles) Tesla Model 3 LR - 560km (348 miles) Jaguar I-Pace - 470km (292 miles) Honda e - 201km (125 miles) Vauxhall Corsa e- 336km (209 miles) Source: SMMT It is worth noting that electric vehicle range is expected to steadily increaseas battery technology improves. Once again, this depends on how you look after it. Most electric car batteries are lithium-based, just like the battery in your mobile phone. Like your phone battery, the one in your car will degrade over time.  What that means is it wonât hold the charge for so long and the range will reduce. If you overcharge the battery or try to charge it at the wrong voltage it will degrade more quickly. Check out whether the manufacturer offers a warranty on the battery â many do.  They typically last eight to 10 years. It's worth understanding how they work, because you won't be able to buy a new petrol or diesel car after 2030.

"The Sun shining through the heat haze from a wildfire in California The Earth continued to endure a period of significant heating in 2020 according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Its provisional assessment suggests this year will be one of the three hottest, just behind 2016 and 2019. The warmest six years in global records dating back to 1850 have now all occurred since 2015. The most notable warmth was in the Siberian Arctic, where temperatures were 5C above average. UN climate change goal now 'within reach' Covid pandemic has little impact on rise in CO2 Can sending fewer emails really save the planet? Warmer winters linked to increased drowning risk To work out the annual rise in temperatures for their State of the Climate report, the WMO uses information from five different global datasets. They then compare modern readings to temperatures taken between 1850-1900. This baseline figure is sometimes referred to as pre-industrial levels. With data available from January to October this year, the WMO says 2020 is  set to be around 1.2C above the baseline, but  with a margin of error of 0.1C. All five datasets currently have 2020 as the second warmest, behind 2016 and ahead of 2019, based on comparisons with similar periods in previous years. However the expectation from scientists is that the temperature data from November and December will likely see enough cooling to push 2020 into third spot. That's because aLa NiÃ±a weather event has developedin the Pacific Ocean and this normally depresses temperatures. The biggest differences from the long term average temperature were seen in the Siberian Arctic Despite this, the WMO is certain that 2020 will remain one of the warmest three. ""Record warm years have usually coincided with a strong El NiÃ±o event, as was the case in 2016,"" said Prof Petteri Taalas, WMO Secretary General. ""We are now experiencing a La NiÃ±a, which has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but has not been sufficient to put a brake on this year's heat."" These relatively similar global temperature figure recorded over the past few years hide considerable differences at local level. In 2020, Siberia saw temperatures around 5C above average, which culminated in a reading of38C at Verkhoyansk on the 20th June, which is provisionally the highest known temperature recorded anywhere north of the Arctic Circle. Icebergs off Greenland as the Arctic summer melt was second largest on record January to October was also the warmest such period on record in Europe. But some places were below average including parts of Canada, Brazil, India and Australia. Overall though the 2020 figure reinforces the view that climate warming, driven by human activities is persisting. The decade from 2011 to 2020 is the warmest yet recorded. The majority of the excess heat generated from warming gases in the atmosphere ends up in the oceans. This is putting added strain on the seas, with around 80% of global waters experiencing at least one marine heatwave this year.  These events, similar to heatwaves on land, see prolonged exposure to high temperatures which can have devastating impacts on marine creatures and ecosystems. Along-running heatwaveoff the coast of California, known as ""the blob"", was said to have killed up to a million seabirds in 2015-16. Researchers say that these events have become more than 20 times more frequent over the past 40 years. ""About 90% of the heat accumulating within the climate system from anthropogenic climate change is stored in the ocean,"" said Prof John Church from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. ""This latest update from WMO clearly shows the oceans are continuing to warm, and at an accelerating rate, contributing to sea-level rise. This means climate change has significant momentum committing us to further change over the coming decades."" The WMO says that warming continues to drive melting in many parts of the world, including Greenland where around 152 billion tonnes of ice was lost from the ice sheet in the year to August 2020. There were 30 named storms during the North Atlantic hurricane season, breaking the record for the number of such events. Europe saw another record-breaking summer in 2020, making life uncomfortable for travellers As well as record numbers,new evidence suggestedthat hurricanes get stronger when they hit land because of rising temperatures. Other impacts noted by the WMO this year included wildfires in Siberia, Australia and along the US West Coast and South America, which saw plumes of smoke circumnavigate the globe. Floods in Africa and South East Asia displaced large numbers of people and undermined food security for millions. The findings of the WMO report won't come as a surprise to most observers. This video can not be played What is climate change? ""The state of the global climate? Parlous,"" said Prof Dave Reay from University of Edinburgh, UK. ""These annual updates of deteriorating planetary health always make for bleak reading; this year's is a full red alert. Surging heat, intensifying droughts and rampant wildfires all speak of the acute impacts of climate change in 2020.  They also warn of the chronic undermining of global carbon sinks - the oceans, trees and soils around the world - that is underway. ""Throw yet more emissions and warming at them and they will rip the Paris climate goals from our grasp forever. The year ahead will be defined by our recovery from Covid-19, the centuries ahead will be defined by how green that recovery actually is."" Hurricane Iota left destruction in its trail in Nicaragua Environmental campaigners say the report adds urgency to calls for the recovery, post-Covid, to focus on climate change and the environment. ""Although the pandemic will have been the biggest concern to many people in the developed world in 2020, for millions in climate vulnerable places the climate emergency remains the biggest threat and sadly there is no simple vaccine to fix the climate. But keeping fossil fuels in the ground would be a good start,"" said Dr Kat Kramer, from Christian Aid. ""These findings show just how important it is to ensure the government's economic recovery measures don't entrench the fossil fuel economy but act to accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon world."" According to a new report from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), climate change is now the biggest threat to the most important world heritage sites. The IUCN says that 83 such sites are now threatened by rising temperatures, including the Great Barrier Reef where ocean warming, acidification and extreme weather have all contributed to a dramatic decline. It has been rated as having a ""critical"" outlook for the first time. Follow Matton Twitter.,external.

"A new analysis, seen by the BBC, suggests the goals of the UN Paris climate agreement are getting ""within reach."" TheClimate Action Tracker,externalgroup looked at new climate promises from China and other nations, along with the carbon plans of US President-elect Joe Biden. These commitments would mean the rise in world temperatures could be held to 2.1C by the end of this century. Previous estimates indicated up to 3C of heating, with disastrous impacts. But the experts are worried the long-term optimism is not matched by short-term plans to cut CO2. John Kerry named as Biden's climate tsar Covid pandemic has little impact on rise in CO2 Climate pledge on gas boilers for 2023  'vanishes' For more than a decade, researchers from the Climate Action Tracker have kept a close eye on what countries' collective carbon-cutting pledges mean for our warming world. After the failed Copenhagen summit in 2009, the group estimated that global temperatures would rise by 3.5C by the end of this century. But the creation in 2015 of the Paris climate agreement, which was designed to avoid dangerous warming of the Earth, made a considerable impact. As a result of the international deal, countries slowly started to switch away from fossil fuels. In September this year, the group concluded that the world was heading for warming of around 2.7C by 2100. This figure was still far above the 2C goal contained in the wording of the Paris pact, and nowhere near the more challenging 1.5C target thatscientists endorsed as the threshold to destructive warming in 2018. Their new ""optimistic analysis"" now suggests a rise of 2.1C by 2100. This video can not be played What is climate change? The past three months have seen some key developments. In September, China's President Xi Jinpingtold the UN that his country will reach net zero emissions by 2060, and that its emissions will peak before 2030. According to the CAT researchers, this could reduce warming by 0.2 to 0.3C by the end of the century. Japan and South Korea have bothfollowed suit,external, pledging to reach net zero by 2050. South Africa and Canada have also announced their own net zero targets. The other significant change is the election of Joe Biden in the US. Tackling climate change is amajor part of his agenda. He has promised to bring the US to net zero emissions by 2050. That move would reduce global temperatures by 0.1C by 2100. ""We now have north of 50% of global emissions covered by big countries with a zero emissions by mid-century goal,"" said Bill Hare from Climate Analytics, who helped lead the Climate Action Tracker analysis. ""When you add all that up, along with what a whole bunch of other countries are doing, then you move the temperature dial from around 2.7C to really quite close to two degrees."" ""It's still a fair way off from the Paris Agreement target, but it is a really major development,"" he told BBC News. President-elect Joe Biden has selected former US Secretary of State John Kerry to be his climate envoy The CAT researchers say they have taken a fairly conservative approach but they readily acknowledge that their optimistic analysis comes with some major caveats. The biggest problem as they see it, is that the near-term plans to cut carbon by 2030 are just not up to the job. ""Countries have not yet adjusted their short-term actions to be on a pathway towards the long-term target,"" said Niklas HÃ¶hne, from the NewClimate Institute, who also works on the Climate Action Tracker. ""Long-term targets are easier, they are far away. But short-term actions are happening right now and they affect citizens, they affect voters. And that's why this is much more difficult,"" he told BBC News. Politicians have been under pressure to act on climate change from protestors, including Greta Thunberg The countries that have signed up to the Paris agreement are expected to lodge new carbon-cutting plans for 2030 by the end of this year. It's expected that a number will do so, including the UK and the EU. But there are several countries who are still reluctant to set goals, and many poorer nations are still looking to invest in coal. ""There are countries that still remain bad actors, including Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Australia, Russia, and a few others,"" said Bill Hare. ""And we also have a pipeline of coal plants in the region where I'm working now in Asia. It has not collapsed, it has not gone away, so yes, there's much to be concerned about. And there's much that can go wrong."" A hydrogen-powered train - the green form of the gas could help decarbonise transport According to observers, the response of countries to the Covid crisis is a huge opportunity to focus their short-term spending on renewable energy and increased decarbonisation. ""The pandemic opened a window to not only get countries to outline their long-term goal, but to actually move onto the right path so that they can actually achieve the long term goal,"" said Dr Maisa Rojas, who is the director of the Center for Climate and Resilience Research at the University of Chile in Santiago.

"This video can not be played Ch Insp Mark Runacres of Avon and Somerset Police: ""Sadly... there have been four fatalities"" Four people have died and another has been injured in a large explosion at a waste water treatment works. Firefighters were called to Wessex Water's premises in Avonmouth, Bristol, at about 11:20 GMT. Three of the people who died worked for the firm, and the other was a contractor. The injured person's condition is not life-threatening. The blast happened in a silo containing treated biosolids and was not terror related, police said. A witness reported hearing a ""very loud explosion"" that ""shook buildings"", and another said they saw about 10 ambulances driving to the scene. Police declared a major incident and are investigating the circumstances of the blast. This video can not be played Avonmouth explosion eyewitness describes the search for missing people Ch Insp Mark Runacres, from Avon and Somerset Police, said the explosion happened in a chemical tank at a water recycling centre. ""The fire service led the rescue operation but sadly, despite the best efforts of all those involved, there were four fatalities. ""This is a tragic incident and our thoughts and sympathies go out to them."" The families of those who died have been contacted. Police and paramedics were sent to the scene Luke Gazzard from Avon Fire and Rescue Service said the four people died at the scene and there was no report of a fire. He said emergency services had dealt with ""a very, very challenging incident"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet he was ""deeply saddened"" to learn of the loss of life in the explosion. ""Our hearts go out to the victims and their families. Thank you to the emergency services who attended the scene,"" he said. Colin Skellett, chief executive of Wessex Water, said the company's ""thoughts are with the families, friends and colleagues of those involved"". He said they were ""absolutely devastated that the tragic incident at our site earlier today has resulted in four fatalities"". The company is working with the Health and Safety Executive as part of the investigation. The silo holds treated biosolids before it is recycled as an organic soil conditioner, Ch Insp Runacres said. He said a ""thorough investigation involving a number of agencies"" would be carried out. ""I can reassure people living in the nearby area that there is not believed to be any ongoing public safety concerns."" Biosolids are ""treated sludge"", a by-product of the sewage treatment process. According to Wessex Water, the sludge is treated in anaerobic digesters, oxygen-free tanks, to produce agricultural fertiliser and renewable energy. People have been urged to avoid the area. An emergency services helicopter landed near the site Jawad Burhan, who took a photo appearing to show a tank that had exploded, said there was a ""helicopter looking for missing people"". ""I heard the sound, I'm working beside the building in another warehouse. ""After 10 minutes I saw the helicopter coming and the police."" Kieran Jenkins, who works nearby, said he was inside a warehouse when he heard a ""big bang"". ""The whole warehouse was shaking and we literally stood there in shock,"" he said. ""We thought everything was going to fall and we came out and all we could see was people running - it was a bit of a shock, really."" Bristol Waste, which runs the nearby Avonmouth recycling centre, tweeted it had closed the site temporarily. Lorry driver Ronan Doyle said he was parked off Kings Weston Lane about to enter the recycling plant when he heard the explosion. ""There was a quieter 'whoosh' first, followed by a much louder and more intense noise,"" he said. ""It sounded like someone had driven into the lorry - the noise was so loud it didn't sound like anything I've ever heard before and it was followed by a loud bang. ""I continued into the recycling centre and we have just locked ourselves in purely because our way out is blocked."" Sean Nolan, who witnessed the aftermath of the explosion, said he initially thought the noise was from a crash. ""I heard what I thought may have been two trucks colliding by the way it shook the ground... it was big. ""It was quite short-lived, I'd say about two or three seconds. Sort of a boom and echo and then it just went quiet. ""That was it. There was no smoke, there was no after-effects of it."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer gave his condolences on Twitter, writing: ""My thoughts are with all those who tragically lost their lives today in Avonmouth. My heart goes out to their friends and family."" Darren Jones, MP for Bristol North West, said: ""My family and I are keeping those affected in our thoughts and prayers, following the tragic consequences of the explosion in Avonmouth."" He was ""pleased that the situation has been contained and that there is no further risk to local people"". Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said: ""This has already been such a challenging year, and this news of further loss of life is another terrible blow. ""As a city we will mourn for them.""

"Meeting the UK's world-leading climate change target will be a ""colossal challenge"", a government spending watchdog has warned. The National Audit Office says it will affect the way we work, travel, heat our homes - even how much meat we eat. In a report,externalit says the cost of cutting CO2 is highly uncertain, but the cost of allowing temperatures to rise would probably be greater. The PM has vowed to cut emissions by 68% by 2030 based on 1990 levels. Making the new pledge, Boris Johnson urged other world leaders to follow with ambitious targets at the virtual climate summit he is hosting on 12 December. The announcement has been broadly welcomed, although scientists say it does not guarantee dangerous climate change will be avoided. They urged Mr Johnson to impose policies to back up his ambitions - currently the UK is slipping behind its existing targets. The PM said: âWe have proven we can reduce our emissions and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process â uniting businesses, academics, NGOs and local communities in a common goal to go further and faster to tackle climate change. âToday, we are taking the lead with an ambitious new target to reduce our emissions by 2030 faster than any major economy. Humans waging 'suicidal war' on nature - UN chief The year 2020 set to be in top three warmest A really simple guide to climate change âBut this is a global effort, which is why the UK is urging world leaders to bring forward their own ambitious plans to cut emissions and set net zero targets.â One of the UKâs leading climate scientists, Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, told BBC News: âMr Johnsonâs target is ambitious â but we need action to back it up, right now. The Treasury recently committed billions towards the HS2 rail link He noted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently committed Â£127bn to the HS2 rail link and new roads - which will both increase emissions - while offering just Â£1bn to home insulation, which would reduce emissions. Prof Hoskins remarked: âThe actions of the chancellor don't measure up. Every single department has to wear climate change glasses when they think of new policies, and the Treasury clearly hasnât got that message.â He and other scientists said even if the UK and other nations keep their promises on cutting emissions there was no guarantee the world would avoid serious heating. âThe world will be increasingly difficult and dangerous with every percentage point of temperature rise,â he said. âThere are important things we donât know for sure. How much more does it take to destabilise Antarctica, for instance? We don't knowâ¦ and the impact could be devastating.â Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ© from the University of East Anglia said if nations matched the UKâs lead âit wonât be a safe climate â but it will be a safer climate than weâd get based on current levels of ambition.â In 2019, total UK greenhouse gas emissions were 45% per cent lower than in 1990. Achieving the new target, a 68% cut, will require the UK working 50% harder than it currently is. Between 2008 and 2018 the energy sector saw the biggest fall in emissions (-62%) as the UK abandoned coal burning. It's followed by the waste sector (-46%) which started capturing methane emissions, and industry (29%) where efficiency improved. Emissions from transport have barely fallen (-3%). Farm emissions are almost static (-2%). A coalition of green groups is urging the government to reach a 75% cut by 2030. And more radical groups such as Extinction Rebellion say the UK should stop emissions almost completely within a few years to be confident of avoiding climate disaster. Research by the London School of Economics (LSE) found that it is economically feasible for UK emissions to be cut by 72%. The government has not costed the range of measures that would be needed, but experts say more homes will need to switch to low-carbon heating. Gas-guzzling SUVs might also be forced off the roads â and frequent fliers taxed more. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which advises government, welcomed the 68% cut, but warned: âThis is more than just a number. âIt should be accompanied by wider climate commitments, including the development of a policy package and net zero strategy to deliver against the UK goal; clear commitments to reduce international aviation and shipping emissions; and greater support for climate finance, particularly for developing countries.â Net zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and balancing any further releases by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. More policies will be revealed if the long-delayed Energy White Paper is published, as expected, before Christmas. The prime ministerâs 68% target represents the UKâs NDC â its nationally determined contribution towards meeting the Paris Agreement. This video can not be played Is it possible to reverse the climate crisis? The BBC's Justin Rowlatt explains NDCs represent the commitments by each country - under the Paris pact - to reduce their own national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The Paris deal, signed in 2016, is aimed at keeping global temperature rise well under 2C, preferably with a maximum rise of 1.5C. Why the UK's carbon-free future will need rules The virtual event Mr Johnson is hosting next week is in place of annual UN climate talks scheduled for Glasgow in November but postponed by a year because of Covid-19. The UK will hold the presidency of next yearâs meeting in partnership with Italy. It is known as COP26 - the 26th Conference of the Parties. Laurence Tubiana, an architect of the Paris Agreement, said: ""This commitment from the prime minister can underpin his personal efforts to seek similar moves from counterparts in the run-up to the Glasgow Summit next year. â(It will need) investments in areas ranging from greener steel production to farming and clean heating technologies, but other countries can draw confidence from Britain's leadership."" The RSPBâs Martin Harper said: âThe UK governmentâs new 2030 climate target will enhance the UKâs leadership credentials. âBut we need to go further and faster, in particular by investing in protecting and restoring habitats such as our peatlands which are so important for locking up carbon.â A UK strategy on conserving peat is long-delayed. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: ""We welcome the important strengthening of the 2030 UK target. But this is the minimum we should aim for."" Peter Simpson, from Anglian Water and co-chair of the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group, said: âCredible plans matter in the race to zero, so todayâs announcement is welcomed. The spotlight is on.â Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said the net zero target was ""daunting"". ""The government hasn't put its own house in order yet or done enough to put the UK on course to meet older, easier targets. It's time to lead by example and shift its efforts up a gear,"" she said.

"This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world The top US intelligence official says China is the ""greatest threat to democracy and freedom"" since World War Two. Writing in the Wall St Journal, John Ratcliffe said China was growing its power by stealing US secrets and then replacing US firms in the market. The Trump administration has taken a hard line on China, imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and accusing Beijing of intellectual property theft. China has not yet responded. However, it has responded forcefully to US moves such as the imposition of tariffs and efforts to keep the telecoms giant Huawei out of the American market. Beijing was preparing for confrontation with the US and intended to dominate the world ""economically, militarily and technologically"", Mr Ratcliffe warned. Some of Mr Ratcliffe's comments echoprevious interventions by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and FBI chief Christopher Wray. However, they also come at a time when China has stepped up pressure on US ally Australia, publishing a list of ways it wants Canberra to change its behaviour, slapping tariffs on imports of Australian wine and provoking the Australian government over its rights record in Afghanistan. Why did China really go cold turkey on Australian wine? Australia and China's new battleground: social media Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying had earlier on Wednesday accused the US of ""launching various political oppressive campaigns against China"", adding that this came ""out of strong ideological bias and a strategy to contain China"". ""There is a Chinese saying... 'the eye sees what the mind believes',""she said in her daily press conference,external. ""We hope the US will... stop regarding everyone as spies."" The Director of National Intelligence said China had replaced Russia and counter-terrorism as the main focus of US intelligence activities. China was engaged in a form of economic espionage that he described as ""rob, replicate and replace"" - giving the example of aChinese wind turbine firm that was found guilty in the US of stealing from a US competitorbefore going on to sell worldwide while the US firm lost shareholder value and fired staff. US intellectual property worth $500bn (Â£370bn) was being stolen every year, he said. FBI arrests of  Chinese nationals for stealing research had become frequent and China had also been paying the head of Harvard University's chemistry department $50,000 a month until his arrest earlier this year. This video can not be played China's UK Ambassador Liu Xiaoming: China is not the enemy of the US Mr Ratcliffe also accused Chinese intelligence services of introducing vulnerabilities into technology offered by top Chinese tech firms such as Huawei and said allies using Chinese technology would not have US intelligence shared with them. He said US intelligence showed that China had carried out ""human testing"" on troops with the aim of developing soldiers with ""biologically enhanced capabilities"". And he said China had engaged in a ""massive influence campaign"" targeting US members of Congress and their staff by encouraging unions at big firms to tell local politicians to take a softer line on China or face losing union members' votes. Beijing was targeting members of Congress with ""six times the frequency of Russia and 12 times the frequency of Iran"", Mr Ratcliffe said. The spying game: China's global network Why US-China relations have reached a low Other countries faced the same challenge from China as the US, he said. ""China believes that a global order without it at the top is a historical aberration,"" he said. ""It aims to change that and reverse the spread of liberty around the world."" Under President Trump, the US has ramped up confrontation with China in a number of areas. The two countries have imposedtariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of one another's goodsandimposed export controls on products in sensitive areas. On Thursday the White House said it had added four more Chinese firms - chipmaker SMIC, national oil firm CNOOC, China Construction Technology Co and China International Engineering Consulting Corp - to a blacklist of firms deemed to be linked to the Chinese military. Earlier this year the US ordered a Chinese consulate in Houston to close over economic espionage concerns - Beijing responded by ordering the US to close its consulate in the city of Chengdu. The two countries have alsoexpelled each others' journalists. This video can not be played Men are filmed using a hose and closing rubbish bins at China's consulate in Houston Relations between the two superpowers have also soured over the coronavirus pandemic - which Mr Trump has repeatedly referred to as the ""Chinese virus"" - and China's moves in Hong Kong. Mr Trump signed an order ending preferential US treatment for Hong Kong after Beijing imposed a controversial new security law there, which the US said ended Hong Kong's autonomy. The Hong Kong crisis and the new world order Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice The US has also accused China of ""horrific and systematic"" human rights abuses in its treatment of its Muslim Uighur minority in the Xinjiang region and has sanctioned some Chinese politicians. China is accused of mass detentions, religious persecution and forced sterilisation of Uighurs and others, but Beijing denies any mistreatment. China's hidden camps - BBC News Uighurs 'detained for beards and veils' - leak President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office in January, is expected to continue President Trump's policy of countering China, but jointly with allies, as opposed to Mr Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals. There is rare cross-party agreement on getting tough with China over trade and other issues, the BBC's White House correspondent Tara McKelvey says. How will Biden change US foreign policy? The Trump administration has been successful in winning global support for a boycott of Chinese communications technology. However, Mr Biden is likely to be more active in seeking areas of co-operation with a rising China, particularly in areas such as climate change.

"Quarantine rules are set to be eased for business travellers in England. The rules will be relaxed for top bosses of foreign multinational firms visiting English branches and bosses at firms planning to invest. Returning executives will also be exempt from quarantine. In each case, the business trips must result in a deal which creates or preserves 50 jobs or leads to a Â£100m investment or order, according to the Department for Transport. The new rule will allow business people to travel to England from countries that are not on the UK's list of travel corridors without having to isolate for 14 days on arrival. The move was announced in a tweet by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Travellers will have to demonstrate in an exemption letter that they are delivering these business benefits to the UK. This letter will be checked by police or Border Force. When in England, the government said, executives will be exempt from the normal quarantine rules only in the course of a ""specific business activity"" that will benefit the UK economy. ""And [they] will only be able to meet with others as required by that specific activity,"" it said. Performing arts workers, TV production staff, journalists and recently signed sports professionals will also be exempt, the government said. Currently, people arriving in the UK from most countries - including British nationals - must self-isolate for 14 days or face fines of up to Â£1,000. But that can increase to Â£10,000 for repeat offenders. Exceptions are made for people coming from the Common Travel Area - the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - or countries intravel corridors,externalwith England.

"Care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid vaccine from 14 December, the health secretary has confirmed. There had been fears that homes would not be able to receive the first batch of doses due to logistical challenges. But Jeanne Freeman said confirmation on how the vaccine can be transported and stored meant it would now be possible to deliver them to care homes. The vaccines will be given to the vaccinators from Tuesday 8 December. The health secretary said about 65,500 doses of the vaccine would arrive in Scotland by Tuesday. Thefirst consignment of the vaccine arrived in the UK on Thursdayand it will now be distributed to vaccination centres across the four nations. They will initially be stored in packs of 997 doses in specialist freezers around Scotland. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at a temperature of -70C. Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week What are the safety checks for vaccines? When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Ms Freeman said this posed ""particular logistical challenges"" when vaccinating people at or close to their homes. But she told MSPs it had now been confirmed the vaccine could be transported in an unfrozen state for up to 12 hours. It can also be broken down into smaller pack sizes and stored undiluted for up to five days, she said. ""So in effect we can take the vaccine to them [care homes] or close to them, and we will begin that exercise from 14 December,"" the health secretary said. ""From next Tuesday we will begin vaccinating first the vaccinators themselves and then work our way through the first cohorts of health and social care workers."" The vaccine is made in Belgium and has to be stored at around -70C The health secretary said Scotland already had the 160 vaccinators who would be needed from Tuesday. The government is also ""on track"" to recruit 2,000 vaccinators and support staff by the end of January. ""An existing core of trained and experienced vaccinators from the flu programme will transition over to Covid vaccination over this month and next,"" she said. ""We are actively recruiting from the emergency registers and the NHS Scotland accelerated recruitment portal and drawing from the wider clinical workforce of GPs, pharmacists, dentists and optometrists."" Ms Freeman said that pregnant women, or women who were planning to be pregnant in the next three months, should not take the Pfizer vaccine. And she confirmed 16 and 17-year-olds with underlying health conditions would be vaccinated, following a request from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Half of the initial supplies of the vaccine that arrive in Scotland in December will be held back for the second dose. The Scottish government has bought 23 ultra-low temperature freezers to store the vaccine. They will be based at all major acute hospitals across the country and on Scotland's islands. Ms Freeman said the introduction of mass vaccination centres was ""further down the line"". But she added that she hoped the first wave of the vaccination programme would be completed by the spring. The Scottish Conservatives said more clarity was still needed on staff recruitment, vaccination centres, freezers, and the long-term plans. Everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 will be offered a vaccination. The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has drawn up advice on how people should be prioritised. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials. The vaccine must be stored at around -70C and will be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people. The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said despite the speed of approval, no corners have been cut. Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said.

"There will be no extension to Scotland's school Christmas holidays, the country's education secretary has confirmed. Talks had been held about potentially shutting all schools on 18 December and reopening them again on 11 January. But there had been concern about the impact on teaching time and the difficulties it could cause parents. The EIS, Scotland's largest teaching union, said the decision not to extend the holidays would anger many teachers. And it accused the government of ""once again showing a complete disregard for the concerns and welfare of teachers"". The union had wanted schools to move to remote learning in the final week of term to ensure senior staff did not find themselves having to deal with Covid outbreaks during the holidays. Will next year's Higher exams go ahead? Talks held on extending school Christmas holidays Keeping level 4 schools open 'is vital for pupils' This would also have minimised the risk of staff, pupils and parents having Christmas ruined by infections, the union had argued. Holiday dates in Scotland vary between different council areas, with many schools due to finish on 22 or 23 December before returning between 5 and 7 January. A memo that wasleaked to the Daily Record newspaper,externallast week suggested that the government was considering a national extension to the holidays. It would have seen schools either remaining closed or introducing remote learning for a temporary period. The proposal was designed to limit the spread of Covid after families get together for Christmas. Mr Swinney said the health advice he had been given suggested that pupils would be safer in school Opposition parties had accused the government of ""dithering"" over the decision, which they said was causing uncertainty for pupils, staff and parents. In aletter to the Scottish Parliament's education committee,externalon Thursday morning, Education Secretary John Swinney said: ""I have reached the decision not to make any changes to the planned Christmas and new year holiday dates"". Mr Swinney said there had been a ""range of views"" when the proposal was discussed at the Education Recovery Group, which includes councils, teaching unions and other organisations. He added: ""The public health advice that I received is to keep schools open as planned as the controlled school environment is more preferable to social mixing outside of school if schools are closed early. ""In addition, vulnerable children may be at greater risk if they are out of school for an extended period."" Mr Swinney also said he had taken into account the need to provide childcare for key workers, and the ""significant difficulties"" an extension to the holidays could cause for working parents. And he said the advice he had received continued to be that there is no evidence that schools and early learning settings are driving transmission of the virus, and that there is ""no clear rationale for disrupting children's education."" Mr Swinney is facing calls to cancel next year's Higher and Advanced Higher exams Mr Swinney also confirmed that there would be a staggered return for university students after the holidays, and that students would not be returning in the ""congested period"" directly after Christmas and new year. He said he was still in discussions on the precise nature of the return and that he would set out the details as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens have repeated their call for the government to cancel Higher and Advanced Higher exams next year and replace them with a ""robust system of continuous assessment"". The government has already cancelled next year's National 5s, with a final decision on whether or not to have Higher and Advanced Higher exams due to be made by the February break. The party's co-leader Patrick Harvie said it was clear that the academic year was being severely disrupted, and highlighted the case of a pupil who has already had to self-isolate three times yet faces prelim exams early next year. He added: ""It's long past time the first minister gave teachers and young people the clarity they need and accepted that Higher and Advanced Higher exams cannot go ahead in the coming year."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that the government was considering ""very, very carefully"" whether the exams should go ahead, and appeared to suggest a decision could be made sooner than February.

"Madeleine McCann was three when she went missing in 2007 Scotland Yard is still treating Madeleine McCann as a missing person, the Met Commissioner has said, despite the belief of German prosecutors that she is dead. Dame Cressida Dick said the force was working with German investigators but had not seen all of their evidence. Madeleine disappeared in 2007 aged three on holiday in Portugal. Prosecutors previously said they have evidence a German child sex offender named as Christian B killed her. But although Christian B, 43, was identified as a suspect in June, prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said the evidence is not strong enough to charge him. Suspects' surnames are not usually revealed in Germany for privacy reasons. Who is the German suspect? The Madeleine McCann case: A timeline Dame Cressida said that the Met's position had not changed since the summer, when the force said its investigation - Operation Grange - remained a missing person inquiry as there is no ""definitive evidence whether Madeleine is alive or dead"". She said a small team of Met Police investigators continued to work ""very closely"" with police in Germany and Portugal. ""We will continue until the time that it is right, either because much more light has been thrown on this or somebody has been brought to justice,"" she said. ""Or if we feel we have exhausted all possible opportunities. We're not at any of those stages at the moment, and the team continues."" Despite the close co-operation, she said she did not expect ""every single piece of material to be shared with us"". ""I'm sure they're sharing the relevant things at the relevant times with us,"" Dame Cressida said. Madeleine, from Rothley in Leicestershire, went missing from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, on 3 May 2007, shortly before her fourth birthday. Official records show Christian B has 17 previous convictions, including for rape and sexual abuse of children Christian B is currently serving a prison sentence for drug offences in Germany and lost an appeal last month against a further seven-year sentence for rape. He attacked a 72-year-old American woman in 2005 in the same area from where Madeleine disappeared about 18 months later. Police believe he was regularly living in this part of Portugal between 1997 and 2007, staying in a camper van at the time he is suspected of abducting Madeleine.

"The Florida sanctuary owned by Carole Baskin (pictured) was featured on Tiger King A tiger ""nearly tore"" off the arm of a volunteer at a big cat sanctuary in Florida that featured in the Netflix series Tiger King. Candy Crouser, 69, a volunteer at Big Cat Rescue - the animal refuge made famous by Tiger King character Carole Baskin - was injured on Thursday. In a statement, the sanctuary said Ms Crouser was hurt after Kimba, a male tiger rescued from Guatemala, bit her. She broke protocols by sticking her hand into his cage, it added. Ms Crouser, who had been with the sanctuary for five years, had arrived for feeding to find that the tiger was ""locked in a section that was away from where he was usually fed"",the statement,externalsaid. After reaching inside to unlatch a door, the tiger ""grabbed her arm and nearly tore it off at the shoulder"". The statement added: ""Candy said she just wasn't thinking when she reached in to un-clip it [the door]."" The rush to make Tiger King spin-offs and sequels Tiger King star Lowe accused of animal cruelty Netflix Tiger King doc âlies to get viewersâ Bystanders used a belt as a tourniquet, and packed ice around Ms Crouser's arm in an effort to save it. Ambulance workers arrived to transport her to hospital in around 20 minutes, the statement adds. Kimba was rescued from a Guatemalan circus Ms Crouser was still conscious after the attack, ""and insisted that she did not want Kimba Tiger to come to any harm for this mistake"". The organisation added that her arm had been broken in three places and that her shoulder had been ""badly damaged"". The tiger is being kept in quarantine for 30 days as a precaution, Big Cat Rescue said, adding, ""but [he] was just acting normal due to the presence of food and the opportunity"". The incident came as the US House of Representatives passed a law 272-114 on Thursday that would ban private big cat ownership and the handling of young cubs. The Big Cat Public Safety Act was championed by Ms Baskin and Big Cat Rescue, which cited Thursday's incident as evidence for why the law must be passed. It ""confirms the inherent danger in dealing with these animals and why we need the Big Cat Public Safety Act to eliminate having them untracked in backyards around the country and ending up in sanctuaries"", the group said.

"This video can not be played Williamson: 'We are a much better country' for approving vaccine The UK is getting a coronavirus vaccine first because it is a ""much better country"" than France, Belgium and the US, says the education secretary. Some UK ministers claim Brexit speeded the process up - but Gavin Williamson said it was down to having superior medical experts. On Wednesday the UK's medical regulator was the first to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use. The EU said it was ""definitely not in the game of comparing regulators"". A source close to Mr Williamson said that his intention had been to ""praise the scientific brilliance of the regulator, but he is known to be enthusiastically patriotic and that enthusiasm clearly shone through in what was a broadly light-hearted conversation with the studio host"". The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's decision means the vaccine will start to be rolled out to the most vulnerable people from next week. People will need two doses, three weeks apart, so the vaccination project is expected to take several months to complete. Reality Check: Did Brexit speed up the UK's vaccine approval? Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week How does the Pfizer vaccine work? PM hails vaccine but warns it is 'not game over' Speaking to LBC radio on Thursday,,externalMr Williamson said: ""I just reckon we've got the very best people in this country and we've obviously got the best medical regulator, much better than the French have, much better than the Belgians have, much better than the Americans have. ""That doesn't surprise me at all, because we're a much better country than every single one of them."" This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given He said the UK had a ""real competitive advantage, but do you know who it's down to? It's down to those brilliant, brilliant clinicians in the regulator who've made it happen so fast, so our thanks go out to them because by doing what they've done, they're going to have saved lives."" But European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said the MHRA's experts are ""very good"" but ""we are definitely not in the game of comparing regulators across countries, nor on commenting on claims as to who is better"". ""This is not a football competition, we are talking about the life and health of people,"" he said. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Concern over vaccine deployment to care homes Conservative peer Lord Forsyth said it was ""disappointing to see some folk trying to make political capital out of the brilliant vaccine news"". ""Frankly it's just unseemly and we should just be united in our thanks to those responsible for this breakthrough and the hope it brings to every person on the planet,"" the former Scotland Secretary wrote in a tweet.

"Former US presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton have volunteered to have their Covid-19 vaccinations be publicly televised. The trio of two Democrats and one Republican said they would get the jab once it has been approved by regulators and recommended by US health officials. The move is intended to boost public confidence in the safety and efficacy of coronavirus vaccines. Polls indicate large swathes of the US public are reluctant to get the jab. A Gallup poll - conducted in October before the results of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials were released - showed roughly six in 10 Americans would be willing to take the vaccine, up from a low of 50% in September. No vaccination has yet been approved in the US, but government regulators will be examining Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines in the coming weeks. ""I promise you that when it's been made for people who are less at risk, I will be taking it,"" Mr Obama said in a SiriusXM radio interview on Wednesday. ""I may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed, just so that people know that I trust this science, and what I don't trust is getting Covid."" Facebook to take down false vaccine claims When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Representatives for Mr Bush and Mr Clinton told CNN that the former presidents - who have banded together in the past - pledged to take the vaccine ""as soon as available"" to them and urged all Americans to do the same. This video can not be played Not everyone is a fan of injections Public health experts have said mass inoculation against the virus could result in herd immunity, an essential step in curbing the spread of the disease. The public vaccinations may play into a broader awareness campaign once a vaccine is formally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

"Irish airline Ryanair has placed an order for 75 more Boeing 737 Max aircraft as the plane is set to return to the skies after two fatal crashes. Ryanair had already agreed to buy 135 jets. The extra planes take the list value of the order to $22bn (Â£16.3bn). The US Federal Aviation Administrationrecently certified the Boeing 737 Max for a return to serviceafter it had been grounded since March 2019. Ryanair said it would take delivery of the planes early next year. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is yet to give the Boeing 737 Max the go-ahead to return to service. EASA is in charge of re-certification for EU member states, as well as the UK. If Boeing wanted to appoint a new chief salesman, it should just call in Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary. The 737 Max, he said, was a wonderful aircraft. A game-changer. More efficient than older planes. More environmentally friendly. Passengers would love it. Except he didn't call it the 737 Max. He repeatedly referred to the ""737 8200"". A sly rebranding exercise? Not according to Mr O'Leary. The plane was brilliant, and whatever you called it, passengers would want to fly on it. Boeing's more world-weary Dave Calhoun also insisted there was no rebranding going on. And yet... his company was once heartily proud of the Max, and liked to flaunt the new name at every opportunity. Today, he was eager to downplay it as just another run-of-the-mill member of the 737 family. Boeing was forced to take the 737 Max out of service following two crashes within five months of each other, which together killed 346 people. Its clearance to fly again comes after Boeing implemented a series of modifications including updating flight control software, revising crew procedures and rerouting internal wiring. At a news conference in Washington to announce the deal, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary described the 737 Max as ""a fabulous aircraft"". Boeing's chief executive, David Calhoun, said it was ""the beginning of the fulfilment of a more robust order book"". Neither side disclosed the exact price that Ryanair will pay for the planes, but the airline will benefit from what the firms described as a ""modest"" discount on the cost. Mr Calhoun said Boeing did not expect to have to slash prices to bring back customers. ""We believe strongly in the recovery and therefore we will stay patient,"" Mr Calhoun said. ""We don't feel a need to discount our way into the marketplace."" Mick Ryan, a married father of two, died when a Boeing 737 Max crashed in Ethiopia last year News of the deal was greeted with dismay by Naoise Ryan, of Cork in Ireland, whose husband Mick Ryan died when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 - a 737 Max - crashed in March 2019. ""Ryanair's purchase of the Max is an endorsement of Boeing's disregard of safety and human life. Like Boeing, they are prepared to gamble with people's lives in order to sell cheap flights on 'bargain-binned' planes,"" she said. ""It is horrific that Boeing can once again profit from this dangerous plane while still hiding documents and have not been held to account for the deaths of 346 people. Boeing's attitude and dismissiveness should give everyone pause before ever boarding a Max.""

"This video can not be played Ch Insp Mark Runacres of Avon and Somerset Police: ""Sadly... there have been four fatalities"" Four people have died and another has been injured in a large explosion at a waste water treatment works. Firefighters were called to Wessex Water's premises in Avonmouth, Bristol, at about 11:20 GMT. Three of the people who died worked for the firm, and the other was a contractor. The injured person's condition is not life-threatening. The blast happened in a silo containing treated biosolids and was not terror related, police said. A witness reported hearing a ""very loud explosion"" that ""shook buildings"", and another said they saw about 10 ambulances driving to the scene. Police declared a major incident and are investigating the circumstances of the blast. This video can not be played Avonmouth explosion eyewitness describes the search for missing people Ch Insp Mark Runacres, from Avon and Somerset Police, said the explosion happened in a chemical tank at a water recycling centre. ""The fire service led the rescue operation but sadly, despite the best efforts of all those involved, there were four fatalities. ""This is a tragic incident and our thoughts and sympathies go out to them."" The families of those who died have been contacted. Police and paramedics were sent to the scene Luke Gazzard from Avon Fire and Rescue Service said the four people died at the scene and there was no report of a fire. He said emergency services had dealt with ""a very, very challenging incident"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet he was ""deeply saddened"" to learn of the loss of life in the explosion. ""Our hearts go out to the victims and their families. Thank you to the emergency services who attended the scene,"" he said. Colin Skellett, chief executive of Wessex Water, said the company's ""thoughts are with the families, friends and colleagues of those involved"". He said they were ""absolutely devastated that the tragic incident at our site earlier today has resulted in four fatalities"". The company is working with the Health and Safety Executive as part of the investigation. The silo holds treated biosolids before it is recycled as an organic soil conditioner, Ch Insp Runacres said. He said a ""thorough investigation involving a number of agencies"" would be carried out. ""I can reassure people living in the nearby area that there is not believed to be any ongoing public safety concerns."" Biosolids are ""treated sludge"", a by-product of the sewage treatment process. According to Wessex Water, the sludge is treated in anaerobic digesters, oxygen-free tanks, to produce agricultural fertiliser and renewable energy. People have been urged to avoid the area. An emergency services helicopter landed near the site Jawad Burhan, who took a photo appearing to show a tank that had exploded, said there was a ""helicopter looking for missing people"". ""I heard the sound, I'm working beside the building in another warehouse. ""After 10 minutes I saw the helicopter coming and the police."" Kieran Jenkins, who works nearby, said he was inside a warehouse when he heard a ""big bang"". ""The whole warehouse was shaking and we literally stood there in shock,"" he said. ""We thought everything was going to fall and we came out and all we could see was people running - it was a bit of a shock, really."" Bristol Waste, which runs the nearby Avonmouth recycling centre, tweeted it had closed the site temporarily. Lorry driver Ronan Doyle said he was parked off Kings Weston Lane about to enter the recycling plant when he heard the explosion. ""There was a quieter 'whoosh' first, followed by a much louder and more intense noise,"" he said. ""It sounded like someone had driven into the lorry - the noise was so loud it didn't sound like anything I've ever heard before and it was followed by a loud bang. ""I continued into the recycling centre and we have just locked ourselves in purely because our way out is blocked."" Sean Nolan, who witnessed the aftermath of the explosion, said he initially thought the noise was from a crash. ""I heard what I thought may have been two trucks colliding by the way it shook the ground... it was big. ""It was quite short-lived, I'd say about two or three seconds. Sort of a boom and echo and then it just went quiet. ""That was it. There was no smoke, there was no after-effects of it."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer gave his condolences on Twitter, writing: ""My thoughts are with all those who tragically lost their lives today in Avonmouth. My heart goes out to their friends and family."" Darren Jones, MP for Bristol North West, said: ""My family and I are keeping those affected in our thoughts and prayers, following the tragic consequences of the explosion in Avonmouth."" He was ""pleased that the situation has been contained and that there is no further risk to local people"". Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said: ""This has already been such a challenging year, and this news of further loss of life is another terrible blow. ""As a city we will mourn for them.""

"This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world The top US intelligence official says China is the ""greatest threat to democracy and freedom"" since World War Two. Writing in the Wall St Journal, John Ratcliffe said China was growing its power by stealing US secrets and then replacing US firms in the market. The Trump administration has taken a hard line on China, imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and accusing Beijing of intellectual property theft. China has not yet responded. However, it has responded forcefully to US moves such as the imposition of tariffs and efforts to keep the telecoms giant Huawei out of the American market. Beijing was preparing for confrontation with the US and intended to dominate the world ""economically, militarily and technologically"", Mr Ratcliffe warned. Some of Mr Ratcliffe's comments echoprevious interventions by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and FBI chief Christopher Wray. However, they also come at a time when China has stepped up pressure on US ally Australia, publishing a list of ways it wants Canberra to change its behaviour, slapping tariffs on imports of Australian wine and provoking the Australian government over its rights record in Afghanistan. Why did China really go cold turkey on Australian wine? Australia and China's new battleground: social media Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying had earlier on Wednesday accused the US of ""launching various political oppressive campaigns against China"", adding that this came ""out of strong ideological bias and a strategy to contain China"". ""There is a Chinese saying... 'the eye sees what the mind believes',""she said in her daily press conference,external. ""We hope the US will... stop regarding everyone as spies."" The Director of National Intelligence said China had replaced Russia and counter-terrorism as the main focus of US intelligence activities. China was engaged in a form of economic espionage that he described as ""rob, replicate and replace"" - giving the example of aChinese wind turbine firm that was found guilty in the US of stealing from a US competitorbefore going on to sell worldwide while the US firm lost shareholder value and fired staff. US intellectual property worth $500bn (Â£370bn) was being stolen every year, he said. FBI arrests of  Chinese nationals for stealing research had become frequent and China had also been paying the head of Harvard University's chemistry department $50,000 a month until his arrest earlier this year. This video can not be played China's UK Ambassador Liu Xiaoming: China is not the enemy of the US Mr Ratcliffe also accused Chinese intelligence services of introducing vulnerabilities into technology offered by top Chinese tech firms such as Huawei and said allies using Chinese technology would not have US intelligence shared with them. He said US intelligence showed that China had carried out ""human testing"" on troops with the aim of developing soldiers with ""biologically enhanced capabilities"". And he said China had engaged in a ""massive influence campaign"" targeting US members of Congress and their staff by encouraging unions at big firms to tell local politicians to take a softer line on China or face losing union members' votes. Beijing was targeting members of Congress with ""six times the frequency of Russia and 12 times the frequency of Iran"", Mr Ratcliffe said. The spying game: China's global network Why US-China relations have reached a low Other countries faced the same challenge from China as the US, he said. ""China believes that a global order without it at the top is a historical aberration,"" he said. ""It aims to change that and reverse the spread of liberty around the world."" Under President Trump, the US has ramped up confrontation with China in a number of areas. The two countries have imposedtariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of one another's goodsandimposed export controls on products in sensitive areas. On Thursday the White House said it had added four more Chinese firms - chipmaker SMIC, national oil firm CNOOC, China Construction Technology Co and China International Engineering Consulting Corp - to a blacklist of firms deemed to be linked to the Chinese military. Earlier this year the US ordered a Chinese consulate in Houston to close over economic espionage concerns - Beijing responded by ordering the US to close its consulate in the city of Chengdu. The two countries have alsoexpelled each others' journalists. This video can not be played Men are filmed using a hose and closing rubbish bins at China's consulate in Houston Relations between the two superpowers have also soured over the coronavirus pandemic - which Mr Trump has repeatedly referred to as the ""Chinese virus"" - and China's moves in Hong Kong. Mr Trump signed an order ending preferential US treatment for Hong Kong after Beijing imposed a controversial new security law there, which the US said ended Hong Kong's autonomy. The Hong Kong crisis and the new world order Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice The US has also accused China of ""horrific and systematic"" human rights abuses in its treatment of its Muslim Uighur minority in the Xinjiang region and has sanctioned some Chinese politicians. China is accused of mass detentions, religious persecution and forced sterilisation of Uighurs and others, but Beijing denies any mistreatment. China's hidden camps - BBC News Uighurs 'detained for beards and veils' - leak President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office in January, is expected to continue President Trump's policy of countering China, but jointly with allies, as opposed to Mr Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals. There is rare cross-party agreement on getting tough with China over trade and other issues, the BBC's White House correspondent Tara McKelvey says. How will Biden change US foreign policy? The Trump administration has been successful in winning global support for a boycott of Chinese communications technology. However, Mr Biden is likely to be more active in seeking areas of co-operation with a rising China, particularly in areas such as climate change.

"The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall visited the Soho Theatre The Prince of Wales has said he is ""praying"" more entertainment venues can reopen soon, after a theatre visit to watch an actress perform in a break from her day job in a supermarket. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall visited Soho Theatre to show their support for London's arts scene. Some venues in the capital are now reopening after the latest lockdown. The royal couple saw Natasha Marshall perform part of her play Half Breed, still wearing her Morrisons uniform. ""I've got to go back later, so it was easier to keep it on, I'll be in such a rush,"" Marshall told the prince and the duchess. ""It's such a pleasure to meet you. The theatre has supported me so much I jumped at the chance to perform today."" Natasha Marshall's play Half Breed had a run at the Soho Theatre in 2017 Prince Charles replied: ""That's marvellous, such dedication. I really enjoyed the performance and I am praying all of you can open soon. I wish you every success."" Soho Theatre is where Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge began her career, and is the setting for a series of new stand-up comedy specials on Amazon Prime. Prince Charles and Camilla also visited one of London's most famous music venues, the 100 Club, where acts like the Rolling Stones, the Sex Pistols and Oasis have performed over the years. Some gig venues and theatres are beginning to reopen for socially-distanced performances after London went into tier two following the lifting of England's lockdown on Wednesday. This video can not be played ""We're starting to come back!"" â actress Jenny Seagrove told BBC Breakfast she's excited to return to the stage One of the first West End plays to open is Love Letters starring Martin Shaw and Jenny Seagrove, which begins at the Theatre Royal Haymarket later. The two-hander had a short run in Windsor before the latest lockdown, when Seagrove said it felt ""so emotional"" to be back on stage. ""It's just so exciting because it means we're starting to come back,"" she told BBC Breakfast on Thursday. ""And not just actors and performers and directors, but the make-up girls, the hair girls, the costume people, the technicians - everybody who's just been sitting there for however many months. It feels like a lifetime."" Prince Charles and Camilla added their signatures to the 100 Club dressing room's wall Prince Charles' signature on the 100 Club wall Other West End shows opening this week include a staged concert version of Les Miserables starring Michael Ball, Alfie Boe and Carrie Hope Fletcher; and A Christmas Carol with Brian Conley, Jacqueline Jossa and a 24-piece orchestra. This weekend will also see the return of Six the Musical and the opening of Death Drop, which is described as a ""Dragatha Christie murder mystery"", starring drag artist Courtney Act. ""It's exciting. We have been rehearsing for the last couple of weeks,"" Act told the PA news agency. ""I know everybody has been locked at home but we have been being nasally penetrated twice a week and temperature checked every day in our little rehearsal bubble."" Vinegar Strokes and Courtney Act will star in Death Drop at the Garrick Theatre in London The production has faced challenges like how to portray a murder on stage while maintaining social distancing. Act said: ""Murder from 1.5m is challenging. There is a slapping scene where we ask the audience to further suspend their disbelief."" Further planned openings next week include The Play That Goes Wrong, Everybody's Talking About Jamie and Pantoland at the Palladium. Many theatres in tier two areas are also opening their festive shows, but venues in tier three areas are not allowed to open.

"Immigration Enforcement broke into a block of flats in north-west London to detain a 36-year-old British Syrian man A suspected people-smuggling gang accused of bringing hundreds of people to the UK in small boats has been broken up, the Home Office says. A 36-year-old British Syrian man was detained at his flat in north-west London on Thursday morning, bringing the total number of arrests to 14. The group is alleged to have helped more than 600 people cross the Channel in May alone. About 80% of the people they are thought to have smuggled were Syrian. Home Secretary Priti Patel, who watched the raid being carried out, said she had ""repeatedly and unapologetically"" pointed out that smuggling people by illegal means put lives at risk. ""We have seen people die this year in the Channel,"" she said. ""It is absolutely right that we do everything, we use all the tools we have from a law enforcement perspective, to go after them."" The rest of the group were arrested in raids in London and Sheffield over several months. More French patrols to target Channel crossings Home Office 'missed chance to stop migrant boats' Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? Channel crossings by migrants increased sharply from April, with more than 8,200 people making the journey in small boats so far in 2020, compared to 1,844 last year and 299 in 2018. Most claim asylum on arrival in the UK, but the overall numbers doing so have fallen in 2020 as the pandemic has meant other routes - by road and air - have been less accessible. Campaigners say asylum seekers - most of whom have fled places such as Iran, Iraq and Syria before making the Channel crossing - have no choice but to enter the UK illegally, as it is not possible to apply for asylum outside the country and there are no safe and legal routes. Priti Patel said French authorities were successfully preventing crossings in small boats The home secretary praised the French authorities for taking stronger action to prevent boats from departing, saying that on one day when 20 people made it across, more than 200 had been stopped from leaving the beaches of Normandy. These interventions have contributed to a 65% fall in the number of crossings on days when the sea is calm, the Home Office said. The number of crossings peaked at 1,868 for the month of September. ""They have actually been going into the waters to stop boats from listing and sinking to save lives and it's absolutely the right thing to do,"" Ms Patel said. ""These routes are dangerous. Lives have been put at risk."" Both the French and UK governments were committed to making this route ""unviable"", she said. ""We want to cut this route completely and we will stop at nothing to try and do that."" She said people should seek asylum in the first safe country they can get to, adding that ""European member states are safe countries"". At the raid attended by the home secretary and the media, one 36-year-old man was arrested Under a new agreement with France which began at the weekend, the UK is paying Â£28m towards doubling the number of police officers on beaches and on surveillance technology such as drones, radar and cameras. Ms Patel said when the Brexit transition period ends in January, the UK government will negotiate agreements with individual EU countries such as France to return people who could have claimed asylum earlier in their journeys through Europe. ""We will start negotiating bilaterally, country by country, and we are already making that very, very clear to EU member states. Bilateral relations matter,"" she said. Existing agreements on returning asylum seekers will expire with the Brexit transition period and negotiations with the EU have so far failed to produce an agreement.

"Madeleine McCann was three when she went missing in 2007 Scotland Yard is still treating Madeleine McCann as a missing person, the Met Commissioner has said, despite the belief of German prosecutors that she is dead. Dame Cressida Dick said the force was working with German investigators but had not seen all of their evidence. Madeleine disappeared in 2007 aged three on holiday in Portugal. Prosecutors previously said they have evidence a German child sex offender named as Christian B killed her. But although Christian B, 43, was identified as a suspect in June, prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said the evidence is not strong enough to charge him. Suspects' surnames are not usually revealed in Germany for privacy reasons. Who is the German suspect? The Madeleine McCann case: A timeline Dame Cressida said that the Met's position had not changed since the summer, when the force said its investigation - Operation Grange - remained a missing person inquiry as there is no ""definitive evidence whether Madeleine is alive or dead"". She said a small team of Met Police investigators continued to work ""very closely"" with police in Germany and Portugal. ""We will continue until the time that it is right, either because much more light has been thrown on this or somebody has been brought to justice,"" she said. ""Or if we feel we have exhausted all possible opportunities. We're not at any of those stages at the moment, and the team continues."" Despite the close co-operation, she said she did not expect ""every single piece of material to be shared with us"". ""I'm sure they're sharing the relevant things at the relevant times with us,"" Dame Cressida said. Madeleine, from Rothley in Leicestershire, went missing from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, on 3 May 2007, shortly before her fourth birthday. Official records show Christian B has 17 previous convictions, including for rape and sexual abuse of children Christian B is currently serving a prison sentence for drug offences in Germany and lost an appeal last month against a further seven-year sentence for rape. He attacked a 72-year-old American woman in 2005 in the same area from where Madeleine disappeared about 18 months later. Police believe he was regularly living in this part of Portugal between 1997 and 2007, staying in a camper van at the time he is suspected of abducting Madeleine.

We had 2000 but they were loud and they were supportive to the team so thanks to them for coming and making the effort.  The boys wanted it I could see from the start they wanted it, they were hurt from previous game they showed the attitude and desire that is required.  We were aggressive, we wanted to put the ball in the box we created chances.  Now we have another one on Sunday."" On replicating performance in Premier League:""The aggressiveness is always there but the margins in the Premier League are so much smaller, when you make a mistake you pay the price.  We haven't been as ruthless in the final third in the Premier League as we have in Europe, but I liked the reaction of the team and the performance today. ""Many of them I am delighted with, the injured players who been out for so long they worked so hard we are so glad to have them back, to add numbers to the squad.  [Alexandre] Lacazaette it was great to have him on the score sheet, some really good individual performances and some of the good from the young boys as well.

Arsenal 4-1 Rapid Vienna Arsenal scored 3+ goals in four consecutive
European games for the first time since March 2000, on their way to the Uefa Cup final that season. LASK 3-3 Tottenham Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho, asked what he learnt from his side tonight, said:""Nothing new
really. The fact that the Europa League group phase doesn't motivate some of the
players, I knew it. ""That some players are fundamental for us and I always need on the pitch in
any circumstance, a couple of these players to give a little bit of balance to
the team. ""As an example, (Pierre-Emile) Hojbjerg and Sonny, without them I don't think
we would have a positive result. Nothing really that I learn. The players know
and I share my feelings with them, I am normally right. ""When I saw the warm-up before the game I had a feeling and I told the players
before the game that there was a huge difference in intensity, communication and
enthusiasm in their warm-up and our warm-up because I was looking at both.
Nothing surprises me."" As good as Arsenal were tonight, the key question is whether they can take that attacking display into the Premier League. There will be no better time than against Tottenham on Sunday. Speaking of Spurs, they were below par tonight and their manager Jose Mourinho wasn't happy... Rangers 3-2 Standard Liege Good news from elsewhere because Rangers have beaten Standard Liege and they are through to the last 32. Follow all the reaction here. Arsenal 4-1 Rapid Vienna I didn't clock anyone sneaking off for an early getaway from the stands. Instead they are all sticking around to applaud the players, who are in turn walking around pitch applauding them. Mikel Arteta has joined them too. Great to see. Arsenal 4-1 Rapid Vienna All over. A very successful night for Arsenal, who scored four goals and could have had many more. The fans in attendance will certainly have been entertained. Arsenal 4-1 Rapid Vienna Oh I could easily overhype Emile Smith Rowe, Dom. A really, really exciting player who is destined for a great career if he can stay free of injury. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Adam Salter:Arsenal look like scoring every time they come forward. The fact that they havenât is the only disappointment tonight. I'm really glad Emile Smith-Rowe hasn't been overhyped in the way we've seen some youngsters over the years. Hopefully he can keep growing and flourish before he's ready to step into the spotlight for real Dom in Cornwall Arsenal 4-1 Rapid Vienna Willian has a go from distance but the shot skips just wide of the far post. Worth a go. The 90 minutes are up and there will be three minutes of added time. Arsenal 4-1 Rapid Vienna Arsenal have had 12 corners tonight with four of them coming in pretty much the last four minutes. They are pinging balls into the box for fun at the moment. Arsenal 4-1 Rapid Vienna Four minutes remaining but there's no let up from Arsenal, which is good to see. They win a succession of corners before Pablo Mari loops a header into Richard Strebinger's hands. Arsenal 4-1 Rapid Vienna Willians corner goes right through the area but no-one in a blue shirt is able to turn in. Arsenal pick the ball up again and Pablo MarÃ­ tries his luck for a second of the game but this time fires wide.

Arsenal 4-1 Rapid Vienna Richard Strebinger denies Arsenal a fifth as he pushes over a well-hit Dani Ceballos free-kick.

"The vaccine is made in Belgium and has to be stored at around -70C The first consignment of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has arrived in the UK. It has been taken to a central hub at an undisclosed location, and will now be distributed to hospital vaccination centres around the UK. The UK has ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. England's deputy chief medical officer said the first wave of vaccinations could prevent up to 99% of Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths. Speaking to BBC News, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said that would be possible if everyone on the first priority list took the vaccine and it was highly effective. He said it was key to distribute the vaccine ""as fast"" and at the ""highest volume"" as possible, but he acknowledged there would need to be some flexibility in the list. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are made in Belgium and have travelled to the UK via the Eurotunnel. Who will get the Covid vaccine first? What are the safety checks for vaccines? Listen again: Prof Van-Tam answers your questions The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and decided by the government. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff. However, because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at the necessary -70C, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - to lower the risk of wasting doses. Prof Van-Tam told BBC News: ""If we can get through phase one [of the priority list] and it is a highly effective vaccine and there is very, very high up take, then we could in theory take out 99% of hospitalisations and deaths related to Covid 19. ""That is why the phase one list is what it is, that is the primary ambition."" This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? The UK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, hasapologised for remarks that seemed to criticise the UK's vaccine approval process. He initially told Fox News: ""The UK did not do it as carefully. If you go quickly and you do it superficially, people are not going to want to get vaccinated."" But the UK defended its process, and said the jab is safe and effective. And speaking later to the BBC, Dr Fauci said: ""There really has been a misunderstanding, and for that I'm sorry, and I apologise for that. ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint. ""Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK. And that's just the reality. I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way."" The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The UK's 40 million doses will be distributed as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, with the first load rolled out next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. But the bulk of the roll-out across the UK will be next year. And it could take until April for all those deemed most at-risk to receive the new vaccine, according to NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:What tests are available? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Two other ways of measuring deaths - where Covid is mentioned on the death certificate, and the number of ""excess deaths"" for this time of year - give higher total figures. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more deaths than the UK, according to Johns Hopkins University. However, the UK has had more deaths per 100,000 people than any of those nations. In terms of deaths per 100,000 people, the UK is the seventh-highest country globally, behind Belgium, San Marino, Peru, Andorra, Spain and Italy.

"This video can not be played Dr Fauci told the BBC: ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint"" Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, has apologised for remarks that seemed to criticise the UK's vaccine approval process. ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint,"" Dr Fauci told the BBC on Thursday. The UK on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine for the coronavirus. It has defended the rapid approval and said the jab is safe and effective. Dr Fauci on Wednesday had told Fox News that the UK did not review the vaccine ""as carefully"" as US health regulators, although he implied that the US would quickly also be in a position to approve a vaccine. ""We'll be there. We'll be there very soon,"" he added. He later told CBS News that the UK had ""rushed"" the approval, but on Thursday he walked back the comments, and said there was  ""no judgement on the way the UK did it"". ""Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK. And that's just the reality,"" Dr Fauci told the BBC. ""I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way."" The UK medicines regulator - MHRA - said it had ""rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review"" - adding that it reviewed preliminary data on the vaccine trials dating back to June and had been running a ""rolling review"" since October which helped speed the process. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? The regulator said that Covid vaccines were being developed ""in a coordinated in a way that allows some stages of this process to happen in parallel to condense the time needed"" adding that it did not mean that ""the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness"" had been bypassed. ""Any vaccine must undergo robust clinical trials in line with international standards, with oversight provided by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,"" it said. ""No vaccine would be authorised for supply in the UK unless the expected standards of safety, quality and efficacy are met,"" the MHRA added. Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week On Thursday, the UK's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC he was ""very confident"" in the MHRA. He said there was more than ""100 years of medical experience"" between the UK regulator and the committee advising which groups of people are vaccinated first. Dr Fauci's remarks came as the US surpassed 14 million Covid-19 infections in total, with a recorded 276,325 deaths. A woman waits for a Covid-19 test in California, as cases mount across the US Analysis by Naomi Grimley, BBC health correspondent America's Food and Drug Administration does have a different approach to other regulators around the world - it often asks vaccine makers for their raw data, which it then spends time re-analysing. The UK's medicines regulator in London, on the other hand, relies more heavily on the companies' own reports as does the European Medicines Agency, based in Amsterdam. Politics may also explain why the FDA hasn't yet given the green light. Back in October, President Trump pressured health officials to approve the first vaccine candidates before election day on 3 November but they pushed back, fearing it might become a political football. The FDA said it wanted to see two months' extra safety data from the final phase vaccine trials before pharmaceutical companies could apply for emergency approval. That has inevitably left some arguing the US has got bogged down in a much more detailed review than might have been necessary. The head of the European Medicines Agency also appeared to raise eyebrows yesterday at the truncated timetable in London. But officials in the UK believe the US and EU are likely to approve the vaccine soon. The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, andthe first consignment of that vaccine has now arrived. It has been taken to a central hub at an undisclosed location, and will now be distributed to hospital vaccination centres around the UK. England's deputy chief medical officer said the first wave of vaccinations could prevent up to 99% of Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths. Did Brexit speed up the UK's vaccine approval? What does UK vaccine approval mean for US? Are countries under pressure to approve a vaccine? This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" The US FDA plans to meet on 10 December to discuss approval for the UK-approved vaccine, and will meet again on 17 December to discuss a second vaccine - Moderna. Dr Fauci had described the US Food and Drug Administration's approval process, slower than the UK, as the ""gold standard"". On Thursday he clarified, saying the US does ""things a little differently"" than the UK. ""That's all,"" he said. ""Not better, not worse, just differently."" An independent UK expert on the use and effects of drugs in populations - Prof Stephen Evans of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the approvals processes carried out by the FDA and the MHRA were ""basically very similar"". ""The only major difference is that the FDA may reproduce all the tables submitted by a company by re-analysing the data,"" he said. ""It is very clear that the UK assessment of this has followed all the usual processes, but has been working incredibly long hours and seven days a week both with MHRA staff and with their academic advisors for quite a long time on initial and interim data before the final data were submitted."" Dr Fauci has led the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH) for more than 30 years - covering five presidential transitions - and has become the most visible member of the White House's coronavirus task force. The EU, meanwhile, is eyeing a 29 December meeting of the European Medicines Agency to determine if there is adequate safety data on the vaccine for it to be approved in Europe. This timeline puts the EU weeks behind both the UK and US. After the agency approves the vaccine, it will probably also need a sign-off from the EU Commission.

"All non-essential retail has been closed since last Friday Non-essential retail and some parts of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland can reopen next Friday, the Stormont executive has agreed.

"Former US presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton have volunteered to have their Covid-19 vaccinations be publicly televised. The trio of two Democrats and one Republican said they would get the jab once it has been approved by regulators and recommended by US health officials. The move is intended to boost public confidence in the safety and efficacy of coronavirus vaccines. Polls indicate large swathes of the US public are reluctant to get the jab. A Gallup poll - conducted in October before the results of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials were released - showed roughly six in 10 Americans would be willing to take the vaccine, up from a low of 50% in September. No vaccination has yet been approved in the US, but government regulators will be examining Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines in the coming weeks. ""I promise you that when it's been made for people who are less at risk, I will be taking it,"" Mr Obama said in a SiriusXM radio interview on Wednesday. ""I may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed, just so that people know that I trust this science, and what I don't trust is getting Covid."" Facebook to take down false vaccine claims When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Representatives for Mr Bush and Mr Clinton told CNN that the former presidents - who have banded together in the past - pledged to take the vaccine ""as soon as available"" to them and urged all Americans to do the same. This video can not be played Not everyone is a fan of injections Public health experts have said mass inoculation against the virus could result in herd immunity, an essential step in curbing the spread of the disease. The public vaccinations may play into a broader awareness campaign once a vaccine is formally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In the UK - where the Pfizer vaccine has already been approved - the press secretary to Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested he may take the vaccine live on TV to convince others to get it too.

"This video can not be played Watch the moment Ranjitsinh Disale found out he'd been named the world's most exceptional teacher A teacher from a village school in India, praised for improving the education of girls, has won this year's Global Teacher Prize. But Ranjitsinh Disale has already given away half of the $1m (Â£750,000) - sharing it with runners-up in the competition. A special Covid Hero prize was won by Jamie Frost, a UK teacher who ran a free maths tuition website. The winners were announced by Stephen Fry in an online ceremony. Mr Disale, who teaches in the Zilla Parishad Primary School, in the drought-prone village of Paritewadi, in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, was named the world's most exceptional teacher, ahead of 12,000 other nominations. ""In this hard time, teachers are giving their best to make sure every student has access to their birthright of a good education,"" said Mr Disale, aged 32. The prize was announced online by Stephen Fry Teachers ""always believe in giving and sharing"", he said, and as such was sharing half his prize money among the other teachers shortlisted in the top 10. Mr Disale was praised by the competition's judges for his work to ensure disadvantaged girls went to school and achieved high results - rather than missing out on school and facing early marriage. He also provides online science lessons for pupils in 83 countries and runs an international project building connections between young people in conflict zones. The Indian teacher runs a project to bring people together across conflict zones ""The Covid pandemic has dealt a severe blow to education systems around the worldâ¦ but it is the contribution of teachers during these difficult times that is making the difference,"" said Stefania Giannini, assistant director general of Unesco, a partner in the competition. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey Foundation that set up the teachers' competition, said ""by sharing the prize you teach the world the importance of giving"". Mr Disale's decision to split the prize will mean over Â£40,000 each for runners-up from countries including Italy, Brazil, Vietnam, Malaysia, Nigeria, South Africa, South Korea, the US and also Jamie Frost from the UK. Jamie Frost's maths website helped pupils studying at home in the lockdown Mr Frost, a teacher from Tiffin School in Kingston-upon-Thames, was commended for his work running the DrFrostMaths online learning platform, which helped families with children trying to study from home during the lockdowns. He also won a special one-off Covid Hero prize worth about Â£34,000. The maths teacher warned that the pandemic had widened educational inequalities. ""That is why I have spent every hour I could adapting my free online learning platform to help students across the globe shut out of their classrooms,"" said Mr Frost. Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the ""creativity and ingenuity"" of Mr Frost and the winning teachers. ""Although I'm speaking to you in difficult and sometimes heartbreaking circumstances, it's right that we take time to recognise the enormous contribution and sacrifice of the world's teachers during this pandemic,"" said Mr Johnson. Next year there will also be a prize for students, run with the US educational technology firm, Chegg.

"Shoppers at Topshop and other Arcadia brands will only be able to use gift cards for half of their order, the embattled company has said. Arcadia collapsed into administration on Monday and shoppers have been unable to use gift cards online since. The company and its administrators said the card shutdown was a temporary technical issue which would be resolved by early next week. But they said the cards would only be valid for 50% of a purchase. That means, for example, only Â£25 in card value could be redeemed on a Â£50 order, or someone wanting to use the whole of their Â£10 gift card would need to spend Â£20 in total. The rule is now in place in stores, where gift cards can be used. Administrators for the business are not obliged to accept gift cards but, with stores and websites still trading, many shoppers hoped and expected that they would still be able to use them. Abi Vedder says she will have to spend a lot Abi Vedder, 39, from London, received a gift of Â£100 to spend in Topshop vouchers when she left her job as a social worker two weeks ago. ""Social workers are not rich and it is infuriating that all my colleagues' money may be wasted, as I would now need to buy something worth Â£200 to claim the voucher, which I'm not sure I can,"" she said. ""I'm worried I won't be able to get anything to remember my job by now, because I left during this ridiculous year."" A spokesman for Arcadia's administrators, Deloitte, said: ""The full value of a gift card can be put towards up to 50% of a purchase. ""Gift cards are currently being accepted in all stores and customers will be able to use them online from early next week. There is currently maintenance on the site impacting the use of gift cards. This should be fixed by early next week."" Topshop owner Arcadia goes into administration Currys PC World apologises after gift cards wiped The company told shoppers: ""Gift cards have been temporarily switched off until further notice. I can confirm you are still able to use gift cards in store, you will only be able to apply 50% of the gift card to your purchase. ""Apologies for the inconvenience that has been caused.""

The Arcadia group runs 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, and includes the Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, and Burton brands. The administration will give Arcadia breathing space from creditors, such as landlords for its shops or clothing suppliers, while a buyer is sought for all or parts of the company. Arcadia executives will still hold day-to-day control over the business. However, the jobs of the company's 13,000 employees are at risk. If no buyer is found and the company folds, then gift cards are likely to be worthless as cardholders would be near the back of a queue of creditors with claims for a payout from any remaining assets that are sold. Debenhams, which said on Tuesday thatit expected to close its doors after the failure to find a buyer for the business, said it was still accepting payment by gift card, but it had not sold any new ones for many months. Earlier this week, Currys PC World apologised aftera website glitch wiped hundreds of pounds off gift cardsand left Black Friday bargain hunters without their shopping.

"The number of people in hospital with coronavirus has more than doubled since early November Record-high Covid infections and hospitalisations have been reported in the US, with fears they will not slow in the run-up to Christmas. The number of people in hospital passed 100,000 for the first time, a figure that has doubled since early November. New cases rose by a record 195,695 on Wednesday, and the daily death toll of 2,733 was close to a new high. The city of Los Angeles has reacted to an unprecedented surge there by ordering residents to stay at home. Nationwide, infections have now surpassed 14 million, with more than 274,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Figures have continued to soar in recent weeks,with around a million new infections reported every week in November.,external- equivalent to 99 every minute. In response to surging numbers, US authorities have warned that the country's healthcare system faces an unprecedented strain this winter. Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? What does UK vaccine approval mean for US? This video can not be played âNo end in sightâ: One day inside a rural North Dakota hospital's Covid fight ""The reality is that December, January and February are going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation,"" said Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). California, Texas and Florida - the three most populous US states - are among the worst-affected areas of the country, and have each registered more than one million cases. California Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday issued a stay-at-home order for much of his state, saying he was pulling an ""emergency brake"" as the virus surge threatens to overwhelm hospitals. Regions with less than 15% intensive care capacity - including Southern California and the Sacramento area - will be on lockdown for at least three weeks. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has issued a stay-at-home order due to rising infections In the city of Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti issuedan emergency order,externalfor residents to stay home with immediate affect, following an unprecedented surge of infections. ""It's time to cancel everything. If it isn't essential, don't do it,"" Mr Garcetti said. A similar order is already in place in Los Angeles county - the current epicentre of America's outbreak - where some hospitals are already approaching full capacity. Authorities reported 5,987 cases on Tuesday, bringing the county's total to 414,185. US officials have said they expect infection numbers to continue rising over the next few days because many people travelled over the Thanksgiving holiday, ignoring government advice.""Travel volume was high over Thanksgiving,"" said Cindy Friedman, chief of the travellers' health branch at the CDC. ""Even if only a small percentage of those people were carrying the disease and passed it on to other people, that can translate into hundreds of thousands of additional infections."" The CDC has urged people to refrain from travel over Christmas. But the public health body has also relaxed its guidelines for how long people should quarantine after coming into contact with an infected person - shortening it from 14 days to between seven and 10. Although the number of deaths is still rising, one set of brighter figures is that of deaths in relation to infections. The CDC says the share of cases resulting in death fell from 6.7% in April to 1.9% in September, reflecting that health workers are now more successful in treating the disease. US regulators will discuss approvals for two coronavirus vaccines this month US regulators are expected to meet on 10 December to discuss emergency approval for a vaccine developed by Moderna. They will meet again on 17 December to address another one made by Pfizer,which was approved this week in the UK. Federal officials at the CDC have agreed that the nation's 21 million healthcare workers should be prioritised, as well the three million elderly Americans living in long-term care homes. But there is less consensus on how states should distribute it to other groups. This video can not be played Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world. There are also concerns regarding how many Americans are willing to get vaccinated. A recent Gallup poll found that 58% said they would be willing, although this is up from a low of 50% in September.

"This video can not be played Lord Maginnis is not going to take part in âbehaviour training"" after using âhomophobic and offensive"" language Lord Maginnis of Drumglass should be suspended from the Lords for at least 18 months over bullying and harassment claims, a standards watchdog has said. The independent Ulster Unionist broke the rules in his conduct towards four people and used ""homophobic and offensive"" language, it was found. The Lords Conduct Committee ordered the ex-MP and soldier to take ""behaviour training"" or face a longer ban. But he told the BBC he would refuse to do so. Asked if that would mean a greater punishment, he said: ""So be it."" Lord Maginnis denied bullying and harassment and called the committee's report ""ridiculous"", adding that he was the victim of a campaign against him, involving the LGBT rights charity Stonewall. But Stonewall said he should ""step up and accept responsibility for his behaviour and apologise to those he has hurt"". Defending his stance, Lord Maginnis told BBC Radio Ulster: ""I've held responsible positions all my life,. ""At 83 years of age, I'm not going to be dictated to in this way."" Lord Maginnis accused of verbal abuse in Parliament Complaints against Lord Maginnis were made by Parliamentary security officer Christian Bombolo, SNP MP Hannah Bardell and Labour MPs Luke Pollard and Toby Perkins. He was accused of verbally abusing Mr Bombolo when asked to show his security pass in January, with Ms Bardell saying he became rude and aggressive when she intervened. Ms Bardell later told the House of Commons it was ""one of the worst cases of abuse of security staff"" she had witnessed. At the time, The Huffington Post website quoted Lord Maginnis as saying in response: ""Queers like Ms Bardell don't particularly annoy me."" It was also claimed that, in February, he sent an email about other parliamentarians containing a homophobic subject line. And he was accused of making homophobic remarks about Ms Bardell and Mr Pollard at a breakfast meeting hosted by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Armed Forces in March. The Lords Commissioner for Standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrief, who carried out an investigation into Lord Maginnis, previously recommended a ban of nine months. He appealed against this, but the committee found he had shown ""very little insight into the impact of his behaviour on the complainants, and no remorse for the upset he had caused"". Instead, it added, he had ""portrayed himself as a victim of a conspiracyâ¦ and continued to refer to the complainants in a disobliging and sometimes offensive manner"". Following the publication ofthe report,external, Ms Bardell told BBC Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie that she had received death threats after speaking in the Commons about Lord Maginnis's behaviour. She added that it was ""total nonsense"" to suggest she was behind a ""conspiracy"" against the peer. Ms Bardell also said she was ""disappointed"" by the recommendation of a ban for Lord Maginnis and that ""in any normal workplace anywhere in the UK, this would be a sackable offence"". Lord Maginnis, who was the Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone from 1983 to 2001 having previously served in the Ulster Defence Regiment, became a life peer in 2001. The House of Lords will decide on 7 December whether to bring the recommended ban into force.

"The UK becomes first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths, according to official figures Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than UK England's deputy chief medical officer hails Pfizer vaccine approval but says ""we have to take it really carefully"" Education secretary says UK got vaccine first because it is a ""better country"" than France, Belgium and US Moscow announces start of immunisation programme on Saturday, using Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine US has record number of new daily cases - almost 200,000 - as hospitalisations double since early November Facebook to take down false vaccine claims to prevent ""imminent physical harm"" International vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, IBM says Edited by Paul Gribben and Robert Greenall As our live page draws to a close, here is a round-up of the main coronavirus news today.   Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italy responded to a recent surge in cases with a new round of restrictions It was a milestone Italians knew would be a matter of time before they hit: the day when the country would exceed the highest death toll of the first
wave â 969 on 27 March. And now itâs happened. With 993 deaths
recorded in the past 24 hours, Italy has had its deadliest day of the pandemic.
The numbers are hard to fathom. The chink of light is that the infection rate is gradually
decreasing. While cases remain high âabove 23,000 today â the rate of positive
results to number of tests has decreased in the past week from 12.4% to 10.2%.
The curve is flattening. But as in the first wave, it takes time for the death
toll to catch up, since many of todayâs fatalities were infected around the
peak of the second wave in early November. After grim figures, Italians are bracing themselves for a
less-than-happy Christmas with tightened restrictions. Theyâll be banned from
moving between regions, forced to self-isolate if they come into the country
from abroad, ordered to obey night-time curfews around Christmas Day and New
Year and told only to celebrate Christmas lunch with close family. This country
has been devastated by the first and now the second wave. It fears a third.  The US Supreme Court has ordered a lower court to reconsider a challenge to pandemic-related restrictions on religious services in California. The ruling sided with a church that had challenged the policy as unconstitutional religious discrimination, throwing out a lower court  ruling rejecting their case. The Harvest Rock Church and Harvest International Ministry has more than 160 churches in the state, according to AP news agency. California Governor Gavin Newsom has put heavy restrictions on religious services amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Under the current rules, houses of worship in the stateâs worst-hit areas cannot hold indoor gatherings. Elsewhere, there are restrictions on capacity. The ruling on Thursday came after the Supreme Court last week barred New York from enforcing certain limits on attendance at churches and synagogues. Quarantine rules are set to be eased for business travellers in England, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. From 04:00 GMT on Saturday, 5 December, the following people will no longer need to self-isolate when returning to England from a country not in a travel corridor:  For business travellers, their trips must result in a deal which creates or preserves 50 jobs or leads to a Â£100,000 investment or order, according to the Department for Transport. Read more on this story here Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were joined at Soho Theatre by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have been visiting entertainment venues in Soho, London, today to find out how the arts and entertainment sector has been coping during the pandemic. The couple were treated to an intimate performance at Soho Theatre - of the one-woman play Half Breed by Natasha Marshall. The actress revealed she had to dash from her Morrisons supermarket job to do the gig in front of the royals and was still wearing her uniform. She told the prince and his wife: ""I've got to go back later so it was easier to keep it on, I'll be in such a rush. ""The theatre has supported me so much I jumped at the chance to perform today."" Charles replied: ""That's marvellous, such dedication. I really enjoyed the performance and I am praying all of you can open soon."" Many entertainment venues are battling to stay in business because of the restrictions Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics So far, wave two has been lower
and slower than wave one. About 80% of deaths involving
coronavirus happened before August, and most of those happened in just one
month. Almost 10,000 coronavirus
deaths a week were registered in consecutive weeks in April. In this second wave, it looks
like the peak figures â assuming infections keep falling before widespread
vaccination takes place â might be closer to 3,000 than 4,000. And, as in wave one, those over
75 account for about 75% of the deaths, suggesting that vaccinating over-75s
could stem the vast majority of future deaths. This time around, the spread
of deaths around the country has looked quite different. In the spring and summer,
London and the North West of England each accounted for about 15% of
coronavirus deaths in the UK. But in this wave, Londonâs
share is down, closer to 5% whereas the North West is just under 25%. As the UK becomes the first European country to record a death toll of over 60,000, the daily reported deaths remain high at an average of 441 over the last 7 days. But confirmed cases show a marked fall following England's nationwide lockdown and stricter measures elsewhere in the UK. It also seems to have had an impact on daily hospital admissions, which have fallen to an average of 1,395 a day in the seven days up to 26 November, from a high of 1765 a day on 11 November. Dr Anthony Fauci was challenged over the vaccine's earlier availability in the UK UK ministers have been making their quick approval of the Pfizer vaccine a point of national pride, with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson facing criticism for claiming the speed was due to the UK being a ""much better country"" than European rivals. But the top US infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, hasaccused the UK of being less rigorous in its approval process. ""The UK did not do it as carefully,"" he told Fox News. ""If you go quickly and you do it superficially, people are not going to want to get vaccinated."" Fauci was facing criticism that the US was behind the UK in receiving the vaccine, but said there was only a difference of ""a couple of days"" and promised that US approval would come ""very soon"". He did not detail any specific issues with the UK approvals process. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, responsible for approving the vaccine, said it had accelerated the process by conducting a rolling review of Pfizer's data, starting at the beginning of October. ""We have rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review,â the agency said. Portugal's health minister has said that the country's citizens will receive Covid-19 vaccines for free via the public health service. Marta Temido
said 22 million doses would be bought for â¬200m. Vaccinations will start in January and nearly a million people will be given shots in the first phase. The country has six agreements for vaccines, including with AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, according to drugs regulator Infarmed. Earlier officials said the country had passed the peak of the ""second wave"" of the virus, which occurred between 12 and 15 November. Restrictions introduced last month include mandatory remote working and
a nightly curfew for the vast majority of the population, and a weekend
curfew in areas deemed to be at very high or extremely high risk, including
Lisbon and Porto. Portugal has had a total of 303,846 confirmed coronavirus cases since the
start of the epidemic and 4,645 deaths associated with Covid-19. The UK government's coronavirus figures suggest that for three months the average number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test was fewer than 50 deaths per day. But, as we have reported, on Monday the number of people who have died has increased to a total of 60,113 - up 414 in the past 24 hours. There have been a further 14,879 cases, as daily cases continue on a downward trend. As the latest government figures have confirmed, more than 60,000 people in
the UK have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. According to data from John Hopkins University,external, only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK. The UK government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest therehave been more than 69,000 deaths by this measure,external. The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland - which measure excess deaths - show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. The UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths,according to the latest government figures,external. A total of 60,113 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 414 in the past 24 hours. Two other ways of measuring deaths - where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate, and the number of ""excess deaths"" for this time of year - give higher total figures. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK,according to data from Johns Hopkins University,external. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics In
the week to 29 November, 87% of the nearly 90,000 beds in English hospitals
were occupied. This
is largely unchanged since the first week of November, when NHS England first
published these figures. The
NHS is meant to keep at least a 10th of its beds free to create flexibility to
admit patients and cope with surges in demand. But
a single number doesnât tell the full story. It
doesnât include the Nightingale hospitals that provide extra capacity, or the
beds that have been freed by cancelling operations. Or
that the pressures arenât evenly spread. Some
hospitals like North Middlesex, Southport & Ormskirk, Surrey &
Sussex, and Wrightington, Wigan & Leigh have more than 95% of beds taken. More
hospitals have seen capacity free up this month than have seen it tighten. But
as we move into the months that, in any year, put the most stress on capacity
within the NHS, all eyes will be on these figures. BBC World News This video can not be played Coronavirus: Normality is 'years away' despite vaccines A complete return to normal life after the coronavirus pandemic is years away, Prof Dale Fisher, chairman of the World Health Organisation's global outbreak and response network has said. He told BBC World News: ""I think over the next year or two things will loosen up quite a lot. I think we will eventually get back to normal but will that take three years or 10 years, I don't know."" He said there were a number of challenges ahead with the distribution of vaccines, including encouraging people to have them and not get complacent about the risks from the virus as time went on. Prof Fisher was speaking to Lucy Hocking. Care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the Covid vaccine from 14 December, the Scottish health secretary has confirmed. There had been concerns about getting doses to care homes because of issues with transporting small doses. But Jeanne Freeman said some of those issues had been addressed, making it possible to take the vaccine to homes. The first batches of the vaccine, which arrive in Scotland on Tuesday, will be given to health staff. Read morehere. Nick BeakeBrussels Correspondent, BBC News An exasperated sigh sums up
the reaction from a number of European
capitals to the vaccine victory
proclamations of some British government ministers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonâs sweeping
assessment that the UK is a âbetterâ country than many of its allies was seen
as particularly bold. One senior diplomat told me
he was delighted Britons would soon be receiving the vaccine, but that âsomeone
should remind Mr Williamson that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was created by a
German company, founded by scientists of Turkish origin, in partnership with
an American distributor, and is being manufactured in Belgium before being
transported across France to reach the UKâ. The claim that Brexit allowed the UK to approve the vaccine faster than other Europe countries has been disproved, but it does reflect once again a different path the UK is taking. All EU countries have the option to follow the UK example and let their domestic
drug regulator issue emergency approval, but the bloc says it wants to wait for
the European Medicines Agency to give the green light on all their behalf. But if the
Europe-wide delivery of a vaccine which promises to end the coronavirus misery
for millions is pushed back, there will likely be more voices asking: âWhy canât
we have what the Brits have already got?â.  We have more on the latest figures in the US where there have been a record number of cases. As we mentioned earlier, new cases rose by a record 195,695 on Wednesday. These graphs show the extent of the problem faced by health services there.  The number of people in hospital passed 100,000 for the first time, a figure that has doubled since early November, Covid Tracking Project data showed.  And deaths have risen quickly in recent weeks too - the daily death toll of 2,733 was close to a new high.  Nationwide, infections are now closing in on 14 million, with more than 264,000 deaths, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. Asda has become the latest supermarket to return business rates relief it has received from the UK government during the pandemic, announcing it will repay Â£340m. It follows similar moves by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi and means the grocers will collectively return more than Â£1.7bn. Supermarkets had been allowed to stay open during the lockdown while non-essential shops had to close. Asda said its costs in dealing with Covid had outweighed any state support. But its president and chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: ""As the hope of a vaccine and a more 'normal' life returning in 2021 grows, we have confidence that we are in a strong position to again do the right thing for the communities we serve."" Earlier, England's deputy chief medical officer answered questions from members of the public about Covid-19, including on vaccine safety and effectiveness, in a live BBC News special. Here are some of the highlights, from giving vaccine advice to his mum,  rolling out another football analogy and Father Christmas' position on the vaccine priority list.

"In Wales people are still out and about shopping, but what is happening over the border? It's the run up to a Christmas like no other and we are all trying to figure out what we can and cannot do to get ready, while keeping others safe. Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafeswill be banned from serving alcoholic drink apart from takeaways from Fridayand will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT in a bid to curb a rise in coronavirus cases. People in Wales will be able totravel to parts of Englandfrom Friday. So what do England's tiers mean for those living and working in Wales? Yes. In a word. There will be restrictions but as cross-border travel rules are relaxed on Friday from 18:00, you can go toplaces in tiers one and two,external- but not to areas under the strictest measures in tier three. Travel allowed between Wales and parts of England Wales 'must act now' to curb Covid spread What do the new rules mean for pubs in Wales? Shops allowed to open 24-hours a day over Christmas It means travel to places like London, Liverpool, Chester, Cheltenham and Bath will be possible within the new rules - which start at 18:00 on Friday - but not to Manchester, Birmingham or Bristol. There are caveats, though. While pubs intwo of England's three 'tiers'can now open - and every English county that borders Wales is in tier two - youcan only buy alcohol as part of a ""substantial meal"". One cabinet minister did say drinkers in those tier two areas of England canorder a Scotch egg with their pintto keep in line with post-lockdown rules. Thetier two rules,externalalso mean you cannot ""mix with anyone who is not part of your household or support bubble"" when indoors. The Welsh Government is urging people against cross-border travel in an attempt to curb rising coronavirus rates. ""We are advising people in Wales not to travel into those parts of England and Scotland where the infection rate is lower, to help prevent them taking coronavirus with them,"" First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. ""Coronavirus doesn't respect borders - we all have a part to play in keeping Wales and the UK safe. Please think carefully about where you are going and what you are doing. This virus thrives wherever we come together with others."" Well, it depends what area of England they live in. The rise in Wales' coronavirus infection rate slowed down due to the 'firebreak' lockdown You can see loved ones in England's tier one, within the local rules of that area. But you can't go to see family or friends if they live in England's highest tier - which is most of the north east and west, Yorkshire and the Humber, parts of the West Midlands and parts of the south east and west of England. However, if you've a loved one in England in your support bubble, you can still visit them no matter what tier they are in. Up to three households can form an exclusive ""bubble"" to meet indoors during the Christmas period But people are being urged not to take that trip unless they have to. How many Covid deaths and cases have there been in Wales? Postcode check: What tier do my friends or relatives live in? What tier is your area in? There are exceptions in all of England's tiers for childcare andsupport bubbles,external. If you do travel to visit your support bubble, once in England you will need to follow the rules that apply there. Travel into Scotland's top tiers,external- levels three and four - is not allowed, much like England's tier three areas, except for essential reasons. So places like Glasgow, Stirling and Livingston are among the eleven local authority areas with the highest Covid measures as all non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gyms are shut until 11 December. This video can not be played Abby wants her family to be together at Christmas - but there are too many households At level three, alcohol sales are not allowed and cafes and restaurants can only serve food and non-alcoholic drinks and must close at 18:00.

No. Atwo-week circuit-breaker took effect on 27 November,externalto try to reduce transmission of the virus and Welsh legislations prevents travel Are you fed up of all that online shopping and fancy a look around some real shops? People are advised by governments to shop locally if they go Christmas shopping Well, you can do that in any area of the UK - as long as it isn't under the strictest Covid measures. So places like Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Northern Ireland are out of bounds. But you can can shop anywhere else although governments are advising people to remain in their local regions. How lovely would it be to have a little bit of winter sun? Well, international travel is allowed again but the government advises that you don't unless it is ""essential"". Festive breaks or getaways abroad are now allowed subject to possible quarantine on return People will be subject toexisting 14-day quarantine rules on return, depending on where you've been, but the outright ban on travelling abroad is gone. For those wanting to drive home to see family and friends to celebrate over the festive period,new rules will be introduced. From 23 to 27 December, people from across the UK will be able to meet. But with numbers limited to three households, some larger families, and those who have relatives who have separated, this may lead to difficult choices when arranging the dinner table.

"Facebook wants to stamp out content that discourages vaccinations Facebook says it will start removing false claims about Covid-19 vaccines to prevent ""imminent physical harm"". The company says it is accelerating its plans to ban misleading and false information on its Facebook and Instagram platforms following the announcement of the first vaccine being approved for use in the United Kingdom. Among already-debunked claims that won't be allowed are falsehoods about vaccine ingredients, safety, effectiveness and side-effects. Also banned will be the long-running false conspiracy theory that coronavirus vaccines will contain a microchip to control or monitor patients. Facebook has come under fire for what's been seen as a patchy approach to fake news and false claims, and misleading content about the pandemic is still widely available on its platforms. It says it willremove false claims about Covid-19 vaccines,external""that have already been debunked by public health experts"". Facebook says that since January it has been removing content about the pandemic, such as false cures and treatments or claims that the disease doesn't exist at all. In October, it banned advertisements that discouraged people from taking vaccines. This is a continuation of the policy ""to remove misinformation about the virus that could lead to imminent physical harm"", the company said. ""This could include false claims about the safety, efficacy, ingredients or side effects of the vaccines [and] false claims that Covid-19 vaccines contain microchips, or anything else that isn't on the official vaccine ingredient list. ""We will also remove conspiracy theories about Covid-19 vaccines that we know today are false."" Vaccine rumours debunked: Microchips, 'altered DNA' and more However, Facebook warned that these policies, which the BBC understands have been brought forward following the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by the British medicines regulator, will take some time to come into effect. ""We will not be able to start enforcing these policies overnight,"" a Facebook statement said. Anti-vaccine sentiment has been picked up by believers of other conspiracy theories Social media is awash with conspiracy theories about coronavirus vaccines, which resurface whenever news breaks - like the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use in the UK. These conspiracies are worlds away from legitimate concerns, making false allegations of microchipping, genocide and DNA alternation. For that reason, many will welcome the announcement of this crackdown by Facebook - including politicians who have been calling for action from the social media giants. It's tougher than previous announcements - this time a commitment to removing conspiracies rather than just fact-checking or labelling these posts as misleading. But fears remain that yet another commitment to tackle misinformation by the social media site will not translate into effective action - or be the right approach. Conspiracy narratives about the coronavirus vaccine have become so prevalent, often originating in anti-vaccination and pseudoscience circles before spilling into parent chats, community forums and Instagram feeds. Undoing those narratives months after they first began to spread may not be enough to reverse the seeds of doubt they have sown in communities around the world. While Facebook's announcement has been broadly welcomed, there are concerns that the company might not follow through on its promises. Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said in a statement: ""Today's policy change is long overdue, but there is no guarantee that it will be properly enforced."" ""As we saw in the months following Facebook's promise to remove misinformation about coronavirus earlier this year, they rarely enforce their own policies"". Mr Ahmed went on to urge governments to accelerate plans to regulate harmful online content. ""They must introduce tough regulations as soon as possible to ensure these policies are enforced, including criminal sanctions for breaches of their duty to remove harmful material that puts lives at risk."" The UK government has been planning an Online Harms Bill for this very purpose, but it has beencriticised over ""unacceptable"" delays in its publication, while Jo Stevens, Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, called for emergency legislation ""to protect people from this dangerous disinformation"".

A 36-year-old British Syrian man was detained at his flat in north-west London on Thursday morning, bringing the total number of arrests to 14. The group is alleged to have helped more than 600 people cross the Channel in May alone. About 80% of the people they are thought to have smuggled were Syrian. Home Secretary Priti Patel, who watched the raid being carried out, said she had ""repeatedly and unapologetically"" pointed out that smuggling people by illegal means put lives at risk. ""We have seen people die this year in the Channel,"" she said. ""It is absolutely right that we do everything, we use all the tools we have from a law enforcement perspective, to go after them."" The rest of the group were arrested in raids in London and Sheffield over several months. More French patrols to target Channel crossings Home Office 'missed chance to stop migrant boats' Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? Channel crossings by migrants increased sharply from April, with more than 8,200 people making the journey in small boats so far in 2020, compared to 1,844 last year and 299 in 2018. Most claim asylum on arrival in the UK, but the overall numbers doing so have fallen in 2020 as the pandemic has meant other routes - by road and air - have been less accessible. Campaigners say asylum seekers - most of whom have fled places such as Iran, Iraq and Syria before making the Channel crossing - have no choice but to enter the UK illegally, as it is not possible to apply for asylum outside the country and there are no safe and legal routes. Priti Patel said French authorities were successfully preventing crossings in small boats The home secretary praised the French authorities for taking stronger action to prevent boats from departing, saying that on one day when 20 people made it across, more than 200 had been stopped from leaving the beaches of Normandy. These interventions have contributed to a 65% fall in the number of crossings on days when the sea is calm, the Home Office said. The number of crossings peaked at 1,868 for the month of September. ""They have actually been going into the waters to stop boats from listing and sinking to save lives and it's absolutely the right thing to do,"" Ms Patel said. ""These routes are dangerous. Lives have been put at risk."" Both the French and UK governments were committed to making this route ""unviable"", she said. ""We want to cut this route completely and we will stop at nothing to try and do that."" She said people should seek asylum in the first safe country they can get to, adding that ""European member states are safe countries"". At the raid attended by the home secretary and the media, one 36-year-old man was arrested Under a new agreement with France which began at the weekend, the UK is paying Â£28m towards doubling the number of police officers on beaches and on surveillance technology such as drones, radar and cameras. Ms Patel said when the Brexit transition period ends in January, the UK government will negotiate agreements with individual EU countries such as France to return people who could have claimed asylum earlier in their journeys through Europe. ""We will start negotiating bilaterally, country by country, and we are already making that very, very clear to EU member states. Bilateral relations matter,"" she said. Existing agreements on returning asylum seekers will expire with the Brexit transition period and negotiations with the EU have so far failed to produce an agreement.

"GCSE and A-level students missed time in school and continue to face disruption Extra measures to ""boost fairness and support students"" will be used for next summer's GCSE and A-level exams in England, ministers have announced. More generous grading, advance notice of exam topics and additional papers are promised by the Department for Education to make up for the disruption faced by students during the pandemic. Those who cannot sit exams due to self-isolation rules will still get a grade. Heads said it was ""a reasonable package"" of measures for the situation. The DfE says it has had ""extensive engagement"" with exams watchdog Ofqual, exam boards and senior leaders across the education sector. The measures mean: more generous grading than usual, in line with results from summer 2020, so that this year's cohort is not disadvantaged students getting advance notice - at the end of January - of some topic areas covered in exams to focus revision exam aids - such as formula sheets - provided in some exams to cut down on the memorising required additional ""backup"" exams - to be held in July - to give students a second chance to sit a paper if they have to miss main exams or assessments due to illness or self-isolation and a new expert group, which will monitor variation in the impact of the pandemic on students across the country. In extreme cases, where a student misses all their papers, a teacher-assessed grade will be given. Those young people taking vocational and technical qualifications will also see adaptations to their exams to ensure fairness. Schooling 'completely disrupted' in some areas Mixed response as 2021 exams in Wales scrapped Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 NI GCSE and A-level exams 'will go ahead in 2021' Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said exams were the best way of measuring performance, and that it was ""so important"" they took place next summer. ""But this isn't business as usual. I know students are facing unprecedented disruption to their learning. ""That's why exams will be different next year, taking exceptional steps to ensure they are as fair as possible."" Mr Williamson later told the BBC that students have had an ""incredibly difficult"" year and he speaks ""as a father"" as well as education secretary. He told BBC Breakfast: ""I know as a father of a 16-year-old who is taking GCSEs this year, who's been in a situation where she's had to self-isolate and her friends have, that we have to take extra measures, have to take extra steps, to make sure there's as much fairness for them."" He also told Sky News he could ""absolutely"" give a cast-iron guarantee that exams will not be cancelled next year. This video can not be played COVID-19: The students at school in a pandemic A-level and GCSE students in England were this yeargiven grades estimated by their teachers, in a government u-turn, after exams were cancelled because of the pandemic. It followed uproar after about 40% of A-level results were downgraded from students' predicted grades by exams regulator Ofqual, which used an algorithm based on schools' prior marks. Julia: ""I have lots of worries about GCSEs"" Julia, a Year 11 GCSE student at Herne Bay High School in Kent, says the learning lost because of Covid-19 has caused a lot of anxiety. ""I have a lot of worries about GCSEs, because I really feel there's not much being done about the amount of time we missed. ""I'm especially worried about English and maths because those are a must-have for any sixth form. "" Edward, also in Year 11, agrees that the disruption for his year group should be recognised. ""It should be taken into account, everyone should have the same chance as everyone else as we are sitting the same exam."" He says knowing which topics will be coming up will help with revision. ""That would be extremely helpful so that I know what I should prioritise my time on."" Jessica Petherick says she feels ""almost forgotten about by the government"" Jessica Petherick, a Year 13 A-level student from Essex, says she feels ""almost forgotten about by the government"". The 17-year-old adds: ""It's taken them a long time to come up with a plan, and I feel uncertain about what's going to happen. I know there's a plan, but as everyone knows they've made plenty of u-turns."" In primary schools, Year 6 national tests, known as Sats, will go ahead ""to assist with pupils' transition to secondary schools"" and teacher assessment in English reading, writing and mathematics at Key Stage 1 will remain. But the Key Stage 1 tests in reading and maths, and the grammar, punctuation, and spelling tests at Key Stage 1 and 2 will be cancelled for this academic year. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the measures were ""a reasonable package"" to mitigate the damaging impact of the pandemic and made exams ""as fair as they can be in the circumstances"". Mr Barton said advanced notice of exam topics and exam aids would ""help pupils know where to focus their energies in the time that remains"" before exams take place. ""It is not perfect - nothing can be given the fact that learning has been so disrupted by coronavirus and that pupils have been affected to vastly different extents. ""But various options have been discussed exhaustively, and, frankly, schools and colleges just need a decision - the uncertainty has gone on for much too long."" In Wales, A-levels and GCSE exams havebeen cancelledandNationals in Scotlandhave also been cancelled, but Highers and Advanced Highers will be taken, two weeks later than usual. In Northern Ireland,GCSEs and A-levels are going ahead, but will start a week later than usual. The DfE also announced that school inspections by Ofsted inspectors, which were suspended in March, will not resume until after Easter. In the meantime, Ofsted will conduct ""supportive monitoring inspections"" to schools and colleges currently judged to be ""inadequate"" and some that ""require improvement"". Test and exam results will not be included in school performance tables - instead the tables will be replaced by other information such as attendance information and student destinations. Labour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, welcomed the government's announcement but said it had come ""very late"". She told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""We're nearly at the Christmas holidays and students have been very, very anxious ever since September, and teachers uncertain about what they should be preparing their students for."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the announcement brought some ""much needed relief to school leaders who have been operating in 'emergency mode' for most of this year"". But Robin Bevan, headteacher of Southend High School for Boys and National Education Union president, said schools did not yet know how many topics their students would be told about in advance. He said: ""Not knowing this until next year means that the students and teachers may now be 'misusing' their time, catching up on content that may be of educational value but isn't required for the exam. It's a form of curriculum bingo."" At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Fans returned to football grounds on Wednesday after the latest lockdown in England was lifted The Premier League and English Football League have agreed a Â£250m rescue package to help ease the financial challenge faced by EFL clubs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The EFL will be assisted in getting a Â£200m loan for Championship clubs. A Â£50m grant has been agreed for League One and Two clubs. EFL chairman Rick Parry said it was a ""welcome, tangible commitment to the professional game at a time when it has needed it most"". The Premier League will pay up to Â£15m to help the EFL secure a Â£200m loan which it will then lend to Championship clubs interest free. Loans are capped at Â£8.33m per club and must be repaid by June 2024. The Â£50m rescue package for Leagues One and Two is split into two parts - Â£30m will be paid to the 48 clubs as a grant based on missed gate receipts from the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons. League One clubs will receive a minimum payment of Â£375,000 League Two clubs will receive a minimum payment of Â£250,000 The remaining Â£15m will be distributed using a lost gate revenue share calculation A further Â£20m monitored grant will be provided and clubs can apply based on need. A joint Premier League and EFL panel will determine club eligibility. Clubs receiving a monitored grant will be subject to restrictions with respect to transfer spend and player wages. ""Our over-arching aim throughout this process has been to ensure that all EFL clubs survive the financial impact of the pandemic,"" said Parry. ""I am pleased that we have now reached a resolution on behalf of our clubs and, as we have maintained throughout, this will provide much-needed support and clarity following months of uncertainty."" Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said: ""The Premier League is a huge supporter of the football pyramid and is well aware of the important role clubs play in their communities. Our commitment is that no EFL club need go out of business due to Covid-19. ""We are very pleased to have reached this agreement and we stand together with the EFL in our commitment to protect all clubs in these unprecedented times."" Since March, football has been played behind closed doors until restrictions were lifted in some areas of England this week, meaning clubs have missed out on vital matchday revenue. In October, EFL clubs rejected the Premier League's proposed Â£50m rescue package for League One and Two clubs, saying it ""falls some way short"" of the required amount. Top-flight clubs made the offer afterdeciding not to pursue Project Big Picture. But in November, clubs ""agreed in principle"" for those in League One and Two to receive the package from the Premier League. The agreement came two days after after a parliamentary committee heard that10 EFL clubs were struggling to pay wages. The EFL board approved the deal on Thursday before Premier League shareholders then gave their final approval to the agreement. ""I warmly welcome this deal between the Premier League and the EFL which provides up to Â£250m support to help clubs through Covid,"" said culture secretary Oliver Dowden. ""Fans are starting to return and we look forward to building on this as soon as it's safe. ""With a Â£250m support package for men's elite football andÂ£300m government fundingfor women's football, the National League and other major spectator sports, we have fuel in the tank to get clubs and sports through this."" Julian Knight MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said he welcomed the rescue package but criticised the delay in agreeing the deal, adding: ""This fiasco is evidence of a lack of accountability within football's governance structure."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan Amid an unprecedented financial crisis after nine months without gate receipts, this will come as a major relief to many cash-strapped clubs in Leagues One and Two, and to the government, which had been applying pressure on the Premier League to do more to support the rest of the game ever since it was allowed to resume last season. With no money given to professional men's football in the government's recent Â£300m bailout, and several clubs facing ruin, the fear was that the league structure faced collapse if a deal was not agreed, so after the return of fans for the first time in nine months this week, this news represents another positive step. Some will note that given the billions of pounds the top-flight clubs generate from TV deals, it can easily afford a contribution of Â£65m, and could have done more to help their counterparts on whom they often rely for talent. Others will question how Championship clubs will be able to pay back the millions they are now able to borrow. But at a time when Premier League clubs are also losing significant amounts as a result of Covid, persuading them to give away vast sums was never going to be simple. Many in the game have questioned why football clubs should be expected to help poorer businesses in a way not seen in other industries. Others, however, will welcome a hugely significant agreement after months of unedifying deadlock between leagues and politicians that has done little for the reputation of the sport. A number of Premier League managers have complained about being restricted to using three substitutes, saying the number should be raised to five, in line with all major European leagues, Uefa club competitions and the EFL. Liverpool bossJurgen Klopp said last weekthat on a recent manager's call, 15 top-flight bosses were in favour of a change, with only five against - enough to get it passed. However, withtwo votes having already gone againstthe proposal, the Premier League did not put the matter up for debate at Thursday's shareholders' meeting and no club put it forward, so the rule will remain as it is until at least the next meeting.

"Struggling engineering firm BiFab has been put into administration after failing to secure any new contracts. It comes despite the firm, which has plants in Fife and Lewis, receiving Â£52m from the Scottish government. However, BiFab said it had been unable to compete with yards owned or subsidised by governments in and outside the EU. The firm had been seen as the best hope for offshore wind manufacturing in Scotland. In a statement, the firm said: ""BiFab can confirm that the board has agreed to place the company in administration following the Scottish government's decision to remove contract assurances. BiFab hits back at government's investment claims 'No legal route' for more support for BiFab The complex battle over the BiFab yards Government 'cannot continue to support' BiFab ""The company has worked tirelessly to bring jobs into Fife and Lewis with some success. ""However, the absence of supply chain protections in Scotland and the wider UK have consistently undermined our ability to compete with government-owned and government-supported yards outside and inside the European Union. ""We would urge the Scottish and UK governments to address these structural challenges as a matter of urgency in order to ensure that the benefits of offshore renewables are shared more widely with communities across the country."" The steel fabrication firm, which has yards in Methil and Burntisland in Fife, and Lewis, was rescued by the Scottish government in 2017 and was acquired by Canada-based JV Driver the following year, with the company believing the Scottish government would be the ""primary financiers"". However, a Â£2bn deal to manufacture eight wind turbine jackets at its yards in Methil as part of the Neart Na Gaoithe (NnG) project collapsed last month, and the UK and Scottish governments said they had no legal route to provide further financial support to the company. A joint statement by trade unions GMB Scotland and Unite said BiFab's administration exposed the ""myth of Scotland's renewables revolution as well as a decade of political hypocrisy and failure, in Scotland and the rest of the UK."" GMB Scotland secretary Gary Smith and Unite Scotland secretary Pat Rafferty added that the workers and communities dependent on the yards had ""fought so hard for a future"". ""Shamefully the Scottish government has buried these hopes just in time for Christmas and they have worked together with UK government in doing so,"" they said. ""A decade on from the promise of a 'Saudi Arabia of renewables' and 28,000 full time jobs in offshore wind manufacturing, we've been left with industrial ruins in Fife and Lewis."" Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the Scottish government had worked for more than three years to support BiFab and remained committed to securing a future for the yards and the workforce. She acknowledged that it was ""extremely worrying"" for workers and said the government would continue to do everything possible to support them. She added that as a minority shareholder, the Scottish government had been ""exhaustive"" in its considerations of support options and said there was no legal route for either the Scottish or UK governments to provide further financial support. ""In order to successfully secure and deliver new contracts, BiFab required working capital, the provision of appropriate assurance packages by the shareholders, and plans for investment at the sites,"" she said. ""Despite commitments made at the time of acquisition, this is something the majority shareholder JV Driver was not willing to provide to secure future work."" At First Minister's Questions, Nicola Sturgeon said she ""deeply regretted"" and was ""deeply disappointed"" by the developments. ""We were not able to legally provide the additional support BiFab was seeking,"" she said. ""Had the majority shareholder been prepared to invest, that may have been different."" The best that can be said of BiFab going bust is that few workers stand to lose their jobs, as the yards have spent three years getting little more than necessary maintenance. So not many hurt? Well, this goes much deeper than immediate job losses, and beyond 400-plus jobs that could have come from the contract it won. The yards are totemic: they have been a vital sign that Scotland could gain from manufacturing for the green energy revolution. Without factories to build turbines or towers, though they were promised, there's now little prospect for steel fabrication - one product Scots made well for the offshore oil industry. If there was a strategy, it failed, repeatedly. For platforms and turbines to be located off the coast of Fife, Angus and Aberdeenshire, it's cheaper to build in Asia, the Middle East and Spain. Scottish yards lacked the government support and subsidy that their rivals get. But that's too easy an excuse. They also lack the scale and efficiency of competitors, which required investment - public, private or both. So what's being done about that? We're due to get a new manufacturing strategy from the Scottish government, imminently. The UK government has been talking about industrial strategy, with its focus on the north of England. Both will have a lot of heavy lifting to do if they're to raise the Scottish and UK game in industrial competitiveness. Last week, BiFab said the Canadian owner had repeatedly offered to offload shares to the government at no cost. It said this would give the Scottish government - which owns a third of the company - more flexibility to back it. It said ministers' statements about it had been inaccurate or untruthful and JV Driver had agreed to become involved on the understanding that ministers would provide most of the finance required to win new contracts. A joint working group has been set up with the UK government to explore how existing policy measures can be used to strengthen the renewables and clean energy supply chain in Scotland. On Wednesday, MSPs voted to ""condemn"" the Scottish government's decision to withdraw financial guarantees and to call on them to ""act now to secure the future"" of the yards. The motion, which was passed by 61-60, said the government was ""risking Scotland's reputation as a green investment hub"". STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said the announcement was the latest stage in a ""sorry saga of government and corporate failure with the victims being workers and their families from Fife to the Islands"". Scottish Greens energy spokesman Mark Ruskell said the news showed a ""major dereliction of the Scottish government's duties on jobs and a green recovery"" and made ""a mockery"" of their claims to have saved BiFab eight months ago. Scottish Labour economy spokesman Alex Rowley said: ""This terrible news will come as a hammer blow to workers across Scotland and exposes the fraud that is the SNP's claims of a renewables revolution."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""The SNP government's incompetence has left an industrial wasteland. This was a golden opportunity to connect our battle against climate change with jobs in industrial communities across the country, but the government has wasted over Â£52m creating a couple of hundred temporary jobs.""

"There will be no extension to Scotland's school Christmas holidays, the country's education secretary has confirmed. Talks had been held about potentially shutting all schools on 18 December and reopening them again on 11 January. But there had been concern about the impact on teaching time and the difficulties it could cause parents. The EIS, Scotland's largest teaching union, said the decision not to extend the holidays would anger many teachers. And it accused the government of ""once again showing a complete disregard for the concerns and welfare of teachers"". The union had wanted schools to move to remote learning in the final week of term to ensure senior staff did not find themselves having to deal with Covid outbreaks during the holidays. Will next year's Higher exams go ahead? Talks held on extending school Christmas holidays Keeping level 4 schools open 'is vital for pupils' This would also have minimised the risk of staff, pupils and parents having Christmas ruined by infections, the union had argued. Holiday dates in Scotland vary between different council areas, with many schools due to finish on 22 or 23 December before returning between 5 and 7 January. A memo that wasleaked to the Daily Record newspaper,externallast week suggested that the government was considering a national extension to the holidays. It would have seen schools either remaining closed or introducing remote learning for a temporary period. The proposal was designed to limit the spread of Covid after families get together for Christmas. Mr Swinney said the health advice he had been given suggested that pupils would be safer in school Opposition parties had accused the government of ""dithering"" over the decision, which they said was causing uncertainty for pupils, staff and parents. In aletter to the Scottish Parliament's education committee,externalon Thursday morning, Education Secretary John Swinney said: ""I have reached the decision not to make any changes to the planned Christmas and new year holiday dates"". Mr Swinney said there had been a ""range of views"" when the proposal was discussed at the Education Recovery Group, which includes councils, teaching unions and other organisations. He added: ""The public health advice that I received is to keep schools open as planned as the controlled school environment is more preferable to social mixing outside of school if schools are closed early. ""In addition, vulnerable children may be at greater risk if they are out of school for an extended period."" Mr Swinney also said he had taken into account the need to provide childcare for key workers, and the ""significant difficulties"" an extension to the holidays could cause for working parents. And he said the advice he had received continued to be that there is no evidence that schools and early learning settings are driving transmission of the virus, and that there is ""no clear rationale for disrupting children's education."" Mr Swinney is facing calls to cancel next year's Higher and Advanced Higher exams Mr Swinney also confirmed that there would be a staggered return for university students after the holidays, and that students would not be returning in the ""congested period"" directly after Christmas and new year. He said he was still in discussions on the precise nature of the return and that he would set out the details as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens have repeated their call for the government to cancel Higher and Advanced Higher exams next year and replace them with a ""robust system of continuous assessment"". The government has already cancelled next year's National 5s, with a final decision on whether or not to have Higher and Advanced Higher exams due to be made by the February break. The party's co-leader Patrick Harvie said it was clear that the academic year was being severely disrupted, and highlighted the case of a pupil who has already had to self-isolate three times yet faces prelim exams early next year. He added: ""It's long past time the first minister gave teachers and young people the clarity they need and accepted that Higher and Advanced Higher exams cannot go ahead in the coming year."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that the government was considering ""very, very carefully"" whether the exams should go ahead, and appeared to suggest a decision could be made sooner than February.

"EU negotiator Michel Barnier has been in London since face-to-face talks resumed The prospect of a breakthrough in post-Brexit trade negotiations between the UK and EU is ""receding"", according to a senior UK government source. They told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the EU team were ""bringing new elements into the negotiation"" at the ""eleventh hour"". But the source said a breakthrough was ""still possible in the next few days"". Talks were continuing into the night in London. Current trading rules expire on 31 December. Both sides are urgently seeking compromises in key areas, including fishing rights and competition rules. An EU source told the BBC's political editor that talks were ""extremely sluggish"" around the so-calledlevel playing fieldfor competition rules and standards. But another source from Brussels said there were ""never any surprises or new demands from the EU side"". Laura Kuenssberg said both sides were suggesting to her that the real sticking point was over how those rules would be policed. Have trade talks taken a turn for the worse? Are both sides running out of road for a Brexit deal? What happens next with Brexit? The UK and EU have been locked in talks since March to determine their future relations once the UK's Brexit transition period ends in less than four weeks' time. The BBC's political editor said: ""The stumbling blocks certainly aren't new, but the sense on the UK side is that talks have gone backwards 24 hours"". She added that there were ""still real problems to solve"". Earlier, Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney told Irish broadcaster RTE that talks were ""at the very end"". Speaking ahead of Brexit meetings in Paris with his French counterpart on Thursday, he said efforts were under way to close negotiations ""in the next few days"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Boris Johnson has said the UK remains ""absolutely committed"" to ""getting a deal if we can"". Speaking on Wednesday, the prime minister said the EU side ""know what the UK bottom line is,"" as talks continued in what is seen as a crucial week. Face-to-face talks between negotiators have been ongoing since the weekend after a week-long pause. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is expected to return to Brussels on Friday to brief the bloc on the state of play, but Laura Kuenssberg said he may come straight back to join the four new negotiators who arrived on Thursday night. To do business with each other from January, the UK and the EU agree there will have to be some shared rules. It's called the level playing field, if you want to use the jargon, andyou can read about it in all the detail you want here. But again and again, the two sides have clashed over who should be in charge of the rules and, particularly, what happens if things go wrong. Late on Wednesday, there were signs that a deal was nearly concluded. But after another day of talks on Thursday, just before 19:00 GMT, things seemed to take a turn for the worse. It's true that both sides want a deal. It's also true that both sides can see the shape of a possible deal. But when there is so much at stake, taking it for granted that it will happen is quite an assumption to make. Read more from Laura here. On Thursday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told reporters: ""If the choice is a deal or no deal, then a deal is obviously in the national interest."" He said he was ""consulting across the Labour Party"" on whether the party's MPs should back a deal if it comes to a vote in the Commons, and would decide after examining the contents of the deal. He denied Labour was split over the issue, after reports he wasplanning to ask his MPs to vote in favour,externalbut some shadow cabinet members want to abstain. ""We've pulled together incredibly over the last few months through difficult decisions, and we'll do so on this decision again,"" he added. The government has not confirmed how it intends to ratify a deal in Parliament. But the UK's chief negotiator Lord David Frost has said he assumed MPs would have to approve a law to implement ""at least some elements"" of a deal. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The negotiations are continuing ahead of a politically sensitive moment next week, when acontroversial piece of Brexit legislationreturns to the Commons. The Internal Market Bill, which would allow ministers to override sections of the UK's withdrawal agreement, will come back before MPs next Monday. The publication of the bill in September sent shockwaves through the talks, and led to the EU Commissionbeginning legal proceedingsagainst the UK. But on Thursday, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government intends to reinsert contentious clauses taken out of the bill by the House of Lords. The PM's spokesman added the bill was a ""legal safety net"" to protect the UK internal market, in case talks about detailed arrangements for the Irish border break down. On Wednesday, MPs are also set to vote on a new taxation bill that willreportedly contain similar powersto override the withdrawal agreement over the issues of customs and VAT. EU leaders are due to meet next Thursday in Brussels for a scheduled summit. What happens now that a deal's been done? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks?

"This video can not be played Dr Fauci told the BBC: ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint"" Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, has apologised for remarks that seemed to criticise the UK's vaccine approval process. ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint,"" Dr Fauci told the BBC on Thursday. The UK on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine for the coronavirus. It has defended the rapid approval and said the jab is safe and effective. Dr Fauci on Wednesday had told Fox News that the UK did not review the vaccine ""as carefully"" as US health regulators, although he implied that the US would quickly also be in a position to approve a vaccine. ""We'll be there. We'll be there very soon,"" he added. He later told CBS News that the UK had ""rushed"" the approval, but on Thursday he walked back the comments, and said there was  ""no judgement on the way the UK did it"". ""Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK. And that's just the reality,"" Dr Fauci told the BBC. ""I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way."" The UK medicines regulator - MHRA - said it had ""rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review"" - adding that it reviewed preliminary data on the vaccine trials dating back to June and had been running a ""rolling review"" since October which helped speed the process. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? The regulator said that Covid vaccines were being developed ""in a coordinated in a way that allows some stages of this process to happen in parallel to condense the time needed"" adding that it did not mean that ""the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness"" had been bypassed. ""Any vaccine must undergo robust clinical trials in line with international standards, with oversight provided by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,"" it said. ""No vaccine would be authorised for supply in the UK unless the expected standards of safety, quality and efficacy are met,"" the MHRA added. Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week On Thursday, the UK's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC he was ""very confident"" in the MHRA. He said there was more than ""100 years of medical experience"" between the UK regulator and the committee advising which groups of people are vaccinated first. Dr Fauci's remarks came as the US surpassed 14 million Covid-19 infections in total, with a recorded 276,325 deaths. A woman waits for a Covid-19 test in California, as cases mount across the US Analysis by Naomi Grimley, BBC health correspondent America's Food and Drug Administration does have a different approach to other regulators around the world - it often asks vaccine makers for their raw data, which it then spends time re-analysing. The UK's medicines regulator in London, on the other hand, relies more heavily on the companies' own reports as does the European Medicines Agency, based in Amsterdam. Politics may also explain why the FDA hasn't yet given the green light. Back in October, President Trump pressured health officials to approve the first vaccine candidates before election day on 3 November but they pushed back, fearing it might become a political football. The FDA said it wanted to see two months' extra safety data from the final phase vaccine trials before pharmaceutical companies could apply for emergency approval. That has inevitably left some arguing the US has got bogged down in a much more detailed review than might have been necessary. The head of the European Medicines Agency also appeared to raise eyebrows yesterday at the truncated timetable in London. But officials in the UK believe the US and EU are likely to approve the vaccine soon. The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, andthe first consignment of that vaccine has now arrived. It has been taken to a central hub at an undisclosed location, and will now be distributed to hospital vaccination centres around the UK. England's deputy chief medical officer said the first wave of vaccinations could prevent up to 99% of Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths. Did Brexit speed up the UK's vaccine approval? What does UK vaccine approval mean for US? Are countries under pressure to approve a vaccine? This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" The US FDA plans to meet on 10 December to discuss approval for the UK-approved vaccine, and will meet again on 17 December to discuss a second vaccine - Moderna. Dr Fauci had described the US Food and Drug Administration's approval process, slower than the UK, as the ""gold standard"". On Thursday he clarified, saying the US does ""things a little differently"" than the UK. ""That's all,"" he said. ""Not better, not worse, just differently."" An independent UK expert on the use and effects of drugs in populations - Prof Stephen Evans of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the approvals processes carried out by the FDA and the MHRA were ""basically very similar"". ""The only major difference is that the FDA may reproduce all the tables submitted by a company by re-analysing the data,"" he said. ""It is very clear that the UK assessment of this has followed all the usual processes, but has been working incredibly long hours and seven days a week both with MHRA staff and with their academic advisors for quite a long time on initial and interim data before the final data were submitted."" Dr Fauci has led the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH) for more than 30 years - covering five presidential transitions - and has become the most visible member of the White House's coronavirus task force. The EU, meanwhile, is eyeing a 29 December meeting of the European Medicines Agency to determine if there is adequate safety data on the vaccine for it to be approved in Europe. This timeline puts the EU weeks behind both the UK and US. After the agency approves the vaccine, it will probably also need a sign-off from the EU Commission.

"Fans returned to football grounds on Wednesday after the latest lockdown in England was lifted The Premier League and English Football League have agreed a Â£250m rescue package to help ease the financial challenge faced by EFL clubs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The EFL will be assisted in getting a Â£200m loan for Championship clubs. A Â£50m grant has been agreed for League One and Two clubs. EFL chairman Rick Parry said it was a ""welcome, tangible commitment to the professional game at a time when it has needed it most"". The Premier League will pay up to Â£15m to help the EFL secure a Â£200m loan which it will then lend to Championship clubs interest free. Loans are capped at Â£8.33m per club and must be repaid by June 2024. The Â£50m rescue package for Leagues One and Two is split into two parts - Â£30m will be paid to the 48 clubs as a grant based on missed gate receipts from the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons. League One clubs will receive a minimum payment of Â£375,000 League Two clubs will receive a minimum payment of Â£250,000 The remaining Â£15m will be distributed using a lost gate revenue share calculation A further Â£20m monitored grant will be provided and clubs can apply based on need. A joint Premier League and EFL panel will determine club eligibility. Clubs receiving a monitored grant will be subject to restrictions with respect to transfer spend and player wages. ""Our over-arching aim throughout this process has been to ensure that all EFL clubs survive the financial impact of the pandemic,"" said Parry. ""I am pleased that we have now reached a resolution on behalf of our clubs and, as we have maintained throughout, this will provide much-needed support and clarity following months of uncertainty."" Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said: ""The Premier League is a huge supporter of the football pyramid and is well aware of the important role clubs play in their communities. Our commitment is that no EFL club need go out of business due to Covid-19. ""We are very pleased to have reached this agreement and we stand together with the EFL in our commitment to protect all clubs in these unprecedented times."" Since March, football has been played behind closed doors until restrictions were lifted in some areas of England this week, meaning clubs have missed out on vital matchday revenue. In October, EFL clubs rejected the Premier League's proposed Â£50m rescue package for League One and Two clubs, saying it ""falls some way short"" of the required amount. Top-flight clubs made the offer afterdeciding not to pursue Project Big Picture. But in November, clubs ""agreed in principle"" for those in League One and Two to receive the package from the Premier League. The agreement came two days after after a parliamentary committee heard that10 EFL clubs were struggling to pay wages. The EFL board approved the deal on Thursday before Premier League shareholders then gave their final approval to the agreement. ""I warmly welcome this deal between the Premier League and the EFL which provides up to Â£250m support to help clubs through Covid,"" said culture secretary Oliver Dowden. ""Fans are starting to return and we look forward to building on this as soon as it's safe. ""With a Â£250m support package for men's elite football andÂ£300m government fundingfor women's football, the National League and other major spectator sports, we have fuel in the tank to get clubs and sports through this."" Julian Knight MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said he welcomed the rescue package but criticised the delay in agreeing the deal, adding: ""This fiasco is evidence of a lack of accountability within football's governance structure."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan Amid an unprecedented financial crisis after nine months without gate receipts, this will come as a major relief to many cash-strapped clubs in Leagues One and Two, and to the government, which had been applying pressure on the Premier League to do more to support the rest of the game ever since it was allowed to resume last season. With no money given to professional men's football in the government's recent Â£300m bailout, and several clubs facing ruin, the fear was that the league structure faced collapse if a deal was not agreed, so after the return of fans for the first time in nine months this week, this news represents another positive step. Some will note that given the billions of pounds the top-flight clubs generate from TV deals, it can easily afford a contribution of Â£65m, and could have done more to help their counterparts on whom they often rely for talent. Others will question how Championship clubs will be able to pay back the millions they are now able to borrow. But at a time when Premier League clubs are also losing significant amounts as a result of Covid, persuading them to give away vast sums was never going to be simple. Many in the game have questioned why football clubs should be expected to help poorer businesses in a way not seen in other industries. Others, however, will welcome a hugely significant agreement after months of unedifying deadlock between leagues and politicians that has done little for the reputation of the sport. A number of Premier League managers have complained about being restricted to using three substitutes, saying the number should be raised to five, in line with all major European leagues, Uefa club competitions and the EFL. Liverpool bossJurgen Klopp said last weekthat on a recent manager's call, 15 top-flight bosses were in favour of a change, with only five against - enough to get it passed. However, withtwo votes having already gone againstthe proposal, the Premier League did not put the matter up for debate at Thursday's shareholders' meeting and no club put it forward, so the rule will remain as it is until at least the next meeting.

This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" The US FDA plans to meet on 10 December to discuss approval for the UK-approved vaccine, and will meet again on 17 December to discuss a second vaccine - Moderna. Dr Fauci had described the US Food and Drug Administration's approval process, slower than the UK, as the ""gold standard"". On Thursday he clarified, saying the US does ""things a little differently"" than the UK. ""That's all,"" he said. ""Not better, not worse, just differently."" An independent UK expert on the use and effects of drugs in populations - Prof Stephen Evans of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the approvals processes carried out by the FDA and the MHRA were ""basically very similar"". ""The only major difference is that the FDA may reproduce all the tables submitted by a company by re-analysing the data,"" he said. ""It is very clear that the UK assessment of this has followed all the usual processes, but has been working incredibly long hours and seven days a week both with MHRA staff and with their academic advisors for quite a long time on initial and interim data before the final data were submitted."" Dr Fauci has led the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH) for more than 30 years - covering five presidential transitions - and has become the most visible member of the White House's coronavirus task force. The EU, meanwhile, is eyeing a 29 December meeting of the European Medicines Agency to determine if there is adequate safety data on the vaccine for it to be approved in Europe. This timeline puts the EU weeks behind both the UK and US. After the agency approves the vaccine, it will probably also need a sign-off from the EU Commission.

"Fans returned to football grounds on Wednesday after the latest lockdown in England was lifted The Premier League and English Football League have agreed a Â£250m rescue package to help ease the financial challenge faced by EFL clubs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The EFL will be assisted in getting a Â£200m loan for Championship clubs. A Â£50m grant has been agreed for League One and Two clubs. EFL chairman Rick Parry said it was a ""welcome, tangible commitment to the professional game at a time when it has needed it most"". The Premier League will pay up to Â£15m to help the EFL secure a Â£200m loan which it will then lend to Championship clubs interest free. Loans are capped at Â£8.33m per club and must be repaid by June 2024. The Â£50m rescue package for Leagues One and Two is split into two parts - Â£30m will be paid to the 48 clubs as a grant based on missed gate receipts from the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons. League One clubs will receive a minimum payment of Â£375,000 League Two clubs will receive a minimum payment of Â£250,000 The remaining Â£15m will be distributed using a lost gate revenue share calculation A further Â£20m monitored grant will be provided and clubs can apply based on need. A joint Premier League and EFL panel will determine club eligibility. Clubs receiving a monitored grant will be subject to restrictions with respect to transfer spend and player wages. ""Our over-arching aim throughout this process has been to ensure that all EFL clubs survive the financial impact of the pandemic,"" said Parry. ""I am pleased that we have now reached a resolution on behalf of our clubs and, as we have maintained throughout, this will provide much-needed support and clarity following months of uncertainty."" Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said: ""The Premier League is a huge supporter of the football pyramid and is well aware of the important role clubs play in their communities. Our commitment is that no EFL club need go out of business due to Covid-19. ""We are very pleased to have reached this agreement and we stand together with the EFL in our commitment to protect all clubs in these unprecedented times."" Since March, football has been played behind closed doors until restrictions were lifted in some areas of England this week, meaning clubs have missed out on vital matchday revenue. In October, EFL clubs rejected the Premier League's proposed Â£50m rescue package for League One and Two clubs, saying it ""falls some way short"" of the required amount. Top-flight clubs made the offer afterdeciding not to pursue Project Big Picture. But in November, clubs ""agreed in principle"" for those in League One and Two to receive the package from the Premier League. The agreement came two days after after a parliamentary committee heard that10 EFL clubs were struggling to pay wages. The EFL board approved the deal on Thursday before Premier League shareholders then gave their final approval to the agreement. ""I warmly welcome this deal between the Premier League and the EFL which provides up to Â£250m support to help clubs through Covid,"" said culture secretary Oliver Dowden. ""Fans are starting to return and we look forward to building on this as soon as it's safe. ""With a Â£250m support package for men's elite football andÂ£300m government fundingfor women's football, the National League and other major spectator sports, we have fuel in the tank to get clubs and sports through this."" Julian Knight MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said he welcomed the rescue package but criticised the delay in agreeing the deal, adding: ""This fiasco is evidence of a lack of accountability within football's governance structure."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan Amid an unprecedented financial crisis after nine months without gate receipts, this will come as a major relief to many cash-strapped clubs in Leagues One and Two, and to the government, which had been applying pressure on the Premier League to do more to support the rest of the game ever since it was allowed to resume last season. With no money given to professional men's football in the government's recent Â£300m bailout, and several clubs facing ruin, the fear was that the league structure faced collapse if a deal was not agreed, so after the return of fans for the first time in nine months this week, this news represents another positive step. Some will note that given the billions of pounds the top-flight clubs generate from TV deals, it can easily afford a contribution of Â£65m, and could have done more to help their counterparts on whom they often rely for talent. Others will question how Championship clubs will be able to pay back the millions they are now able to borrow. But at a time when Premier League clubs are also losing significant amounts as a result of Covid, persuading them to give away vast sums was never going to be simple. Many in the game have questioned why football clubs should be expected to help poorer businesses in a way not seen in other industries. Others, however, will welcome a hugely significant agreement after months of unedifying deadlock between leagues and politicians that has done little for the reputation of the sport. A number of Premier League managers have complained about being restricted to using three substitutes, saying the number should be raised to five, in line with all major European leagues, Uefa club competitions and the EFL. Liverpool bossJurgen Klopp said last weekthat on a recent manager's call, 15 top-flight bosses were in favour of a change, with only five against - enough to get it passed. However, withtwo votes having already gone againstthe proposal, the Premier League did not put the matter up for debate at Thursday's shareholders' meeting and no club put it forward, so the rule will remain as it is until at least the next meeting.

"More than 60,000 people in the UK have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test,official figures show.,external A further 414 were recorded on Thursday, taking the total to 60,113. Two other ways of measuring deaths - where Covid is mentioned on the death certificate, and the number of ""excess deaths"" for this time of year - give higher total figures. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more deaths than the UK, according toJohns Hopkins University.,external However, the UK has had more deaths per 100,000 people than any of those nations. In terms of deaths per 100,000 people, the UK is the seventh-highest country globally, behind Belgium, San Marino, Peru, Andorra, Spain and Italy. Coronavirus: Your tributes to those who have died How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? Prime Minister Boris Johnson said every death was ""one too many"". ""While it's fantastic news that a vaccine is on its way, we must not lose sight of the fact that the fight against coronavirus is not yet won,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, meanwhile, described the milestone as ""heartbreaking"". ""My thoughts are with all those families who will spend Christmas remembering those loved ones who are no longer with us,"" he said. The latest daily figures for the UK also showed a further 14,879 people have tested positive for Covid-19, taking the UK's total cases to 1,674,134. Covid news comes in contrasting shades. In early November, Pfizer and Biontech announced the success of their vaccine trial, which increased hopes of a return to normality. Two days later, the UK's daily reported death toll hit 50,000. This week's news of regulatory approval for the vaccine is closely followed by that total passing 60,000. This covers those who have died within 28 days of a positive test. There is a broader definition that includes those who might have died after a longer period from the time of a test, or who weren't tested but whose death certificates involved Covid-19 - this shows around 70,000 have died with the virus. These are sobering statistics and underline even more the importance of the vaccine for charting a way towards saving lives. First vaccines 'could cut 99% of deaths' - Van-Tam Minister: UK got jab first as it's better country Quarantine rules to be relaxed for business bosses The government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest therehave been more than 69,000 deaths by this measure.,external The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland - which measure excess deaths - suggest the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. So far, the second wave has been lower and slower than the first wave. About 80% of deaths involving coronavirus happened before August, and most of those happened in just one month. Almost 10,000 coronavirus deaths a week were registered in consecutive weeks in April. In this second wave, it looks like the peak figures - assuming infections keep falling before widespread vaccination takes place - might be closer to 3,000 than 4,000. And, as in the first wave, those over 75 account for about 75% of the deaths, suggesting that vaccinating over-75s could stem the vast majority of future deaths. This time around, the spread of deaths around the country has looked quite different. In the spring and summer, London and the north-west of England each accounted for about 15% of coronavirus deaths in the UK. But in this wave, London's share is down, closer to 5%, whereas the North West is just under 25%. Meanwhile, bed occupancy rates have fallen in almost three-fifths of English hospitals since the week ending 8 November - the first week these figures were published. In the week to 29 November, 87% of beds in English hospitals were occupied, compared with 88% the previous week. The NHS is meant to keep at least 10% of its beds free so that it can be flexible, allowing it to admit patients and cope with surges in demand. The number of hospitals reporting more than 90% occupancy has fallen slightly since the first week of November - down from 52 to 45 of the 127trusts reporting data,external. This video can not be played Family's grief over mother's Covid-19 death However, Robert Cuffe, the BBC's head of statistics, said pressures on hospitals are not ""evenly spread"". Some hospitals like North Middlesex, Southport and Ormskirk, Surrey and Sussex, and Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh have more than 95% of beds taken. He said: ""More hospitals have seen capacity free up this month than have seen it tighten. ""But as we move into the months that, in any year, put the most stress on capacity within the NHS, all eyes will be on these figures."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

The consignment has been taken to a central hub at an undisclosed location and from there will be distributed to designated hospital vaccination centres around the UK. Earlier, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said the first wave of vaccinations could prevent up to 99% of Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths. Speaking to BBC News, he said that would be possible if everyone on the first priority list took the vaccine and it was highly effective. He said it was key to distribute the vaccine ""as fast"" and at the ""highest volume"" possible, but he acknowledged there would need to be some flexibility in the list.

"Facebook wants to stamp out content that discourages vaccinations Facebook says it will start removing false claims about Covid-19 vaccines to prevent ""imminent physical harm"". The company says it is accelerating its plans to ban misleading and false information on its Facebook and Instagram platforms following the announcement of the first vaccine being approved for use in the United Kingdom. Among already-debunked claims that won't be allowed are falsehoods about vaccine ingredients, safety, effectiveness and side-effects. Also banned will be the long-running false conspiracy theory that coronavirus vaccines will contain a microchip to control or monitor patients. Facebook has come under fire for what's been seen as a patchy approach to fake news and false claims, and misleading content about the pandemic is still widely available on its platforms. It says it willremove false claims about Covid-19 vaccines,external""that have already been debunked by public health experts"". Facebook says that since January it has been removing content about the pandemic, such as false cures and treatments or claims that the disease doesn't exist at all. In October, it banned advertisements that discouraged people from taking vaccines. This is a continuation of the policy ""to remove misinformation about the virus that could lead to imminent physical harm"", the company said. ""This could include false claims about the safety, efficacy, ingredients or side effects of the vaccines [and] false claims that Covid-19 vaccines contain microchips, or anything else that isn't on the official vaccine ingredient list. ""We will also remove conspiracy theories about Covid-19 vaccines that we know today are false."" Vaccine rumours debunked: Microchips, 'altered DNA' and more However, Facebook warned that these policies, which the BBC understands have been brought forward following the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by the British medicines regulator, will take some time to come into effect. ""We will not be able to start enforcing these policies overnight,"" a Facebook statement said. Anti-vaccine sentiment has been picked up by believers of other conspiracy theories Social media is awash with conspiracy theories about coronavirus vaccines, which resurface whenever news breaks - like the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use in the UK. These conspiracies are worlds away from legitimate concerns, making false allegations of microchipping, genocide and DNA alternation. For that reason, many will welcome the announcement of this crackdown by Facebook - including politicians who have been calling for action from the social media giants. It's tougher than previous announcements - this time a commitment to removing conspiracies rather than just fact-checking or labelling these posts as misleading. But fears remain that yet another commitment to tackle misinformation by the social media site will not translate into effective action - or be the right approach. Conspiracy narratives about the coronavirus vaccine have become so prevalent, often originating in anti-vaccination and pseudoscience circles before spilling into parent chats, community forums and Instagram feeds. Undoing those narratives months after they first began to spread may not be enough to reverse the seeds of doubt they have sown in communities around the world. While Facebook's announcement has been broadly welcomed, there are concerns that the company might not follow through on its promises. Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said in a statement: ""Today's policy change is long overdue, but there is no guarantee that it will be properly enforced."" ""As we saw in the months following Facebook's promise to remove misinformation about coronavirus earlier this year, they rarely enforce their own policies"". Mr Ahmed went on to urge governments to accelerate plans to regulate harmful online content. ""They must introduce tough regulations as soon as possible to ensure these policies are enforced, including criminal sanctions for breaches of their duty to remove harmful material that puts lives at risk."" The UK government has been planning an Online Harms Bill for this very purpose, but it has beencriticised over ""unacceptable"" delays in its publication, while Jo Stevens, Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, called for emergency legislation ""to protect people from this dangerous disinformation"".

"The international vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, according to IBM. The company says it tracked a campaign aimed at the delivery ""cold chain"" used to keep vaccines at the right temperature during transportation. The attackers' identity is unclear - but IBM said the sophistication of their methods indicated a nation state. It follows warnings from governments - including the UK's - of countries targeting aspects of vaccine research. IBM says it believes the campaign started in September 2020. It says phishing emails were sent out across six countries, which targeted organisations linked to the Cold Chain Equipment Optimisation Platform (CCEOP) of Gavi, the international vaccine alliance. Gavi's partners include the World Health Organization, Unicef, the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. They help distribute vaccines around the world to some of the poorest regions. This sometimes requires a ""cold chain"". For example, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - which was not the specific target of this campaign - will need to be kept at a temperature of about -70C as it is moved about. The attackers impersonated a business executive from a legitimate Chinese company involved in CCEOP's supply cold chain to make it more likely the targets would engage with the email. They then sent phishing emails to organisations that provided transportation, which contained malicious code and asked for people's log in credentials. That could have allowed them to understand the infrastructure that governments intended to use to distribute vaccines. ""Advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy is likely a high-value and high-priority nation-state target,"" IBM says. IBM says the wider targeting included: the European Commission's Directorate General Taxation and Customs Union companies involved in manufacturing solar panels, which can be used to keep vaccines cold in places where reliable power is not available a South Korean software-development company a German website-development company, which supports clients associated with pharmaceutical manufacturers, container transport, biotechnology and manufacturers of electrical components for communications This video can not be played Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world.

"Up to 99% of Covid-19 hospitalisations and deaths could be avoided with the first wave of vaccinations, England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has said. Speaking to BBC News, he said that would be possible if everyone on the first priority list took the vaccine and it was highly effective. He said it was key to go ""as fast"" and at the ""highest volume"" as possible. But he acknowledged there would need to be some flexibility in the list. On Wednesday the UKbecame the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use. The BBC understands that some of the first delivery of the Pfizer vaccine is travelling via the Eurotunnel to the UK on Thursday. Prof Van-Tam, who was taking viewers' questions on the BBC News channel and Radio 5 Live, said that due to technical issues around the vaccine - particularly the need to store it at very low temperatures - it would be difficult to take the vaccine to individual people's homes. Are countries under pressure to approve a vaccine? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? What are the safety checks for vaccines? Listen again: Prof Van-Tam answers your questions The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and decided by the government. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff. But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine risks being wasted. Prof Van-Tam told BBC News: ""If we can get through phase one [of the priority list] and it is a highly effective vaccine and there is very, very high up take, then we could in theory take out 99% of hospitalisations and deaths related to Covid 19. ""That is why the phase one list is what is, that is the primary ambition."" Prof Van-Tam said the government would need to make further decisions on how to continue with the second part of the programme, while reviewing how the vaccine performs in the coming months. Meanwhile, Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, said patience was required over the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine. Prof Harnden said the JCVI's ""clear remit was to decide on prioritisation groups"" but it always understood ""there were going to be vaccine product storage, transport and administration constraints"". ""We have advised in our statement that there is flexibility at an approach to this list according to what was actually feasible and logistical on the ground, so this is not wholly unexpected - but the clear list that we have drawn out is a list of priority in terms of vulnerability,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Prof Harnden said he understood delays in delivering the vaccine to care homes would be disappointing for residents and their families. But he added: ""I think just a very small degree of patience is required because I think we are at the forefront here in the UK. ""I think the very short-term practical difficulties of getting this out from a storage point of view should not let us all lose sight of the fact that these care home residents and their staff are our utmost priority - and it may well be possible to get the care home staff to be immunised within a local hospital setting,"" he said. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. These will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. But the bulk of the roll-out across the UK will be next year. And it could take until April for all those most at-risk to receive the new vaccine, according to NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens.

"GCSE and A-level students missed time in school and continue to face disruption Extra measures to ""boost fairness and support students"" will be used for next summer's GCSE and A-level exams in England, ministers have announced. More generous grading, advance notice of exam topics and additional papers are promised by the Department for Education to make up for the disruption faced by students during the pandemic. Those who cannot sit exams due to self-isolation rules will still get a grade. Heads said it was ""a reasonable package"" of measures for the situation. The DfE says it has had ""extensive engagement"" with exams watchdog Ofqual, exam boards and senior leaders across the education sector. The measures mean: more generous grading than usual, in line with results from summer 2020, so that this year's cohort is not disadvantaged students getting advance notice - at the end of January - of some topic areas covered in exams to focus revision exam aids - such as formula sheets - provided in some exams to cut down on the memorising required additional ""backup"" exams - to be held in July - to give students a second chance to sit a paper if they have to miss main exams or assessments due to illness or self-isolation and a new expert group, which will monitor variation in the impact of the pandemic on students across the country. In extreme cases, where a student misses all their papers, a teacher-assessed grade will be given. Those young people taking vocational and technical qualifications will also see adaptations to their exams to ensure fairness. Schooling 'completely disrupted' in some areas Mixed response as 2021 exams in Wales scrapped Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 NI GCSE and A-level exams 'will go ahead in 2021' Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said exams were the best way of measuring performance, and that it was ""so important"" they took place next summer. ""But this isn't business as usual. I know students are facing unprecedented disruption to their learning. ""That's why exams will be different next year, taking exceptional steps to ensure they are as fair as possible."" Mr Williamson later told the BBC that students have had an ""incredibly difficult"" year and he speaks ""as a father"" as well as education secretary. He told BBC Breakfast: ""I know as a father of a 16-year-old who is taking GCSEs this year, who's been in a situation where she's had to self-isolate and her friends have, that we have to take extra measures, have to take extra steps, to make sure there's as much fairness for them."" He also told Sky News he could ""absolutely"" give a cast-iron guarantee that exams will not be cancelled next year. This video can not be played COVID-19: The students at school in a pandemic A-level and GCSE students in England were this yeargiven grades estimated by their teachers, in a government u-turn, after exams were cancelled because of the pandemic. It followed uproar after about 40% of A-level results were downgraded from students' predicted grades by exams regulator Ofqual, which used an algorithm based on schools' prior marks. Julia: ""I have lots of worries about GCSEs"" Julia, a Year 11 GCSE student at Herne Bay High School in Kent, says the learning lost because of Covid-19 has caused a lot of anxiety. ""I have a lot of worries about GCSEs, because I really feel there's not much being done about the amount of time we missed. ""I'm especially worried about English and maths because those are a must-have for any sixth form. "" Edward, also in Year 11, agrees that the disruption for his year group should be recognised. ""It should be taken into account, everyone should have the same chance as everyone else as we are sitting the same exam."" He says knowing which topics will be coming up will help with revision. ""That would be extremely helpful so that I know what I should prioritise my time on."" Jessica Petherick says she feels ""almost forgotten about by the government"" Jessica Petherick, a Year 13 A-level student from Essex, says she feels ""almost forgotten about by the government"". The 17-year-old adds: ""It's taken them a long time to come up with a plan, and I feel uncertain about what's going to happen. I know there's a plan, but as everyone knows they've made plenty of u-turns."" In primary schools, Year 6 national tests, known as Sats, will go ahead ""to assist with pupils' transition to secondary schools"" and teacher assessment in English reading, writing and mathematics at Key Stage 1 will remain. But the Key Stage 1 tests in reading and maths, and the grammar, punctuation, and spelling tests at Key Stage 1 and 2 will be cancelled for this academic year. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the measures were ""a reasonable package"" to mitigate the damaging impact of the pandemic and made exams ""as fair as they can be in the circumstances"". Mr Barton said advanced notice of exam topics and exam aids would ""help pupils know where to focus their energies in the time that remains"" before exams take place. ""It is not perfect - nothing can be given the fact that learning has been so disrupted by coronavirus and that pupils have been affected to vastly different extents. ""But various options have been discussed exhaustively, and, frankly, schools and colleges just need a decision - the uncertainty has gone on for much too long."" In Wales, A-levels and GCSE exams havebeen cancelledandNationals in Scotlandhave also been cancelled, but Highers and Advanced Highers will be taken, two weeks later than usual. In Northern Ireland,GCSEs and A-levels are going ahead, but will start a week later than usual. The DfE also announced that school inspections by Ofsted inspectors, which were suspended in March, will not resume until after Easter. In the meantime, Ofsted will conduct ""supportive monitoring inspections"" to schools and colleges currently judged to be ""inadequate"" and some that ""require improvement"". Test and exam results will not be included in school performance tables - instead the tables will be replaced by other information such as attendance information and student destinations. Labour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, welcomed the government's announcement but said it had come ""very late"". She told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""We're nearly at the Christmas holidays and students have been very, very anxious ever since September, and teachers uncertain about what they should be preparing their students for."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the announcement brought some ""much needed relief to school leaders who have been operating in 'emergency mode' for most of this year"". But Robin Bevan, headteacher of Southend High School for Boys and National Education Union president, said schools did not yet know how many topics their students would be told about in advance. He said: ""Not knowing this until next year means that the students and teachers may now be 'misusing' their time, catching up on content that may be of educational value but isn't required for the exam. It's a form of curriculum bingo."" At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Williamson: 'We are a much better country' for approving vaccine The UK is getting a coronavirus vaccine first because it is a ""much better country"" than France, Belgium and the US, says the education secretary. Some UK ministers claim Brexit speeded the process up - but Gavin Williamson said it was down to having superior medical experts. On Wednesday the UK's medical regulator was the first to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use. The EU said it was ""definitely not in the game of comparing regulators"". A source close to Mr Williamson said that his intention had been to ""praise the scientific brilliance of the regulator, but he is known to be enthusiastically patriotic and that enthusiasm clearly shone through in what was a broadly light-hearted conversation with the studio host"". The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's decision means the vaccine will start to be rolled out to the most vulnerable people from next week. People will need two doses, three weeks apart, so the vaccination project is expected to take several months to complete. Reality Check: Did Brexit speed up the UK's vaccine approval? Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week How does the Pfizer vaccine work? PM hails vaccine but warns it is 'not game over' Speaking to LBC radio on Thursday,,externalMr Williamson said: ""I just reckon we've got the very best people in this country and we've obviously got the best medical regulator, much better than the French have, much better than the Belgians have, much better than the Americans have.

"This video can not be played Lord Maginnis is not going to take part in âbehaviour training"" after using âhomophobic and offensive"" language Lord Maginnis of Drumglass should be suspended from the Lords for at least 18 months over bullying and harassment claims, a standards watchdog has said. The independent Ulster Unionist broke the rules in his conduct towards four people and used ""homophobic and offensive"" language, it was found. The Lords Conduct Committee ordered the ex-MP and soldier to take ""behaviour training"" or face a longer ban. But he told the BBC he would refuse to do so. Asked if that would mean a greater punishment, he said: ""So be it."" Lord Maginnis denied bullying and harassment and called the committee's report ""ridiculous"", adding that he was the victim of a campaign against him, involving the LGBT rights charity Stonewall. But Stonewall said he should ""step up and accept responsibility for his behaviour and apologise to those he has hurt"". Defending his stance, Lord Maginnis told BBC Radio Ulster: ""I've held responsible positions all my life,. ""At 83 years of age, I'm not going to be dictated to in this way."" Lord Maginnis accused of verbal abuse in Parliament Complaints against Lord Maginnis were made by Parliamentary security officer Christian Bombolo, SNP MP Hannah Bardell and Labour MPs Luke Pollard and Toby Perkins. He was accused of verbally abusing Mr Bombolo when asked to show his security pass in January, with Ms Bardell saying he became rude and aggressive when she intervened. Ms Bardell later told the House of Commons it was ""one of the worst cases of abuse of security staff"" she had witnessed. At the time, The Huffington Post website quoted Lord Maginnis as saying in response: ""Queers like Ms Bardell don't particularly annoy me."" It was also claimed that, in February, he sent an email about other parliamentarians containing a homophobic subject line. And he was accused of making homophobic remarks about Ms Bardell and Mr Pollard at a breakfast meeting hosted by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Armed Forces in March. The Lords Commissioner for Standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrief, who carried out an investigation into Lord Maginnis, previously recommended a ban of nine months. He appealed against this, but the committee found he had shown ""very little insight into the impact of his behaviour on the complainants, and no remorse for the upset he had caused"". Instead, it added, he had ""portrayed himself as a victim of a conspiracyâ¦ and continued to refer to the complainants in a disobliging and sometimes offensive manner"". Following the publication ofthe report,external, Ms Bardell told BBC Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie that she had received death threats after speaking in the Commons about Lord Maginnis's behaviour. She added that it was ""total nonsense"" to suggest she was behind a ""conspiracy"" against the peer. Ms Bardell also said she was ""disappointed"" by the recommendation of a ban for Lord Maginnis and that ""in any normal workplace anywhere in the UK, this would be a sackable offence"". Lord Maginnis, who was the Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone from 1983 to 2001 having previously served in the Ulster Defence Regiment, became a life peer in 2001.

"EU negotiator Michel Barnier has been in London since face-to-face talks resumed The prospect of a breakthrough in post-Brexit trade negotiations between the UK and EU is ""receding"", according to a senior UK government source. They told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the EU team were ""bringing new elements into the negotiation"" at the ""eleventh hour"". But the source said a breakthrough was ""still possible in the next few days"". Talks were continuing into the night in London. Current trading rules expire on 31 December. Both sides are urgently seeking compromises in key areas, including fishing rights and competition rules. An EU source told the BBC's political editor that talks were ""extremely sluggish"" around the so-calledlevel playing fieldfor competition rules and standards. But another source from Brussels said there were ""never any surprises or new demands from the EU side"". Laura Kuenssberg said both sides were suggesting to her that the real sticking point was over how those rules would be policed. Have trade talks taken a turn for the worse? Are both sides running out of road for a Brexit deal? What happens next with Brexit? The UK and EU have been locked in talks since March to determine their future relations once the UK's Brexit transition period ends in less than four weeks' time. The BBC's political editor said: ""The stumbling blocks certainly aren't new, but the sense on the UK side is that talks have gone backwards 24 hours"". She added that there were ""still real problems to solve"". Earlier, Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney told Irish broadcaster RTE that talks were ""at the very end"". Speaking ahead of Brexit meetings in Paris with his French counterpart on Thursday, he said efforts were under way to close negotiations ""in the next few days"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Boris Johnson has said the UK remains ""absolutely committed"" to ""getting a deal if we can"". Speaking on Wednesday, the prime minister said the EU side ""know what the UK bottom line is,"" as talks continued in what is seen as a crucial week. Face-to-face talks between negotiators have been ongoing since the weekend after a week-long pause. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is expected to return to Brussels on Friday to brief the bloc on the state of play, but Laura Kuenssberg said he may come straight back to join the four new negotiators who arrived on Thursday night. To do business with each other from January, the UK and the EU agree there will have to be some shared rules. It's called the level playing field, if you want to use the jargon, andyou can read about it in all the detail you want here. But again and again, the two sides have clashed over who should be in charge of the rules and, particularly, what happens if things go wrong. Late on Wednesday, there were signs that a deal was nearly concluded. But after another day of talks on Thursday, just before 19:00 GMT, things seemed to take a turn for the worse. It's true that both sides want a deal. It's also true that both sides can see the shape of a possible deal. But when there is so much at stake, taking it for granted that it will happen is quite an assumption to make. Read more from Laura here. On Thursday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told reporters: ""If the choice is a deal or no deal, then a deal is obviously in the national interest."" He said he was ""consulting across the Labour Party"" on whether the party's MPs should back a deal if it comes to a vote in the Commons, and would decide after examining the contents of the deal. He denied Labour was split over the issue, after reports he wasplanning to ask his MPs to vote in favour,externalbut some shadow cabinet members want to abstain. ""We've pulled together incredibly over the last few months through difficult decisions, and we'll do so on this decision again,"" he added. The government has not confirmed how it intends to ratify a deal in Parliament. But the UK's chief negotiator Lord David Frost has said he assumed MPs would have to approve a law to implement ""at least some elements"" of a deal. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The negotiations are continuing ahead of a politically sensitive moment next week, when acontroversial piece of Brexit legislationreturns to the Commons. The Internal Market Bill, which would allow ministers to override sections of the UK's withdrawal agreement, will come back before MPs next Monday. The publication of the bill in September sent shockwaves through the talks, and led to the EU Commissionbeginning legal proceedingsagainst the UK. But on Thursday, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government intends to reinsert contentious clauses taken out of the bill by the House of Lords. The PM's spokesman added the bill was a ""legal safety net"" to protect the UK internal market, in case talks about detailed arrangements for the Irish border break down. On Wednesday, MPs are also set to vote on a new taxation bill that willreportedly contain similar powersto override the withdrawal agreement over the issues of customs and VAT. EU leaders are due to meet next Thursday in Brussels for a scheduled summit. What happens now that a deal's been done? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks?

"This video can not be played Ch Insp Mark Runacres of Avon and Somerset Police: ""Sadly... there have been four fatalities"" Four people have died and another has been injured in a large explosion at a waste water treatment works. Firefighters were called to Wessex Water's premises in Avonmouth, Bristol, at about 11:20 GMT. Three of the people who died worked for the firm, and the other was a contractor. The injured person's condition is not life-threatening. The blast happened in a silo containing treated biosolids and was not terror related, police said. A witness reported hearing a ""very loud explosion"" that ""shook buildings"", and another said they saw about 10 ambulances driving to the scene. Police declared a major incident and are investigating the circumstances of the blast. This video can not be played Avonmouth explosion eyewitness describes the search for missing people Ch Insp Mark Runacres, from Avon and Somerset Police, said the explosion happened in a chemical tank at a water recycling centre. ""The fire service led the rescue operation but sadly, despite the best efforts of all those involved, there were four fatalities. ""This is a tragic incident and our thoughts and sympathies go out to them."" The families of those who died have been contacted. Police and paramedics were sent to the scene Luke Gazzard from Avon Fire and Rescue Service said the four people died at the scene and there was no report of a fire. He said emergency services had dealt with ""a very, very challenging incident"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet he was ""deeply saddened"" to learn of the loss of life in the explosion. ""Our hearts go out to the victims and their families. Thank you to the emergency services who attended the scene,"" he said. Colin Skellett, chief executive of Wessex Water, said the company's ""thoughts are with the families, friends and colleagues of those involved"". He said they were ""absolutely devastated that the tragic incident at our site earlier today has resulted in four fatalities"". The company is working with the Health and Safety Executive as part of the investigation. The silo holds treated biosolids before it is recycled as an organic soil conditioner, Ch Insp Runacres said. He said a ""thorough investigation involving a number of agencies"" would be carried out. ""I can reassure people living in the nearby area that there is not believed to be any ongoing public safety concerns."" Biosolids are ""treated sludge"", a by-product of the sewage treatment process. According to Wessex Water, the sludge is treated in anaerobic digesters, oxygen-free tanks, to produce agricultural fertiliser and renewable energy. People have been urged to avoid the area. An emergency services helicopter landed near the site Jawad Burhan, who took a photo appearing to show a tank that had exploded, said there was a ""helicopter looking for missing people"". ""I heard the sound, I'm working beside the building in another warehouse. ""After 10 minutes I saw the helicopter coming and the police."" Kieran Jenkins, who works nearby, said he was inside a warehouse when he heard a ""big bang"". ""The whole warehouse was shaking and we literally stood there in shock,"" he said. ""We thought everything was going to fall and we came out and all we could see was people running - it was a bit of a shock, really."" Bristol Waste, which runs the nearby Avonmouth recycling centre, tweeted it had closed the site temporarily. Lorry driver Ronan Doyle said he was parked off Kings Weston Lane about to enter the recycling plant when he heard the explosion. ""There was a quieter 'whoosh' first, followed by a much louder and more intense noise,"" he said. ""It sounded like someone had driven into the lorry - the noise was so loud it didn't sound like anything I've ever heard before and it was followed by a loud bang. ""I continued into the recycling centre and we have just locked ourselves in purely because our way out is blocked."" Sean Nolan, who witnessed the aftermath of the explosion, said he initially thought the noise was from a crash. ""I heard what I thought may have been two trucks colliding by the way it shook the ground... it was big. ""It was quite short-lived, I'd say about two or three seconds. Sort of a boom and echo and then it just went quiet. ""That was it. There was no smoke, there was no after-effects of it."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer gave his condolences on Twitter, writing: ""My thoughts are with all those who tragically lost their lives today in Avonmouth. My heart goes out to their friends and family."" Darren Jones, MP for Bristol North West, said: ""My family and I are keeping those affected in our thoughts and prayers, following the tragic consequences of the explosion in Avonmouth."" He was ""pleased that the situation has been contained and that there is no further risk to local people"". Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said: ""This has already been such a challenging year, and this news of further loss of life is another terrible blow. ""As a city we will mourn for them.""

"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December.

"The international vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, according to IBM. The company says it tracked a campaign aimed at the delivery ""cold chain"" used to keep vaccines at the right temperature during transportation. The attackers' identity is unclear - but IBM said the sophistication of their methods indicated a nation state. It follows warnings from governments - including the UK's - of countries targeting aspects of vaccine research. IBM says it believes the campaign started in September 2020. It says phishing emails were sent out across six countries, which targeted organisations linked to the Cold Chain Equipment Optimisation Platform (CCEOP) of Gavi, the international vaccine alliance. Gavi's partners include the World Health Organization, Unicef, the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. They help distribute vaccines around the world to some of the poorest regions. This sometimes requires a ""cold chain"". For example, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - which was not the specific target of this campaign - will need to be kept at a temperature of about -70C as it is moved about. The attackers impersonated a business executive from a legitimate Chinese company involved in CCEOP's supply cold chain to make it more likely the targets would engage with the email. They then sent phishing emails to organisations that provided transportation, which contained malicious code and asked for people's log in credentials. That could have allowed them to understand the infrastructure that governments intended to use to distribute vaccines. ""Advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy is likely a high-value and high-priority nation-state target,"" IBM says. IBM says the wider targeting included: the European Commission's Directorate General Taxation and Customs Union companies involved in manufacturing solar panels, which can be used to keep vaccines cold in places where reliable power is not available a South Korean software-development company a German website-development company, which supports clients associated with pharmaceutical manufacturers, container transport, biotechnology and manufacturers of electrical components for communications This video can not be played Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world. IBM says the campaign was uncovered by a security team it set up at the start of the pandemic to track down Covid-19 cyber-threats. ""The precision targeting and nature of the specific targeted organisations potentially point to nation-state activity,"" the US company said. ""Without a clear path to a [pay]out, cyber-criminals are unlikely to devote the time and resources required to execute such a calculated operation."" IBM says it has notified those targeted as well as law-enforcement authorities. The US'sCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) has issued an alert,externalencouraging organisations associated with the storage and transport of a vaccineto be on guard for the kind of attacks linked to IBM's report,external. In July, the UK warned Russian intelligence had targeted UK vaccine research, including at Oxford. The US also warned of Chinese hacking, while, more recently, Microsoft said it had seen North Korean and Russian hackers targeting vaccine research. Officials suggested the activity so far had been about intelligence gathering rather than disruption of any research.

"The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is one of two being rolled out across the UK. The government aims to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by mid-February and has got off to a strong start, with more than four million jabs administered. The vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus. It is a new type of jab called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack. The genetic material is encased in a tiny protective bubble of fat to get it into cells. The exact ingredients of the vaccine have not been made public, but other vaccines can contain other ingredients, like aluminium, to make them stable or more effective. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? This is the first RNA vaccine to be approved for use in humans. The concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases. The vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, who will decide whether the jab can be approved for use. NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, and the over 80s are first in line to receive the two vaccines being rolled out in the UK - Pfizer and Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab. About half of over-80s in the UK have now been vaccinated. People in England in their 70s, and those listed as clinically extremely vulnerable, are now beginning to receiving their offers of a jab. Out of the nine priority groups, those aged 50-54 are at the bottom of the current list. There will be a second phase, which will offer the vaccine to the other groups in the population. The vaccine was initially delivered in hospitals. It is now also being administered through GPs and care homes, as well as local vaccination centres in venues such as sports halls andmass vaccination hubsin places like cathedrals and sports halls. However, there are logistical challenges for the Pfizer vaccine: It must be keptat -70C during transportation The jab must be thawed before it is given to a patient It can be stored in a normal fridge for a few days before being used How do the Covid vaccines compare? It is impossible to know and we will find out only by waiting. If immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have annual vaccines, as we do for flu. The vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old and data from its phase three trial suggestsit works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities. Early evidencesuggests the Pfizer vaccine is likely to protect against a coronavirus variant that is spreading around the UK. Some people - such as those with a weak immune system - will not be able to have the vaccine. Nothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks. The data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects, such as headaches and muscle aches, have been reported. If there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent. However, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised. Hopefully yes, but not for some time. If enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures. However, the manufacture and distribution of a vaccine will take some time. So testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet. The vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property. They already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of this year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further. We do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups. These will be crucial for understanding how it will be used. About a dozen vaccines are in the final development stages. The Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab is also being used in the UK, and supplies of the approved Moderna vaccine should arrive in the spring.

"The UK becomes first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths, according to official figures Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than UK England's deputy chief medical officer hails Pfizer vaccine approval but says ""we have to take it really carefully"" Education secretary says UK got vaccine first because it is a ""better country"" than France, Belgium and US Moscow announces start of immunisation programme on Saturday, using Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine US has record number of new daily cases - almost 200,000 - as hospitalisations double since early November Facebook to take down false vaccine claims to prevent ""imminent physical harm"" International vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, IBM says Edited by Paul Gribben and Robert Greenall As our live page draws to a close, here is a round-up of the main coronavirus news today.   Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italy responded to a recent surge in cases with a new round of restrictions It was a milestone Italians knew would be a matter of time before they hit: the day when the country would exceed the highest death toll of the first
wave â 969 on 27 March. And now itâs happened. With 993 deaths
recorded in the past 24 hours, Italy has had its deadliest day of the pandemic.
The numbers are hard to fathom. The chink of light is that the infection rate is gradually
decreasing. While cases remain high âabove 23,000 today â the rate of positive
results to number of tests has decreased in the past week from 12.4% to 10.2%.
The curve is flattening. But as in the first wave, it takes time for the death
toll to catch up, since many of todayâs fatalities were infected around the
peak of the second wave in early November. After grim figures, Italians are bracing themselves for a
less-than-happy Christmas with tightened restrictions. Theyâll be banned from
moving between regions, forced to self-isolate if they come into the country
from abroad, ordered to obey night-time curfews around Christmas Day and New
Year and told only to celebrate Christmas lunch with close family. This country
has been devastated by the first and now the second wave. It fears a third.  The US Supreme Court has ordered a lower court to reconsider a challenge to pandemic-related restrictions on religious services in California. The ruling sided with a church that had challenged the policy as unconstitutional religious discrimination, throwing out a lower court  ruling rejecting their case. The Harvest Rock Church and Harvest International Ministry has more than 160 churches in the state, according to AP news agency. California Governor Gavin Newsom has put heavy restrictions on religious services amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Under the current rules, houses of worship in the stateâs worst-hit areas cannot hold indoor gatherings. Elsewhere, there are restrictions on capacity. The ruling on Thursday came after the Supreme Court last week barred New York from enforcing certain limits on attendance at churches and synagogues. Quarantine rules are set to be eased for business travellers in England, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. From 04:00 GMT on Saturday, 5 December, the following people will no longer need to self-isolate when returning to England from a country not in a travel corridor:  For business travellers, their trips must result in a deal which creates or preserves 50 jobs or leads to a Â£100,000 investment or order, according to the Department for Transport. Read more on this story here Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were joined at Soho Theatre by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have been visiting entertainment venues in Soho, London, today to find out how the arts and entertainment sector has been coping during the pandemic. The couple were treated to an intimate performance at Soho Theatre - of the one-woman play Half Breed by Natasha Marshall. The actress revealed she had to dash from her Morrisons supermarket job to do the gig in front of the royals and was still wearing her uniform. She told the prince and his wife: ""I've got to go back later so it was easier to keep it on, I'll be in such a rush. ""The theatre has supported me so much I jumped at the chance to perform today."" Charles replied: ""That's marvellous, such dedication. I really enjoyed the performance and I am praying all of you can open soon."" Many entertainment venues are battling to stay in business because of the restrictions Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics So far, wave two has been lower
and slower than wave one. About 80% of deaths involving
coronavirus happened before August, and most of those happened in just one
month. Almost 10,000 coronavirus
deaths a week were registered in consecutive weeks in April. In this second wave, it looks
like the peak figures â assuming infections keep falling before widespread
vaccination takes place â might be closer to 3,000 than 4,000. And, as in wave one, those over
75 account for about 75% of the deaths, suggesting that vaccinating over-75s
could stem the vast majority of future deaths. This time around, the spread
of deaths around the country has looked quite different. In the spring and summer,
London and the North West of England each accounted for about 15% of
coronavirus deaths in the UK. But in this wave, Londonâs
share is down, closer to 5% whereas the North West is just under 25%. As the UK becomes the first European country to record a death toll of over 60,000, the daily reported deaths remain high at an average of 441 over the last 7 days. But confirmed cases show a marked fall following England's nationwide lockdown and stricter measures elsewhere in the UK. It also seems to have had an impact on daily hospital admissions, which have fallen to an average of 1,395 a day in the seven days up to 26 November, from a high of 1765 a day on 11 November. Dr Anthony Fauci was challenged over the vaccine's earlier availability in the UK UK ministers have been making their quick approval of the Pfizer vaccine a point of national pride, with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson facing criticism for claiming the speed was due to the UK being a ""much better country"" than European rivals. But the top US infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, hasaccused the UK of being less rigorous in its approval process. ""The UK did not do it as carefully,"" he told Fox News. ""If you go quickly and you do it superficially, people are not going to want to get vaccinated."" Fauci was facing criticism that the US was behind the UK in receiving the vaccine, but said there was only a difference of ""a couple of days"" and promised that US approval would come ""very soon"". He did not detail any specific issues with the UK approvals process. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, responsible for approving the vaccine, said it had accelerated the process by conducting a rolling review of Pfizer's data, starting at the beginning of October. ""We have rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review,â the agency said. Portugal's health minister has said that the country's citizens will receive Covid-19 vaccines for free via the public health service. Marta Temido
said 22 million doses would be bought for â¬200m. Vaccinations will start in January and nearly a million people will be given shots in the first phase. The country has six agreements for vaccines, including with AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, according to drugs regulator Infarmed. Earlier officials said the country had passed the peak of the ""second wave"" of the virus, which occurred between 12 and 15 November. Restrictions introduced last month include mandatory remote working and
a nightly curfew for the vast majority of the population, and a weekend
curfew in areas deemed to be at very high or extremely high risk, including
Lisbon and Porto. Portugal has had a total of 303,846 confirmed coronavirus cases since the
start of the epidemic and 4,645 deaths associated with Covid-19. The UK government's coronavirus figures suggest that for three months the average number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test was fewer than 50 deaths per day. But, as we have reported, on Monday the number of people who have died has increased to a total of 60,113 - up 414 in the past 24 hours. There have been a further 14,879 cases, as daily cases continue on a downward trend. As the latest government figures have confirmed, more than 60,000 people in
the UK have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. According to data from John Hopkins University,external, only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK. The UK government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest therehave been more than 69,000 deaths by this measure,external. The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland - which measure excess deaths - show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. The UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths,according to the latest government figures,external. A total of 60,113 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 414 in the past 24 hours. Two other ways of measuring deaths - where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate, and the number of ""excess deaths"" for this time of year - give higher total figures. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK,according to data from Johns Hopkins University,external. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics In
the week to 29 November, 87% of the nearly 90,000 beds in English hospitals
were occupied. This
is largely unchanged since the first week of November, when NHS England first
published these figures. The
NHS is meant to keep at least a 10th of its beds free to create flexibility to
admit patients and cope with surges in demand. But
a single number doesnât tell the full story. It
doesnât include the Nightingale hospitals that provide extra capacity, or the
beds that have been freed by cancelling operations. Or
that the pressures arenât evenly spread. Some
hospitals like North Middlesex, Southport & Ormskirk, Surrey &
Sussex, and Wrightington, Wigan & Leigh have more than 95% of beds taken. More
hospitals have seen capacity free up this month than have seen it tighten. But
as we move into the months that, in any year, put the most stress on capacity
within the NHS, all eyes will be on these figures. BBC World News This video can not be played Coronavirus: Normality is 'years away' despite vaccines A complete return to normal life after the coronavirus pandemic is years away, Prof Dale Fisher, chairman of the World Health Organisation's global outbreak and response network has said. He told BBC World News: ""I think over the next year or two things will loosen up quite a lot. I think we will eventually get back to normal but will that take three years or 10 years, I don't know."" He said there were a number of challenges ahead with the distribution of vaccines, including encouraging people to have them and not get complacent about the risks from the virus as time went on. Prof Fisher was speaking to Lucy Hocking. Care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the Covid vaccine from 14 December, the Scottish health secretary has confirmed. There had been concerns about getting doses to care homes because of issues with transporting small doses. But Jeanne Freeman said some of those issues had been addressed, making it possible to take the vaccine to homes. The first batches of the vaccine, which arrive in Scotland on Tuesday, will be given to health staff. Read morehere. Nick BeakeBrussels Correspondent, BBC News An exasperated sigh sums up
the reaction from a number of European
capitals to the vaccine victory
proclamations of some British government ministers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonâs sweeping
assessment that the UK is a âbetterâ country than many of its allies was seen
as particularly bold. One senior diplomat told me
he was delighted Britons would soon be receiving the vaccine, but that âsomeone
should remind Mr Williamson that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was created by a
German company, founded by scientists of Turkish origin, in partnership with
an American distributor, and is being manufactured in Belgium before being
transported across France to reach the UKâ. The claim that Brexit allowed the UK to approve the vaccine faster than other Europe countries has been disproved, but it does reflect once again a different path the UK is taking. All EU countries have the option to follow the UK example and let their domestic
drug regulator issue emergency approval, but the bloc says it wants to wait for
the European Medicines Agency to give the green light on all their behalf. But if the
Europe-wide delivery of a vaccine which promises to end the coronavirus misery
for millions is pushed back, there will likely be more voices asking: âWhy canât
we have what the Brits have already got?â.  We have more on the latest figures in the US where there have been a record number of cases. As we mentioned earlier, new cases rose by a record 195,695 on Wednesday. These graphs show the extent of the problem faced by health services there.  The number of people in hospital passed 100,000 for the first time, a figure that has doubled since early November, Covid Tracking Project data showed.  And deaths have risen quickly in recent weeks too - the daily death toll of 2,733 was close to a new high.  Nationwide, infections are now closing in on 14 million, with more than 264,000 deaths, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. Asda has become the latest supermarket to return business rates relief it has received from the UK government during the pandemic, announcing it will repay Â£340m. It follows similar moves by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi and means the grocers will collectively return more than Â£1.7bn. Supermarkets had been allowed to stay open during the lockdown while non-essential shops had to close. Asda said its costs in dealing with Covid had outweighed any state support. But its president and chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: ""As the hope of a vaccine and a more 'normal' life returning in 2021 grows, we have confidence that we are in a strong position to again do the right thing for the communities we serve."" Earlier, England's deputy chief medical officer answered questions from members of the public about Covid-19, including on vaccine safety and effectiveness, in a live BBC News special. Here are some of the highlights, from giving vaccine advice to his mum,  rolling out another football analogy and Father Christmas' position on the vaccine priority list.

"This video can not be played Ch Insp Mark Runacres of Avon and Somerset Police: ""Sadly... there have been four fatalities"" Four people have died and another has been injured in a large explosion at a waste water treatment works. Firefighters were called to Wessex Water's premises in Avonmouth, Bristol, at about 11:20 GMT. Three of the people who died worked for the firm, and the other was a contractor. The injured person's condition is not life-threatening. The blast happened in a silo containing treated biosolids and was not terror related, police said. A witness reported hearing a ""very loud explosion"" that ""shook buildings"", and another said they saw about 10 ambulances driving to the scene. Police declared a major incident and are investigating the circumstances of the blast. This video can not be played Avonmouth explosion eyewitness describes the search for missing people Ch Insp Mark Runacres, from Avon and Somerset Police, said the explosion happened in a chemical tank at a water recycling centre. ""The fire service led the rescue operation but sadly, despite the best efforts of all those involved, there were four fatalities. ""This is a tragic incident and our thoughts and sympathies go out to them."" The families of those who died have been contacted. Police and paramedics were sent to the scene Luke Gazzard from Avon Fire and Rescue Service said the four people died at the scene and there was no report of a fire. He said emergency services had dealt with ""a very, very challenging incident"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet he was ""deeply saddened"" to learn of the loss of life in the explosion. ""Our hearts go out to the victims and their families. Thank you to the emergency services who attended the scene,"" he said. Colin Skellett, chief executive of Wessex Water, said the company's ""thoughts are with the families, friends and colleagues of those involved"". He said they were ""absolutely devastated that the tragic incident at our site earlier today has resulted in four fatalities"". The company is working with the Health and Safety Executive as part of the investigation. The silo holds treated biosolids before it is recycled as an organic soil conditioner, Ch Insp Runacres said. He said a ""thorough investigation involving a number of agencies"" would be carried out. ""I can reassure people living in the nearby area that there is not believed to be any ongoing public safety concerns."" Biosolids are ""treated sludge"", a by-product of the sewage treatment process. According to Wessex Water, the sludge is treated in anaerobic digesters, oxygen-free tanks, to produce agricultural fertiliser and renewable energy. People have been urged to avoid the area.

""We thought everything was going to fall and we came out and all we could see was people running - it was a bit of a shock, really."" Bristol Waste, which runs the nearby Avonmouth recycling centre, tweeted it had closed the site temporarily. Lorry driver Ronan Doyle said he was parked off Kings Weston Lane about to enter the recycling plant when he heard the explosion. ""There was a quieter 'whoosh' first, followed by a much louder and more intense noise,"" he said. ""It sounded like someone had driven into the lorry - the noise was so loud it didn't sound like anything I've ever heard before and it was followed by a loud bang. ""I continued into the recycling centre and we have just locked ourselves in purely because our way out is blocked.""

"Fans returned to football grounds on Wednesday after the latest lockdown in England was lifted The Premier League and English Football League have agreed a Â£250m rescue package to help ease the financial challenge faced by EFL clubs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The EFL will be assisted in getting a Â£200m loan for Championship clubs. A Â£50m grant has been agreed for League One and Two clubs. EFL chairman Rick Parry said it was a ""welcome, tangible commitment to the professional game at a time when it has needed it most"". The Premier League will pay up to Â£15m to help the EFL secure a Â£200m loan which it will then lend to Championship clubs interest free. Loans are capped at Â£8.33m per club and must be repaid by June 2024. The Â£50m rescue package for Leagues One and Two is split into two parts - Â£30m will be paid to the 48 clubs as a grant based on missed gate receipts from the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons. League One clubs will receive a minimum payment of Â£375,000 League Two clubs will receive a minimum payment of Â£250,000 The remaining Â£15m will be distributed using a lost gate revenue share calculation A further Â£20m monitored grant will be provided and clubs can apply based on need. A joint Premier League and EFL panel will determine club eligibility. Clubs receiving a monitored grant will be subject to restrictions with respect to transfer spend and player wages. ""Our over-arching aim throughout this process has been to ensure that all EFL clubs survive the financial impact of the pandemic,"" said Parry. ""I am pleased that we have now reached a resolution on behalf of our clubs and, as we have maintained throughout, this will provide much-needed support and clarity following months of uncertainty."" Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said: ""The Premier League is a huge supporter of the football pyramid and is well aware of the important role clubs play in their communities. Our commitment is that no EFL club need go out of business due to Covid-19. ""We are very pleased to have reached this agreement and we stand together with the EFL in our commitment to protect all clubs in these unprecedented times."" Since March, football has been played behind closed doors until restrictions were lifted in some areas of England this week, meaning clubs have missed out on vital matchday revenue. In October, EFL clubs rejected the Premier League's proposed Â£50m rescue package for League One and Two clubs, saying it ""falls some way short"" of the required amount. Top-flight clubs made the offer afterdeciding not to pursue Project Big Picture. But in November, clubs ""agreed in principle"" for those in League One and Two to receive the package from the Premier League. The agreement came two days after after a parliamentary committee heard that10 EFL clubs were struggling to pay wages. The EFL board approved the deal on Thursday before Premier League shareholders then gave their final approval to the agreement. ""I warmly welcome this deal between the Premier League and the EFL which provides up to Â£250m support to help clubs through Covid,"" said culture secretary Oliver Dowden. ""Fans are starting to return and we look forward to building on this as soon as it's safe. ""With a Â£250m support package for men's elite football andÂ£300m government fundingfor women's football, the National League and other major spectator sports, we have fuel in the tank to get clubs and sports through this."" Julian Knight MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said he welcomed the rescue package but criticised the delay in agreeing the deal, adding: ""This fiasco is evidence of a lack of accountability within football's governance structure."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan Amid an unprecedented financial crisis after nine months without gate receipts, this will come as a major relief to many cash-strapped clubs in Leagues One and Two, and to the government, which had been applying pressure on the Premier League to do more to support the rest of the game ever since it was allowed to resume last season. With no money given to professional men's football in the government's recent Â£300m bailout, and several clubs facing ruin, the fear was that the league structure faced collapse if a deal was not agreed, so after the return of fans for the first time in nine months this week, this news represents another positive step. Some will note that given the billions of pounds the top-flight clubs generate from TV deals, it can easily afford a contribution of Â£65m, and could have done more to help their counterparts on whom they often rely for talent. Others will question how Championship clubs will be able to pay back the millions they are now able to borrow. But at a time when Premier League clubs are also losing significant amounts as a result of Covid, persuading them to give away vast sums was never going to be simple. Many in the game have questioned why football clubs should be expected to help poorer businesses in a way not seen in other industries. Others, however, will welcome a hugely significant agreement after months of unedifying deadlock between leagues and politicians that has done little for the reputation of the sport. A number of Premier League managers have complained about being restricted to using three substitutes, saying the number should be raised to five, in line with all major European leagues, Uefa club competitions and the EFL. Liverpool bossJurgen Klopp said last weekthat on a recent manager's call, 15 top-flight bosses were in favour of a change, with only five against - enough to get it passed. However, withtwo votes having already gone againstthe proposal, the Premier League did not put the matter up for debate at Thursday's shareholders' meeting and no club put it forward, so the rule will remain as it is until at least the next meeting.

"This video can not be played Lord Maginnis is not going to take part in âbehaviour training"" after using âhomophobic and offensive"" language Lord Maginnis of Drumglass should be suspended from the Lords for at least 18 months over bullying and harassment claims, a standards watchdog has said. The independent Ulster Unionist broke the rules in his conduct towards four people and used ""homophobic and offensive"" language, it was found. The Lords Conduct Committee ordered the ex-MP and soldier to take ""behaviour training"" or face a longer ban. But he told the BBC he would refuse to do so. Asked if that would mean a greater punishment, he said: ""So be it."" Lord Maginnis denied bullying and harassment and called the committee's report ""ridiculous"", adding that he was the victim of a campaign against him, involving the LGBT rights charity Stonewall. But Stonewall said he should ""step up and accept responsibility for his behaviour and apologise to those he has hurt"". Defending his stance, Lord Maginnis told BBC Radio Ulster: ""I've held responsible positions all my life,. ""At 83 years of age, I'm not going to be dictated to in this way."" Lord Maginnis accused of verbal abuse in Parliament Complaints against Lord Maginnis were made by Parliamentary security officer Christian Bombolo, SNP MP Hannah Bardell and Labour MPs Luke Pollard and Toby Perkins. He was accused of verbally abusing Mr Bombolo when asked to show his security pass in January, with Ms Bardell saying he became rude and aggressive when she intervened. Ms Bardell later told the House of Commons it was ""one of the worst cases of abuse of security staff"" she had witnessed. At the time, The Huffington Post website quoted Lord Maginnis as saying in response: ""Queers like Ms Bardell don't particularly annoy me."" It was also claimed that, in February, he sent an email about other parliamentarians containing a homophobic subject line. And he was accused of making homophobic remarks about Ms Bardell and Mr Pollard at a breakfast meeting hosted by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Armed Forces in March. The Lords Commissioner for Standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrief, who carried out an investigation into Lord Maginnis, previously recommended a ban of nine months. He appealed against this, but the committee found he had shown ""very little insight into the impact of his behaviour on the complainants, and no remorse for the upset he had caused"". Instead, it added, he had ""portrayed himself as a victim of a conspiracyâ¦ and continued to refer to the complainants in a disobliging and sometimes offensive manner"". Following the publication ofthe report,external, Ms Bardell told BBC Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie that she had received death threats after speaking in the Commons about Lord Maginnis's behaviour. She added that it was ""total nonsense"" to suggest she was behind a ""conspiracy"" against the peer. Ms Bardell also said she was ""disappointed"" by the recommendation of a ban for Lord Maginnis and that ""in any normal workplace anywhere in the UK, this would be a sackable offence"". Lord Maginnis, who was the Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone from 1983 to 2001 having previously served in the Ulster Defence Regiment, became a life peer in 2001. The House of Lords will decide on 7 December whether to bring the recommended ban into force.

"Asda has announced it will repay Â£340m of business rates relief it has received during the pandemic. It follows similar moves by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi and means the grocers will collectively return more than Â£1.7bn. Supermarkets, whose sales have boomed in the crisis, have been criticised for taking government help while paying dividends to shareholders. Asda said its costs of dealing with Covid had outweighed any state support. But its president and chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: ""As the hope of a vaccine and a more 'normal' life returning in 2021 grows, we have confidence that we are in a strong position to again do the right thing for the communities we serve."" Earlier on Thursday, Sainsbury's said it would hand back Â£440m of rates relief it had received, followed by Aldi which pledged to repay Â£100m. It was followed by discount retailer B&M, which said it would forgo Â£80m of rates relief. B&M stores sell some food, alongside homewares, toys and electrical goods. On Wednesday, Tesco and Morrisons promised to repay Â£850m between them. Both Sainsbury's and Aldi said the decision reflected the fact they had been allowed to stay open in lockdown while non-essential shops had to close. Labour said big supermarkets had ""done the decent thing"" but urged the government to pass on the Â£1.7bn handed back already to hard-hit businesses such as pubs and restaurants operating under the new tier system. The Treasury said any funds returned would ""support the ongoing efforts to protect people's jobs and incomes"". Asda has recently been bought by the UK-based billionaire Issa brothers and private equity firm TDR Capital from Walmart of the US in a deal valuing the supermarket chain at Â£6.8bn. Mr Burnley said: ""Almost half our customers are telling us they expect their financial position to worsen in the next 12 months and we recognise that there are other industries and businesses for whom the effects of Covid-19 will be much more long lasting and whose survival is essential to thousands of jobs."" He said Asda would discuss with the government and devolved authorities the best way to return the money ""to ensure the relief we have received can go towards helping those that need it most"". Supermarkets repay rates relief after backlash Sainsbury's to cut 3,500 jobs and shut Argos shops Sainsbury's said that its sales had been ""stronger than originally expected"", despite it facing ""significant costs"" in the crisis. ""With regional restrictions likely to remain in place for some time, we believe it is now fair and right to forgo the business rates relief that we have been given on all Sainsbury's stores,"" boss Simon Roberts said. ""We are very mindful that non-essential retailers and many other businesses have been forced to close again in the second lockdown and we hope that this goes some way towards helping them."" Giles Hurley, boss of Aldi UK, said returning the full value of its business rates was ""the right decision to help support the nation"". In March, all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England were given a business rates holiday for 12 months to help them get through the crisis. But MPs have criticised supermarkets for taking around Â£1.9bn in help while paying dividends to shareholders, calling it an ""absolute scandal"". The UK's supermarkets have seen a sales boom during the pandemic, albeit with higher costs. The big four grocers - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - are also receiving an estimated Â£1 in every Â£6 of all the business rates relief offered by the government. They have come under political fire amid concerns that this help from the taxpayer could've been given to other parts of the retail or hospitality sectors that are still in survival mode - especially since some of the supermarket groups have also been paying dividends to shareholders. Tesco went first and that piled the pressure on its main rivals to immediately follow suit. It says it is simply doing the right thing but some suspect Tesco's move will also help smooth the way for a bumper Â£5bn special dividend pay-out following the sale of its Asian business. And for all of them, there may have been fears about being hit by a possible government windfall tax in the future. Earlier this month, Mr Roberts defended Sainsbury's decision to pay out Â£230m to investors at a time when the chain is also cutting 3,500 jobs and vowing to close 420 Argos stores as part of a restructuring plan. The company pointed out it had taken no money from the government's furlough wage support scheme. However, it will hang on to a further Â£40m of business rates relief for its Argos stores, which as non-essential shops had to close in the lockdowns. Tesco announced on Wednesday it would repay rates relief On Wednesday, Tesco said it would repay Â£585m after it had been criticised over investor payouts. Morrisons also announced it had ""brought forward"" a decision on rates relief and would pay back Â£274m. Kathleen Brooks, of financial analysts Minerva, told the BBC that supermarkets had faced ""a lot of political and media pressure to follow suit"". Some would also see it as a way to avoid having to ""answer to government"", as banks had to after being bailed out in the 2008 financial crisis. However, other grocers have said they will not repay the rates relief. Marks and Spencer, which reported a half year loss and has cancelled its dividend for 2020, said the government support had been ""much-needed"" during ""incredibly challenging circumstances"". While the retailer sells food, most of its clothing and homeware store space has had to close during the lockdowns. On Wednesday, the Co-op said the amount it had spent on protecting staff and customers outweighed the savings from rates relief. But the retailer added it would consider its position on government support again at the end of the year. Waitrose-owner the John Lewis Partnership said the relief would help offset the ""significant"" sales lost while its John Lewis shops were closed, as well as money spent on staying secure from Covid. ""The outlook remains incredibly uncertain and government support remains crucial to help us navigate the crisis,"" it said.

"Top: Rebekah Walker, James Cusack, Robyn Richford, Darcy Kelly, Shay Sade, Vicky Hawkesworth, Jevanni Letford; Bottom: Ellen Macleod, Dean McCullough, Shivani Dave, Rakeem Omar, Kerrie Cosh Radio 1 has announced its guest presenters for the festive period. From Boxing Day until New Year's Day, 33 new faces will take over the airwaves in the station's second guest-presenter takeover. The station put the call out for DJs and presenters in October. ""I can't wait to hear our latest batch of presenters on air over the festive period, and I look forward to seeing what 2021 has in store for them all,"" says Head of Radio 1 Aled Haydn Jones. Many of the selected presenters have taken an unconventional route to their first slot on Radio 1, including Will Kirk from Sheffield, whose day job is in marketing. Will Kirk was diagnosed with hearing loss when he was seven months old Will, 22, has severe-to-profound hearing loss in both ears and wears hearing aids - he will be Radio 1's first deaf or hard-of-hearing DJ. ""I got my first hearing aid at 11 months old. It's something I've always known, that's always been a part of me. ""I like to make a good joke because I can't change it so I might as well make people laugh about it."" In terms of music, there are ""a few hiccups"", Will admits, such as headphones. He says there's lots of experimenting to try and get into the best position. ""Even now, the solutions I've got aren't perfect, but you have to keep trying to find new things and new ways of doing things."" Will hopes to be able to inspire people by presenting on Radio 1. ""To come up and have DJing as a hobby when you are deaf just seems like a ridiculous combination - but just go for it."" 'I'm excited to represent the blind crew on Radio 1' Radio 1 announces new presenter line-up He adds there's always ways to work around it. ""I'm sure anybody that's disabled will say you can find a way to get things done and don't let anything pull you down - including yourself. Don't pull yourself down about anything, just go out there and do it."" Jevanni Letford, from East London, qualified as a lawyer before moving into a career in radio and music - and is now the official tour DJ for KSI. ""It feels amazing and I am absolutely honoured. Having been DJing for over 10 years and putting in the work, this makes all of the journey to date feel worthwhile,"" the 31-year-old says. Nels will become the first black broadcaster to present the Radio 1 Rock Show Several of the presenters began their journeys in student, local, community or hospital radio, including 24-year-old Nels Hylton, who has previously volunteered at the University of Portsmouth's Pure FM and at community station Transmission Roundhouse. He will become the first black presenter to host Radio 1's Rock Show. ""It's really humbling to be selected as part of Radio 1's Christmas line-up, even more so to be the first black broadcaster to present the Radio 1 Rock Show. I can't wait to host the show and prove that rock music is for everybody,"" he said. The first Christmas takeover took place in 2019, with three of the presenterssecuring roleson Radio 1. Sian Eleri will become the new host of BBC Music Introducing on Radio 1 in January, and Joel Mitchell and Fee Mak will each take a turn at hosting Radio 1's Early Breakfast on Fridays in the new year.

"This video can not be played The new rules are ""confusing"" says Veronica Gay People will be able to travel from Wales to tier one and two areas in England and Scotland from Friday. The new regulations prohibit travel into tier three zones in England, tiers three and four in Scotland and the whole of Northern Ireland. Previously people couldonly travel out of Wales if it was ""essential"". But the Welsh Government said it still strongly advised people against travelling to other parts of the UK to help control the spread of the virus. The new rules - which includes Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafesbanning serving alcoholand shutting daily at 18:00 GMT - will come into force at 18:00 on Friday. Q&A: Can people from Wales go to England to drink? Here's how to find out which tier an area of England is in England's lockdown ended on 2 December and it now has athree-tiered system. The Scottish government has afive-level alert systemof Covid-19 restrictions. It means for people in Wales, travel to London will be possible, but not Birmingham or Bristol. Large parts of the Midlands, North East and North West, including Manchester, as well as Kent,are in tier three. A majority of England is in the second highest level - tier two - including London and Liverpool city region. Wales has different coronavirus rules to England The new regulations were announced after the cabinet met on Wednesday to decide on the latest travel restrictions as England's lockdown came to an end. The rules will be reviewed on 17 December. Mandy Symonds has owned The Boat Inn in the border town of Chepstow in Monmouthshire for 18 months. She said she was ""gutted""  when she realised the new regulations meant her customers could go into England - ""a 20 second walk away"" - to drink alcohol in a pub when she could not serve them any. ""I'm closingâ¦ everything's stacked against you,"" she said. The owner of The Boat Inn in Chepstow says she feels like everything is stacked against Wales' pubs ""It's a mockery. I feel like he [First Minister Mark Drakeford] is deliberately trying to drive us out of business. ""The rules should be the same all over the countryâ¦ ""I've spent so much money here, invested in a marquee and put heating in there, lost half our tables, put screens up, staff are wearing masks, there's track and traceâ¦ I feel beaten down over it all now."" She said she did not know when she would reopen but it would depend on restrictions. Clare Davenport says the lifting of the travel rules will make little difference to her Boundary Lane in Saltney is the border between Wales and England. Claire Davenport lives in Flintshire but works on the English side of the border. She said the lifting of travel restrictions would not affect her too much. ""My family tend to keep within Wales and don't go into England really because we've got Broughton shopping park. But it was hectic there on Monday with people from England coming in,"" she said. Veronica Gay says the rules have been confusing for people on the border Veronica Gay, who represents Saltney on Flintshire council, said: ""My heart goes out to people who live on the border because you have a routine and you don't even think about it. ""You don't think 'now I'm in England' or 'now I'm in Wales'. It's been so confusing. ""But the people on Boundary Lane on the Welsh side haven't been able to go to Asda just across the road on the England side."" Conservative member of the Senedd (MS) Darren Millar said: ""While any lifting of travel restrictions between Wales and England is to be welcomed, there can be no doubt that this news will rub salt in the wounds of the Welsh hospitality industry. How many people can get together at Christmas? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales ""With Welsh pubs, cafes and restaurants being banned from selling alcohol on their premises from 6pm tomorrow, many of their customers will be taking their custom and cash across the border to enjoy a tipple with a meal in England instead."" He urged the Welsh Government to ""rethink its new rules"" and ""engage with leaders the hospitality industry"". Part of Broadstone Park campsite is in Gloucestershire, England, and half in Monmouthshire, Wales Jeff Revill owns the Broadstone Park campsite, half of which is in Gloucestershire, England, and half in Monmouthshire, Wales. He has faced issues such as guests on the English side of the site being unable to use the only shower block which is in Wales - after looking into it he was told it was an essential journey. He said the new regulations made things easier for the business: ""I can bounce between the two borders nowâ¦ it means we can get our glamping pods open again and there would be no issue [in people staying at the site] popping to Monmouth and back. ""It will be back to business as usualâ¦ hopefully we can pick up a little bit of business now heading into the spring."" The easing of restrictions comes ahead of additional rules for Christmas, whenthree households from around the UKwill be able to meet from 23 December until at least 27 December. The new regulations mean Frank and Margaret Clarke, who live in Mold, Flintshire, are able to travel to Churton in Cheshire - which is in tier two - where their son and his family live. But they said they were unsure what the new rules meant for seeing their grandchildren, aged six, four and six months. Frank and Margaret Clarke moved from Norfolk to Mold in Flintshire to be closer to their son who lives in Churton, Cheshire ""We have been on WhatsApp and FaceTime... our daughter in law had a baby but we haven't been able to go over and help,"" said Mr Clarke. ""It's been a difficult time for us - we can go and see them but we can't go inside and we're not sure if they can come into our house. ""We are trying to be sensible because of our age."" Geoffrey Shone, 65, from Rossett in Wrexham, said he found the rules too difficult to understand. ""I don't understand half the rules properly. It's the way they are put,"" he said. He said he did not know if the rules meant he could see his cousins over the border in Dodleston, Cheshire - that area is in tier two so under the new rules he could travel there. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""There will be no restrictions on travel within Wales but we need to have some restrictions on travel across the border to those parts of the UK where infection rates are high to prevent the spread of coronavirus."" He advised people in Wales not to travel into parts of England and Scotland where the infection rate is lower, ""to help prevent them taking coronavirus with them"". ""Coronavirus doesn't respect borders,"" he said. ""We all have a part to play in keeping Wales and the UK safe. ""Please think carefully about where you are going and what you are doing. This virus thrives wherever we come together with others."" The Welsh Government said the travel restrictions were likely to remain in place until at least January but will be kept under constant review. International travel restrictions will continue and are also likely to remain in place until at least January but will be kept under constant review, it added.

"Inverness Town Steeple, which rises from the city's centre, was damaged by an earthquake in 1816 Earthquakes are rare in Scotland and when they do occur they usually pass unnoticed, but the potential for a large damaging quake is taken seriously. In August 1816 an earthquake shook Scotland from the Pentland Firth coast in the north to Coldstream in the Borders. A man walking in the hills near Relugas in Moray told of hearing a sound like a ""rushing wind"". Furniture moved across floors in homes in Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire while elsewhere church bells rang out and dogs started howling. Scotland shaken by early-hours earthquake Skye quake caused 'house beams to creak' Inverness bore the brunt of the quake. Chimney tops and pieces of masonry fell from buildings and the Town Steeple was twisted out of shape. Ferrymen at a crossing between North Kessock at Inverness and the Black Isle told of their boat being rocked up and down as if by waves. But Scotland's largest known earthquake came 64 years later, in November 1880. The 5.2 local magnitude (ML) quake in Argyll was felt along the west coast of Scotland and out east as far as Perthshire. Lighthouse keepers in Lewis and Barra in the Western Isles and from Cape Wrath in Sutherland to the Mull of Galloway reported feeling it. August 1974 saw a 4.4ML earthquake which had its epicentre in Kintail in the north west Highlands. The quake was the largest in a ""swarm"" of more than 20 seismic events that occurred for several months into the following year. The Kessock Bridge at Inverness was designed to be ""quake-proof"" British Geological Survey (BGS), which records seismic activity across the world, detects up 300 quakes every year in the UK. Only about three of these events are usually felt by people or are heard as a deep rumbling sound or a loud bang. In August last year, people reported windows rattling and house beams creaking duringa small earthquake on the Isle of Skye. On Tuesday this week people in the west of Scotland were shaken by an earthquake in the early hours of the morning. The earthquake, with a magnitude of 3.3, according to British Geological Survey (BGS), happened just before 02:00. BGS said its epicentre was at Achnamara west of Lochgilphead in Argyll and Bute. More than 30 people reported the tremor, from as far away as Edinburgh and across Ireland. BGS said larger quakes with the potential to cause minor damage, such as those in the past, occur about every 38 years. In the UK, the most recent of these was a 5.2 magnitude earthquake was in February 2008 which wasfelt across England and parts of Wales,external. A man suffered a broken pelvis when a chimney collapsed in South Yorkshire. And precautions are taken for these larger earthquakes. For the first time in 10 years BGS has updated itsseismic hazard maps for the UK,external. It has been able to draw on larger data sets than have been previously available along with some new tools and methods to improve on its previous maps. The maps show where seismic events of varying strength may happen, and with what probability. They are used by engineers to help them decide whether buildings and other structures need to be designed to be ""earthquake resistant"". In Scotland, the Kessock road bridge and a nearby waste water pipe laid by Scottish Water have been designed to be ""quake-proof"". Loch Ness lies along part of the Great Glen Fault, an area linked to earthquakes in the Highlands But why do earthquakes occur in Scotland? Quakes are associated with a geological feature called a fault, which is a fracture or an area of fractures between two huge blocks of rock. During an earthquake there is a sudden movement between these blocks, such as one slipping down or up against the other. In Scotland, these faults can run for hundreds of miles. According to BGS, most Scottish earthquakes occur in western Scotland with events felt in places such asIslay in the Inner Hebridesand also Fort William and, in November last year,in Glen Coe. In the Highlands, one of the most active areas, seismic activity is related to what are known as the Highland Boundary Fault Zone, Great Glen Fault Zone, Strathconon Fault, Kinlochhourn Fault and the Loch Maree Fault. The Great Glen Fault is probably the best known of the fault zones. At least 300 miles (483 km) in length it cuts diagonally across the Highlands from Inverness to Fort William and has its origins in events that happened about 400 million years ago. It is home to the world-famous Loch Ness, just down the road from Inverness and its now long repaired earthquake-hit town steeple.

In the UK, the most recent of these was a 5.2 magnitude earthquake was in February 2008 which wasfelt across England and parts of Wales,external. A man suffered a broken pelvis when a chimney collapsed in South Yorkshire. And precautions are taken for these larger earthquakes. For the first time in 10 years BGS has updated itsseismic hazard maps for the UK,external. It has been able to draw on larger data sets than have been previously available along with some new tools and methods to improve on its previous maps. The maps show where seismic events of varying strength may happen, and with what probability. They are used by engineers to help them decide whether buildings and other structures need to be designed to be ""earthquake resistant"". In Scotland, the Kessock road bridge and a nearby waste water pipe laid by Scottish Water have been designed to be ""quake-proof"". Loch Ness lies along part of the Great Glen Fault, an area linked to earthquakes in the Highlands But why do earthquakes occur in Scotland? Quakes are associated with a geological feature called a fault, which is a fracture or an area of fractures between two huge blocks of rock. During an earthquake there is a sudden movement between these blocks, such as one slipping down or up against the other. In Scotland, these faults can run for hundreds of miles. According to BGS, most Scottish earthquakes occur in western Scotland with events felt in places such asIslay in the Inner Hebridesand also Fort William and, in November last year,in Glen Coe. In the Highlands, one of the most active areas, seismic activity is related to what are known as the Highland Boundary Fault Zone, Great Glen Fault Zone, Strathconon Fault, Kinlochhourn Fault and the Loch Maree Fault. The Great Glen Fault is probably the best known of the fault zones. At least 300 miles (483 km) in length it cuts diagonally across the Highlands from Inverness to Fort William and has its origins in events that happened about 400 million years ago. It is home to the world-famous Loch Ness, just down the road from Inverness and its now long repaired earthquake-hit town steeple.

"Asda has announced it will repay Â£340m of business rates relief it has received during the pandemic. It follows similar moves by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi and means the grocers will collectively return more than Â£1.7bn. Supermarkets, whose sales have boomed in the crisis, have been criticised for taking government help while paying dividends to shareholders. Asda said its costs of dealing with Covid had outweighed any state support. But its president and chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: ""As the hope of a vaccine and a more 'normal' life returning in 2021 grows, we have confidence that we are in a strong position to again do the right thing for the communities we serve."" Earlier on Thursday, Sainsbury's said it would hand back Â£440m of rates relief it had received, followed by Aldi which pledged to repay Â£100m. It was followed by discount retailer B&M, which said it would forgo Â£80m of rates relief. B&M stores sell some food, alongside homewares, toys and electrical goods. On Wednesday, Tesco and Morrisons promised to repay Â£850m between them. Both Sainsbury's and Aldi said the decision reflected the fact they had been allowed to stay open in lockdown while non-essential shops had to close. Labour said big supermarkets had ""done the decent thing"" but urged the government to pass on the Â£1.7bn handed back already to hard-hit businesses such as pubs and restaurants operating under the new tier system. The Treasury said any funds returned would ""support the ongoing efforts to protect people's jobs and incomes"". Asda has recently been bought by the UK-based billionaire Issa brothers and private equity firm TDR Capital from Walmart of the US in a deal valuing the supermarket chain at Â£6.8bn. Mr Burnley said: ""Almost half our customers are telling us they expect their financial position to worsen in the next 12 months and we recognise that there are other industries and businesses for whom the effects of Covid-19 will be much more long lasting and whose survival is essential to thousands of jobs."" He said Asda would discuss with the government and devolved authorities the best way to return the money ""to ensure the relief we have received can go towards helping those that need it most"". Supermarkets repay rates relief after backlash Sainsbury's to cut 3,500 jobs and shut Argos shops Sainsbury's said that its sales had been ""stronger than originally expected"", despite it facing ""significant costs"" in the crisis. ""With regional restrictions likely to remain in place for some time, we believe it is now fair and right to forgo the business rates relief that we have been given on all Sainsbury's stores,"" boss Simon Roberts said. ""We are very mindful that non-essential retailers and many other businesses have been forced to close again in the second lockdown and we hope that this goes some way towards helping them."" Giles Hurley, boss of Aldi UK, said returning the full value of its business rates was ""the right decision to help support the nation"". In March, all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England were given a business rates holiday for 12 months to help them get through the crisis. But MPs have criticised supermarkets for taking around Â£1.9bn in help while paying dividends to shareholders, calling it an ""absolute scandal"". The UK's supermarkets have seen a sales boom during the pandemic, albeit with higher costs. The big four grocers - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - are also receiving an estimated Â£1 in every Â£6 of all the business rates relief offered by the government. They have come under political fire amid concerns that this help from the taxpayer could've been given to other parts of the retail or hospitality sectors that are still in survival mode - especially since some of the supermarket groups have also been paying dividends to shareholders. Tesco went first and that piled the pressure on its main rivals to immediately follow suit. It says it is simply doing the right thing but some suspect Tesco's move will also help smooth the way for a bumper Â£5bn special dividend pay-out following the sale of its Asian business. And for all of them, there may have been fears about being hit by a possible government windfall tax in the future. Earlier this month, Mr Roberts defended Sainsbury's decision to pay out Â£230m to investors at a time when the chain is also cutting 3,500 jobs and vowing to close 420 Argos stores as part of a restructuring plan. The company pointed out it had taken no money from the government's furlough wage support scheme. However, it will hang on to a further Â£40m of business rates relief for its Argos stores, which as non-essential shops had to close in the lockdowns. Tesco announced on Wednesday it would repay rates relief On Wednesday, Tesco said it would repay Â£585m after it had been criticised over investor payouts. Morrisons also announced it had ""brought forward"" a decision on rates relief and would pay back Â£274m. Kathleen Brooks, of financial analysts Minerva, told the BBC that supermarkets had faced ""a lot of political and media pressure to follow suit"". Some would also see it as a way to avoid having to ""answer to government"", as banks had to after being bailed out in the 2008 financial crisis. However, other grocers have said they will not repay the rates relief. Marks and Spencer, which reported a half year loss and has cancelled its dividend for 2020, said the government support had been ""much-needed"" during ""incredibly challenging circumstances"". While the retailer sells food, most of its clothing and homeware store space has had to close during the lockdowns. On Wednesday, the Co-op said the amount it had spent on protecting staff and customers outweighed the savings from rates relief. But the retailer added it would consider its position on government support again at the end of the year. Waitrose-owner the John Lewis Partnership said the relief would help offset the ""significant"" sales lost while its John Lewis shops were closed, as well as money spent on staying secure from Covid. ""The outlook remains incredibly uncertain and government support remains crucial to help us navigate the crisis,"" it said.

"Shoppers at Topshop and other Arcadia brands will only be able to use gift cards for half of their order, the embattled company has said. Arcadia collapsed into administration on Monday and shoppers have been unable to use gift cards online since. The company and its administrators said the card shutdown was a temporary technical issue which would be resolved by early next week. But they said the cards would only be valid for 50% of a purchase. That means, for example, only Â£25 in card value could be redeemed on a Â£50 order, or someone wanting to use the whole of their Â£10 gift card would need to spend Â£20 in total. The rule is now in place in stores, where gift cards can be used. Administrators for the business are not obliged to accept gift cards but, with stores and websites still trading, many shoppers hoped and expected that they would still be able to use them. Abi Vedder says she will have to spend a lot Abi Vedder, 39, from London, received a gift of Â£100 to spend in Topshop vouchers when she left her job as a social worker two weeks ago. ""Social workers are not rich and it is infuriating that all my colleagues' money may be wasted, as I would now need to buy something worth Â£200 to claim the voucher, which I'm not sure I can,"" she said. ""I'm worried I won't be able to get anything to remember my job by now, because I left during this ridiculous year."" A spokesman for Arcadia's administrators, Deloitte, said: ""The full value of a gift card can be put towards up to 50% of a purchase. ""Gift cards are currently being accepted in all stores and customers will be able to use them online from early next week. There is currently maintenance on the site impacting the use of gift cards. This should be fixed by early next week."" Topshop owner Arcadia goes into administration Currys PC World apologises after gift cards wiped The company told shoppers: ""Gift cards have been temporarily switched off until further notice. I can confirm you are still able to use gift cards in store, you will only be able to apply 50% of the gift card to your purchase. ""Apologies for the inconvenience that has been caused.""

"A US mayor who flew off by private jet on holiday while urging residents to stay home is the latest politician to be accused of Covid-19 hypocrisy. Steve Adler, leader of Austin, Texas, went on a family getaway to Mexico as he told people to keep indoors amid spiralling virus caseloads.

What does UK vaccine approval mean for US? Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? A number of cases involving Democratic office-holders being accused of double standards on coronavirus rule-flouting have made headlines in recent weeks. Democrats tend to be more in favour of broad virus-control measures than their Republican counterparts. California Governor Gavin Newsom last month apologised after he was caught dining with lobbyists and members of the California Medical Association, all without masks, at a crowded table for 12 in a swanky restaurant in Napa Valley. He initially claimed the meal at the Michelin-starred French Laundry, where some prix fixe plates go for $450 per person, took place outdoors. But photos emerged showing the space had a roof, three walls and another wall with sliding glass doors. This week Mr Newsom warned he was considering ""dramatic, arguably drastic"" stay-at-home orders to tackle surging coronavirus caseload in the state. It has since emerged that one night after Mr Newsom dined at the French Laundry, San Francisco Mayor London Breed attended a birthday party for a socialite at the same restaurant. The meal took place as Ms Breed was urging residents to stay at home and avoid socialising,reports the San Francisco Chronicle,external.

"This video can not be played Watch the moment Ranjitsinh Disale found out he'd been named the world's most exceptional teacher A teacher from a village school in India, praised for improving the education of girls, has won this year's Global Teacher Prize. But Ranjitsinh Disale has already given away half of the $1m (Â£750,000) - sharing it with runners-up in the competition. A special Covid Hero prize was won by Jamie Frost, a UK teacher who ran a free maths tuition website. The winners were announced by Stephen Fry in an online ceremony. Mr Disale, who teaches in the Zilla Parishad Primary School, in the drought-prone village of Paritewadi, in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, was named the world's most exceptional teacher, ahead of 12,000 other nominations. ""In this hard time, teachers are giving their best to make sure every student has access to their birthright of a good education,"" said Mr Disale, aged 32. The prize was announced online by Stephen Fry Teachers ""always believe in giving and sharing"", he said, and as such was sharing half his prize money among the other teachers shortlisted in the top 10. Mr Disale was praised by the competition's judges for his work to ensure disadvantaged girls went to school and achieved high results - rather than missing out on school and facing early marriage. He also provides online science lessons for pupils in 83 countries and runs an international project building connections between young people in conflict zones. The Indian teacher runs a project to bring people together across conflict zones ""The Covid pandemic has dealt a severe blow to education systems around the worldâ¦ but it is the contribution of teachers during these difficult times that is making the difference,"" said Stefania Giannini, assistant director general of Unesco, a partner in the competition. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey Foundation that set up the teachers' competition, said ""by sharing the prize you teach the world the importance of giving"". Mr Disale's decision to split the prize will mean over Â£40,000 each for runners-up from countries including Italy, Brazil, Vietnam, Malaysia, Nigeria, South Africa, South Korea, the US and also Jamie Frost from the UK. Jamie Frost's maths website helped pupils studying at home in the lockdown Mr Frost, a teacher from Tiffin School in Kingston-upon-Thames, was commended for his work running the DrFrostMaths online learning platform, which helped families with children trying to study from home during the lockdowns. He also won a special one-off Covid Hero prize worth about Â£34,000. The maths teacher warned that the pandemic had widened educational inequalities. ""That is why I have spent every hour I could adapting my free online learning platform to help students across the globe shut out of their classrooms,"" said Mr Frost. Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the ""creativity and ingenuity"" of Mr Frost and the winning teachers. ""Although I'm speaking to you in difficult and sometimes heartbreaking circumstances, it's right that we take time to recognise the enormous contribution and sacrifice of the world's teachers during this pandemic,"" said Mr Johnson. Next year there will also be a prize for students, run with the US educational technology firm, Chegg.

"In Wales people are still out and about shopping, but what is happening over the border? It's the run up to a Christmas like no other and we are all trying to figure out what we can and cannot do to get ready, while keeping others safe. Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafeswill be banned from serving alcoholic drink apart from takeaways from Fridayand will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT in a bid to curb a rise in coronavirus cases. People in Wales will be able totravel to parts of Englandfrom Friday. So what do England's tiers mean for those living and working in Wales? Yes. In a word. There will be restrictions but as cross-border travel rules are relaxed on Friday from 18:00, you can go toplaces in tiers one and two,external- but not to areas under the strictest measures in tier three. Travel allowed between Wales and parts of England Wales 'must act now' to curb Covid spread What do the new rules mean for pubs in Wales? Shops allowed to open 24-hours a day over Christmas It means travel to places like London, Liverpool, Chester, Cheltenham and Bath will be possible within the new rules - which start at 18:00 on Friday - but not to Manchester, Birmingham or Bristol. There are caveats, though. While pubs intwo of England's three 'tiers'can now open - and every English county that borders Wales is in tier two - youcan only buy alcohol as part of a ""substantial meal"". One cabinet minister did say drinkers in those tier two areas of England canorder a Scotch egg with their pintto keep in line with post-lockdown rules. Thetier two rules,externalalso mean you cannot ""mix with anyone who is not part of your household or support bubble"" when indoors. The Welsh Government is urging people against cross-border travel in an attempt to curb rising coronavirus rates. ""We are advising people in Wales not to travel into those parts of England and Scotland where the infection rate is lower, to help prevent them taking coronavirus with them,"" First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. ""Coronavirus doesn't respect borders - we all have a part to play in keeping Wales and the UK safe. Please think carefully about where you are going and what you are doing. This virus thrives wherever we come together with others."" Well, it depends what area of England they live in. The rise in Wales' coronavirus infection rate slowed down due to the 'firebreak' lockdown You can see loved ones in England's tier one, within the local rules of that area. But you can't go to see family or friends if they live in England's highest tier - which is most of the north east and west, Yorkshire and the Humber, parts of the West Midlands and parts of the south east and west of England. However, if you've a loved one in England in your support bubble, you can still visit them no matter what tier they are in. Up to three households can form an exclusive ""bubble"" to meet indoors during the Christmas period But people are being urged not to take that trip unless they have to. How many Covid deaths and cases have there been in Wales? Postcode check: What tier do my friends or relatives live in? What tier is your area in? There are exceptions in all of England's tiers for childcare andsupport bubbles,external. If you do travel to visit your support bubble, once in England you will need to follow the rules that apply there. Travel into Scotland's top tiers,external- levels three and four - is not allowed, much like England's tier three areas, except for essential reasons. So places like Glasgow, Stirling and Livingston are among the eleven local authority areas with the highest Covid measures as all non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gyms are shut until 11 December. This video can not be played Abby wants her family to be together at Christmas - but there are too many households At level three, alcohol sales are not allowed and cafes and restaurants can only serve food and non-alcoholic drinks and must close at 18:00. Buttravel into those areas is bannedunless you're part of an ""extended household"". No. Atwo-week circuit-breaker took effect on 27 November,externalto try to reduce transmission of the virus and Welsh legislations prevents travel Are you fed up of all that online shopping and fancy a look around some real shops? People are advised by governments to shop locally if they go Christmas shopping Well, you can do that in any area of the UK - as long as it isn't under the strictest Covid measures. So places like Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Northern Ireland are out of bounds. But you can can shop anywhere else although governments are advising people to remain in their local regions. How lovely would it be to have a little bit of winter sun? Well, international travel is allowed again but the government advises that you don't unless it is ""essential"". Festive breaks or getaways abroad are now allowed subject to possible quarantine on return People will be subject toexisting 14-day quarantine rules on return, depending on where you've been, but the outright ban on travelling abroad is gone. For those wanting to drive home to see family and friends to celebrate over the festive period,new rules will be introduced. From 23 to 27 December, people from across the UK will be able to meet. But with numbers limited to three households, some larger families, and those who have relatives who have separated, this may lead to difficult choices when arranging the dinner table. Wales 'must act now' to curb Covid spread Travel allowed between Wales and parts of the UK No Senedd vote allowed before pub alcohol ban Tier two drinkers 'could order Scotch egg' as meal Alcohol ban for Welsh pubs from Friday Christmas Covid fears for pubs and restaurants Johnson: Covid tiers will bring clarity Police get power to check cars for Covid breaches At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played The couple spoke to BBC Scotland's The Nine about moving to the island It is a bold move to set up home in a new place but it takes real bravery to throw your belongings in a van and set out for life on a remote island you have never even visited. Bristol couple Alex Mumford and Buffy Cracknell have dropped everything to start a new adventure living and working in a tiny community on the Isle of Rum, 30 miles off the Scottish mainland. Back in Augustthe Isle of Rum Community Trust made a call for new residentsand the pair were among hundreds who applied. This week they finally made it to the place they had only ever googled. Four days after arriving on the island and mastering the log burner, the couple were still smiling ""Both of us have always enjoyed being in the middle of nowhere, and when we went away to New Zealand last year we knew it was something we wanted to do long-term and when this came up, we knew this would be something we could enjoy,"" Alex toldBBC Scotland's The Nine. ""Life on Rum will be wet, but there will also be a lot of community life which is something we are really looking forward to,"" said Buffy. ""Nature, being able to go on long walks, see lots of wildlife and being able to go out the door and walk without having to get into the car. ""Because its a small community there will be a nice aspect of knowing everyone. In Bristol we didn't get to know people."" Alex and Buffy's eco house is in a development of four properties which have all been filled with young families Rum, one of the Small Isles in the Inner Hebrides, has a population of between 30 and 40, depending on the time of year and seasonal workers. Just two children attend its primary school. Life on the island is literally ""off-grid"" and small hydro-electric schemes provide power. For many years it has been difficult for potential settlers to consider moving there without a job offer and a home to move into. The community trust decided to change that by sourcing funding to build four new eco homes with high quality fibre broadband in the village of Kinloch, and then invited people to come and rent them. The appeal asked for ""individuals or families keen to fit in to the island way of life"" and people with a trade, a skill or other business which would help diversify and grow the local economy. Families with children were particularly welcome, with the two school pupils keen to make new friends. More than 4,000 inquiries came, and 440 serious applications were made. Rum has a population of between 30 and 40 with more people in the summer months, but that has now been boosted with 14 new arrivals From the massive response, four couples were selected, three from England and one from Scotland, with six children between them. The project, five years in the making, saw three of the new families move in this week and one more to arrive over the weekend. Steve Robertson, the island's development officer, said: ""We have six new kids, all under eight which is wonderful. They are all starting to find their feet and things are starting to slot into place. ""We desperately needed new people to help Rum become a outward-looking, dynamic island and it is great to have these little bright sparks running around. ""The new young families will play a crucial role in sharing the load in the future of the island. ""There are challenges - the ferry and the remoteness, but there are lots of positives to living on an island."" Alex and Buffy tried to visit but, as they started their journey north, the second English lockdown was called. Their final decision to move was based on a lot of internet research. Alex said: ""During lockdown we were stuck in the Bristol flat thinking we should be doing more than that. And the opportunity to live somewhere like this, we found it and we just went for it. ""Life's too short to hold back. Take that step and go for it. If it doesn't work we'll do something else, we have each other. We have put the hard work in and we are coming to it wholeheartedly."" Just the general view on way to the local store The couple have been on the island for less than a week and tried to be as prepared as they could. They arrived with 27 tins of beans and 12 tins of chopped tomatoes. Alex, a qualified childcare worker, is hoping to work in the school and get involved in a new nursery next year. Buffy will continue her work in content, websites and marketing. Both are preparing to turn their hobbies - cooking, baking and knitting - into ways to generate income. And the long-term plan is to boost the school roll. Alex and Buffy have enjoyed exploring their new home Alex said: ""I think children - if we are going to have them - it's going to be in a place like this. We are looking at that long term. We hope this is a long-term move, I have flitted about places for too long."" Buffy agrees: ""Now we are here the reality has set in - what we need to do. But we know we can do it. We are not prepared for the midges yet but we still have time."" And she is still in awe at her new surroundings ""Literally right now there are two stags about 100m away from the window,"" she said.

"Streaming in lower definitions can reduce emissions Streaming a television show in standard definition can shave a little off your carbon emissions, scientists at the UK's Royal Society says. 4K video streaming - also know as Ultra HD - on a phone generates about eight times more in emissions than standard definition (SD), it says. And, on a small screen, the viewer might not even notice the difference. Platforms and regulators should limit streaming resolution and default to SD, the authors urged. The scientists' report says digital technologyâs estimated contribution to global emissions ranges from 1.4% to 5.9% of the global total. Another simple way to save energy is for people streaming music to turn off any accompanying video if theyâre just listening, not watching, the authors say. They estimate such small moves could save up to 5% of the emissions from a streaming service â a reduction comparable to whatâs achieved by running YouTubeâs servers on renewable energy. The report also suggests owning and using devices for longer before trading them in, because the emissions created in making a new device are significant. Some of the numbers in the report are contested. But it says that if you change your mobile phone every two years, the manufacturing represents about half of all the emissions it will generate through its lifetime. But if individuals keep their phones for four years instead of two, that contribution is significantly reduced. For the same reason, the report says buying a device second-hand - or sharing equipment - also reduce the share of so-called ""embodied emissions"". This video can not be played Watch: Puneet Pal Singh spoke to Ajit Melarkode, from the cloud storage firm Rackspace, about the benefit and potential risks of the technology. Moving computing from home or business desktops and on to the cloud can also help, because the cloud allows more efficient patterns of server use - so they donât consume energy while idle. Tech firms must also play a part, by providing transparent information about the energy consumption of their digital products and services, the report recommends. âThere are many routes to net zero [carbon emissions], but digital technology has a central role to play,â said lead author Prof Andy Hopper from Cambridge University. âWe must stay alert to digital demand outpacing the carbon emission reductions this transition promises.â Another co-author of the report, Prof Corinne Le Querre from the University of East Anglia, told BBC News: âTo be honest, digital tech is a small fraction of your emissions compared with, say flying even once a year â but every bit of CO2 saving is significant. ""Whatâs more, weâre trying to prompt people to harness the power of digital to help tackle climate change. ""The way we heat our homes, for instance, is a nonsense. We occupy part of house but heat the whole thing. We can cure that by using digital technology. âWe have to make sure that the digital revolution supports the climate revolution â and weâre failing to do that at the moment.â Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external Correction 10 December 2020: A previous version of this story said HD video streaming generated eight times the emissions of standard definition streams.

"EU negotiator Michel Barnier has been in London since face-to-face talks resumed The prospect of a breakthrough in post-Brexit trade negotiations between the UK and EU is ""receding"", according to a senior UK government source. They told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the EU team were ""bringing new elements into the negotiation"" at the ""eleventh hour"". But the source said a breakthrough was ""still possible in the next few days"". Talks were continuing into the night in London. Current trading rules expire on 31 December. Both sides are urgently seeking compromises in key areas, including fishing rights and competition rules. An EU source told the BBC's political editor that talks were ""extremely sluggish"" around the so-calledlevel playing fieldfor competition rules and standards. But another source from Brussels said there were ""never any surprises or new demands from the EU side"". Laura Kuenssberg said both sides were suggesting to her that the real sticking point was over how those rules would be policed. Have trade talks taken a turn for the worse? Are both sides running out of road for a Brexit deal? What happens next with Brexit? The UK and EU have been locked in talks since March to determine their future relations once the UK's Brexit transition period ends in less than four weeks' time. The BBC's political editor said: ""The stumbling blocks certainly aren't new, but the sense on the UK side is that talks have gone backwards 24 hours"". She added that there were ""still real problems to solve"". Earlier, Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney told Irish broadcaster RTE that talks were ""at the very end"". Speaking ahead of Brexit meetings in Paris with his French counterpart on Thursday, he said efforts were under way to close negotiations ""in the next few days"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Boris Johnson has said the UK remains ""absolutely committed"" to ""getting a deal if we can"". Speaking on Wednesday, the prime minister said the EU side ""know what the UK bottom line is,"" as talks continued in what is seen as a crucial week. Face-to-face talks between negotiators have been ongoing since the weekend after a week-long pause. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is expected to return to Brussels on Friday to brief the bloc on the state of play, but Laura Kuenssberg said he may come straight back to join the four new negotiators who arrived on Thursday night. To do business with each other from January, the UK and the EU agree there will have to be some shared rules. It's called the level playing field, if you want to use the jargon, andyou can read about it in all the detail you want here. But again and again, the two sides have clashed over who should be in charge of the rules and, particularly, what happens if things go wrong. Late on Wednesday, there were signs that a deal was nearly concluded. But after another day of talks on Thursday, just before 19:00 GMT, things seemed to take a turn for the worse. It's true that both sides want a deal. It's also true that both sides can see the shape of a possible deal. But when there is so much at stake, taking it for granted that it will happen is quite an assumption to make. Read more from Laura here. On Thursday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told reporters: ""If the choice is a deal or no deal, then a deal is obviously in the national interest."" He said he was ""consulting across the Labour Party"" on whether the party's MPs should back a deal if it comes to a vote in the Commons, and would decide after examining the contents of the deal. He denied Labour was split over the issue, after reports he wasplanning to ask his MPs to vote in favour,externalbut some shadow cabinet members want to abstain. ""We've pulled together incredibly over the last few months through difficult decisions, and we'll do so on this decision again,"" he added. The government has not confirmed how it intends to ratify a deal in Parliament. But the UK's chief negotiator Lord David Frost has said he assumed MPs would have to approve a law to implement ""at least some elements"" of a deal. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The negotiations are continuing ahead of a politically sensitive moment next week, when acontroversial piece of Brexit legislationreturns to the Commons. The Internal Market Bill, which would allow ministers to override sections of the UK's withdrawal agreement, will come back before MPs next Monday. The publication of the bill in September sent shockwaves through the talks, and led to the EU Commissionbeginning legal proceedingsagainst the UK. But on Thursday, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government intends to reinsert contentious clauses taken out of the bill by the House of Lords. The PM's spokesman added the bill was a ""legal safety net"" to protect the UK internal market, in case talks about detailed arrangements for the Irish border break down. On Wednesday, MPs are also set to vote on a new taxation bill that willreportedly contain similar powersto override the withdrawal agreement over the issues of customs and VAT. EU leaders are due to meet next Thursday in Brussels for a scheduled summit. What happens now that a deal's been done? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks?

"Sending live animals abroad for slaughter and fattening will be banned in England and Wales under new plans. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the ban could be in force by the end of 2021 in a post-Brexit break from EU trade rules. The RSPCA welcomed the move, saying it would be ""a landmark achievement for animal welfare"". But the National Farmers Union is calling for improvements to export rules, rather than an outright ban. The government is launching an eight-week consultation on the plan - which includes measures to cut the amount of time animals spend in trucks within the UK. A package of reforms is then expected to come to Parliament next summer. Are both sides running out of road for a Brexit deal? UK at odds with EU over approval for food exports What happens next with Brexit? Current EU trading rules allow for animals to be transported abroad for slaughter. One local authority in Kenttried to ban the exports in 2012after a lorry full of lame sheep was found at the local port and the animals had to be put down. But the High Court overturned the ban, saying it was a breach of EU free trade rules. Only a few thousand of the millions of animals bred for meat in the UK end up being shipped to Europe for slaughter. But the government said now the UK has left the EU - and will stop following its rules after the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December - a ban can be introduced. Its consultation will also look at further elements of animal welfare in transport, such as reducing maximum journey times, giving animals more space and headroom during transport, and stricter rules on transporting animals in extreme temperatures or by sea. After months of taking a battering on issues like food standards in future trade deals - chlorinated chicken and the like - here is a strong push from the government on animal welfare issues. An outright ban of this kind on live animal exports is stronger than some animal welfare experts had expected the government to propose - although one MP who's campaigned on this issue for years (and was delighted) told me he didn't care how the practice ended, just that it did. Announcing the measure just weeks before the transition period ends sends a strong signal. The government has long maintained that exporting live animals was a practice which could be ended as a result of Brexit - a good example of where leaving the EU would bring benefits. No surprise then that it is keen to deliver on it fully. But included in this consultation are some measures which will limit how far animals can travel within the UK, and it could well be that those measures prove a bumpier ride for the government. The Conservative Party made the pledge to ban live animal exports in its election manifesto. There had been fears a ban may not be possible under global trade rules, but ministers are confident its plans are inline with them. Mr Eustice said the government had ""struck the right balance"" with its plan, saying it would ""remove the trade that most people are concerned about - predominantly the export of lambs for slaughter to continental Europe - but would enable high value breeding stock still to be traded, as they are usually transported in very good conditions"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The move has the support of the RSPCA, which has campaigned on the issue for more than 50 years. The charity's chief executive officer, Chris Sherwood, said: ""There is absolutely no reasonable justification to subject an animal to an unnecessarily stressful journey abroad simply for them to be fattened for slaughter. ""Ending live exports for slaughter and further fattening would be a landmark achievement for animal welfare."" But the NFU is instead calling for improvements to export regulations. The union's livestock board chairman, Richard Findlay, said: ""The NFU has developed a solution to raise the standards for live exports for slaughter. ""We believe that an assurance scheme which goes beyond the current regulation would be best to ensure all animals travel in the best possible conditions and that they arrive at the approved and final destination in the best possible health."" He added: ""Significant regulatory changes could potentially have a massive impact on the UK food supply chain."" However, the chief policy adviser for campaign group Compassion in World Farming, Peter Stevenson, urged farmers not to oppose the plans. Instead he called on the industry to ""recognise that this is an important part of moving forward to a high welfare future"".

"Shoppers at Topshop and other Arcadia brands will only be able to use gift cards for half of their order, the embattled company has said. Arcadia collapsed into administration on Monday and shoppers have been unable to use gift cards online since. The company and its administrators said the card shutdown was a temporary technical issue which would be resolved by early next week. But they said the cards would only be valid for 50% of a purchase. That means, for example, only Â£25 in card value could be redeemed on a Â£50 order, or someone wanting to use the whole of their Â£10 gift card would need to spend Â£20 in total. The rule is now in place in stores, where gift cards can be used. Administrators for the business are not obliged to accept gift cards but, with stores and websites still trading, many shoppers hoped and expected that they would still be able to use them. Abi Vedder says she will have to spend a lot Abi Vedder, 39, from London, received a gift of Â£100 to spend in Topshop vouchers when she left her job as a social worker two weeks ago. ""Social workers are not rich and it is infuriating that all my colleagues' money may be wasted, as I would now need to buy something worth Â£200 to claim the voucher, which I'm not sure I can,"" she said. ""I'm worried I won't be able to get anything to remember my job by now, because I left during this ridiculous year."" A spokesman for Arcadia's administrators, Deloitte, said: ""The full value of a gift card can be put towards up to 50% of a purchase. ""Gift cards are currently being accepted in all stores and customers will be able to use them online from early next week. There is currently maintenance on the site impacting the use of gift cards. This should be fixed by early next week."" Topshop owner Arcadia goes into administration Currys PC World apologises after gift cards wiped The company told shoppers: ""Gift cards have been temporarily switched off until further notice. I can confirm you are still able to use gift cards in store, you will only be able to apply 50% of the gift card to your purchase. ""Apologies for the inconvenience that has been caused.""

The Arcadia group runs 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, and includes the Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, and Burton brands. The administration will give Arcadia breathing space from creditors, such as landlords for its shops or clothing suppliers, while a buyer is sought for all or parts of the company. Arcadia executives will still hold day-to-day control over the business. However, the jobs of the company's 13,000 employees are at risk. If no buyer is found and the company folds, then gift cards are likely to be worthless as cardholders would be near the back of a queue of creditors with claims for a payout from any remaining assets that are sold. Debenhams, which said on Tuesday thatit expected to close its doors after the failure to find a buyer for the business, said it was still accepting payment by gift card, but it had not sold any new ones for many months. Earlier this week, Currys PC World apologised aftera website glitch wiped hundreds of pounds off gift cardsand left Black Friday bargain hunters without their shopping.

"There will be no extension to Scotland's school Christmas holidays, the country's education secretary has confirmed. Talks had been held about potentially shutting all schools on 18 December and reopening them again on 11 January. But there had been concern about the impact on teaching time and the difficulties it could cause parents. The EIS, Scotland's largest teaching union, said the decision not to extend the holidays would anger many teachers. And it accused the government of ""once again showing a complete disregard for the concerns and welfare of teachers"". The union had wanted schools to move to remote learning in the final week of term to ensure senior staff did not find themselves having to deal with Covid outbreaks during the holidays. Will next year's Higher exams go ahead? Talks held on extending school Christmas holidays Keeping level 4 schools open 'is vital for pupils' This would also have minimised the risk of staff, pupils and parents having Christmas ruined by infections, the union had argued. Holiday dates in Scotland vary between different council areas, with many schools due to finish on 22 or 23 December before returning between 5 and 7 January. A memo that wasleaked to the Daily Record newspaper,externallast week suggested that the government was considering a national extension to the holidays. It would have seen schools either remaining closed or introducing remote learning for a temporary period. The proposal was designed to limit the spread of Covid after families get together for Christmas. Mr Swinney said the health advice he had been given suggested that pupils would be safer in school Opposition parties had accused the government of ""dithering"" over the decision, which they said was causing uncertainty for pupils, staff and parents. In aletter to the Scottish Parliament's education committee,externalon Thursday morning, Education Secretary John Swinney said: ""I have reached the decision not to make any changes to the planned Christmas and new year holiday dates"". Mr Swinney said there had been a ""range of views"" when the proposal was discussed at the Education Recovery Group, which includes councils, teaching unions and other organisations. He added: ""The public health advice that I received is to keep schools open as planned as the controlled school environment is more preferable to social mixing outside of school if schools are closed early. ""In addition, vulnerable children may be at greater risk if they are out of school for an extended period."" Mr Swinney also said he had taken into account the need to provide childcare for key workers, and the ""significant difficulties"" an extension to the holidays could cause for working parents. And he said the advice he had received continued to be that there is no evidence that schools and early learning settings are driving transmission of the virus, and that there is ""no clear rationale for disrupting children's education."" Mr Swinney is facing calls to cancel next year's Higher and Advanced Higher exams Mr Swinney also confirmed that there would be a staggered return for university students after the holidays, and that students would not be returning in the ""congested period"" directly after Christmas and new year. He said he was still in discussions on the precise nature of the return and that he would set out the details as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens have repeated their call for the government to cancel Higher and Advanced Higher exams next year and replace them with a ""robust system of continuous assessment"". The government has already cancelled next year's National 5s, with a final decision on whether or not to have Higher and Advanced Higher exams due to be made by the February break. The party's co-leader Patrick Harvie said it was clear that the academic year was being severely disrupted, and highlighted the case of a pupil who has already had to self-isolate three times yet faces prelim exams early next year. He added: ""It's long past time the first minister gave teachers and young people the clarity they need and accepted that Higher and Advanced Higher exams cannot go ahead in the coming year."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that the government was considering ""very, very carefully"" whether the exams should go ahead, and appeared to suggest a decision could be made sooner than February.

"A US mayor who flew off by private jet on holiday while urging residents to stay home is the latest politician to be accused of Covid-19 hypocrisy. Steve Adler, leader of Austin, Texas, went on a family getaway to Mexico as he told people to keep indoors amid spiralling virus caseloads. He recorded a video from the beach resort instructing residents back home: ""This is not the time to relax."" But Mr Adler, a Democrat, denied violating his own regulations. He told the Austin American-Statesman,external, which revealed his trip: ""There was no recommendation for people not to travel during that period of time. ""Someone could look at me and say, 'He travelled.' But what they could not say is that I travelled at a time when I was telling other people not to travel.""

The mayor acknowledged to the newspaper that masks distributed to guests were ""probably not"" worn all the time. The next day, the mayor and seven other attendees of the wedding boarded a private jet for the oceanfront resort of Cabo San Lucas, where they spent a week at a family timeshare apartment. One night into the trip, Mr Adler addressed Austin residents in a Facebook video, giving no hint he was outside the city, reports the Austin American-Statesman. ""We need to stay home if you can,"" he said. ""This is not the time to relax. We are going to be looking really closely. We may have to close things down if we are not careful."" What does UK vaccine approval mean for US? Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? A number of cases involving Democratic office-holders being accused of double standards on coronavirus rule-flouting have made headlines in recent weeks. Democrats tend to be more in favour of broad virus-control measures than their Republican counterparts. California Governor Gavin Newsom last month apologised after he was caught dining with lobbyists and members of the California Medical Association, all without masks, at a crowded table for 12 in a swanky restaurant in Napa Valley. He initially claimed the meal at the Michelin-starred French Laundry, where some prix fixe plates go for $450 per person, took place outdoors. But photos emerged showing the space had a roof, three walls and another wall with sliding glass doors. This week Mr Newsom warned he was considering ""dramatic, arguably drastic"" stay-at-home orders to tackle surging coronavirus caseload in the state. It has since emerged that one night after Mr Newsom dined at the French Laundry, San Francisco Mayor London Breed attended a birthday party for a socialite at the same restaurant. The meal took place as Ms Breed was urging residents to stay at home and avoid socialising,reports the San Francisco Chronicle,external.

She defended the trip as ""essential travel"" In a rare alignment of viewpoints, the White House and liberal-leaning cable network CNN blasted Democratic politicians on Wednesday over the controversies.

"The international vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, according to IBM. The company says it tracked a campaign aimed at the delivery ""cold chain"" used to keep vaccines at the right temperature during transportation. The attackers' identity is unclear - but IBM said the sophistication of their methods indicated a nation state. It follows warnings from governments - including the UK's - of countries targeting aspects of vaccine research. IBM says it believes the campaign started in September 2020. It says phishing emails were sent out across six countries, which targeted organisations linked to the Cold Chain Equipment Optimisation Platform (CCEOP) of Gavi, the international vaccine alliance. Gavi's partners include the World Health Organization, Unicef, the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. They help distribute vaccines around the world to some of the poorest regions. This sometimes requires a ""cold chain"". For example, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - which was not the specific target of this campaign - will need to be kept at a temperature of about -70C as it is moved about. The attackers impersonated a business executive from a legitimate Chinese company involved in CCEOP's supply cold chain to make it more likely the targets would engage with the email. They then sent phishing emails to organisations that provided transportation, which contained malicious code and asked for people's log in credentials. That could have allowed them to understand the infrastructure that governments intended to use to distribute vaccines. ""Advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy is likely a high-value and high-priority nation-state target,"" IBM says. IBM says the wider targeting included: the European Commission's Directorate General Taxation and Customs Union companies involved in manufacturing solar panels, which can be used to keep vaccines cold in places where reliable power is not available a South Korean software-development company a German website-development company, which supports clients associated with pharmaceutical manufacturers, container transport, biotechnology and manufacturers of electrical components for communications This video can not be played Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world. IBM says the campaign was uncovered by a security team it set up at the start of the pandemic to track down Covid-19 cyber-threats. ""The precision targeting and nature of the specific targeted organisations potentially point to nation-state activity,"" the US company said. ""Without a clear path to a [pay]out, cyber-criminals are unlikely to devote the time and resources required to execute such a calculated operation."" IBM says it has notified those targeted as well as law-enforcement authorities. The US'sCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) has issued an alert,externalencouraging organisations associated with the storage and transport of a vaccineto be on guard for the kind of attacks linked to IBM's report,external. In July, the UK warned Russian intelligence had targeted UK vaccine research, including at Oxford. The US also warned of Chinese hacking, while, more recently, Microsoft said it had seen North Korean and Russian hackers targeting vaccine research.

"Up to 99% of Covid-19 hospitalisations and deaths could be avoided with the first wave of vaccinations, England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has said. Speaking to BBC News, he said that would be possible if everyone on the first priority list took the vaccine and it was highly effective. He said it was key to go ""as fast"" and at the ""highest volume"" as possible. But he acknowledged there would need to be some flexibility in the list. On Wednesday the UKbecame the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use. The BBC understands that some of the first delivery of the Pfizer vaccine is travelling via the Eurotunnel to the UK on Thursday. Prof Van-Tam, who was taking viewers' questions on the BBC News channel and Radio 5 Live, said that due to technical issues around the vaccine - particularly the need to store it at very low temperatures - it would be difficult to take the vaccine to individual people's homes. Are countries under pressure to approve a vaccine? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? What are the safety checks for vaccines? Listen again: Prof Van-Tam answers your questions The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and decided by the government. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff. But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine risks being wasted. Prof Van-Tam told BBC News: ""If we can get through phase one [of the priority list] and it is a highly effective vaccine and there is very, very high up take, then we could in theory take out 99% of hospitalisations and deaths related to Covid 19. ""That is why the phase one list is what is, that is the primary ambition."" Prof Van-Tam said the government would need to make further decisions on how to continue with the second part of the programme, while reviewing how the vaccine performs in the coming months. Meanwhile, Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, said patience was required over the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine. Prof Harnden said the JCVI's ""clear remit was to decide on prioritisation groups"" but it always understood ""there were going to be vaccine product storage, transport and administration constraints"". ""We have advised in our statement that there is flexibility at an approach to this list according to what was actually feasible and logistical on the ground, so this is not wholly unexpected - but the clear list that we have drawn out is a list of priority in terms of vulnerability,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Prof Harnden said he understood delays in delivering the vaccine to care homes would be disappointing for residents and their families. But he added: ""I think just a very small degree of patience is required because I think we are at the forefront here in the UK. ""I think the very short-term practical difficulties of getting this out from a storage point of view should not let us all lose sight of the fact that these care home residents and their staff are our utmost priority - and it may well be possible to get the care home staff to be immunised within a local hospital setting,"" he said. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. These will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. But the bulk of the roll-out across the UK will be next year. And it could take until April for all those most at-risk to receive the new vaccine, according to NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens.

"Streaming in lower definitions can reduce emissions Streaming a television show in standard definition can shave a little off your carbon emissions, scientists at the UK's Royal Society says. 4K video streaming - also know as Ultra HD - on a phone generates about eight times more in emissions than standard definition (SD), it says. And, on a small screen, the viewer might not even notice the difference. Platforms and regulators should limit streaming resolution and default to SD, the authors urged. The scientists' report says digital technologyâs estimated contribution to global emissions ranges from 1.4% to 5.9% of the global total. Another simple way to save energy is for people streaming music to turn off any accompanying video if theyâre just listening, not watching, the authors say. They estimate such small moves could save up to 5% of the emissions from a streaming service â a reduction comparable to whatâs achieved by running YouTubeâs servers on renewable energy. The report also suggests owning and using devices for longer before trading them in, because the emissions created in making a new device are significant. Some of the numbers in the report are contested. But it says that if you change your mobile phone every two years, the manufacturing represents about half of all the emissions it will generate through its lifetime. But if individuals keep their phones for four years instead of two, that contribution is significantly reduced. For the same reason, the report says buying a device second-hand - or sharing equipment - also reduce the share of so-called ""embodied emissions"".

Moving computing from home or business desktops and on to the cloud can also help, because the cloud allows more efficient patterns of server use - so they donât consume energy while idle. Tech firms must also play a part, by providing transparent information about the energy consumption of their digital products and services, the report recommends. âThere are many routes to net zero [carbon emissions], but digital technology has a central role to play,â said lead author Prof Andy Hopper from Cambridge University. âWe must stay alert to digital demand outpacing the carbon emission reductions this transition promises.â Another co-author of the report, Prof Corinne Le Querre from the University of East Anglia, told BBC News: âTo be honest, digital tech is a small fraction of your emissions compared with, say flying even once a year â but every bit of CO2 saving is significant. ""Whatâs more, weâre trying to prompt people to harness the power of digital to help tackle climate change. ""The way we heat our homes, for instance, is a nonsense.

"This video can not be played The new rules are ""confusing"" says Veronica Gay People will be able to travel from Wales to tier one and two areas in England and Scotland from Friday. The new regulations prohibit travel into tier three zones in England, tiers three and four in Scotland and the whole of Northern Ireland. Previously people couldonly travel out of Wales if it was ""essential"". But the Welsh Government said it still strongly advised people against travelling to other parts of the UK to help control the spread of the virus. The new rules - which includes Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafesbanning serving alcoholand shutting daily at 18:00 GMT - will come into force at 18:00 on Friday. Q&A: Can people from Wales go to England to drink? Here's how to find out which tier an area of England is in England's lockdown ended on 2 December and it now has athree-tiered system. The Scottish government has afive-level alert systemof Covid-19 restrictions. It means for people in Wales, travel to London will be possible, but not Birmingham or Bristol. Large parts of the Midlands, North East and North West, including Manchester, as well as Kent,are in tier three. A majority of England is in the second highest level - tier two - including London and Liverpool city region. Wales has different coronavirus rules to England The new regulations were announced after the cabinet met on Wednesday to decide on the latest travel restrictions as England's lockdown came to an end. The rules will be reviewed on 17 December. Mandy Symonds has owned The Boat Inn in the border town of Chepstow in Monmouthshire for 18 months. She said she was ""gutted""  when she realised the new regulations meant her customers could go into England - ""a 20 second walk away"" - to drink alcohol in a pub when she could not serve them any. ""I'm closingâ¦ everything's stacked against you,"" she said. The owner of The Boat Inn in Chepstow says she feels like everything is stacked against Wales' pubs ""It's a mockery. I feel like he [First Minister Mark Drakeford] is deliberately trying to drive us out of business. ""The rules should be the same all over the countryâ¦ ""I've spent so much money here, invested in a marquee and put heating in there, lost half our tables, put screens up, staff are wearing masks, there's track and traceâ¦ I feel beaten down over it all now."" She said she did not know when she would reopen but it would depend on restrictions. Clare Davenport says the lifting of the travel rules will make little difference to her Boundary Lane in Saltney is the border between Wales and England. Claire Davenport lives in Flintshire but works on the English side of the border. She said the lifting of travel restrictions would not affect her too much. ""My family tend to keep within Wales and don't go into England really because we've got Broughton shopping park. But it was hectic there on Monday with people from England coming in,"" she said. Veronica Gay says the rules have been confusing for people on the border Veronica Gay, who represents Saltney on Flintshire council, said: ""My heart goes out to people who live on the border because you have a routine and you don't even think about it. ""You don't think 'now I'm in England' or 'now I'm in Wales'. It's been so confusing. ""But the people on Boundary Lane on the Welsh side haven't been able to go to Asda just across the road on the England side."" Conservative member of the Senedd (MS) Darren Millar said: ""While any lifting of travel restrictions between Wales and England is to be welcomed, there can be no doubt that this news will rub salt in the wounds of the Welsh hospitality industry. How many people can get together at Christmas? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales ""With Welsh pubs, cafes and restaurants being banned from selling alcohol on their premises from 6pm tomorrow, many of their customers will be taking their custom and cash across the border to enjoy a tipple with a meal in England instead."" He urged the Welsh Government to ""rethink its new rules"" and ""engage with leaders the hospitality industry"". Part of Broadstone Park campsite is in Gloucestershire, England, and half in Monmouthshire, Wales Jeff Revill owns the Broadstone Park campsite, half of which is in Gloucestershire, England, and half in Monmouthshire, Wales. He has faced issues such as guests on the English side of the site being unable to use the only shower block which is in Wales - after looking into it he was told it was an essential journey. He said the new regulations made things easier for the business: ""I can bounce between the two borders nowâ¦ it means we can get our glamping pods open again and there would be no issue [in people staying at the site] popping to Monmouth and back. ""It will be back to business as usualâ¦ hopefully we can pick up a little bit of business now heading into the spring."" The easing of restrictions comes ahead of additional rules for Christmas, whenthree households from around the UKwill be able to meet from 23 December until at least 27 December. The new regulations mean Frank and Margaret Clarke, who live in Mold, Flintshire, are able to travel to Churton in Cheshire - which is in tier two - where their son and his family live. But they said they were unsure what the new rules meant for seeing their grandchildren, aged six, four and six months. Frank and Margaret Clarke moved from Norfolk to Mold in Flintshire to be closer to their son who lives in Churton, Cheshire ""We have been on WhatsApp and FaceTime... our daughter in law had a baby but we haven't been able to go over and help,"" said Mr Clarke. ""It's been a difficult time for us - we can go and see them but we can't go inside and we're not sure if they can come into our house. ""We are trying to be sensible because of our age."" Geoffrey Shone, 65, from Rossett in Wrexham, said he found the rules too difficult to understand. ""I don't understand half the rules properly. It's the way they are put,"" he said. He said he did not know if the rules meant he could see his cousins over the border in Dodleston, Cheshire - that area is in tier two so under the new rules he could travel there. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""There will be no restrictions on travel within Wales but we need to have some restrictions on travel across the border to those parts of the UK where infection rates are high to prevent the spread of coronavirus."" He advised people in Wales not to travel into parts of England and Scotland where the infection rate is lower, ""to help prevent them taking coronavirus with them"". ""Coronavirus doesn't respect borders,"" he said. ""We all have a part to play in keeping Wales and the UK safe. ""Please think carefully about where you are going and what you are doing. This virus thrives wherever we come together with others."" The Welsh Government said the travel restrictions were likely to remain in place until at least January but will be kept under constant review. International travel restrictions will continue and are also likely to remain in place until at least January but will be kept under constant review, it added.

"Hospitality outlets will be forced to close from 00:01 on Friday Pubs, bars and restaurants in Jersey are set to close from 00:01 GMT on Friday for up to a month in order to tackle a surge in Covid cases. The ""hospitality circuit breaker"" announced on Wednesday comes amid fears health services could be overwhelmed. Food and hospitality outlets, except takeaways, will have to shut. All shops can stay open, but indoor sport and fitness classes and gyms must close and the 2m (6.6ft) distancing law is to be brought back into force. Chief Minister John Le Fondre said the recent rise in cases on the island presented ""a real and immediate risk to health services... and islanders' lives"". The circuit-breaker measures are expected to remain in place until 4 January. One pub owner said measures should have been introduced sooner to try to save jobs and Christmas trade for the hospitality industry. There are currently 331 active cases on Jersey with the majority - 231 - symptomatic and eight cases being treated in hospital. On Wednesday, 56 new Covid cases were identified, the biggest daily total of new infections recorded so far. Senator Le Fondre said Jersey's R number was currently between 1.4 and 1.9, which ""means each case is, on average, passing the infection on to more than one other person"". ""This is too much and we need to introduce more stringent restrictions to protect islanders."" EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Jersey ""now stands at an important crossroads in our pandemic response"", Senator Le Fondre said, adding: ""I know that collectively these measures represent a significant restriction...particularly at this time of year, when we want to be celebrating and spending time with loved ones and friends. ""But we need to prevent our health services from being overwhelmed, and ensure we are still able to celebrate during the festive period."" Support for affected businesses would be provided under the co-funded payroll scheme, according to the chief minister. Sean Murphy, who runs the Lamplighter Pub in St Helier, said the move should have come ""a lot earlier to try save Christmas"". He said having to close over Christmas and the new year would cost people their jobs and the industry thousands of pounds. ""Everybody in hospitality understands the reasoning of it because of Covid, but it's the timing of the closure,"" Mr Murphy said. Analysis:Freddie Miller, Political Reporter, BBC News When Jersey's politicians agreed in July to reopen the borders, there were no known active cases of the virus. And while the numbers increased in the following months, many felt the situation was under control - largely thanks to a system of rapid border testing. But within days, the mood has changed significantly. The number of cases has more than doubled since 25 November, with a series of parties and social events blamed. Amid growing concerns about the ability of the health service to cope, these restrictions were announced just 48 hours after a previous tightening of the rules, and the day after masks were made mandatory in shops and supermarkets. The government insists it has acted decisively. But many have criticised ministers' reaction, with one prominent backbencher arguing they have ""dithered since late October"". And while some will see the closure of hospitality as an over-reaction, with Christmas just three weeks away, others believe it is too little, too late. Rules on households mixing over Christmas will be announced in the next few days. Health Minister Deputy Richard Renouf warned the island would need to open its Nightingale hospital if cases continued to rise. Jersey's General Hospitalclosed to all visitors at 17:00 on Wednesday, while high-risk islanders havebeen told to adopt ""extra measures"", including avoiding visits to other people's homes. Deputy Renouf also said officials were in ""close discussions"" with the UK following itsapproval of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine.

"Up to 99% of Covid-19 hospitalisations and deaths could be avoided with the first wave of vaccinations, England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has said. Speaking to BBC News, he said that would be possible if everyone on the first priority list took the vaccine and it was highly effective. He said it was key to go ""as fast"" and at the ""highest volume"" as possible. But he acknowledged there would need to be some flexibility in the list. On Wednesday the UKbecame the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use. The BBC understands that some of the first delivery of the Pfizer vaccine is travelling via the Eurotunnel to the UK on Thursday. Prof Van-Tam, who was taking viewers' questions on the BBC News channel and Radio 5 Live, said that due to technical issues around the vaccine - particularly the need to store it at very low temperatures - it would be difficult to take the vaccine to individual people's homes. Are countries under pressure to approve a vaccine? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? What are the safety checks for vaccines? Listen again: Prof Van-Tam answers your questions The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and decided by the government. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff. But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine risks being wasted. Prof Van-Tam told BBC News: ""If we can get through phase one [of the priority list] and it is a highly effective vaccine and there is very, very high up take, then we could in theory take out 99% of hospitalisations and deaths related to Covid 19. ""That is why the phase one list is what is, that is the primary ambition."" Prof Van-Tam said the government would need to make further decisions on how to continue with the second part of the programme, while reviewing how the vaccine performs in the coming months. Meanwhile, Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, said patience was required over the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine. Prof Harnden said the JCVI's ""clear remit was to decide on prioritisation groups"" but it always understood ""there were going to be vaccine product storage, transport and administration constraints"". ""We have advised in our statement that there is flexibility at an approach to this list according to what was actually feasible and logistical on the ground, so this is not wholly unexpected - but the clear list that we have drawn out is a list of priority in terms of vulnerability,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Prof Harnden said he understood delays in delivering the vaccine to care homes would be disappointing for residents and their families. But he added: ""I think just a very small degree of patience is required because I think we are at the forefront here in the UK. ""I think the very short-term practical difficulties of getting this out from a storage point of view should not let us all lose sight of the fact that these care home residents and their staff are our utmost priority - and it may well be possible to get the care home staff to be immunised within a local hospital setting,"" he said. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. These will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. But the bulk of the roll-out across the UK will be next year. And it could take until April for all those most at-risk to receive the new vaccine, according to NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens.

There are currently 331 active cases on Jersey with the majority - 231 - symptomatic and eight cases being treated in hospital. On Wednesday, 56 new Covid cases were identified, the biggest daily total of new infections recorded so far. Senator Le Fondre said Jersey's R number was currently between 1.4 and 1.9, which ""means each case is, on average, passing the infection on to more than one other person"". ""This is too much and we need to introduce more stringent restrictions to protect islanders."" EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Jersey ""now stands at an important crossroads in our pandemic response"", Senator Le Fondre said, adding: ""I know that collectively these measures represent a significant restriction...particularly at this time of year, when we want to be celebrating and spending time with loved ones and friends. ""But we need to prevent our health services from being overwhelmed, and ensure we are still able to celebrate during the festive period."" Support for affected businesses would be provided under the co-funded payroll scheme, according to the chief minister. Sean Murphy, who runs the Lamplighter Pub in St Helier, said the move should have come ""a lot earlier to try save Christmas"". He said having to close over Christmas and the new year would cost people their jobs and the industry thousands of pounds. ""Everybody in hospitality understands the reasoning of it because of Covid, but it's the timing of the closure,"" Mr Murphy said. Analysis:Freddie Miller, Political Reporter, BBC News When Jersey's politicians agreed in July to reopen the borders, there were no known active cases of the virus. And while the numbers increased in the following months, many felt the situation was under control - largely thanks to a system of rapid border testing. But within days, the mood has changed significantly. The number of cases has more than doubled since 25 November, with a series of parties and social events blamed. Amid growing concerns about the ability of the health service to cope, these restrictions were announced just 48 hours after a previous tightening of the rules, and the day after masks were made mandatory in shops and supermarkets. The government insists it has acted decisively. But many have criticised ministers' reaction, with one prominent backbencher arguing they have ""dithered since late October"". And while some will see the closure of hospitality as an over-reaction, with Christmas just three weeks away, others believe it is too little, too late. Rules on households mixing over Christmas will be announced in the next few days. Health Minister Deputy Richard Renouf warned the island would need to open its Nightingale hospital if cases continued to rise. Jersey's General Hospitalclosed to all visitors at 17:00 on Wednesday, while high-risk islanders havebeen told to adopt ""extra measures"", including avoiding visits to other people's homes. Deputy Renouf also said officials were in ""close discussions"" with the UK following itsapproval of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine.

"This video can not be played The couple spoke to BBC Scotland's The Nine about moving to the island It is a bold move to set up home in a new place but it takes real bravery to throw your belongings in a van and set out for life on a remote island you have never even visited. Bristol couple Alex Mumford and Buffy Cracknell have dropped everything to start a new adventure living and working in a tiny community on the Isle of Rum, 30 miles off the Scottish mainland. Back in Augustthe Isle of Rum Community Trust made a call for new residentsand the pair were among hundreds who applied. This week they finally made it to the place they had only ever googled. Four days after arriving on the island and mastering the log burner, the couple were still smiling ""Both of us have always enjoyed being in the middle of nowhere, and when we went away to New Zealand last year we knew it was something we wanted to do long-term and when this came up, we knew this would be something we could enjoy,"" Alex toldBBC Scotland's The Nine. ""Life on Rum will be wet, but there will also be a lot of community life which is something we are really looking forward to,"" said Buffy. ""Nature, being able to go on long walks, see lots of wildlife and being able to go out the door and walk without having to get into the car. ""Because its a small community there will be a nice aspect of knowing everyone. In Bristol we didn't get to know people."" Alex and Buffy's eco house is in a development of four properties which have all been filled with young families Rum, one of the Small Isles in the Inner Hebrides, has a population of between 30 and 40, depending on the time of year and seasonal workers. Just two children attend its primary school. Life on the island is literally ""off-grid"" and small hydro-electric schemes provide power. For many years it has been difficult for potential settlers to consider moving there without a job offer and a home to move into. The community trust decided to change that by sourcing funding to build four new eco homes with high quality fibre broadband in the village of Kinloch, and then invited people to come and rent them. The appeal asked for ""individuals or families keen to fit in to the island way of life"" and people with a trade, a skill or other business which would help diversify and grow the local economy. Families with children were particularly welcome, with the two school pupils keen to make new friends. More than 4,000 inquiries came, and 440 serious applications were made. Rum has a population of between 30 and 40 with more people in the summer months, but that has now been boosted with 14 new arrivals From the massive response, four couples were selected, three from England and one from Scotland, with six children between them. The project, five years in the making, saw three of the new families move in this week and one more to arrive over the weekend. Steve Robertson, the island's development officer, said: ""We have six new kids, all under eight which is wonderful. They are all starting to find their feet and things are starting to slot into place. ""We desperately needed new people to help Rum become a outward-looking, dynamic island and it is great to have these little bright sparks running around. ""The new young families will play a crucial role in sharing the load in the future of the island. ""There are challenges - the ferry and the remoteness, but there are lots of positives to living on an island."" Alex and Buffy tried to visit but, as they started their journey north, the second English lockdown was called. Their final decision to move was based on a lot of internet research. Alex said: ""During lockdown we were stuck in the Bristol flat thinking we should be doing more than that. And the opportunity to live somewhere like this, we found it and we just went for it. ""Life's too short to hold back. Take that step and go for it. If it doesn't work we'll do something else, we have each other. We have put the hard work in and we are coming to it wholeheartedly."" Just the general view on way to the local store The couple have been on the island for less than a week and tried to be as prepared as they could. They arrived with 27 tins of beans and 12 tins of chopped tomatoes. Alex, a qualified childcare worker, is hoping to work in the school and get involved in a new nursery next year. Buffy will continue her work in content, websites and marketing. Both are preparing to turn their hobbies - cooking, baking and knitting - into ways to generate income. And the long-term plan is to boost the school roll. Alex and Buffy have enjoyed exploring their new home Alex said: ""I think children - if we are going to have them - it's going to be in a place like this. We are looking at that long term. We hope this is a long-term move, I have flitted about places for too long."" Buffy agrees: ""Now we are here the reality has set in - what we need to do. But we know we can do it. We are not prepared for the midges yet but we still have time."" And she is still in awe at her new surroundings ""Literally right now there are two stags about 100m away from the window,"" she said.

"Jimmy Lai had earlier this year been detained under the new national security law Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy supporter Jimmy Lai has been charged with fraud and detained until a court hearing in April next year. On Thursday a court denied him bail over a charge relating to the illegal use of his company's premises. It comes a day after three prominent pro-democracy activists were jailed. The cases have raised fears of a renewed crackdown on the city's activists and media figures, spurred by a controversial new security law. Mr Lai was arrested under the National Security Law earlier this year and later released on bail. China has said the new law will return stability to the territory after a year of unrest, but critics say it has silenced dissent. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice The Hong Kong paper that pushed the boundary In another development, former Hong Kong pro-democracy legislator Ted Hui has announced during a trip to Denmark that he is going into exile. Mr Lai, 73, was arrested on Wednesday night along with two other senior executives from media company Next Digital. Mr Lai is the founder of Next Digital which publishes Apple Daily, a well-read tabloid which is frequently critical of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese leadership. On Thursday, the three men appeared in court to face charges relating to the alleged illegal use of their company's headquarters for purposes not permitted by its lease. The charges stated that they had sublet a section of the premises. The landlord is a corporation established by the government to run the city's industrial parks. Mr Lai was brought into court on Thursday morning The fraud charge is not being heard under the National Security Law but, according to an Apple Daily report, the judge presiding over the case had been hand-picked by the city's leader, Carrie Lam, to handle national security cases. A police statement on the arrests did not name those detained but pointed out that one of them - Jimmy Lai - was still under investigation for violating the National Security Law. While the two senior executives were granted bail, Mr Lai was denied because he was deemed an ""absconding risk"", according to local reports. One of the city's most prominent supporters of the pro-democracy movement, Mr Lai is estimated to be worth more than $1bn (Â£766m).  Having made his initial fortune in the clothing industry, he later ventured into media and founded Next Digital. In a local media landscape increasingly fearful of Beijing, Mr Lai is a persistent thorn for China - both through his publications and writing that openly criticises the Chinese leadership. This video can not be played Jimmy Lai told the BBC he would not give in to intimidation It has seen him become a hero for many residents in Hong Kong. But on the mainland he is viewed as a ""traitor"" who threatens Chinese national security. Earlier this year, he was accused of ""colluding with foreign forces"" under the National Security Law. He was arrested in August, becoming the most high-profile person in Hong Kong to be detained under the law, and his newspaper offices were raided by hundreds of police officers. He was later released on bail. Interviewed by the BBC before the latest arrest, he said he would not give in to intimidation. ""If they can induce fear in you, that's the cheapest way to control you and the most effective way and they know it. ""The only way to defeat the way of intimidation is to face up to fear and don't let it frighten you."" The former Hong Kong pro-democracy legislator said in a statement: ""I hereby announce that I will go into exile and will withdraw my membership of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong to leave Hong Kong. ""There is no word to explain my pain and it's hard to hold back tears."" Mr Hui faces charges linked to pro-democracy protests, but had been given bail. By Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, in Hong Kong Jimmy Lai's detention comes hot on the heels of the jailing of three young activists for inciting unauthorised assembly. A dozen pro-Beijing pensioners popped champagne corks outside court to celebrate their sentencing, while holding a banner calling for even harsher jail terms. One of the activists, Agnes Chow, is being investigated along with Jimmy Lai for allegedly colluding with foreign forces in order to threaten China's national security. If found guilty, they could remain in jail until they die. A few political pundits have been saying that Beijing will only get tougher on Hong Kong. Following earlier sanctions by the US on some government officials, Beijing retaliated, sanctioning four Americans this week. But some supporters of the pro-democracy camp have been wondering if a change of guard in Washington will make it even harder to make their voices heard. But Jimmy Lai's Next Digital group expects business as usual. Its shares will resume trading on Friday, copies of Apple Daily will still hit the news stands, and their new online daily news broadcast will still go on air, with his daughter-in-law fronting the bulletins. On Wednesday, activists Joshua Wong, Ivan Lam and Agnes Chow were jailed for their involvement in mass protests last year. HK's Joshua Wong and democracy activists jailed The young activists - who are among the city's most prominent - had been convicted of unauthorised assembly. Agnes Chow, Ivan Lam and Joshua Wong are prominent democracy activists Rights group Amnesty International condemned the ruling, saying it was a way for authorities to ""send a warning to anyone who dares to openly criticise the government that they could be next"". A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 but under the so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle. It was supposed to guarantee certain freedoms for the territory - including freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - which mainland China does not have. But the National Security Law has reduced Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. The legislation introduced new crimes, including penalties of up to life in prison. Anyone found to have conspired with foreigners to provoke ""hatred"" of the Chinese government or the Hong Kong authorities may have committed a crime. This video can not be played Hong Kong security law: The BBC's Stephen McDonell explains what it means, and what people there think Trials can be held in secret and without a jury, and cases can be taken over by the mainland authorities. Mainland security personnel can legally operate in Hong Kong with impunity. After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety. The Chinese government defends the law, saying it will help return stability to the territory, which has been shaken by pro-democracy protests, and bring it more into line with the Chinese mainland.

"Care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid vaccine from 14 December, the health secretary has confirmed. There had been fears that homes would not be able to receive the first batch of doses due to logistical challenges. But Jeanne Freeman said confirmation on how the vaccine can be transported and stored meant it would now be possible to deliver them to care homes. The vaccines will be given to the vaccinators from Tuesday 8 December. The health secretary said about 65,500 doses of the vaccine would arrive in Scotland by Tuesday. Thefirst consignment of the vaccine arrived in the UK on Thursdayand it will now be distributed to vaccination centres across the four nations. They will initially be stored in packs of 997 doses in specialist freezers around Scotland. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at a temperature of -70C. Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week What are the safety checks for vaccines? When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Ms Freeman said this posed ""particular logistical challenges"" when vaccinating people at or close to their homes. But she told MSPs it had now been confirmed the vaccine could be transported in an unfrozen state for up to 12 hours. It can also be broken down into smaller pack sizes and stored undiluted for up to five days, she said. ""So in effect we can take the vaccine to them [care homes] or close to them, and we will begin that exercise from 14 December,"" the health secretary said. ""From next Tuesday we will begin vaccinating first the vaccinators themselves and then work our way through the first cohorts of health and social care workers."" The vaccine is made in Belgium and has to be stored at around -70C The health secretary said Scotland already had the 160 vaccinators who would be needed from Tuesday. The government is also ""on track"" to recruit 2,000 vaccinators and support staff by the end of January. ""An existing core of trained and experienced vaccinators from the flu programme will transition over to Covid vaccination over this month and next,"" she said. ""We are actively recruiting from the emergency registers and the NHS Scotland accelerated recruitment portal and drawing from the wider clinical workforce of GPs, pharmacists, dentists and optometrists."" Ms Freeman said that pregnant women, or women who were planning to be pregnant in the next three months, should not take the Pfizer vaccine. And she confirmed 16 and 17-year-olds with underlying health conditions would be vaccinated, following a request from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Half of the initial supplies of the vaccine that arrive in Scotland in December will be held back for the second dose. The Scottish government has bought 23 ultra-low temperature freezers to store the vaccine. They will be based at all major acute hospitals across the country and on Scotland's islands. Ms Freeman said the introduction of mass vaccination centres was ""further down the line"". But she added that she hoped the first wave of the vaccination programme would be completed by the spring. The Scottish Conservatives said more clarity was still needed on staff recruitment, vaccination centres, freezers, and the long-term plans. Everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 will be offered a vaccination. The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has drawn up advice on how people should be prioritised. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials. The vaccine must be stored at around -70C and will be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people. The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said despite the speed of approval, no corners have been cut. Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said.

"Struggling engineering firm BiFab has been put into administration after failing to secure any new contracts. It comes despite the firm, which has plants in Fife and Lewis, receiving Â£52m from the Scottish government. However, BiFab said it had been unable to compete with yards owned or subsidised by governments in and outside the EU. The firm had been seen as the best hope for offshore wind manufacturing in Scotland. In a statement, the firm said: ""BiFab can confirm that the board has agreed to place the company in administration following the Scottish government's decision to remove contract assurances. BiFab hits back at government's investment claims 'No legal route' for more support for BiFab The complex battle over the BiFab yards Government 'cannot continue to support' BiFab ""The company has worked tirelessly to bring jobs into Fife and Lewis with some success. ""However, the absence of supply chain protections in Scotland and the wider UK have consistently undermined our ability to compete with government-owned and government-supported yards outside and inside the European Union. ""We would urge the Scottish and UK governments to address these structural challenges as a matter of urgency in order to ensure that the benefits of offshore renewables are shared more widely with communities across the country."" The steel fabrication firm, which has yards in Methil and Burntisland in Fife, and Lewis, was rescued by the Scottish government in 2017 and was acquired by Canada-based JV Driver the following year, with the company believing the Scottish government would be the ""primary financiers"". However, a Â£2bn deal to manufacture eight wind turbine jackets at its yards in Methil as part of the Neart Na Gaoithe (NnG) project collapsed last month, and the UK and Scottish governments said they had no legal route to provide further financial support to the company. A joint statement by trade unions GMB Scotland and Unite said BiFab's administration exposed the ""myth of Scotland's renewables revolution as well as a decade of political hypocrisy and failure, in Scotland and the rest of the UK."" GMB Scotland secretary Gary Smith and Unite Scotland secretary Pat Rafferty added that the workers and communities dependent on the yards had ""fought so hard for a future"". ""Shamefully the Scottish government has buried these hopes just in time for Christmas and they have worked together with UK government in doing so,"" they said. ""A decade on from the promise of a 'Saudi Arabia of renewables' and 28,000 full time jobs in offshore wind manufacturing, we've been left with industrial ruins in Fife and Lewis."" Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the Scottish government had worked for more than three years to support BiFab and remained committed to securing a future for the yards and the workforce. She acknowledged that it was ""extremely worrying"" for workers and said the government would continue to do everything possible to support them. She added that as a minority shareholder, the Scottish government had been ""exhaustive"" in its considerations of support options and said there was no legal route for either the Scottish or UK governments to provide further financial support. ""In order to successfully secure and deliver new contracts, BiFab required working capital, the provision of appropriate assurance packages by the shareholders, and plans for investment at the sites,"" she said. ""Despite commitments made at the time of acquisition, this is something the majority shareholder JV Driver was not willing to provide to secure future work."" At First Minister's Questions, Nicola Sturgeon said she ""deeply regretted"" and was ""deeply disappointed"" by the developments. ""We were not able to legally provide the additional support BiFab was seeking,"" she said. ""Had the majority shareholder been prepared to invest, that may have been different."" The best that can be said of BiFab going bust is that few workers stand to lose their jobs, as the yards have spent three years getting little more than necessary maintenance. So not many hurt? Well, this goes much deeper than immediate job losses, and beyond 400-plus jobs that could have come from the contract it won. The yards are totemic: they have been a vital sign that Scotland could gain from manufacturing for the green energy revolution. Without factories to build turbines or towers, though they were promised, there's now little prospect for steel fabrication - one product Scots made well for the offshore oil industry. If there was a strategy, it failed, repeatedly. For platforms and turbines to be located off the coast of Fife, Angus and Aberdeenshire, it's cheaper to build in Asia, the Middle East and Spain. Scottish yards lacked the government support and subsidy that their rivals get. But that's too easy an excuse. They also lack the scale and efficiency of competitors, which required investment - public, private or both. So what's being done about that? We're due to get a new manufacturing strategy from the Scottish government, imminently. The UK government has been talking about industrial strategy, with its focus on the north of England. Both will have a lot of heavy lifting to do if they're to raise the Scottish and UK game in industrial competitiveness. Last week, BiFab said the Canadian owner had repeatedly offered to offload shares to the government at no cost. It said this would give the Scottish government - which owns a third of the company - more flexibility to back it. It said ministers' statements about it had been inaccurate or untruthful and JV Driver had agreed to become involved on the understanding that ministers would provide most of the finance required to win new contracts. A joint working group has been set up with the UK government to explore how existing policy measures can be used to strengthen the renewables and clean energy supply chain in Scotland. On Wednesday, MSPs voted to ""condemn"" the Scottish government's decision to withdraw financial guarantees and to call on them to ""act now to secure the future"" of the yards. The motion, which was passed by 61-60, said the government was ""risking Scotland's reputation as a green investment hub"". STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said the announcement was the latest stage in a ""sorry saga of government and corporate failure with the victims being workers and their families from Fife to the Islands"". Scottish Greens energy spokesman Mark Ruskell said the news showed a ""major dereliction of the Scottish government's duties on jobs and a green recovery"" and made ""a mockery"" of their claims to have saved BiFab eight months ago. Scottish Labour economy spokesman Alex Rowley said: ""This terrible news will come as a hammer blow to workers across Scotland and exposes the fraud that is the SNP's claims of a renewables revolution."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""The SNP government's incompetence has left an industrial wasteland. This was a golden opportunity to connect our battle against climate change with jobs in industrial communities across the country, but the government has wasted over Â£52m creating a couple of hundred temporary jobs."" BiFab hits back at government's investment claims 'No legal route' for more support for BiFab The complex battle over the BiFab yards Government 'cannot continue to support' BiFab At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Doctors may have made ""do not resuscitate"" decisions on a blanket basis in the first wave of the pandemic, the care watchdog has warned. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said it saw a jump in complaints between March and September. Do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR) decisions may have been used inappropriately when care services were under extreme pressure, it found. Blanket use of DNARs was ""totally unacceptable"", an NHS spokeswoman said. PM hails vaccine but warns it is 'not game over' Doctors face agonising life-death care decisions NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' DNAR orders refer to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), so do not cover any other type of treatment someone needs for their condition or care that helps people feel comfortable and pain-free. Only 15% to 20% of those who undergo in hospital survive, with survival rates dropping to between 5% and 10% outside of a hospital setting. Although it can cause punctured lungs, fractured ribs and severe bruising, failing to fully appraise a patient or their loved ones of their options is a breach of their human rights, the CQC warned. The watchdog's guidance states decisions on DNARs must never be dictated by blanket policies, must be free from discrimination, and not made on a clinician's ""subjective view of a person's quality of life"". But despite reminding care providers of their obligations, the CQC said it received evidence from staff and patients' families that DNARs had been applied without consultation. The number of complaints it received about the orders jumped to 40 between March and September, compared to just nine similar complaints in the previous six months. One carer told the CQC an on-call doctor had informed care home staff that if a resident were to catch Covid-19, a DNAR would automatically be put in place. Another witness said some care homes and learning disability services had been told by GPs to place blanket orders on everyone in their care. Some families of patients said they were not made aware such an order was in place until their relative was quite unwell. Others said they had been told their loved one had agreed to a DNAR, but they had concerns over their understanding due to factors such as a lack of English or deafness. The CQC also found examples of routine care not being provided in homes, such as an ambulance or doctor not being called, due to the existence of the do not resuscitate order. Inappropriate DNARs may still be on people's files, the CQC said. Rosie Benneyworth, chief inspector of primary medical services and integrated care at the CQC, said: ""It is unacceptable for clinical decisions - decisions which could dictate whether someone's loved one gets the right care when they need it most - to be applied in a blanket approach to any group of people."" An NHS spokeswoman said: ""The NHS has repeatedly instructed local clinicians that the blanket application of DNARs would be totally unacceptable and that access to treatment and care for people with learning disabilities and autism should always be made on an individual basis and in consultation with family and carers.""

"Supplies of the vaccine are expected in the coming days People in Scotland will start to receive a Covid-19 vaccine from next week, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as being safe for use. The first minister said it was expected the first jabs could be administered in Scotland on Tuesday 8 December. She said this was ""without a shadow of a doubt the best news we have heard since the pandemic started"". Ms Sturgeon warned that ""we are not at the end of this pandemic yet"" and added that the vaccination programme would be a massive logistical exercise. But she added: ""Today does feel like it may well be the beginning of the end of this horrible experience"". UK approves Pfizer Covid vaccine for use next week What are the safety checks for vaccines? When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Live updates: Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine approved The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said the vaccine - which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness - is safe to roll out, and immunisations for people in priority groups could start within days. The UK government has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each. About 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK next week, with a share being made available for Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said this was ""fantastic news"", and that there was a ""high probability"" that people could start receiving the first of two required doses in the next week. She said: ""If we receive the first doses as soon as we are expecting to, I can confirm the first vaccines will be administered on Tuesday, 8 December. That is just six days from now."" Nicola Sturgeon said the approval of the vaccine was ""fantastic news"" Ms Sturgeon said rolling out the vaccine across the country would be a ""massive operation"", and said people ""must not ease up in our effort to control"" the virus in the meantime. She added: ""For all the difficulties that lie ahead, this should give us real hope that the end of this pandemic is in sight."" Ms Sturgeon said she would be getting vaccinated as soon as she could - and would be prepared to get the jab live on TV if it encouraged others to get it. The vaccination will not be mandatory and the first minister stressed that the government was ""not planning sanctions"" for those who decide not to get it. But she added: ""We will put everything we've got behind persuading everybody to get this vaccine as soon as they become eligible."" How do we know the vaccine is safe? And other questions How will we keep the vaccine cold enough? The UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, said British Army planners have already been working with the Scottish government and a number of health boards to provide strategic planning expertise to help ensure people in Scotland get the vaccine as quickly as possible. It is thought that big venues such as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre are being lined up as the type of venue that will be transformed into vaccine distribution ""hubs"" once the second phase is rolled out for the wider population. National clinical director Prof Jason Leitch told BBC Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattie: ""We will need high-volume places to get through people, a bit like we've done with testing, and that might well end up being in airports, football stadia, community centres all over the country."" The vaccine doses will be rolled out as quickly as the company in Belgium can make it, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December. But the bulk of the rollout will be next year, he added, while predicting: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better. ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again."" Scottish Labour MSP Iain Gray welcomed the vaccine announcement as ""the day we have all been waiting for"". But he said the Scottish government's recent track record on logistics has ""not been so good"", citing problems with delivery of PPE and expanding the testing programme. The Scottish Conservatives criticised the first minister for making the announcement in her daily briefing, rather than in the Scottish Parliament, and for not publishing the government's vaccine delivery plan. The party's leader at Holyrood, Ruth Davidson, said: ""The public needs to hear answers from the first minister and the plans have to be scrutinised fully by parliament to avoid any pitfalls, such as the postcode lottery that occurred with the flu jab rollout this year."" The vaccine is made in Belgium and has to be stored at around -70C Everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 will be offered a vaccination - that's 4.4m people. The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has drawn up advice on how people should be prioritised. It has said that the priorities for the first wave of vaccine distribution, from December to February, are: frontline health and social care staff older residents in care homes care home staff all those aged 80 and over unpaid carers and personal assistants those delivering the vaccination programme It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials. The vaccine must be stored at around -70C and will be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people. The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said despite the speed of approval, no corners have been cut. Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said. Another vaccine from Moderna uses the same mRNA approach as the Pfizer vaccine and offers similar protection. The UK has pre-ordered seven million doses that could be ready by the spring. The UK has ordered 100 million doses of a different type of Covid vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca. That vaccine uses a harmless virus, altered to look a lot more like the virus that causes Covid-19. Russia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another one made by CanSino Biologics. Both work in a similar way to the Oxford vaccine. There are some other promising vaccines that could also be approved soon. Use the form below to send us your questions and we could be in touch.

"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

"The coronavirus vaccination campaign is now well under way in Scotland, and we have a good idea of how plans to deploy the vaccine are shaping up. The Scottish government has said the first two priority groups - including care home staff and residents, frontline health workers and over-80s in the community - would have had their first jab by 5 February. Those aged 70 and over will be vaccinated by mid-February. People aged over 65 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be vaccinated by early March. This covers the first five of the nine priority groups, which is just over 1.4 million people. Three vaccines have now been approved by UK regulators - those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna. They have been purchased by the UK government and Scotland will get a share of them, based on its population. Current modelling indicates that Scotland will have the capacity to deliver about 400,000 vaccinations a week from the end of February. GP practices, health centres and local clinics have already been delivering vaccinations. From Monday 1 February, mass vaccination centres, including Edinburgh International Conference Centre (EICC) and Aberdeen's P&J LIVE at TECA, will be in operation. The Scottish government said the EICC will have capacity to vaccinate more than 21,000 people a week at 45 stations. The centre in Aberdeen will start with 20 booths, vaccinating around 6000 people weekly. The NHS Louisa Jordan mass vaccination centre in Glasgow has been operating since 8 December, carrying out 1,000 to 5,000 vaccinations daily. The facility has the capacity to move to 10,000 per day. Other large centres will operate at Ravenscraig Sports Facility in Motherwell and Queen Margaret University in Musselburgh - as well as at leisure centres and town halls. Centres were planning initially to be opened seven days from 08:00 to 22:00, but that could be extended. It won't be practical for everyone in Scotland to travel to receive their vaccine. So, in some remote communities, a mobile vaccination unit will be set up to offer immunisations. In this case, public health officials say they will likely make one trip to the area and vaccinate everyone in the priority group at once - which might mean someone lower down the priority list will get vaccinated earlier than they would had they lived in an urban area. One plan public health officials are looking at is using mobile libraries to deliver vaccines in remote communities. The hope is to have people aged 50 and over vaccinated by the start of May. The number of injections vaccinators will administer will be dependent on supply - so there might not be a smooth increase in how many people have received their immunisation. Quite quickly it's expected the number of injections given to begin increasing. That's because initially things were very focused on getting those in care homes vaccinated first. Because the vaccine had to be taken to the homes, it has taken a longer time to get through than if the same number of people had been able to turn up at a mass vaccination site. By the autumn everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 should have been offered one of the Covid vaccinations. That's 4.4 million people. But this will depend entirely on supplies - and just now, public health experts say they only know how many doses they can expect until June. From March, a second stream of second doses of the vaccinations will also be getting under way as the latest guidance is that the second jab should be received up to 12 weeks after the first. There are no plans to make vaccinations mandatory. The UK government is ordering vaccines on behalf of the four nations, and the supply is then be divided up between Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland on the basis of population. Scotland's share of the UK's vaccine supply equates to its 8.2% share of the UK population. The UK government has secured early access to more than 400 million doses of experimental vaccines. There are more than enough supplies of approved vaccines to give every adult in the UK both doses. Data suggests that whilst the efficacy of both vaccines is optimised when a second dose is administered, they offer considerable protection after a single dose, at least in the short term. So the new plan is for more people to be given a first dose, rather than holding back stock to administer down the line as second doses. Everyone should still receive a second dose within 12 weeks of the first. Trials of the Oxford vaccine, which was developed by British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca and Oxford University, show it stops an average of 70% of people developing Covid symptoms. Nobody who was given the vaccine in the trial developed severe disease or needed hospital treatment. There is also data that suggests adjusting the dose could increase protection up to 90%. This vaccine takes a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees and genetically modifies it to resemble coronavirus to try to provoke an immune response. First person receives Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved for use in UK The manufacturers of thePfizer/BioNtech vaccinesay the jab could prevent 95% of people from becoming ill with Covid-19. It is what's known as an RNA vaccine - a new type of technology. It involves injecting part of the virus' genetic code into the body to train the immune system. Antibodies and T-cells are then made by the body to fight the coronavirus. There were fears that the requirement for it to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures would pose problems in getting it to care homes or to remote communities. However, it has since transpired that the vaccine can be moved around in an unfrozen state for up to 12 hours and can be stored undiluted for up to five days. How do the Covid vaccines compare? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Did Brexit speed up the UK's vaccine approval? The Moderna vaccine is an RNA vaccine, like Pfizer's, which uses part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response. It requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer. Several other vaccines are in the final testing stage, and more results from other teams working on advanced trials are also expected in the coming weeks and months. The JCVI has said it does not have a preference for one vaccine above the other, but it's unlikely you'll get to choose which you get. That depends on a number of factors - what is available, where you are being vaccinated, and what we know about how the vaccines work by the time you are being vaccinated. The Scottish government has said that it will be distributing supplies so that they can offer the most ""extensive and timely"" coverage possible, so for that reason ""one vaccine may be offered in certain settings over another"". And scientists will be studying the efficacy of the injections as people are given them, and it may well turn out that different vaccines suit different parts of the population. So, it may be that what vaccine you get is dependent on your age or where you live, for example. But it is early days - we'll learn more in the months ahead. Public health officials said when the Pfizer jab was approved that pregnant and breastfeeding women should not be given the injection, due to the limited amount of data available on its use within that group. However, the regulator has since updated its advice to say that when the potential benefits outweigh the risks, the decision can be made for the woman to be vaccinated. For the Oxford vaccine, the advice is the same - it can be administered when the potential benefits outweigh the risk. Most children aged 18 and under will not get the Pfizer vaccine. This is because not enough research on using this vaccine on children has been carried out yet. And, so far, the Oxford vaccine has only been approved for those over 18. Regulators initially said that people with a history of significant allergic reactionsshould not have the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab. But they have now said they have received further assurances, and that those with allergies to food or other medicines or vaccinescanhave this injection. However, anyone with a history of allergic reaction to this vaccine or any of its ingredients should not receive this injection. The Oxford vaccine can also be given to those with allergies to other medicines or food. Again, it's only those with a known history of reacting to any of its ingredients who should not have it. Anyone who has previously reacted to a vaccine should speak to their doctor first. CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland? LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"The UK becomes first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths, according to official figures Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than UK England's deputy chief medical officer hails Pfizer vaccine approval but says ""we have to take it really carefully"" Education secretary says UK got vaccine first because it is a ""better country"" than France, Belgium and US Moscow announces start of immunisation programme on Saturday, using Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine US has record number of new daily cases - almost 200,000 - as hospitalisations double since early November Facebook to take down false vaccine claims to prevent ""imminent physical harm"" International vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, IBM says Edited by Paul Gribben and Robert Greenall As our live page draws to a close, here is a round-up of the main coronavirus news today.   Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italy responded to a recent surge in cases with a new round of restrictions It was a milestone Italians knew would be a matter of time before they hit: the day when the country would exceed the highest death toll of the first
wave â 969 on 27 March. And now itâs happened. With 993 deaths
recorded in the past 24 hours, Italy has had its deadliest day of the pandemic.
The numbers are hard to fathom. The chink of light is that the infection rate is gradually
decreasing. While cases remain high âabove 23,000 today â the rate of positive
results to number of tests has decreased in the past week from 12.4% to 10.2%.
The curve is flattening. But as in the first wave, it takes time for the death
toll to catch up, since many of todayâs fatalities were infected around the
peak of the second wave in early November. After grim figures, Italians are bracing themselves for a
less-than-happy Christmas with tightened restrictions. Theyâll be banned from
moving between regions, forced to self-isolate if they come into the country
from abroad, ordered to obey night-time curfews around Christmas Day and New
Year and told only to celebrate Christmas lunch with close family. This country
has been devastated by the first and now the second wave. It fears a third.  The US Supreme Court has ordered a lower court to reconsider a challenge to pandemic-related restrictions on religious services in California. The ruling sided with a church that had challenged the policy as unconstitutional religious discrimination, throwing out a lower court  ruling rejecting their case. The Harvest Rock Church and Harvest International Ministry has more than 160 churches in the state, according to AP news agency. California Governor Gavin Newsom has put heavy restrictions on religious services amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Under the current rules, houses of worship in the stateâs worst-hit areas cannot hold indoor gatherings. Elsewhere, there are restrictions on capacity. The ruling on Thursday came after the Supreme Court last week barred New York from enforcing certain limits on attendance at churches and synagogues. Quarantine rules are set to be eased for business travellers in England, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. From 04:00 GMT on Saturday, 5 December, the following people will no longer need to self-isolate when returning to England from a country not in a travel corridor:  For business travellers, their trips must result in a deal which creates or preserves 50 jobs or leads to a Â£100,000 investment or order, according to the Department for Transport. Read more on this story here Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were joined at Soho Theatre by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have been visiting entertainment venues in Soho, London, today to find out how the arts and entertainment sector has been coping during the pandemic. The couple were treated to an intimate performance at Soho Theatre - of the one-woman play Half Breed by Natasha Marshall. The actress revealed she had to dash from her Morrisons supermarket job to do the gig in front of the royals and was still wearing her uniform. She told the prince and his wife: ""I've got to go back later so it was easier to keep it on, I'll be in such a rush. ""The theatre has supported me so much I jumped at the chance to perform today."" Charles replied: ""That's marvellous, such dedication. I really enjoyed the performance and I am praying all of you can open soon."" Many entertainment venues are battling to stay in business because of the restrictions Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics So far, wave two has been lower
and slower than wave one. About 80% of deaths involving
coronavirus happened before August, and most of those happened in just one
month. Almost 10,000 coronavirus
deaths a week were registered in consecutive weeks in April. In this second wave, it looks
like the peak figures â assuming infections keep falling before widespread
vaccination takes place â might be closer to 3,000 than 4,000. And, as in wave one, those over
75 account for about 75% of the deaths, suggesting that vaccinating over-75s
could stem the vast majority of future deaths. This time around, the spread
of deaths around the country has looked quite different. In the spring and summer,
London and the North West of England each accounted for about 15% of
coronavirus deaths in the UK. But in this wave, Londonâs
share is down, closer to 5% whereas the North West is just under 25%. As the UK becomes the first European country to record a death toll of over 60,000, the daily reported deaths remain high at an average of 441 over the last 7 days. But confirmed cases show a marked fall following England's nationwide lockdown and stricter measures elsewhere in the UK. It also seems to have had an impact on daily hospital admissions, which have fallen to an average of 1,395 a day in the seven days up to 26 November, from a high of 1765 a day on 11 November. Dr Anthony Fauci was challenged over the vaccine's earlier availability in the UK UK ministers have been making their quick approval of the Pfizer vaccine a point of national pride, with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson facing criticism for claiming the speed was due to the UK being a ""much better country"" than European rivals. But the top US infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, hasaccused the UK of being less rigorous in its approval process. ""The UK did not do it as carefully,"" he told Fox News. ""If you go quickly and you do it superficially, people are not going to want to get vaccinated."" Fauci was facing criticism that the US was behind the UK in receiving the vaccine, but said there was only a difference of ""a couple of days"" and promised that US approval would come ""very soon"". He did not detail any specific issues with the UK approvals process. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, responsible for approving the vaccine, said it had accelerated the process by conducting a rolling review of Pfizer's data, starting at the beginning of October. ""We have rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review,â the agency said. Portugal's health minister has said that the country's citizens will receive Covid-19 vaccines for free via the public health service. Marta Temido
said 22 million doses would be bought for â¬200m. Vaccinations will start in January and nearly a million people will be given shots in the first phase. The country has six agreements for vaccines, including with AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, according to drugs regulator Infarmed. Earlier officials said the country had passed the peak of the ""second wave"" of the virus, which occurred between 12 and 15 November. Restrictions introduced last month include mandatory remote working and
a nightly curfew for the vast majority of the population, and a weekend
curfew in areas deemed to be at very high or extremely high risk, including
Lisbon and Porto. Portugal has had a total of 303,846 confirmed coronavirus cases since the
start of the epidemic and 4,645 deaths associated with Covid-19. The UK government's coronavirus figures suggest that for three months the average number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test was fewer than 50 deaths per day. But, as we have reported, on Monday the number of people who have died has increased to a total of 60,113 - up 414 in the past 24 hours. There have been a further 14,879 cases, as daily cases continue on a downward trend. As the latest government figures have confirmed, more than 60,000 people in
the UK have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. According to data from John Hopkins University,external, only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK. The UK government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest therehave been more than 69,000 deaths by this measure,external. The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland - which measure excess deaths - show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. The UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths,according to the latest government figures,external. A total of 60,113 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 414 in the past 24 hours. Two other ways of measuring deaths - where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate, and the number of ""excess deaths"" for this time of year - give higher total figures. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK,according to data from Johns Hopkins University,external. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics In
the week to 29 November, 87% of the nearly 90,000 beds in English hospitals
were occupied. This
is largely unchanged since the first week of November, when NHS England first
published these figures. The
NHS is meant to keep at least a 10th of its beds free to create flexibility to
admit patients and cope with surges in demand. But
a single number doesnât tell the full story. It
doesnât include the Nightingale hospitals that provide extra capacity, or the
beds that have been freed by cancelling operations. Or
that the pressures arenât evenly spread. Some
hospitals like North Middlesex, Southport & Ormskirk, Surrey &
Sussex, and Wrightington, Wigan & Leigh have more than 95% of beds taken. More
hospitals have seen capacity free up this month than have seen it tighten. But
as we move into the months that, in any year, put the most stress on capacity
within the NHS, all eyes will be on these figures. BBC World News This video can not be played Coronavirus: Normality is 'years away' despite vaccines A complete return to normal life after the coronavirus pandemic is years away, Prof Dale Fisher, chairman of the World Health Organisation's global outbreak and response network has said. He told BBC World News: ""I think over the next year or two things will loosen up quite a lot. I think we will eventually get back to normal but will that take three years or 10 years, I don't know."" He said there were a number of challenges ahead with the distribution of vaccines, including encouraging people to have them and not get complacent about the risks from the virus as time went on. Prof Fisher was speaking to Lucy Hocking. Care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the Covid vaccine from 14 December, the Scottish health secretary has confirmed. There had been concerns about getting doses to care homes because of issues with transporting small doses. But Jeanne Freeman said some of those issues had been addressed, making it possible to take the vaccine to homes. The first batches of the vaccine, which arrive in Scotland on Tuesday, will be given to health staff. Read morehere. Nick BeakeBrussels Correspondent, BBC News An exasperated sigh sums up
the reaction from a number of European
capitals to the vaccine victory
proclamations of some British government ministers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonâs sweeping
assessment that the UK is a âbetterâ country than many of its allies was seen
as particularly bold. One senior diplomat told me
he was delighted Britons would soon be receiving the vaccine, but that âsomeone
should remind Mr Williamson that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was created by a
German company, founded by scientists of Turkish origin, in partnership with
an American distributor, and is being manufactured in Belgium before being
transported across France to reach the UKâ. The claim that Brexit allowed the UK to approve the vaccine faster than other Europe countries has been disproved, but it does reflect once again a different path the UK is taking. All EU countries have the option to follow the UK example and let their domestic
drug regulator issue emergency approval, but the bloc says it wants to wait for
the European Medicines Agency to give the green light on all their behalf. But if the
Europe-wide delivery of a vaccine which promises to end the coronavirus misery
for millions is pushed back, there will likely be more voices asking: âWhy canât
we have what the Brits have already got?â.  We have more on the latest figures in the US where there have been a record number of cases. As we mentioned earlier, new cases rose by a record 195,695 on Wednesday. These graphs show the extent of the problem faced by health services there.  The number of people in hospital passed 100,000 for the first time, a figure that has doubled since early November, Covid Tracking Project data showed.  And deaths have risen quickly in recent weeks too - the daily death toll of 2,733 was close to a new high.  Nationwide, infections are now closing in on 14 million, with more than 264,000 deaths, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. Asda has become the latest supermarket to return business rates relief it has received from the UK government during the pandemic, announcing it will repay Â£340m. It follows similar moves by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi and means the grocers will collectively return more than Â£1.7bn. Supermarkets had been allowed to stay open during the lockdown while non-essential shops had to close. Asda said its costs in dealing with Covid had outweighed any state support. But its president and chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: ""As the hope of a vaccine and a more 'normal' life returning in 2021 grows, we have confidence that we are in a strong position to again do the right thing for the communities we serve."" Earlier, England's deputy chief medical officer answered questions from members of the public about Covid-19, including on vaccine safety and effectiveness, in a live BBC News special. Here are some of the highlights, from giving vaccine advice to his mum,  rolling out another football analogy and Father Christmas' position on the vaccine priority list.

"Care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid vaccine from 14 December, the health secretary has confirmed. There had been fears that homes would not be able to receive the first batch of doses due to logistical challenges. But Jeanne Freeman said confirmation on how the vaccine can be transported and stored meant it would now be possible to deliver them to care homes. The vaccines will be given to the vaccinators from Tuesday 8 December. The health secretary said about 65,500 doses of the vaccine would arrive in Scotland by Tuesday. Thefirst consignment of the vaccine arrived in the UK on Thursdayand it will now be distributed to vaccination centres across the four nations. They will initially be stored in packs of 997 doses in specialist freezers around Scotland. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at a temperature of -70C. Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week What are the safety checks for vaccines? When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Ms Freeman said this posed ""particular logistical challenges"" when vaccinating people at or close to their homes. But she told MSPs it had now been confirmed the vaccine could be transported in an unfrozen state for up to 12 hours. It can also be broken down into smaller pack sizes and stored undiluted for up to five days, she said. ""So in effect we can take the vaccine to them [care homes] or close to them, and we will begin that exercise from 14 December,"" the health secretary said. ""From next Tuesday we will begin vaccinating first the vaccinators themselves and then work our way through the first cohorts of health and social care workers."" The vaccine is made in Belgium and has to be stored at around -70C The health secretary said Scotland already had the 160 vaccinators who would be needed from Tuesday. The government is also ""on track"" to recruit 2,000 vaccinators and support staff by the end of January. ""An existing core of trained and experienced vaccinators from the flu programme will transition over to Covid vaccination over this month and next,"" she said. ""We are actively recruiting from the emergency registers and the NHS Scotland accelerated recruitment portal and drawing from the wider clinical workforce of GPs, pharmacists, dentists and optometrists."" Ms Freeman said that pregnant women, or women who were planning to be pregnant in the next three months, should not take the Pfizer vaccine. And she confirmed 16 and 17-year-olds with underlying health conditions would be vaccinated, following a request from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Half of the initial supplies of the vaccine that arrive in Scotland in December will be held back for the second dose. The Scottish government has bought 23 ultra-low temperature freezers to store the vaccine. They will be based at all major acute hospitals across the country and on Scotland's islands. Ms Freeman said the introduction of mass vaccination centres was ""further down the line"". But she added that she hoped the first wave of the vaccination programme would be completed by the spring. The Scottish Conservatives said more clarity was still needed on staff recruitment, vaccination centres, freezers, and the long-term plans. Everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 will be offered a vaccination. The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has drawn up advice on how people should be prioritised. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials. The vaccine must be stored at around -70C and will be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people. The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said despite the speed of approval, no corners have been cut. Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said.

"Asda has announced it will repay Â£340m of business rates relief it has received during the pandemic. It follows similar moves by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi and means the grocers will collectively return more than Â£1.7bn. Supermarkets, whose sales have boomed in the crisis, have been criticised for taking government help while paying dividends to shareholders. Asda said its costs of dealing with Covid had outweighed any state support. But its president and chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: ""As the hope of a vaccine and a more 'normal' life returning in 2021 grows, we have confidence that we are in a strong position to again do the right thing for the communities we serve."" Earlier on Thursday, Sainsbury's said it would hand back Â£440m of rates relief it had received, followed by Aldi which pledged to repay Â£100m. It was followed by discount retailer B&M, which said it would forgo Â£80m of rates relief. B&M stores sell some food, alongside homewares, toys and electrical goods. On Wednesday, Tesco and Morrisons promised to repay Â£850m between them. Both Sainsbury's and Aldi said the decision reflected the fact they had been allowed to stay open in lockdown while non-essential shops had to close. Labour said big supermarkets had ""done the decent thing"" but urged the government to pass on the Â£1.7bn handed back already to hard-hit businesses such as pubs and restaurants operating under the new tier system. The Treasury said any funds returned would ""support the ongoing efforts to protect people's jobs and incomes"". Asda has recently been bought by the UK-based billionaire Issa brothers and private equity firm TDR Capital from Walmart of the US in a deal valuing the supermarket chain at Â£6.8bn. Mr Burnley said: ""Almost half our customers are telling us they expect their financial position to worsen in the next 12 months and we recognise that there are other industries and businesses for whom the effects of Covid-19 will be much more long lasting and whose survival is essential to thousands of jobs."" He said Asda would discuss with the government and devolved authorities the best way to return the money ""to ensure the relief we have received can go towards helping those that need it most"". Supermarkets repay rates relief after backlash Sainsbury's to cut 3,500 jobs and shut Argos shops Sainsbury's said that its sales had been ""stronger than originally expected"", despite it facing ""significant costs"" in the crisis. ""With regional restrictions likely to remain in place for some time, we believe it is now fair and right to forgo the business rates relief that we have been given on all Sainsbury's stores,"" boss Simon Roberts said. ""We are very mindful that non-essential retailers and many other businesses have been forced to close again in the second lockdown and we hope that this goes some way towards helping them."" Giles Hurley, boss of Aldi UK, said returning the full value of its business rates was ""the right decision to help support the nation"". In March, all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England were given a business rates holiday for 12 months to help them get through the crisis. But MPs have criticised supermarkets for taking around Â£1.9bn in help while paying dividends to shareholders, calling it an ""absolute scandal"". The UK's supermarkets have seen a sales boom during the pandemic, albeit with higher costs. The big four grocers - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - are also receiving an estimated Â£1 in every Â£6 of all the business rates relief offered by the government. They have come under political fire amid concerns that this help from the taxpayer could've been given to other parts of the retail or hospitality sectors that are still in survival mode - especially since some of the supermarket groups have also been paying dividends to shareholders. Tesco went first and that piled the pressure on its main rivals to immediately follow suit. It says it is simply doing the right thing but some suspect Tesco's move will also help smooth the way for a bumper Â£5bn special dividend pay-out following the sale of its Asian business. And for all of them, there may have been fears about being hit by a possible government windfall tax in the future. Earlier this month, Mr Roberts defended Sainsbury's decision to pay out Â£230m to investors at a time when the chain is also cutting 3,500 jobs and vowing to close 420 Argos stores as part of a restructuring plan. The company pointed out it had taken no money from the government's furlough wage support scheme. However, it will hang on to a further Â£40m of business rates relief for its Argos stores, which as non-essential shops had to close in the lockdowns. Tesco announced on Wednesday it would repay rates relief On Wednesday, Tesco said it would repay Â£585m after it had been criticised over investor payouts. Morrisons also announced it had ""brought forward"" a decision on rates relief and would pay back Â£274m. Kathleen Brooks, of financial analysts Minerva, told the BBC that supermarkets had faced ""a lot of political and media pressure to follow suit"". Some would also see it as a way to avoid having to ""answer to government"", as banks had to after being bailed out in the 2008 financial crisis. However, other grocers have said they will not repay the rates relief. Marks and Spencer, which reported a half year loss and has cancelled its dividend for 2020, said the government support had been ""much-needed"" during ""incredibly challenging circumstances"". While the retailer sells food, most of its clothing and homeware store space has had to close during the lockdowns. On Wednesday, the Co-op said the amount it had spent on protecting staff and customers outweighed the savings from rates relief. But the retailer added it would consider its position on government support again at the end of the year. Waitrose-owner the John Lewis Partnership said the relief would help offset the ""significant"" sales lost while its John Lewis shops were closed, as well as money spent on staying secure from Covid. ""The outlook remains incredibly uncertain and government support remains crucial to help us navigate the crisis,"" it said.

"Education has been ""completely disrupted"" by the sheer scale of Covid absences in some schools in some areas, Ofsted regional bosses have warned. The regional directors for North-West England and the West Midlands say the impact of rules around self-isolation has significantly impacted attendance. They highlight areas where hundreds of pupils are absent and self-isolating at a time, some again and again. Ofsted says some areas will have seen relatively little impact this term. The latest official figures for overall attendance in England show 22% of pupils in secondary schools were absent last Thursday. This was the same as the previous week, when figures also showed at least some pupils being sent home in 75% of schools. Covid and schools: 'Kids know things aren't right' Pupils sent home in half of England's secondary schools More secondary pupils missing lessons during pandemic Almost one in five secondary schools sending pupils home The comments from these regional directors working with schools in hard-hit areas, come days before England's ministers are due to set out plans for public exams in the summer of 2021. James McNeillie, who oversees West Midlands for Ofsted, meets regularly with groups of head teachers. He said: ""I had one head teacher with schools in Dudley and Sandwell. Across three schools, there were 1,000 pupils self-isolating and 14 members of staff self-isolating. ""And he told me he had dealt with four Covid cases by 10 in the morning. ""That's the kind of messages we are getting about the impact on pupils and teachers."" Andrew Cook, who overseas North-West England which has had some of the highest Covid rates in the country, said there were significant concerns about attendance in areas around Liverpool. Oldham and Greater Manchester. ""There are schools where 40% of staff are off - either self-isolating or having tested positive. The huge impact of self-isolation has a significant impact on attendance. ""Schools are struggling because the number of staff they have had to send home - that impacts their ability to keep schools open. ""Attendance was fairly stable at the beginning of term but its started to decline,"" he said. Mr Cook added that there was one local authority where the whole of Year 11 (GCSE year) had only been in school for two weeks before half term because they were repeatedly having to isolate as a bubble. It would be extremely difficult to keep lessons flowing in such a situation, he said. He added that those pupils who were persistently absent - often those who were most vulnerable before the pandemic - were starting to stay away again. And that parental confidence in school safety was often being shaken when cases or suspected cases emerged. He added: ""The impact on education is going to be significant. There will be some schools that have been hit hardest and with repeated episodes and that is going to completely disrupt their learning."" But he said schools had worked incredibly hard to provide learning online. Looking forward to the way public exams are to be held this year, both directors said it had to be fair. Mr McNeillie said: ""Whatever it is that's decided by central government and Ofqual [the exams watchdog]  - it has to be something that is fair for all."" Mr Cook agreed, adding that schools and head teachers were very focussed on exam groups and were trying to support them as much as possible. Both directors paid tribute to teaching staff and heads, saying they had been doing an amazing job. AnalysisBy Branwen Jeffreys BBC Education Editor The national picture on school attendance hides big variations. Data which I've seen exclusively suggests that even across the north of England some areas are recovering better than other. So the proportion of schools with cases is lower in Blackpool at below 30%, than Oldham or Rochdale where it remained above 40% last week. Other places have suddenly been hit by the impact of the virus, with 16 schools in Kent reported closed recently.  All of this makes it much harder to find a way of recognising lost learning for those facing exams. Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""The health secretary yesterday said the national lockdown had helped to bring coronavirus back under control. ""It will not feel like that in many schools which continue to operate under very difficult circumstances because of the impact of the pandemic. ""We are particularly concerned about the final week of term when any positive cases will result in many children and staff having to self-isolate over Christmas in line with Covid protocols. ""We are pressing the government to allow schools to move to partial or full remote learning during that week if they feel this would help address the situation."" But a Department for Education spokesperson said it was a national priority to keep education settings open full-time. This was supported by the Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty,  who has highlighted the damage caused by not being in education to children's learning, development and mental health, he said. ""Schools, colleges and early years settings across the country have worked extremely hard to remain open, implementing safety measures and scaling up remote education provision for those children who are self-isolating, with approximately 99% of schools open each week since the start of term."" However, National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said pupils and teacher attendance figures was fluctuating massively and head teachers were doing their best to help pupils catch up whilst keeping their schools running. But he said they were ""operating largely in the dark"" because the government was dragging its heals on crucial announcements. âCollapseâ in secondary school attendance warning Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"A-levels and GCSEs in England are due to go ahead next summer, with the exam season starting three weeks later than usual. Plans for how to manage them in a pandemic are expected to be published later this week. So what are the options for making exams fair when many teenagers have missed out on schooling due to the Covid-19 pandemic? Socially distanced exams have already had a trial run with GCSE resits in further education colleges in England in November. It was a big task, with colleges emptying out their buildings so they had enough space to set out for the exams. While tens of thousands of students were resitting maths and English exams, the summer exams are taken by hundreds of thousands. But the autumn retakes have shown that exams can happen in difficult circumstances, albeit on a much smaller scale. Mixed response as 2021 exams in Wales scrapped Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 NI GCSE and A-level exams 'will go ahead in 2021' Will next summer's exams be cancelled? By early summer it's also possible that rapid testing, of the kind being used at universities, could be targeted at any remaining areas of high transmission. This is expected to happen. In summer 2020, grades based largely on teacher assessment jumped up - 78.8% of GCSEs were grade 4 or above compared to 69.9% in 2019. Top grades in A-levels went up too. So will it be back down with a bump this year with exams? That would cause an outcry, because all students have missed out to different degrees. The exams regulator Ofqual has already said the ""baleful"" impact of the pandemic on some students means it doesn't want to drive grades back down to pre-pandemic levels. Giving schools some advance warning of which topics are coming up is already in place for some subjects - and that could increase. Advance warning could be given of the main topics for exams, so schools can use the time between now and the exams to best prepare students. There are different ways this could be done, from identifying texts to slightly narrowing down the content. The scope of the exams has already been reduced in  GCSE English literature, history and ancient history. For example, a pupil would have to answer on a Shakespeare play and then two out of three optional areas in English literature papers. The difficulty of extending this  is it risks further increasing the advantage for teenagers who have faced little disruption due to Covid-19 since September. But it would help schools focus their efforts over the next few months. This is one of the suggestions backed by the Labour Party and has gained interest from some head teachers. But it's an idea that's been sliding down the popularity scale. It would mean putting more choice of questions on exam papers, so students could answer on what their school had managed to cover. It's a form of optionality. However, research has suggested that it can make exam papers more confusing to navigate, which ends up favouring the academically stronger pupils. This is the biggest headache - hard to fix fairly and potentially politically tricky too. Secondary school attendance has fallen dramatically to below 70% of pupils in some areas. Parts of North West England have been badly affected, and some schools in Kent are feeling the impact now. The Labour Party has called for regional adjustment of exam results. That wouldn't take account of highly localised differences, with some schools - even within the same areas - being differently affected, and for that reason it is unlikely. But there will be pressure to find a way of recognising the lost learning. This is unlikely to be done officially, which could risk leaving students carrying a qualification into their future that marks them out as different. Schools are likely to help students plead special circumstances so they can progress to college, apprenticeships  or university. Already two universities have said they will accept one grade lower in recognition of the disruption this year. There could be more than one solution to the issue of students missing exams. Every year some students miss exams because of illness, accidents or a family tragedy. There is a process to deal with these  ""special considerations""  which could be used for individual students. It can involve using data from another paper in the same subject and teacher assessment. But what if a bigger group of teenagers miss out on crucial exams? A contingency series of exams at a slightly later date is likely, so that anyone who needs to go on to the next stage isn't held up waiting for autumn. A-levels and GCSE exams in Wales havealready been cancelled. Nationals in Scotlandhave also been cancelled, but Highers and Advanced Highers will be taken, two weeks later than usual. In Northern Ireland,GCSEs and A-levels will go ahead, but will start a week later than usual.

"Better Examinations' technology keeps an eye on exam-sitters via their webcams The phones began ringing off the hook at Piero Tintori's company Better Examinations back in April. His tech business allows tens of thousands of students to remotely sit exams at the same time, with each needing just a laptop, a webcam and an internet connection. The firm's software uses machine learning (ML), an advanced form of artificial intelligence, to detect patterns in user behaviour that could indicate attempts to cheat. Its technology can also automatically mark multiple-choice answers and mathematics exams. In addition, it checks each exam-sitter's identity using the webcam, to ensure that no-one else is sitting the test for them. The Better Examinations program also temporarily restricts access to the internet, or certain websites and applications on each person's computer. ""We had 60 organisations from all over the world contact us out of the blue, who wanted to run exams online in May and June,"" says Mr Tintori. ""Everything from universities, to professional organisations, to schools."" Piero Tintori says he was even contacted directly by a number of governments With the firm's headquarters in Dublin, plus offices in the US, Australia and Poland, it uses Amazon's cloud computing system Amazon Web Services, to allow everything to work online. Mr Tintori says he was also contacted directly by five governments (whom he declines to name), who were keen for school exams to go ahead. The AI that spots Alzheimer's from cookie drawing Better Examinations is just one example of the increased use of ML in response to this year's pandemic, with the technology being used to do work far more quickly than humans, such as marking exam papers. But what exactly is ML? It is a method of data analysis, whereby computer algorithms are used to speedily process vast amounts of data, to make predictions, identify patterns and replicate actions that humans do in their day-to-day jobs. The use of ML is expected to grow so much over the next four years that its estimated global economic value is expected to rise from $7.3bn (Â£5.7bn) this year, to $30.6bn in 2024,according to one study,external. Machine learning aims to allow computers to be able to make more human-like decisions Global law firm DWF, which helps the in-house legal teams of large corporations, is another business now increasingly using the technology. It was approached by a large real estate company that had an ""impossible"" task. The client wanted 10,000 property lease documents, stored on paper and electronically, and in different locations, to be digitalised into a central database. This firm also wanted to know the exact terms of each of the leases, to discover new commercial opportunities. ""Traditionally, you would get paralegals under supervision to plough through the documents. But from a cost point of view it doesn't work, and also it's inconsistent,"" says Mark Qualter, chief executive of DWF's managed services division. DWF designed an ML system to classify each lease document into categories, identify specific types of details, and then extract data from the document. DWF's Mark Qualter says that ML technology can be far quicker than using humans to do the same job The banking sector is also embracing ML. UK building society Nationwide had asked US computer giant IBM to build an artificial intelligence ""chatbot"" called Arti for it, to help first-time buyers understand how to get a mortgage. But when the UK went into its first lockdown in March, and mortgage holidays were announced, the lender was instead inundated with queries about them. In just four days, Arti - powered by AI platform IBM Watson - was retrained to answer mortgage holiday questions. The virtual agent also dealt with other questions as Nationwide saw online banking registrations jump by 89%. ""In just over two months, Arti had responded to more than 10,000 queries, and a further 350 per day since, freeing up hundreds of hours for frontline teams to focus their time handling more complex requests from members,"" says Michael Conway, UK lead for artificial intelligence at IBM Services. ""Put simply, it allowed Nationwide to focus its resources on those who needed the most help, without ignoring the needs of everyone else."" Nationwide has seen registrations for online banking jump during the pandemic Meanwhile, another UK retail bank has been using ML algorithms to identify customers who are showing indications of financial difficulty, so that they can be contacted automatically, and then offered support before matters get out of hand. This has been provided to the lender by BJSS, a multinational technology engineering consultancy headquartered in Leeds. Sri Harsha Tharkabhushanam, head of data science for BJSS, says that previously of those in arrears, 30% had got to a severe position where ""there was very little the bank could do for them at that point"". But after implementing the ML model, the automated prompts meant fewer people were getting into severe difficulties, with the figure falling to 10%. Business intelligence gathering using AI is also becoming a big deal. For instance, a large European pharmaceutical firm, which wants to remain anonymous, wanted to make sure that if there was a new product launched, or start-up bought, by any of their competitors, it knew about it quickly. New Tech Economyis a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. The company employed Filament AI, a machine-learning software firm in London, to build it a bespoke ML system that could monitor 1,000 websites, 200 story feeds, and roughly 200,000 news articles a day round the clock. Michael Osborne, a professor of machine learning at Oxford University, says that companies across many industries are now ""desperately trying to get their hands on ML"", as many more things are now being quantified digitally, making it easier to analyse them to gain insights. Martha White, associate professor of computing science at the University of Alberta in Canada, agrees that the use of ML is growing fast. ""The combination of more data, and more powerful computers, and a focus on leveraging both has really propelled the field forward,"" she says. ""The prevalence will continue to grow for a few reasons. Firstly, there is still lots of low-hanging fruit, and the ability to monetise with the existing technology. Secondly, we are going to get better at improving our own decision making, using predictions from machine-learning systems."" But although ML is becoming increasingly popular, there are concerns it has been oversold as a ""magic wand"", and the public's distrust of it is only rising, warns Prof Osborne. ""ML is not this all-singing, all-dancing solution to our woes,"" he says. ""Instead it's something that delivers value only when working hand-in-hand with humans, and having humans tailor it to their specific needs. ""ML is powerful, but not a fully general-purpose technology. It needs a lot of careful tweaking to get it to work for any new application.""

"The UK becomes first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths, according to official figures Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than UK England's deputy chief medical officer hails Pfizer vaccine approval but says ""we have to take it really carefully"" Education secretary says UK got vaccine first because it is a ""better country"" than France, Belgium and US Moscow announces start of immunisation programme on Saturday, using Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine US has record number of new daily cases - almost 200,000 - as hospitalisations double since early November Facebook to take down false vaccine claims to prevent ""imminent physical harm"" International vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, IBM says Edited by Paul Gribben and Robert Greenall As our live page draws to a close, here is a round-up of the main coronavirus news today.   Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italy responded to a recent surge in cases with a new round of restrictions It was a milestone Italians knew would be a matter of time before they hit: the day when the country would exceed the highest death toll of the first
wave â 969 on 27 March. And now itâs happened. With 993 deaths
recorded in the past 24 hours, Italy has had its deadliest day of the pandemic.
The numbers are hard to fathom. The chink of light is that the infection rate is gradually
decreasing. While cases remain high âabove 23,000 today â the rate of positive
results to number of tests has decreased in the past week from 12.4% to 10.2%.
The curve is flattening. But as in the first wave, it takes time for the death
toll to catch up, since many of todayâs fatalities were infected around the
peak of the second wave in early November. After grim figures, Italians are bracing themselves for a
less-than-happy Christmas with tightened restrictions. Theyâll be banned from
moving between regions, forced to self-isolate if they come into the country
from abroad, ordered to obey night-time curfews around Christmas Day and New
Year and told only to celebrate Christmas lunch with close family. This country
has been devastated by the first and now the second wave. It fears a third.  The US Supreme Court has ordered a lower court to reconsider a challenge to pandemic-related restrictions on religious services in California. The ruling sided with a church that had challenged the policy as unconstitutional religious discrimination, throwing out a lower court  ruling rejecting their case. The Harvest Rock Church and Harvest International Ministry has more than 160 churches in the state, according to AP news agency. California Governor Gavin Newsom has put heavy restrictions on religious services amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Under the current rules, houses of worship in the stateâs worst-hit areas cannot hold indoor gatherings. Elsewhere, there are restrictions on capacity. The ruling on Thursday came after the Supreme Court last week barred New York from enforcing certain limits on attendance at churches and synagogues. Quarantine rules are set to be eased for business travellers in England, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. From 04:00 GMT on Saturday, 5 December, the following people will no longer need to self-isolate when returning to England from a country not in a travel corridor:  For business travellers, their trips must result in a deal which creates or preserves 50 jobs or leads to a Â£100,000 investment or order, according to the Department for Transport. Read more on this story here Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were joined at Soho Theatre by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have been visiting entertainment venues in Soho, London, today to find out how the arts and entertainment sector has been coping during the pandemic. The couple were treated to an intimate performance at Soho Theatre - of the one-woman play Half Breed by Natasha Marshall. The actress revealed she had to dash from her Morrisons supermarket job to do the gig in front of the royals and was still wearing her uniform. She told the prince and his wife: ""I've got to go back later so it was easier to keep it on, I'll be in such a rush. ""The theatre has supported me so much I jumped at the chance to perform today."" Charles replied: ""That's marvellous, such dedication. I really enjoyed the performance and I am praying all of you can open soon."" Many entertainment venues are battling to stay in business because of the restrictions Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics So far, wave two has been lower
and slower than wave one. About 80% of deaths involving
coronavirus happened before August, and most of those happened in just one
month. Almost 10,000 coronavirus
deaths a week were registered in consecutive weeks in April. In this second wave, it looks
like the peak figures â assuming infections keep falling before widespread
vaccination takes place â might be closer to 3,000 than 4,000. And, as in wave one, those over
75 account for about 75% of the deaths, suggesting that vaccinating over-75s
could stem the vast majority of future deaths. This time around, the spread
of deaths around the country has looked quite different. In the spring and summer,
London and the North West of England each accounted for about 15% of
coronavirus deaths in the UK. But in this wave, Londonâs
share is down, closer to 5% whereas the North West is just under 25%. As the UK becomes the first European country to record a death toll of over 60,000, the daily reported deaths remain high at an average of 441 over the last 7 days. But confirmed cases show a marked fall following England's nationwide lockdown and stricter measures elsewhere in the UK. It also seems to have had an impact on daily hospital admissions, which have fallen to an average of 1,395 a day in the seven days up to 26 November, from a high of 1765 a day on 11 November. Dr Anthony Fauci was challenged over the vaccine's earlier availability in the UK UK ministers have been making their quick approval of the Pfizer vaccine a point of national pride, with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson facing criticism for claiming the speed was due to the UK being a ""much better country"" than European rivals. But the top US infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, hasaccused the UK of being less rigorous in its approval process. ""The UK did not do it as carefully,"" he told Fox News. ""If you go quickly and you do it superficially, people are not going to want to get vaccinated."" Fauci was facing criticism that the US was behind the UK in receiving the vaccine, but said there was only a difference of ""a couple of days"" and promised that US approval would come ""very soon"". He did not detail any specific issues with the UK approvals process. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, responsible for approving the vaccine, said it had accelerated the process by conducting a rolling review of Pfizer's data, starting at the beginning of October. ""We have rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review,â the agency said. Portugal's health minister has said that the country's citizens will receive Covid-19 vaccines for free via the public health service. Marta Temido
said 22 million doses would be bought for â¬200m. Vaccinations will start in January and nearly a million people will be given shots in the first phase. The country has six agreements for vaccines, including with AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, according to drugs regulator Infarmed. Earlier officials said the country had passed the peak of the ""second wave"" of the virus, which occurred between 12 and 15 November. Restrictions introduced last month include mandatory remote working and
a nightly curfew for the vast majority of the population, and a weekend
curfew in areas deemed to be at very high or extremely high risk, including
Lisbon and Porto. Portugal has had a total of 303,846 confirmed coronavirus cases since the
start of the epidemic and 4,645 deaths associated with Covid-19. The UK government's coronavirus figures suggest that for three months the average number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test was fewer than 50 deaths per day. But, as we have reported, on Monday the number of people who have died has increased to a total of 60,113 - up 414 in the past 24 hours. There have been a further 14,879 cases, as daily cases continue on a downward trend. As the latest government figures have confirmed, more than 60,000 people in
the UK have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. According to data from John Hopkins University,external, only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK. The UK government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest therehave been more than 69,000 deaths by this measure,external. The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland - which measure excess deaths - show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. The UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths,according to the latest government figures,external. A total of 60,113 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 414 in the past 24 hours. Two other ways of measuring deaths - where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate, and the number of ""excess deaths"" for this time of year - give higher total figures. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK,according to data from Johns Hopkins University,external. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics In
the week to 29 November, 87% of the nearly 90,000 beds in English hospitals
were occupied. This
is largely unchanged since the first week of November, when NHS England first
published these figures. The
NHS is meant to keep at least a 10th of its beds free to create flexibility to
admit patients and cope with surges in demand. But
a single number doesnât tell the full story. It
doesnât include the Nightingale hospitals that provide extra capacity, or the
beds that have been freed by cancelling operations. Or
that the pressures arenât evenly spread. Some
hospitals like North Middlesex, Southport & Ormskirk, Surrey &
Sussex, and Wrightington, Wigan & Leigh have more than 95% of beds taken. More
hospitals have seen capacity free up this month than have seen it tighten. But
as we move into the months that, in any year, put the most stress on capacity
within the NHS, all eyes will be on these figures. BBC World News This video can not be played Coronavirus: Normality is 'years away' despite vaccines A complete return to normal life after the coronavirus pandemic is years away, Prof Dale Fisher, chairman of the World Health Organisation's global outbreak and response network has said. He told BBC World News: ""I think over the next year or two things will loosen up quite a lot. I think we will eventually get back to normal but will that take three years or 10 years, I don't know."" He said there were a number of challenges ahead with the distribution of vaccines, including encouraging people to have them and not get complacent about the risks from the virus as time went on. Prof Fisher was speaking to Lucy Hocking. Care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the Covid vaccine from 14 December, the Scottish health secretary has confirmed. There had been concerns about getting doses to care homes because of issues with transporting small doses. But Jeanne Freeman said some of those issues had been addressed, making it possible to take the vaccine to homes. The first batches of the vaccine, which arrive in Scotland on Tuesday, will be given to health staff. Read morehere. Nick BeakeBrussels Correspondent, BBC News An exasperated sigh sums up
the reaction from a number of European
capitals to the vaccine victory
proclamations of some British government ministers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonâs sweeping
assessment that the UK is a âbetterâ country than many of its allies was seen
as particularly bold. One senior diplomat told me
he was delighted Britons would soon be receiving the vaccine, but that âsomeone
should remind Mr Williamson that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was created by a
German company, founded by scientists of Turkish origin, in partnership with
an American distributor, and is being manufactured in Belgium before being
transported across France to reach the UKâ. The claim that Brexit allowed the UK to approve the vaccine faster than other Europe countries has been disproved, but it does reflect once again a different path the UK is taking. All EU countries have the option to follow the UK example and let their domestic
drug regulator issue emergency approval, but the bloc says it wants to wait for
the European Medicines Agency to give the green light on all their behalf. But if the
Europe-wide delivery of a vaccine which promises to end the coronavirus misery
for millions is pushed back, there will likely be more voices asking: âWhy canât
we have what the Brits have already got?â.  We have more on the latest figures in the US where there have been a record number of cases. As we mentioned earlier, new cases rose by a record 195,695 on Wednesday. These graphs show the extent of the problem faced by health services there.  The number of people in hospital passed 100,000 for the first time, a figure that has doubled since early November, Covid Tracking Project data showed.  And deaths have risen quickly in recent weeks too - the daily death toll of 2,733 was close to a new high.  Nationwide, infections are now closing in on 14 million, with more than 264,000 deaths, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. Asda has become the latest supermarket to return business rates relief it has received from the UK government during the pandemic, announcing it will repay Â£340m. It follows similar moves by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi and means the grocers will collectively return more than Â£1.7bn. Supermarkets had been allowed to stay open during the lockdown while non-essential shops had to close. Asda said its costs in dealing with Covid had outweighed any state support. But its president and chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: ""As the hope of a vaccine and a more 'normal' life returning in 2021 grows, we have confidence that we are in a strong position to again do the right thing for the communities we serve."" Earlier, England's deputy chief medical officer answered questions from members of the public about Covid-19, including on vaccine safety and effectiveness, in a live BBC News special.

""If you go quickly and you do it superficially, people are not going to want to get vaccinated."" Fauci was facing criticism that the US was behind the UK in receiving the vaccine, but said there was only a difference of ""a couple of days"" and promised that US approval would come ""very soon"". He did not detail any specific issues with the UK approvals process. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, responsible for approving the vaccine, said it had accelerated the process by conducting a rolling review of Pfizer's data, starting at the beginning of October. ""We have rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review,â the agency said. Portugal's health minister has said that the country's citizens will receive Covid-19 vaccines for free via the public health service. Marta Temido
said 22 million doses would be bought for â¬200m. Vaccinations will start in January and nearly a million people will be given shots in the first phase. The country has six agreements for vaccines, including with AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, according to drugs regulator Infarmed. Earlier officials said the country had passed the peak of the ""second wave"" of the virus, which occurred between 12 and 15 November. Restrictions introduced last month include mandatory remote working and
a nightly curfew for the vast majority of the population, and a weekend
curfew in areas deemed to be at very high or extremely high risk, including
Lisbon and Porto. Portugal has had a total of 303,846 confirmed coronavirus cases since the
start of the epidemic and 4,645 deaths associated with Covid-19. The UK government's coronavirus figures suggest that for three months the average number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test was fewer than 50 deaths per day. But, as we have reported, on Monday the number of people who have died has increased to a total of 60,113 - up 414 in the past 24 hours. There have been a further 14,879 cases, as daily cases continue on a downward trend. As the latest government figures have confirmed, more than 60,000 people in
the UK have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. According to data from John Hopkins University,external, only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK. The UK government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest therehave been more than 69,000 deaths by this measure,external. The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland - which measure excess deaths - show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. The UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths,according to the latest government figures,external. A total of 60,113 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 414 in the past 24 hours.

the week to 29 November, 87% of the nearly 90,000 beds in English hospitals
were occupied. This
is largely unchanged since the first week of November, when NHS England first
published these figures. The
NHS is meant to keep at least a 10th of its beds free to create flexibility to
admit patients and cope with surges in demand. But
a single number doesnât tell the full story. It
doesnât include the Nightingale hospitals that provide extra capacity, or the
beds that have been freed by cancelling operations. Or
that the pressures arenât evenly spread. Some
hospitals like North Middlesex, Southport & Ormskirk, Surrey &
Sussex, and Wrightington, Wigan & Leigh have more than 95% of beds taken. More
hospitals have seen capacity free up this month than have seen it tighten. But
as we move into the months that, in any year, put the most stress on capacity
within the NHS, all eyes will be on these figures.

He told BBC World News: ""I think over the next year or two things will loosen up quite a lot. I think we will eventually get back to normal but will that take three years or 10 years, I don't know."" He said there were a number of challenges ahead with the distribution of vaccines, including encouraging people to have them and not get complacent about the risks from the virus as time went on. Prof Fisher was speaking to Lucy Hocking. Care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the Covid vaccine from 14 December, the Scottish health secretary has confirmed. There had been concerns about getting doses to care homes because of issues with transporting small doses. But Jeanne Freeman said some of those issues had been addressed, making it possible to take the vaccine to homes. The first batches of the vaccine, which arrive in Scotland on Tuesday, will be given to health staff. Read morehere. Nick BeakeBrussels Correspondent, BBC News An exasperated sigh sums up
the reaction from a number of European
capitals to the vaccine victory
proclamations of some British government ministers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonâs sweeping
assessment that the UK is a âbetterâ country than many of its allies was seen
as particularly bold. One senior diplomat told me
he was delighted Britons would soon be receiving the vaccine, but that âsomeone
should remind Mr Williamson that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was created by a
German company, founded by scientists of Turkish origin, in partnership with
an American distributor, and is being manufactured in Belgium before being
transported across France to reach the UKâ. The claim that Brexit allowed the UK to approve the vaccine faster than other Europe countries has been disproved, but it does reflect once again a different path the UK is taking. All EU countries have the option to follow the UK example and let their domestic
drug regulator issue emergency approval, but the bloc says it wants to wait for
the European Medicines Agency to give the green light on all their behalf. But if the
Europe-wide delivery of a vaccine which promises to end the coronavirus misery
for millions is pushed back, there will likely be more voices asking: âWhy canât
we have what the Brits have already got?â.  We have more on the latest figures in the US where there have been a record number of cases. As we mentioned earlier, new cases rose by a record 195,695 on Wednesday. These graphs show the extent of the problem faced by health services there.  The number of people in hospital passed 100,000 for the first time, a figure that has doubled since early November, Covid Tracking Project data showed.  And deaths have risen quickly in recent weeks too - the daily death toll of 2,733 was close to a new high.  Nationwide, infections are now closing in on 14 million, with more than 264,000 deaths, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. Asda has become the latest supermarket to return business rates relief it has received from the UK government during the pandemic, announcing it will repay Â£340m. It follows similar moves by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi and means the grocers will collectively return more than Â£1.7bn. Supermarkets had been allowed to stay open during the lockdown while non-essential shops had to close. Asda said its costs in dealing with Covid had outweighed any state support. But its president and chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: ""As the hope of a vaccine and a more 'normal' life returning in 2021 grows, we have confidence that we are in a strong position to again do the right thing for the communities we serve.""

Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italy responded to a recent surge in cases with a new round of restrictions It was a milestone Italians knew would be a matter of time before they hit: the day when the country would exceed the highest death toll of the first
wave â 969 on 27 March. And now itâs happened. With 993 deaths
recorded in the past 24 hours, Italy has had its deadliest day of the pandemic.
The numbers are hard to fathom. The chink of light is that the infection rate is gradually
decreasing. While cases remain high âabove 23,000 today â the rate of positive
results to number of tests has decreased in the past week from 12.4% to 10.2%.
The curve is flattening. But as in the first wave, it takes time for the death
toll to catch up, since many of todayâs fatalities were infected around the
peak of the second wave in early November. After grim figures, Italians are bracing themselves for a
less-than-happy Christmas with tightened restrictions. Theyâll be banned from
moving between regions, forced to self-isolate if they come into the country
from abroad, ordered to obey night-time curfews around Christmas Day and New
Year and told only to celebrate Christmas lunch with close family. This country
has been devastated by the first and now the second wave. It fears a third.  The US Supreme Court has ordered a lower court to reconsider a challenge to pandemic-related restrictions on religious services in California. The ruling sided with a church that had challenged the policy as unconstitutional religious discrimination, throwing out a lower court  ruling rejecting their case. The Harvest Rock Church and Harvest International Ministry has more than 160 churches in the state, according to AP news agency. California Governor Gavin Newsom has put heavy restrictions on religious services amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Under the current rules, houses of worship in the stateâs worst-hit areas cannot hold indoor gatherings. Elsewhere, there are restrictions on capacity. The ruling on Thursday came after the Supreme Court last week barred New York from enforcing certain limits on attendance at churches and synagogues. Quarantine rules are set to be eased for business travellers in England, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. From 04:00 GMT on Saturday, 5 December, the following people will no longer need to self-isolate when returning to England from a country not in a travel corridor:  For business travellers, their trips must result in a deal which creates or preserves 50 jobs or leads to a Â£100,000 investment or order, according to the Department for Transport. Read more on this story here Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were joined at Soho Theatre by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have been visiting entertainment venues in Soho, London, today to find out how the arts and entertainment sector has been coping during the pandemic. The couple were treated to an intimate performance at Soho Theatre - of the one-woman play Half Breed by Natasha Marshall. The actress revealed she had to dash from her Morrisons supermarket job to do the gig in front of the royals and was still wearing her uniform. She told the prince and his wife: ""I've got to go back later so it was easier to keep it on, I'll be in such a rush. ""The theatre has supported me so much I jumped at the chance to perform today."" Charles replied: ""That's marvellous, such dedication. I really enjoyed the performance and I am praying all of you can open soon."" Many entertainment venues are battling to stay in business because of the restrictions Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics So far, wave two has been lower
and slower than wave one. About 80% of deaths involving
coronavirus happened before August, and most of those happened in just one
month. Almost 10,000 coronavirus
deaths a week were registered in consecutive weeks in April. In this second wave, it looks
like the peak figures â assuming infections keep falling before widespread
vaccination takes place â might be closer to 3,000 than 4,000. And, as in wave one, those over
75 account for about 75% of the deaths, suggesting that vaccinating over-75s
could stem the vast majority of future deaths. This time around, the spread
of deaths around the country has looked quite different. In the spring and summer,
London and the North West of England each accounted for about 15% of
coronavirus deaths in the UK. But in this wave, Londonâs
share is down, closer to 5% whereas the North West is just under 25%. As the UK becomes the first European country to record a death toll of over 60,000, the daily reported deaths remain high at an average of 441 over the last 7 days. But confirmed cases show a marked fall following England's nationwide lockdown and stricter measures elsewhere in the UK. It also seems to have had an impact on daily hospital admissions, which have fallen to an average of 1,395 a day in the seven days up to 26 November, from a high of 1765 a day on 11 November.

"The UK has said it would be ""very unusual"" for the EU to seek to block post-Brexit food imports amid a growing dispute over the issue. The EU has cast doubt on whether it would grant Britain a ""third-country listing"" for exports of products of animal origin, citing ""uncertainties"" over its biosecurity controls. Such exports are worth Â£5bn to the UK. A government spokesman said the right to export was the foundation of any kind of agricultural relationship. UK firms exporting goods to mainland Europe will face extra checks when the country leaves the single market and customs union on 1 January at the end of the post-Brexit transition period. Talks over a free trade agreement, which it is hoped will eliminate nearly all tariffs and minimise other barriers to trade, are continuing. EU trade talks hang in balance amid Brexit deal row Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? But the two sides remain far apart over several key issues and the process risks being derailed by an acrimonious row over UK plans to pass legislation giving it the right to over-ride aspects of the withdrawal agreement. The European Commission is due to decide in the coming months on whether to allow British exports of live animals, products of animal origin, such as meat, fish, eggs and dairy products, and animal by-products to continue. The granting of a ""third country"" licence to the whole of the UK had been seen as something of a formality, given the EU's similar arrangements with other nations. The two sides have already agreed that Northern Ireland will remain in the EU's sanitary and phyto-sanitary ""zone"". But speaking after the latest round of talks concluded on Thursday, the EU's chief negotiator said ""more clarity"" was needed about Britain's own hygiene and disease control procedures before an ""assessment"" could take place. Michel Barnier said ""many uncertainties"" remained about how they would operate after 31 December. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""It would be very unusual for the EU to go down this route and deny the UK listing. ""The right to export is the absolute basis for a relationship between two countries that trade agricultural goods. It is a licence to export and entirely separate from the issue of food standards."" The EU accounted for about 60% of all UK food and drink exports in 2019, although this figure has fallen from more than 70% five years ago.

"The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, was said to be in good spirits when he updated EU ambassadors on Wednesday These are unsettling days for those of us watching, waiting and occasionally nail-nibbling, constantly calling sources, perpetually checking social media, for hints that an EU-UK trade security deal is nigh - or off the table completely this year. News could come at any moment. The EU - infamously talented at the old goalpost-moving - has admitted that not only does the European Parliament not need to ratify an agreement for it to be provisionally applied as of 1 January, but that EU leaders don't even need to sign off on the treaty in person. An approved member of their government could do that instead, from the comfort of their own home. Could a deal come between Christmas and New Year, then, is the horrified question in EU capitals. Boris Johnson doesn't seem in a hurry to make up his mind, is the broad sentiment in Brussels. EU leaders don't view the prime minister as a details man. EU officials do not see Boris Johnson as in a rush to make big compromises They don't think he's waiting to hear about the finer points of mackerel, herring or cod quotas before deciding what is politically more expedient for him. Declare a firm resolve and no deal and face the music from the opposition and many UK businesses? Or compromise to get a deal and be accused by ardent Brexit supporters of ""betraying the Leave vote""? What happens next with Brexit? More from Katya: How close to a Brexit trade deal are we? Brexit: Seven things that will change on 1 January What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? As always, the EU is only too happy to point out that there's no win-win here. The prime minister can't have his Brexit cake and eat it. For now, though, we're told there's little movement in talks, even though Belgium's prime minister noted the two sides ""are in the last minutes of a football match"". Michel Barnier the EU's chief negotiator, was reportedly in good spirits when he reported on the negotiations to representatives of the 27 EU countries on Wednesday morning. But he emphasised that the key outstanding issues remained very much the same: EU fishing rights in UK waters after Brexit Mutually agreed competition rules And how to govern a deal, including managing any arising disputes if either the UK or the EU failed to keep to the agreement This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains why the level playing field matters in Brexit talks ""This is the painful part,"" one EU diplomat told me, meaning that it's now time for difficult concessions. But frankly this has been the case for weeks. And as far as I and other observers can make out, both the EU and UK are still busy looking into the whites of each other's eyes, rather than holding their nose and jumping. EU diplomats insisted on Wednesday that the EU had gone pretty much as far as it could. ""Michel Barnier didn't ask us today for more flexibility in his negotiating mandate,"" one source told me. ""If he had, our answer would have been clear."" No EU possibility to compromise at all any more, I asked. ""Only millimetres,"" came the reply. Of course, the EU would say that. It wants the UK to make the big concessions. For a while now, EU countries - particularly those geographically closest to the UK, like France, Belgium and the Netherlands, have been nervous that Mr Barnier might concede ""too much"" in these negotiations. There's little appetite in the EU of wanting to do ""whatever it takes"" to get a deal. At five minutes to midnight, or otherwise. Angela Merkel noted that some EU countries were becoming impatient. France's Emmanuel Macron insisted on Tuesday that France would not sign up to anything that wasn't in its long-term interest. But, of course, the UK government says the same. Why leave the EU if only to tie yourself a few months later to Brussels' regulatory apron strings? Why break free from EU rules, with the dream of becoming a nimbler, more competitive sovereign economy, if you're then constrained by an EU trade deal in how much the government can invest in UK industries? And there, it seems, we are still stuck - provoking anxiety in businesses both sides of the Channel. The Dutch government is using a Brexit muppet to highlight the changes to cross-border trade from 1 January The government and the European Commission insist companies were given plenty of warning. Whether a deal is agreed or not by the year's end, with the UK leaving the single market and customs union, big changes lie ahead. Yet the details of the deal are important for business. And a no-deal situation would probably further complicate and/or delay a decision on other impactful issues, separate from these negotiations. Like UK financial services' access to the Single Market after Brexit, or the flow of data between the EU and UK. As for people's holiday plans, there's pet travel permissions and EU and UK access to each other's healthcare systems still to sort out. EU countries are trying to pile pressure on a reluctant European Commission to be more open about contingency measures in case there's no deal - for example on transport, air traffic control and aviation safety. But Brussels doesn't want to give the UK the impression that it can benefit from a series of ""mini deals"" without signing up to a mutually agreed treaty. After months of these circular negotiations on the same sticking points, EU attention is now re-focusing on Brexit - with a sense of weary resignation and tension. ""It's still feasible that we'll get a deal this month,"" one contact told me. ""Or it could be next month. Or next year.""

"Can the smartphone revolution help us predict what impact new green technology will have? You're probably reading this on your phone. If not, take it out your pocket and look at it. It's a smartphone, isn't it? Think how often you use it and all the useful things it helps you do. Now, think back. How long since you bought your first smartphone? It will be about 10 years, most likely a bit less. Not long. Yet they are now ubiquitous: virtually everyone, everywhere has one and uses it for hours every day. It shows how quickly new technology can take off. The original iPhone was only introduced in 2007 and - bizarre as it now seems - it wasn't regarded as revolutionary back then. Check out this Forbes magazine cover published nine months after the iPhone was released. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The iPhone was just ""one more entrant into an already very busy space,"" according to the boss of the company that made Blackberrys. Remember them? Not only have smartphones crushed all other phone technologies, they have upended dozens of other industries too. They've killed the camera and powered the rise of social media and dating apps. They've decimated the traditional taxi industry. So what has this got to do with energy? It proves an important point about all successful new technologies: it is easy to see why they were so transformative in hindsight, much harder to predict how they will reshape our world in advance. Which brings me to green technology - wind turbines, electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries, that kind of thing. If you still think adopting these new technologies will be an expensive chore, think again. Green tech is at a tipping point where it could take off explosively - just like the smartphone did. And, just like the smartphone, it could bring a revolution in how we do much more than just create energy. Green technologies, such as solar, are at a tipping point So why did the smartphone do so well? Its success was down to a unique convergence of technologies. For the first time, touchscreens, batteries, data networks, compact computer chips, micro-sensors and more were cheap, reliable and small enough to make a $600 (Â£460) smartphone possible. And as demand for smartphones picked up, manufacturers learned how to make those technologies even cheaper and better too. Something similar is now happening with green tech. After years of development, it is becoming much cheaper and more effective. The world's best solar power schemes are now the ""cheapest source of electricity in history"", the International Energy Agency (IEA), which analyses energy markets, said this month. ""Renewable energy is likely to penetrate the energy system more quickly than any fuel ever seen in history,"" predicts Spencer Dale, the chief economist at the oil giant BP. And BP is putting its money where Mr Dale's mouth is. It's pledged to cut its oil and gas production by 40% in the next 10 years, and to plough money into developing its low-carbon business instead. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister, announced a Â£160m investment that he said would see offshore wind producing more than half of current UK electricity demand by 2030. That's right. An investment of just Â£160m in offshore wind when the new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point, in Somerset, is costing at least Â£22.5 billion. How is it so cheap? Because the UK government won't be paying for the new wind turbines, the private sector will. In the UK, offshore wind will soon be profitable without subsidy. Indeed, developers may soon have to pay for access to our continental shelf. Think what that means. You don't need governments offering inducements for companies to build new renewable power, they'll be paying us for the privilege of doing so. China has said it will cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2060 But that is just the beginning. What happens when the world doubles down on cutting carbon? The European Unionhas already signed up to a â¬1tn-plus green stimulus plan. China says it is on board too. At the United Nations' General Assembly meeting in New York this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping made an unconditional commitment that Chinawould cut its carbon emissions to net zero by 2060. Japan and South Korea both announced a 2050 net zero pledge this week, and if Joe Biden wins the American presidential election,he has similarly ambitious carbon cutting plans. Both Biden and the EU have warned they will introduce carbon tariffs to penalise countries that haven't abated emissions selling high-carbon products in their markets. That'll be a powerful encouragement for the rest of the world to follow suit. But even if they don't, we'd have America, China and Europe - half of world emissions and more than half of world GDP - doubling down on cutting carbon. That means even more investment in wind, solar, batteries, electric cars, electrolysis, carbon capture and storage, and any other green technology you can think of. Just like with the smartphone, it becomes a virtuous cycle. ""What we've seen up to now is called a learning curve,"" explains Spencer Dale. ""The more you produce something, the better you get at producing it."" As the amount of solar and wind capacity in the world has doubled and doubled again, the costs have steadily fallen -something documented by the clean tech advocate Ramez Naam,external. ""And at the moment there doesn't seem to be any sign that those learning curves are flattening out,"" says Mr Dale. If he's right, then costs will continue to fall, making renewables increasingly competitive, which in turn will lead to more investment and more renewable power. You get the idea. Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external(PDF, 10.4MB) The road to clean energy Let's now do a thought experiment. The big challenge with renewables is what they call in the trade ""intermittency"" - the fact that you don't get any power when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. It is a big problem. Nobody wants the power to go off. RethinkX, an American think tank specialising in blue-skies thinking on the future of industries,says we need to change our whole mindset about how we generate power,external. We are used to worrying about the costs of overcapacity - producing more power than is needed. That's because the fuel used to generate power is expensive. Not so with renewables. Once you've built them, the power they generate from the wind and sun comes virtually free of charge. RethinkX says this will do to energy what the internet and smartphones have done to data. Thirty years ago there was an inherent physical cost to every newspaper printed or photo taken. Now that everything is digital, the only limit on how much we read or post on Instagram is the number of hours in our day. RethinkX argues that instead of simply replacing existing fossil fuel plants with wind and solar - and then worrying about the cost of plugging those big intermittency gaps - we should just build more and more and more wind and solar, perhaps several times the capacity of the existing electricity grid. Remember, the more we build, the cheaper it gets. So long as we spread them over a wide enough area we'll always get some power. And we can plug the few small gaps remaining with batteries or other power plants. And here's the thing. On sunny and windy days we'll have a huge surplus of electricity at pretty much no extra cost. What could you do with huge amounts of cheap power? You'll certainly want to use it to make more wind turbines and solar panels. But what about electrolysing water to produce hydrogen that can heat homes, power trucks and ships, or make steel? You could power machines to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Or how about a plant to make carbon-neutral aviation fuel from that hydrogen and carbon dioxide? Or a desalination plant to irrigate a desert? RethinkX even suggests the power could be used to mine for cryptocurrencies. The point is this: the cost of energy is a key constraint in virtually everything we do. So new industries are likely rise up to make use of this plentiful power. Obviously they'll have to pay something for this bounty and that'll mean the power that boils your kettle and charges your electric car will be cheaper too. Of course, we are a long way from this utopia. The chances are this vision of unlimited, virtually cost-free energy, may not come to pass - or at least not in the 10-year timeframe they predict. The sheer physical challenge of building so much new infrastructure means it will take time to build up the supply chains and raw materials needed, and there may be limits to how much solar and wind some countries can harness. But the central point remains: there are powerful forces driving down the cost of renewable technologies that upend the traditional narrative of decarbonisation. Contrary to what we are normally told, switching to low-carbon energy doesn't have to be an onerous obligation that will impoverish us and make life less exciting. Instead, it could open up a world of new opportunities, new businesses and livelihoods. And what's more, this could all happen quite soon. Spencer Dale quotes the eminent German economist, Rudi Dornbusch who said: ""In economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could."" And if you don't believe that, just think about all the changes your smartphone has helped bring about in the world.

Mr Obama said ""you lost a big audience the minute you say it"", making it ""a lot less likely"" to effect change. His comments received a backlash from some key black progressive Democrats.

"This video can not be played 'Vaccinate unpaid carers alongside NHS workers' Unpaid carers should have the Covid-19 vaccine at the same time as health and social care workers, a charity said. Carers Wales warned 680,000 carers in Wales would be ""really disappointed"" not to be among those prioritised for the approved Pfizer/BioNTech jab. It wants Wales to follow Scotland in prioritising unpaid carers for the jab. The Welsh Government said the Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation (JCVI) would ""probably"" announce an acceleration of vaccines for carers. The UK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use on Wednesday. The jab offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness and the Welsh Government hopes the first vaccines will be given within seven to 14 days. Priority groups include health and social care workers and over-80s while everyone aged over 50 will be offered the vaccine in the coming months. Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK from next week What safety checks are there for vaccines? 'Unknown' vaccine schedule for care homes in Wales Beth Evans, policy manager for Carers Wales, said unpaid carers felt undervalued and under-recognised, despite having ""sacrificed so much"" to keep loved ones safe. She said the charity's research showed unpaid carers saved the NHS and statutory services Â£33m every day in Wales. ""Within all Welsh Government policies and everything else, [it says] carers should be treated on an equal basis and actually respected,"" Ms Evans added. ""As an organisation, we're really disappointed that carers are not at the top of the first tranche of the Covid vaccines coming out."" She said receiving the vaccine would enable carers to take a break from their roles without the fear of transmitting the disease. Will unpaid carers such as Matthew Williams be among the first for the vaccine? Matthew and Lisa Williams are full-time carers in Swansea for theirnine-year-old son Macsen who has a rare genetic disorderand suffers multiple daily seizures. Mr Williams, 39, has a heart condition which he thinks might mean he meets the criteria for vaccination as a clinically vulnerable person. But he fears his wife might not get it until the vaccine is rolled out to the wider population. ""We feel we're a group that's missing completely from the whole schedule of who will have this and when,"" he said. This video can not be played How will the vaccine work and who gets it first? ""They're not giving the vaccine to children - understandably. But to keep Macsen safe, everyone around him needs to be vaccinated - us, carers, everyone in school - and that would enable him to go back to school and some kind of normal life. ""But we don't know if there are any plans for vaccinating home carers like us at the moment. ""We fear it'll be a case of 'computer says no, you don't fit the criteria'."" Macsen attends Ysgol Crug Glas special school in Swansea, but has not been since February due to his vulnerability. ""Macs loves school but he's missed so much of it,"" said Mr Williams. ""Anything about carers always seems to relate to adult carers - they don't consider carers of children and how it impacts on us. ""What are their plans for parents of vulnerable children who won't themselves be vaccinated? ""We're not saying we should be the first priority - it's right that they look at older people and care homes first - but we don't think we should be last."" Dr Gill Richardson, chairwoman of the Welsh Government's Covid-19 vaccine programme board, said unpaid carers were extremely important not just to the people they care for, but society in general. ""This is something the JCVI is acutely aware of and probably they'll be making announcements about carers and about them being accelerated so they wouldn't have to wait for their particular age group to be called.

"The airline carried 40 millions passengers in the last financial year 2019-20 Budget airline Wizz Air UK is to create 40 jobs with a permanent base at Cardiff Airport. The airline will service nine routes from the airport across Europe and seasonal flights to Egypt. It comes as a major boost for the airport following the loss of Flybe, which collapsed in March. Transport Minister Ken Skates said: ""This is a positive step for the airport to emerge from the impact of Covid-19."" Cardiff Airport will become the airline's fourth base in the UK, following Luton, Gatwick and Doncaster Sheffield. The move will also indirectly create 250 further jobs in the supply chain, the airline said. Airport in 'strong position' despite Flybe loss Ryanair refused to axe flight 'unless airport shut' How will airlines get flying again? It is to launch nine new routes to resorts such as Alicante, Faro and Tenerife as well as seasonal routes during the summer to Corfu and Palma de Mallorca as well as Lanzarote and Sharm El Sheikh during the winter. Managing Director Owain Jones said: ""This reflects Wizz Air's continued commitment to serving the UK market and generating economic growth, as we create local jobs, stimulate the tourism and hospitality industries and deliver on our promise of providing affordable, direct flights to exciting holiday destinations."" The budget airline said it will increase the annual capacity of Cardiff Airport by over 350,000 seats The crisis in the global aviation industry caused by the coronavirus pandemic has seen job losses across Wales. More than1,400 jobs were cut by Airbus at its factory in Broughton, Flintshire, while400 jobs were at risk at three British Airways plantsin south Wales and370 by aircraft engine producer GEat its Nantgarw plant, near Caerphilly. Spencer Birns, Cardiff Airport's interim chief executive, said the new arrival was ""fantastic news for Wales"". He added: ""We know many people living in Wales are craving a well-deserved holiday after such a challenging year and these new flights will give so many more opportunities for holidays to be planned now that will give us all something to look forward to for next year."" Russell George MS, Welsh Conservative transport spokesman, welcomed the news as a ""shot in the arm"" for the sector. ""State-owned Cardiff Airport is by no means out of the woods yet, but this might be a step on a long road to recovery,"" he said. It's been a turbulent year for Cardiff Airport, losing Flybe in March just as the Covid pandemic struck, making to difficult to find a replacement carrier. Its terminal was closed due to travel restrictions, which cost the Welsh government owned airport Â£2 million a month. Bosses and ministers will hope this new carrier, delivering new routes and 40 new jobs is a sign of better days ahead. Passenger numbers have been largely decimated by the pandemic but Wizz Air UK means a boost of 350,000 seats for travellers a year. How will airlines get flying again?

"The US and China have clashed repeatedly in recent months, over trade, coronavirus and Hong Kong Chinese agents have stepped up their efforts to influence President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration, a US intelligence official has said. William Evanina, from the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said the Chinese were also focusing on people close to Mr Biden's team. Mr Evanina said it was an influence campaign ""on steroids"". Separately, a justice department official said more than 1,000 suspected Chinese agents had fled the US. In Wednesday's virtual discussion at the Aspen Institute think tank, Mr Evanina, chief of the Director of National Intelligence's counter-intelligence branch, said China had been attempting to meddle in the US efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine and recent American elections. He continued: ""We've also seen an uptick, which was planned and we predicted, that China would now re-vector their influence campaigns to the new [Biden] administration. ""And when I say that, that malign foreign influence, that diplomatic influence plus, or on steroids, we're starting to see that play across the country to not only the folks starting in the new administration, but those who are around those folks in the new administration. President Donald Trump accused President Xi Jinping's China of unleashing coronavirus on the United States ""So that's one area we're going to be very keen on making sure the new administration understands that influence, what it looks like, what it tastes like, what it feels like when you see it."" Both Mr Biden and President Donald Trump traded bitter accusations during the recent White House campaign of being influenced by Beijing. Mr Trump focused on business dealings by his rival's son Hunter Biden in China, while the Democratic candidate highlighted Mr Trump's Chinese bank account. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China? During the same think tank discussion on Wednesday, John Demers, chief of the justice department's national security division, said hundreds of Chinese researchers with ties to their country's military had been identified by FBI investigators over the summer. Mr Demers said the inquiry began when US authorities arrested five or six Chinese researchers who had hidden their affiliation with the People's Liberation Army (PLA). âNeither the US nor China wants usâ ""Those five or six arrests were just the tip of the iceberg and honestly the size of the iceberg was one that I don't know that we or other folks realised how large it was,"" he said. He told the discussion that after the FBI conducted dozens of interviews with other individuals, ""more than 1,000 PLA-affiliated Chinese researchers left the country"". Mr Demers said ""only the Chinese have the resources and ability and will"" to conduct such alleged political and economic espionage and ""other malign activity"". He told the discussion these researchers were in addition to a group to 1,000 Chinese students and researchers whose visas were revoked by the US back in September. US revokes visas for 1,000 Chinese students US orders China to close Houston consulate The US state department said back then it would only welcome Chinese students ""who do not further the Chinese Communist Party's goals of military dominance"". In July, the state department also closed China's consulate in Houston, Texas, accusing Beijing of stealing intellectual property. Beijing hit back by accusing the US of racial discrimination, but Mr Demers denied on Wednesday that the American authorities were racially profiling Chinese students.

"The UK becomes first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths, according to official figures Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than UK England's deputy chief medical officer hails Pfizer vaccine approval but says ""we have to take it really carefully"" Education secretary says UK got vaccine first because it is a ""better country"" than France, Belgium and US Moscow announces start of immunisation programme on Saturday, using Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine US has record number of new daily cases - almost 200,000 - as hospitalisations double since early November Facebook to take down false vaccine claims to prevent ""imminent physical harm"" International vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, IBM says Edited by Paul Gribben and Robert Greenall As our live page draws to a close, here is a round-up of the main coronavirus news today.   Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italy responded to a recent surge in cases with a new round of restrictions It was a milestone Italians knew would be a matter of time before they hit: the day when the country would exceed the highest death toll of the first
wave â 969 on 27 March. And now itâs happened. With 993 deaths
recorded in the past 24 hours, Italy has had its deadliest day of the pandemic.
The numbers are hard to fathom. The chink of light is that the infection rate is gradually
decreasing. While cases remain high âabove 23,000 today â the rate of positive
results to number of tests has decreased in the past week from 12.4% to 10.2%.
The curve is flattening. But as in the first wave, it takes time for the death
toll to catch up, since many of todayâs fatalities were infected around the
peak of the second wave in early November. After grim figures, Italians are bracing themselves for a
less-than-happy Christmas with tightened restrictions. Theyâll be banned from
moving between regions, forced to self-isolate if they come into the country
from abroad, ordered to obey night-time curfews around Christmas Day and New
Year and told only to celebrate Christmas lunch with close family. This country
has been devastated by the first and now the second wave. It fears a third.  The US Supreme Court has ordered a lower court to reconsider a challenge to pandemic-related restrictions on religious services in California. The ruling sided with a church that had challenged the policy as unconstitutional religious discrimination, throwing out a lower court  ruling rejecting their case. The Harvest Rock Church and Harvest International Ministry has more than 160 churches in the state, according to AP news agency. California Governor Gavin Newsom has put heavy restrictions on religious services amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Under the current rules, houses of worship in the stateâs worst-hit areas cannot hold indoor gatherings. Elsewhere, there are restrictions on capacity. The ruling on Thursday came after the Supreme Court last week barred New York from enforcing certain limits on attendance at churches and synagogues. Quarantine rules are set to be eased for business travellers in England, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. From 04:00 GMT on Saturday, 5 December, the following people will no longer need to self-isolate when returning to England from a country not in a travel corridor:  For business travellers, their trips must result in a deal which creates or preserves 50 jobs or leads to a Â£100,000 investment or order, according to the Department for Transport. Read more on this story here Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were joined at Soho Theatre by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have been visiting entertainment venues in Soho, London, today to find out how the arts and entertainment sector has been coping during the pandemic. The couple were treated to an intimate performance at Soho Theatre - of the one-woman play Half Breed by Natasha Marshall. The actress revealed she had to dash from her Morrisons supermarket job to do the gig in front of the royals and was still wearing her uniform. She told the prince and his wife: ""I've got to go back later so it was easier to keep it on, I'll be in such a rush. ""The theatre has supported me so much I jumped at the chance to perform today."" Charles replied: ""That's marvellous, such dedication. I really enjoyed the performance and I am praying all of you can open soon."" Many entertainment venues are battling to stay in business because of the restrictions Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics So far, wave two has been lower
and slower than wave one. About 80% of deaths involving
coronavirus happened before August, and most of those happened in just one
month. Almost 10,000 coronavirus
deaths a week were registered in consecutive weeks in April. In this second wave, it looks
like the peak figures â assuming infections keep falling before widespread
vaccination takes place â might be closer to 3,000 than 4,000. And, as in wave one, those over
75 account for about 75% of the deaths, suggesting that vaccinating over-75s
could stem the vast majority of future deaths. This time around, the spread
of deaths around the country has looked quite different. In the spring and summer,
London and the North West of England each accounted for about 15% of
coronavirus deaths in the UK. But in this wave, Londonâs
share is down, closer to 5% whereas the North West is just under 25%. As the UK becomes the first European country to record a death toll of over 60,000, the daily reported deaths remain high at an average of 441 over the last 7 days. But confirmed cases show a marked fall following England's nationwide lockdown and stricter measures elsewhere in the UK. It also seems to have had an impact on daily hospital admissions, which have fallen to an average of 1,395 a day in the seven days up to 26 November, from a high of 1765 a day on 11 November. Dr Anthony Fauci was challenged over the vaccine's earlier availability in the UK UK ministers have been making their quick approval of the Pfizer vaccine a point of national pride, with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson facing criticism for claiming the speed was due to the UK being a ""much better country"" than European rivals. But the top US infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, hasaccused the UK of being less rigorous in its approval process. ""The UK did not do it as carefully,"" he told Fox News. ""If you go quickly and you do it superficially, people are not going to want to get vaccinated."" Fauci was facing criticism that the US was behind the UK in receiving the vaccine, but said there was only a difference of ""a couple of days"" and promised that US approval would come ""very soon"". He did not detail any specific issues with the UK approvals process. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, responsible for approving the vaccine, said it had accelerated the process by conducting a rolling review of Pfizer's data, starting at the beginning of October. ""We have rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review,â the agency said. Portugal's health minister has said that the country's citizens will receive Covid-19 vaccines for free via the public health service. Marta Temido
said 22 million doses would be bought for â¬200m. Vaccinations will start in January and nearly a million people will be given shots in the first phase. The country has six agreements for vaccines, including with AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, according to drugs regulator Infarmed. Earlier officials said the country had passed the peak of the ""second wave"" of the virus, which occurred between 12 and 15 November. Restrictions introduced last month include mandatory remote working and
a nightly curfew for the vast majority of the population, and a weekend
curfew in areas deemed to be at very high or extremely high risk, including
Lisbon and Porto. Portugal has had a total of 303,846 confirmed coronavirus cases since the
start of the epidemic and 4,645 deaths associated with Covid-19. The UK government's coronavirus figures suggest that for three months the average number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test was fewer than 50 deaths per day. But, as we have reported, on Monday the number of people who have died has increased to a total of 60,113 - up 414 in the past 24 hours. There have been a further 14,879 cases, as daily cases continue on a downward trend. As the latest government figures have confirmed, more than 60,000 people in
the UK have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. According to data from John Hopkins University,external, only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK. The UK government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest therehave been more than 69,000 deaths by this measure,external. The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland - which measure excess deaths - show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. The UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths,according to the latest government figures,external. A total of 60,113 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 414 in the past 24 hours. Two other ways of measuring deaths - where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate, and the number of ""excess deaths"" for this time of year - give higher total figures. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK,according to data from Johns Hopkins University,external. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics In
the week to 29 November, 87% of the nearly 90,000 beds in English hospitals
were occupied. This
is largely unchanged since the first week of November, when NHS England first
published these figures. The
NHS is meant to keep at least a 10th of its beds free to create flexibility to
admit patients and cope with surges in demand. But
a single number doesnât tell the full story. It
doesnât include the Nightingale hospitals that provide extra capacity, or the
beds that have been freed by cancelling operations. Or
that the pressures arenât evenly spread. Some
hospitals like North Middlesex, Southport & Ormskirk, Surrey &
Sussex, and Wrightington, Wigan & Leigh have more than 95% of beds taken. More
hospitals have seen capacity free up this month than have seen it tighten. But
as we move into the months that, in any year, put the most stress on capacity
within the NHS, all eyes will be on these figures. BBC World News This video can not be played Coronavirus: Normality is 'years away' despite vaccines A complete return to normal life after the coronavirus pandemic is years away, Prof Dale Fisher, chairman of the World Health Organisation's global outbreak and response network has said. He told BBC World News: ""I think over the next year or two things will loosen up quite a lot. I think we will eventually get back to normal but will that take three years or 10 years, I don't know."" He said there were a number of challenges ahead with the distribution of vaccines, including encouraging people to have them and not get complacent about the risks from the virus as time went on. Prof Fisher was speaking to Lucy Hocking. Care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the Covid vaccine from 14 December, the Scottish health secretary has confirmed. There had been concerns about getting doses to care homes because of issues with transporting small doses. But Jeanne Freeman said some of those issues had been addressed, making it possible to take the vaccine to homes. The first batches of the vaccine, which arrive in Scotland on Tuesday, will be given to health staff. Read morehere. Nick BeakeBrussels Correspondent, BBC News An exasperated sigh sums up
the reaction from a number of European
capitals to the vaccine victory
proclamations of some British government ministers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonâs sweeping
assessment that the UK is a âbetterâ country than many of its allies was seen
as particularly bold. One senior diplomat told me
he was delighted Britons would soon be receiving the vaccine, but that âsomeone
should remind Mr Williamson that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was created by a
German company, founded by scientists of Turkish origin, in partnership with
an American distributor, and is being manufactured in Belgium before being
transported across France to reach the UKâ. The claim that Brexit allowed the UK to approve the vaccine faster than other Europe countries has been disproved, but it does reflect once again a different path the UK is taking. All EU countries have the option to follow the UK example and let their domestic
drug regulator issue emergency approval, but the bloc says it wants to wait for
the European Medicines Agency to give the green light on all their behalf. But if the
Europe-wide delivery of a vaccine which promises to end the coronavirus misery
for millions is pushed back, there will likely be more voices asking: âWhy canât
we have what the Brits have already got?â.  We have more on the latest figures in the US where there have been a record number of cases. As we mentioned earlier, new cases rose by a record 195,695 on Wednesday. These graphs show the extent of the problem faced by health services there.  The number of people in hospital passed 100,000 for the first time, a figure that has doubled since early November, Covid Tracking Project data showed.  And deaths have risen quickly in recent weeks too - the daily death toll of 2,733 was close to a new high.  Nationwide, infections are now closing in on 14 million, with more than 264,000 deaths, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. Asda has become the latest supermarket to return business rates relief it has received from the UK government during the pandemic, announcing it will repay Â£340m. It follows similar moves by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi and means the grocers will collectively return more than Â£1.7bn. Supermarkets had been allowed to stay open during the lockdown while non-essential shops had to close. Asda said its costs in dealing with Covid had outweighed any state support. But its president and chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: ""As the hope of a vaccine and a more 'normal' life returning in 2021 grows, we have confidence that we are in a strong position to again do the right thing for the communities we serve.""

"Asda has announced it will repay Â£340m of business rates relief it has received during the pandemic. It follows similar moves by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi and means the grocers will collectively return more than Â£1.7bn. Supermarkets, whose sales have boomed in the crisis, have been criticised for taking government help while paying dividends to shareholders. Asda said its costs of dealing with Covid had outweighed any state support. But its president and chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: ""As the hope of a vaccine and a more 'normal' life returning in 2021 grows, we have confidence that we are in a strong position to again do the right thing for the communities we serve."" Earlier on Thursday, Sainsbury's said it would hand back Â£440m of rates relief it had received, followed by Aldi which pledged to repay Â£100m. It was followed by discount retailer B&M, which said it would forgo Â£80m of rates relief. B&M stores sell some food, alongside homewares, toys and electrical goods. On Wednesday, Tesco and Morrisons promised to repay Â£850m between them. Both Sainsbury's and Aldi said the decision reflected the fact they had been allowed to stay open in lockdown while non-essential shops had to close. Labour said big supermarkets had ""done the decent thing"" but urged the government to pass on the Â£1.7bn handed back already to hard-hit businesses such as pubs and restaurants operating under the new tier system. The Treasury said any funds returned would ""support the ongoing efforts to protect people's jobs and incomes"". Asda has recently been bought by the UK-based billionaire Issa brothers and private equity firm TDR Capital from Walmart of the US in a deal valuing the supermarket chain at Â£6.8bn. Mr Burnley said: ""Almost half our customers are telling us they expect their financial position to worsen in the next 12 months and we recognise that there are other industries and businesses for whom the effects of Covid-19 will be much more long lasting and whose survival is essential to thousands of jobs."" He said Asda would discuss with the government and devolved authorities the best way to return the money ""to ensure the relief we have received can go towards helping those that need it most"". Supermarkets repay rates relief after backlash Sainsbury's to cut 3,500 jobs and shut Argos shops Sainsbury's said that its sales had been ""stronger than originally expected"", despite it facing ""significant costs"" in the crisis. ""With regional restrictions likely to remain in place for some time, we believe it is now fair and right to forgo the business rates relief that we have been given on all Sainsbury's stores,"" boss Simon Roberts said. ""We are very mindful that non-essential retailers and many other businesses have been forced to close again in the second lockdown and we hope that this goes some way towards helping them."" Giles Hurley, boss of Aldi UK, said returning the full value of its business rates was ""the right decision to help support the nation"". In March, all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England were given a business rates holiday for 12 months to help them get through the crisis. But MPs have criticised supermarkets for taking around Â£1.9bn in help while paying dividends to shareholders, calling it an ""absolute scandal"". The UK's supermarkets have seen a sales boom during the pandemic, albeit with higher costs. The big four grocers - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - are also receiving an estimated Â£1 in every Â£6 of all the business rates relief offered by the government. They have come under political fire amid concerns that this help from the taxpayer could've been given to other parts of the retail or hospitality sectors that are still in survival mode - especially since some of the supermarket groups have also been paying dividends to shareholders. Tesco went first and that piled the pressure on its main rivals to immediately follow suit. It says it is simply doing the right thing but some suspect Tesco's move will also help smooth the way for a bumper Â£5bn special dividend pay-out following the sale of its Asian business. And for all of them, there may have been fears about being hit by a possible government windfall tax in the future. Earlier this month, Mr Roberts defended Sainsbury's decision to pay out Â£230m to investors at a time when the chain is also cutting 3,500 jobs and vowing to close 420 Argos stores as part of a restructuring plan. The company pointed out it had taken no money from the government's furlough wage support scheme. However, it will hang on to a further Â£40m of business rates relief for its Argos stores, which as non-essential shops had to close in the lockdowns. Tesco announced on Wednesday it would repay rates relief On Wednesday, Tesco said it would repay Â£585m after it had been criticised over investor payouts. Morrisons also announced it had ""brought forward"" a decision on rates relief and would pay back Â£274m. Kathleen Brooks, of financial analysts Minerva, told the BBC that supermarkets had faced ""a lot of political and media pressure to follow suit"". Some would also see it as a way to avoid having to ""answer to government"", as banks had to after being bailed out in the 2008 financial crisis. However, other grocers have said they will not repay the rates relief. Marks and Spencer, which reported a half year loss and has cancelled its dividend for 2020, said the government support had been ""much-needed"" during ""incredibly challenging circumstances"". While the retailer sells food, most of its clothing and homeware store space has had to close during the lockdowns. On Wednesday, the Co-op said the amount it had spent on protecting staff and customers outweighed the savings from rates relief. But the retailer added it would consider its position on government support again at the end of the year. Waitrose-owner the John Lewis Partnership said the relief would help offset the ""significant"" sales lost while its John Lewis shops were closed, as well as money spent on staying secure from Covid. ""The outlook remains incredibly uncertain and government support remains crucial to help us navigate the crisis,"" it said.

Patterson, who created the original format for the popular Royal Rumble event, ""left an indelible mark"" on wrestling, the WWE said in a statement. Wrestling stars including Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and John Cena have paid tribute to a man who ""helped so many"". The cause of Patterson's death has not yet been disclosed. His career in the industry, not just in the ring but as a commentator and a trainer for younger potential stars behind the scenes, spanned six decades. ""Patterson was synonymous with making history,"" the WWE said on its official website on Wednesday. ""His name will forever be revered in WWE lore.""

RIP my friend,"" he tweeted. Patterson began his career in Canada in 1958. In his 2016 autobiography Accepted, Patterson wrote about how he was thrown out of his house in Montreal at the age of 17 after telling his parents he was in love with another man. He moved to the San Francisco Bay area, where he worked for nearly two decades. He then joined the WWE, and was said by the company to have made an ""immediate impact"", becoming the first Intercontinental Champion in September 1979. His most memorable rivalry - and a highlight of his wrestling career - was his ongoing battle with Sgt Slaughter, the WWE said. Around the time he hung up his boots in 1984, he began commentating for the industry and in 1988 he created the Royal Rumble Match, described by the WWE as ""one of the ring's most ground-breaking ideas"".

"The UK becomes first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths, according to official figures Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than UK England's deputy chief medical officer hails Pfizer vaccine approval but says ""we have to take it really carefully"" Education secretary says UK got vaccine first because it is a ""better country"" than France, Belgium and US Moscow announces start of immunisation programme on Saturday, using Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine US has record number of new daily cases - almost 200,000 - as hospitalisations double since early November Facebook to take down false vaccine claims to prevent ""imminent physical harm"" International vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, IBM says Edited by Paul Gribben and Robert Greenall As our live page draws to a close, here is a round-up of the main coronavirus news today.   Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italy responded to a recent surge in cases with a new round of restrictions It was a milestone Italians knew would be a matter of time before they hit: the day when the country would exceed the highest death toll of the first
wave â 969 on 27 March. And now itâs happened. With 993 deaths
recorded in the past 24 hours, Italy has had its deadliest day of the pandemic.
The numbers are hard to fathom. The chink of light is that the infection rate is gradually
decreasing. While cases remain high âabove 23,000 today â the rate of positive
results to number of tests has decreased in the past week from 12.4% to 10.2%.
The curve is flattening. But as in the first wave, it takes time for the death
toll to catch up, since many of todayâs fatalities were infected around the
peak of the second wave in early November. After grim figures, Italians are bracing themselves for a
less-than-happy Christmas with tightened restrictions. Theyâll be banned from
moving between regions, forced to self-isolate if they come into the country
from abroad, ordered to obey night-time curfews around Christmas Day and New
Year and told only to celebrate Christmas lunch with close family. This country
has been devastated by the first and now the second wave. It fears a third.  The US Supreme Court has ordered a lower court to reconsider a challenge to pandemic-related restrictions on religious services in California. The ruling sided with a church that had challenged the policy as unconstitutional religious discrimination, throwing out a lower court  ruling rejecting their case. The Harvest Rock Church and Harvest International Ministry has more than 160 churches in the state, according to AP news agency. California Governor Gavin Newsom has put heavy restrictions on religious services amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Under the current rules, houses of worship in the stateâs worst-hit areas cannot hold indoor gatherings. Elsewhere, there are restrictions on capacity. The ruling on Thursday came after the Supreme Court last week barred New York from enforcing certain limits on attendance at churches and synagogues. Quarantine rules are set to be eased for business travellers in England, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. From 04:00 GMT on Saturday, 5 December, the following people will no longer need to self-isolate when returning to England from a country not in a travel corridor:  For business travellers, their trips must result in a deal which creates or preserves 50 jobs or leads to a Â£100,000 investment or order, according to the Department for Transport. Read more on this story here Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were joined at Soho Theatre by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have been visiting entertainment venues in Soho, London, today to find out how the arts and entertainment sector has been coping during the pandemic. The couple were treated to an intimate performance at Soho Theatre - of the one-woman play Half Breed by Natasha Marshall. The actress revealed she had to dash from her Morrisons supermarket job to do the gig in front of the royals and was still wearing her uniform. She told the prince and his wife: ""I've got to go back later so it was easier to keep it on, I'll be in such a rush. ""The theatre has supported me so much I jumped at the chance to perform today."" Charles replied: ""That's marvellous, such dedication. I really enjoyed the performance and I am praying all of you can open soon."" Many entertainment venues are battling to stay in business because of the restrictions Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics So far, wave two has been lower
and slower than wave one. About 80% of deaths involving
coronavirus happened before August, and most of those happened in just one
month. Almost 10,000 coronavirus
deaths a week were registered in consecutive weeks in April. In this second wave, it looks
like the peak figures â assuming infections keep falling before widespread
vaccination takes place â might be closer to 3,000 than 4,000. And, as in wave one, those over
75 account for about 75% of the deaths, suggesting that vaccinating over-75s
could stem the vast majority of future deaths. This time around, the spread
of deaths around the country has looked quite different. In the spring and summer,
London and the North West of England each accounted for about 15% of
coronavirus deaths in the UK. But in this wave, Londonâs
share is down, closer to 5% whereas the North West is just under 25%. As the UK becomes the first European country to record a death toll of over 60,000, the daily reported deaths remain high at an average of 441 over the last 7 days. But confirmed cases show a marked fall following England's nationwide lockdown and stricter measures elsewhere in the UK. It also seems to have had an impact on daily hospital admissions, which have fallen to an average of 1,395 a day in the seven days up to 26 November, from a high of 1765 a day on 11 November. Dr Anthony Fauci was challenged over the vaccine's earlier availability in the UK UK ministers have been making their quick approval of the Pfizer vaccine a point of national pride, with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson facing criticism for claiming the speed was due to the UK being a ""much better country"" than European rivals. But the top US infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, hasaccused the UK of being less rigorous in its approval process. ""The UK did not do it as carefully,"" he told Fox News. ""If you go quickly and you do it superficially, people are not going to want to get vaccinated."" Fauci was facing criticism that the US was behind the UK in receiving the vaccine, but said there was only a difference of ""a couple of days"" and promised that US approval would come ""very soon"". He did not detail any specific issues with the UK approvals process. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, responsible for approving the vaccine, said it had accelerated the process by conducting a rolling review of Pfizer's data, starting at the beginning of October. ""We have rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review,â the agency said. Portugal's health minister has said that the country's citizens will receive Covid-19 vaccines for free via the public health service. Marta Temido
said 22 million doses would be bought for â¬200m. Vaccinations will start in January and nearly a million people will be given shots in the first phase. The country has six agreements for vaccines, including with AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, according to drugs regulator Infarmed. Earlier officials said the country had passed the peak of the ""second wave"" of the virus, which occurred between 12 and 15 November. Restrictions introduced last month include mandatory remote working and
a nightly curfew for the vast majority of the population, and a weekend
curfew in areas deemed to be at very high or extremely high risk, including
Lisbon and Porto. Portugal has had a total of 303,846 confirmed coronavirus cases since the
start of the epidemic and 4,645 deaths associated with Covid-19. The UK government's coronavirus figures suggest that for three months the average number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test was fewer than 50 deaths per day. But, as we have reported, on Monday the number of people who have died has increased to a total of 60,113 - up 414 in the past 24 hours. There have been a further 14,879 cases, as daily cases continue on a downward trend. As the latest government figures have confirmed, more than 60,000 people in
the UK have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. According to data from John Hopkins University,external, only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK. The UK government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest therehave been more than 69,000 deaths by this measure,external. The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland - which measure excess deaths - show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. The UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths,according to the latest government figures,external. A total of 60,113 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 414 in the past 24 hours. Two other ways of measuring deaths - where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate, and the number of ""excess deaths"" for this time of year - give higher total figures. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK,according to data from Johns Hopkins University,external. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics In
the week to 29 November, 87% of the nearly 90,000 beds in English hospitals
were occupied. This
is largely unchanged since the first week of November, when NHS England first
published these figures. The
NHS is meant to keep at least a 10th of its beds free to create flexibility to
admit patients and cope with surges in demand. But
a single number doesnât tell the full story. It
doesnât include the Nightingale hospitals that provide extra capacity, or the
beds that have been freed by cancelling operations. Or
that the pressures arenât evenly spread. Some
hospitals like North Middlesex, Southport & Ormskirk, Surrey &
Sussex, and Wrightington, Wigan & Leigh have more than 95% of beds taken. More
hospitals have seen capacity free up this month than have seen it tighten. But
as we move into the months that, in any year, put the most stress on capacity
within the NHS, all eyes will be on these figures. BBC World News This video can not be played Coronavirus: Normality is 'years away' despite vaccines A complete return to normal life after the coronavirus pandemic is years away, Prof Dale Fisher, chairman of the World Health Organisation's global outbreak and response network has said. He told BBC World News: ""I think over the next year or two things will loosen up quite a lot. I think we will eventually get back to normal but will that take three years or 10 years, I don't know."" He said there were a number of challenges ahead with the distribution of vaccines, including encouraging people to have them and not get complacent about the risks from the virus as time went on. Prof Fisher was speaking to Lucy Hocking. Care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the Covid vaccine from 14 December, the Scottish health secretary has confirmed. There had been concerns about getting doses to care homes because of issues with transporting small doses. But Jeanne Freeman said some of those issues had been addressed, making it possible to take the vaccine to homes. The first batches of the vaccine, which arrive in Scotland on Tuesday, will be given to health staff. Read morehere. Nick BeakeBrussels Correspondent, BBC News An exasperated sigh sums up
the reaction from a number of European
capitals to the vaccine victory
proclamations of some British government ministers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonâs sweeping
assessment that the UK is a âbetterâ country than many of its allies was seen
as particularly bold. One senior diplomat told me
he was delighted Britons would soon be receiving the vaccine, but that âsomeone
should remind Mr Williamson that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was created by a
German company, founded by scientists of Turkish origin, in partnership with
an American distributor, and is being manufactured in Belgium before being
transported across France to reach the UKâ. The claim that Brexit allowed the UK to approve the vaccine faster than other Europe countries has been disproved, but it does reflect once again a different path the UK is taking. All EU countries have the option to follow the UK example and let their domestic
drug regulator issue emergency approval, but the bloc says it wants to wait for
the European Medicines Agency to give the green light on all their behalf. But if the
Europe-wide delivery of a vaccine which promises to end the coronavirus misery
for millions is pushed back, there will likely be more voices asking: âWhy canât
we have what the Brits have already got?â.  We have more on the latest figures in the US where there have been a record number of cases. As we mentioned earlier, new cases rose by a record 195,695 on Wednesday. These graphs show the extent of the problem faced by health services there.  The number of people in hospital passed 100,000 for the first time, a figure that has doubled since early November, Covid Tracking Project data showed.  And deaths have risen quickly in recent weeks too - the daily death toll of 2,733 was close to a new high.  Nationwide, infections are now closing in on 14 million, with more than 264,000 deaths, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. Asda has become the latest supermarket to return business rates relief it has received from the UK government during the pandemic, announcing it will repay Â£340m. It follows similar moves by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi and means the grocers will collectively return more than Â£1.7bn. Supermarkets had been allowed to stay open during the lockdown while non-essential shops had to close. Asda said its costs in dealing with Covid had outweighed any state support. But its president and chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: ""As the hope of a vaccine and a more 'normal' life returning in 2021 grows, we have confidence that we are in a strong position to again do the right thing for the communities we serve."" Earlier, England's deputy chief medical officer answered questions from members of the public about Covid-19, including on vaccine safety and effectiveness, in a live BBC News special. Here are some of the highlights, from giving vaccine advice to his mum,  rolling out another football analogy and Father Christmas' position on the vaccine priority list.

"Hospitality outlets will be forced to close from 00:01 on Friday Pubs, bars and restaurants in Jersey are set to close from 00:01 GMT on Friday for up to a month in order to tackle a surge in Covid cases. The ""hospitality circuit breaker"" announced on Wednesday comes amid fears health services could be overwhelmed. Food and hospitality outlets, except takeaways, will have to shut. All shops can stay open, but indoor sport and fitness classes and gyms must close and the 2m (6.6ft) distancing law is to be brought back into force. Chief Minister John Le Fondre said the recent rise in cases on the island presented ""a real and immediate risk to health services... and islanders' lives"". The circuit-breaker measures are expected to remain in place until 4 January. One pub owner said measures should have been introduced sooner to try to save jobs and Christmas trade for the hospitality industry. There are currently 331 active cases on Jersey with the majority - 231 - symptomatic and eight cases being treated in hospital. On Wednesday, 56 new Covid cases were identified, the biggest daily total of new infections recorded so far. Senator Le Fondre said Jersey's R number was currently between 1.4 and 1.9, which ""means each case is, on average, passing the infection on to more than one other person"". ""This is too much and we need to introduce more stringent restrictions to protect islanders."" EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Jersey ""now stands at an important crossroads in our pandemic response"", Senator Le Fondre said, adding: ""I know that collectively these measures represent a significant restriction...particularly at this time of year, when we want to be celebrating and spending time with loved ones and friends. ""But we need to prevent our health services from being overwhelmed, and ensure we are still able to celebrate during the festive period."" Support for affected businesses would be provided under the co-funded payroll scheme, according to the chief minister. Sean Murphy, who runs the Lamplighter Pub in St Helier, said the move should have come ""a lot earlier to try save Christmas"". He said having to close over Christmas and the new year would cost people their jobs and the industry thousands of pounds. ""Everybody in hospitality understands the reasoning of it because of Covid, but it's the timing of the closure,"" Mr Murphy said. Analysis:Freddie Miller, Political Reporter, BBC News When Jersey's politicians agreed in July to reopen the borders, there were no known active cases of the virus. And while the numbers increased in the following months, many felt the situation was under control - largely thanks to a system of rapid border testing. But within days, the mood has changed significantly. The number of cases has more than doubled since 25 November, with a series of parties and social events blamed. Amid growing concerns about the ability of the health service to cope, these restrictions were announced just 48 hours after a previous tightening of the rules, and the day after masks were made mandatory in shops and supermarkets. The government insists it has acted decisively. But many have criticised ministers' reaction, with one prominent backbencher arguing they have ""dithered since late October"". And while some will see the closure of hospitality as an over-reaction, with Christmas just three weeks away, others believe it is too little, too late. Rules on households mixing over Christmas will be announced in the next few days. Health Minister Deputy Richard Renouf warned the island would need to open its Nightingale hospital if cases continued to rise. Jersey's General Hospitalclosed to all visitors at 17:00 on Wednesday, while high-risk islanders havebeen told to adopt ""extra measures"", including avoiding visits to other people's homes. Deputy Renouf also said officials were in ""close discussions"" with the UK following itsapproval of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine.

"The US-China relationship is now at one of it lowest points in years Stranded abroad by the coronavirus pandemic and squeezed by political tensions, Chinese students in the United States are rethinking their attitudes to their host and home countries. Eight years ago, Shizheng Tie, then aged 13, moved alone from China to rural Ohio for one sole purpose: education. She once had a budding American dream, but now she says she is facing hostility in that country. ""As a Chinese living in the US, I am very scared now,"" she says. Tie, now a senior student at Johns Hopkins University, describes America as ""anti-China"" and ""chaotic"". Some 360,000 Chinese students are currently enrolled in schools in the US. In the past months, they have experienced two historical events - a global pandemic and unprecedented tensions between the US and China, which have reshaped their views of the two nations. The majority of Chinese students in the US are self-funded and hope their western education will lead to a good career. Meanwhile, Washington has warned that not all students from China are ""normal"", claiming some are Beijing's proxies who conduct economic espionage, orchestrate pro-China views and monitor other Chinese students on American campuses. The Trump administration recently cancelled visas for 3,000 students they believe have ties to the Chinese military. One US senator even suggested that Chinese nationals should be banned from studying math and science in America. Amid the harsh rhetoric, many Chinese students fear that they are being turned into a political target for Washington. In July, the US ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, Texas Tie, majoring in environmental science, says she is pessimistic about her academic future in the US, given the growing scrutiny over Chinese students and scholars in science and technology. ""I used to think I'd pursue my PhD in the US and perhaps settle down here, but now I see myself returning to China after obtaining a master's degree,"" Tie says. Yingyi Ma, associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University, says Chinese students in the US are now ""politicised and marginalised at an unprecedented level"", as Washington is sending ""very unfriendly signals"". 'I'm Asian, so I can never be American' Why US-China relations have reached a low Why a dog photo may be a coded insult at China The strained bilateral relations have swayed public opinion, as a recent survey found that 73% of American adults have an unfavourable view of China - an historic high. Prof Ma published a book called Ambitious and Anxious this January, focusing on Chinese students' experience in America. ""If I write the book now, I will only keep 'anxious' in the title,"" she says. As the coronavirus continues to spread in the US, Tie prefers to return to China, where the outbreak appears to be largely under control. But the country has ordered sharp cuts in international flights to prevent imported cases, leaving many Chinese students overseas, stranded thousands of miles away from their families. On Chinese social media, some comments portrayed these students as spoiled brats, who had fled from the country's fiercely competitive education system and now may imperil its success in containing the virus. ""America wants to kick us out, while China doesn't allow us to return,"" Tie says. China takes a victory lap over US protests US-China contagion: The battle behind the scenes This sentiment is commonly shared among Chinese students in the US. Iris Li, a 20-year-old junior student from China at Emory University in Atlanta, describes the students as ""being kicked like a ball"" between the two countries. ""We are getting the short end of the stick from both sides,"" Li says. After worrying about the outbreak in their home country from afar, these young Chinese are now witnessing the coronavirus crisis in the US. They were perplexed by the cultural differences regarding mask-wearing. They were unsettled by President Trump's use of the phrases ""kung flu"" and ""China virus"". Some have even experienced racial harassment firsthand. This video can not be played Tracy Win Liu says she bought a gun after being faced with coronavirus-related racism Racial discrimination during the pandemic has ""burst their bubble,"" Prof Ma says. A new paper stated that anti-Chinese racism boosts support for Beijing's authoritarian rule among Chinese students in the US. Jennifer Pan, co-author of the paper and assistant professor of Communications at Stanford University, says there is a general belief that Chinese students overseas are indoctrinated to wholeheartedly support the Chinese Communist Party. ""That's not the case,"" Prof Pan says, ""What does change their political views is racism."" The research found that college freshmen from China who read derogatory comments against Chinese people are more likely to support Beijing, while general criticism against the government's coronavirus handling did not produce the same effects. Prof Pan says the findings suggest that Chinese students in the US, whose survey responses are ""mature, sophisticated and thoughtful for their age"", can rationally process criticism against China. Despite her frustration over China's travel restrictions, Tie says she has become more patriotic since living aboard. ""I had believed America to be a wonderland of dreams, equality and tolerance for all. I certainly don't believe it anymore,"" she wrote in her school newspaper in June, criticising America's ""Sinophobia"". In February, she penned an online petition, protesting against her university hosting a panel with Hong Kong democracy activists. But Tie says she's not a ""little pink"", a somewhat disparaging term for nationalistic Chinese youth active on the internet. ""I am patriotic in a rational way, not as a result of brainwashing,"" Tie says, adding that she views both Washington and Beijing critically, citing the lack of freedom of speech in China. ""Both countries let me down many times,"" Tie says, ""but China is my motherland, so I am more willing to endure that frustration."" Similar to Tie, Li plans to return to China after her study, with transformed understandings of her home and host countries. Foreign students in US 'scared for the future' Covid fears putting off Chinese students from UK In early July, Washington announced a policy barring foreign students from staying in the country, but the decision was rescinded after receiving waves of criticism. ""It made me feel hopeful about the US,"" Li says, ""This would not happen in China."" The sociology and religious studies student thinks the pandemic has laid bare the advantages and weaknesses of both political systems. While the Chinese government seems to act more effectively, the US allows dissent, and at times, it is able to correct its own mistakes. American education has made her ""more anti-China,"" Li says with a laugh. Harvard and MIT sued over the reversed decision to strip international students of visas if all their courses were online She recalls feeling ""very uncomfortable"" when she first arrived in America six years ago and saw her fellow students waving Taiwanese flags, which are seen in mainland China as a symbol for Taiwan independence. But after getting to know the Taiwanese students, she realised that though their views may have been completely different, they could discuss issues respectfully, which is encouraged in American classrooms. ""Studying in the US is an important experience in my life,"" one that she says she'd never regret. ""But I am eager to help change China, where my work may be more meaningful.""

"Jimmy Lai had earlier this year been detained under the new national security law Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy supporter Jimmy Lai has been charged with fraud and detained until a court hearing in April next year. On Thursday a court denied him bail over a charge relating to the illegal use of his company's premises. It comes a day after three prominent pro-democracy activists were jailed. The cases have raised fears of a renewed crackdown on the city's activists and media figures, spurred by a controversial new security law. Mr Lai was arrested under the National Security Law earlier this year and later released on bail. China has said the new law will return stability to the territory after a year of unrest, but critics say it has silenced dissent. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice The Hong Kong paper that pushed the boundary In another development, former Hong Kong pro-democracy legislator Ted Hui has announced during a trip to Denmark that he is going into exile. Mr Lai, 73, was arrested on Wednesday night along with two other senior executives from media company Next Digital. Mr Lai is the founder of Next Digital which publishes Apple Daily, a well-read tabloid which is frequently critical of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese leadership. On Thursday, the three men appeared in court to face charges relating to the alleged illegal use of their company's headquarters for purposes not permitted by its lease. The charges stated that they had sublet a section of the premises. The landlord is a corporation established by the government to run the city's industrial parks. Mr Lai was brought into court on Thursday morning The fraud charge is not being heard under the National Security Law but, according to an Apple Daily report, the judge presiding over the case had been hand-picked by the city's leader, Carrie Lam, to handle national security cases. A police statement on the arrests did not name those detained but pointed out that one of them - Jimmy Lai - was still under investigation for violating the National Security Law. While the two senior executives were granted bail, Mr Lai was denied because he was deemed an ""absconding risk"", according to local reports. One of the city's most prominent supporters of the pro-democracy movement, Mr Lai is estimated to be worth more than $1bn (Â£766m).  Having made his initial fortune in the clothing industry, he later ventured into media and founded Next Digital. In a local media landscape increasingly fearful of Beijing, Mr Lai is a persistent thorn for China - both through his publications and writing that openly criticises the Chinese leadership. This video can not be played Jimmy Lai told the BBC he would not give in to intimidation It has seen him become a hero for many residents in Hong Kong. But on the mainland he is viewed as a ""traitor"" who threatens Chinese national security. Earlier this year, he was accused of ""colluding with foreign forces"" under the National Security Law. He was arrested in August, becoming the most high-profile person in Hong Kong to be detained under the law, and his newspaper offices were raided by hundreds of police officers. He was later released on bail. Interviewed by the BBC before the latest arrest, he said he would not give in to intimidation. ""If they can induce fear in you, that's the cheapest way to control you and the most effective way and they know it. ""The only way to defeat the way of intimidation is to face up to fear and don't let it frighten you."" The former Hong Kong pro-democracy legislator said in a statement: ""I hereby announce that I will go into exile and will withdraw my membership of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong to leave Hong Kong. ""There is no word to explain my pain and it's hard to hold back tears."" Mr Hui faces charges linked to pro-democracy protests, but had been given bail. By Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, in Hong Kong Jimmy Lai's detention comes hot on the heels of the jailing of three young activists for inciting unauthorised assembly. A dozen pro-Beijing pensioners popped champagne corks outside court to celebrate their sentencing, while holding a banner calling for even harsher jail terms. One of the activists, Agnes Chow, is being investigated along with Jimmy Lai for allegedly colluding with foreign forces in order to threaten China's national security. If found guilty, they could remain in jail until they die. A few political pundits have been saying that Beijing will only get tougher on Hong Kong. Following earlier sanctions by the US on some government officials, Beijing retaliated, sanctioning four Americans this week. But some supporters of the pro-democracy camp have been wondering if a change of guard in Washington will make it even harder to make their voices heard. But Jimmy Lai's Next Digital group expects business as usual. Its shares will resume trading on Friday, copies of Apple Daily will still hit the news stands, and their new online daily news broadcast will still go on air, with his daughter-in-law fronting the bulletins. On Wednesday, activists Joshua Wong, Ivan Lam and Agnes Chow were jailed for their involvement in mass protests last year. HK's Joshua Wong and democracy activists jailed The young activists - who are among the city's most prominent - had been convicted of unauthorised assembly. Agnes Chow, Ivan Lam and Joshua Wong are prominent democracy activists Rights group Amnesty International condemned the ruling, saying it was a way for authorities to ""send a warning to anyone who dares to openly criticise the government that they could be next"". A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 but under the so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle. It was supposed to guarantee certain freedoms for the territory - including freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - which mainland China does not have. But the National Security Law has reduced Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. The legislation introduced new crimes, including penalties of up to life in prison. Anyone found to have conspired with foreigners to provoke ""hatred"" of the Chinese government or the Hong Kong authorities may have committed a crime. This video can not be played Hong Kong security law: The BBC's Stephen McDonell explains what it means, and what people there think Trials can be held in secret and without a jury, and cases can be taken over by the mainland authorities. Mainland security personnel can legally operate in Hong Kong with impunity. After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety. The Chinese government defends the law, saying it will help return stability to the territory, which has been shaken by pro-democracy protests, and bring it more into line with the Chinese mainland.

"The UK becomes first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths, according to official figures Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than UK England's deputy chief medical officer hails Pfizer vaccine approval but says ""we have to take it really carefully"" Education secretary says UK got vaccine first because it is a ""better country"" than France, Belgium and US Moscow announces start of immunisation programme on Saturday, using Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine US has record number of new daily cases - almost 200,000 - as hospitalisations double since early November Facebook to take down false vaccine claims to prevent ""imminent physical harm"" International vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, IBM says Edited by Paul Gribben and Robert Greenall As our live page draws to a close, here is a round-up of the main coronavirus news today.   Mark LowenBBC News, Rome Italy responded to a recent surge in cases with a new round of restrictions It was a milestone Italians knew would be a matter of time before they hit: the day when the country would exceed the highest death toll of the first
wave â 969 on 27 March. And now itâs happened. With 993 deaths
recorded in the past 24 hours, Italy has had its deadliest day of the pandemic.
The numbers are hard to fathom. The chink of light is that the infection rate is gradually
decreasing. While cases remain high âabove 23,000 today â the rate of positive
results to number of tests has decreased in the past week from 12.4% to 10.2%.
The curve is flattening. But as in the first wave, it takes time for the death
toll to catch up, since many of todayâs fatalities were infected around the
peak of the second wave in early November. After grim figures, Italians are bracing themselves for a
less-than-happy Christmas with tightened restrictions. Theyâll be banned from
moving between regions, forced to self-isolate if they come into the country
from abroad, ordered to obey night-time curfews around Christmas Day and New
Year and told only to celebrate Christmas lunch with close family. This country
has been devastated by the first and now the second wave. It fears a third.  The US Supreme Court has ordered a lower court to reconsider a challenge to pandemic-related restrictions on religious services in California. The ruling sided with a church that had challenged the policy as unconstitutional religious discrimination, throwing out a lower court  ruling rejecting their case. The Harvest Rock Church and Harvest International Ministry has more than 160 churches in the state, according to AP news agency. California Governor Gavin Newsom has put heavy restrictions on religious services amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Under the current rules, houses of worship in the stateâs worst-hit areas cannot hold indoor gatherings. Elsewhere, there are restrictions on capacity. The ruling on Thursday came after the Supreme Court last week barred New York from enforcing certain limits on attendance at churches and synagogues. Quarantine rules are set to be eased for business travellers in England, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. From 04:00 GMT on Saturday, 5 December, the following people will no longer need to self-isolate when returning to England from a country not in a travel corridor:  For business travellers, their trips must result in a deal which creates or preserves 50 jobs or leads to a Â£100,000 investment or order, according to the Department for Transport. Read more on this story here Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were joined at Soho Theatre by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have been visiting entertainment venues in Soho, London, today to find out how the arts and entertainment sector has been coping during the pandemic. The couple were treated to an intimate performance at Soho Theatre - of the one-woman play Half Breed by Natasha Marshall. The actress revealed she had to dash from her Morrisons supermarket job to do the gig in front of the royals and was still wearing her uniform. She told the prince and his wife: ""I've got to go back later so it was easier to keep it on, I'll be in such a rush. ""The theatre has supported me so much I jumped at the chance to perform today."" Charles replied: ""That's marvellous, such dedication. I really enjoyed the performance and I am praying all of you can open soon."" Many entertainment venues are battling to stay in business because of the restrictions Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics So far, wave two has been lower
and slower than wave one. About 80% of deaths involving
coronavirus happened before August, and most of those happened in just one
month. Almost 10,000 coronavirus
deaths a week were registered in consecutive weeks in April. In this second wave, it looks
like the peak figures â assuming infections keep falling before widespread
vaccination takes place â might be closer to 3,000 than 4,000. And, as in wave one, those over
75 account for about 75% of the deaths, suggesting that vaccinating over-75s
could stem the vast majority of future deaths. This time around, the spread
of deaths around the country has looked quite different. In the spring and summer,
London and the North West of England each accounted for about 15% of
coronavirus deaths in the UK. But in this wave, Londonâs
share is down, closer to 5% whereas the North West is just under 25%. As the UK becomes the first European country to record a death toll of over 60,000, the daily reported deaths remain high at an average of 441 over the last 7 days. But confirmed cases show a marked fall following England's nationwide lockdown and stricter measures elsewhere in the UK. It also seems to have had an impact on daily hospital admissions, which have fallen to an average of 1,395 a day in the seven days up to 26 November, from a high of 1765 a day on 11 November. Dr Anthony Fauci was challenged over the vaccine's earlier availability in the UK UK ministers have been making their quick approval of the Pfizer vaccine a point of national pride, with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson facing criticism for claiming the speed was due to the UK being a ""much better country"" than European rivals. But the top US infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, hasaccused the UK of being less rigorous in its approval process. ""The UK did not do it as carefully,"" he told Fox News. ""If you go quickly and you do it superficially, people are not going to want to get vaccinated."" Fauci was facing criticism that the US was behind the UK in receiving the vaccine, but said there was only a difference of ""a couple of days"" and promised that US approval would come ""very soon"". He did not detail any specific issues with the UK approvals process. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, responsible for approving the vaccine, said it had accelerated the process by conducting a rolling review of Pfizer's data, starting at the beginning of October. ""We have rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review,â the agency said. Portugal's health minister has said that the country's citizens will receive Covid-19 vaccines for free via the public health service. Marta Temido
said 22 million doses would be bought for â¬200m. Vaccinations will start in January and nearly a million people will be given shots in the first phase. The country has six agreements for vaccines, including with AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, according to drugs regulator Infarmed. Earlier officials said the country had passed the peak of the ""second wave"" of the virus, which occurred between 12 and 15 November. Restrictions introduced last month include mandatory remote working and
a nightly curfew for the vast majority of the population, and a weekend
curfew in areas deemed to be at very high or extremely high risk, including
Lisbon and Porto. Portugal has had a total of 303,846 confirmed coronavirus cases since the
start of the epidemic and 4,645 deaths associated with Covid-19. The UK government's coronavirus figures suggest that for three months the average number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test was fewer than 50 deaths per day. But, as we have reported, on Monday the number of people who have died has increased to a total of 60,113 - up 414 in the past 24 hours. There have been a further 14,879 cases, as daily cases continue on a downward trend. As the latest government figures have confirmed, more than 60,000 people in
the UK have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. According to data from John Hopkins University,external, only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK. The UK government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus - but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest therehave been more than 69,000 deaths by this measure,external. The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland - which measure excess deaths - show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. The UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 60,000 coronavirus deaths,according to the latest government figures,external. A total of 60,113 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 414 in the past 24 hours. Two other ways of measuring deaths - where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate, and the number of ""excess deaths"" for this time of year - give higher total figures. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid-19 deaths than the UK,according to data from Johns Hopkins University,external. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics In
the week to 29 November, 87% of the nearly 90,000 beds in English hospitals
were occupied. This
is largely unchanged since the first week of November, when NHS England first
published these figures. The
NHS is meant to keep at least a 10th of its beds free to create flexibility to
admit patients and cope with surges in demand. But
a single number doesnât tell the full story. It
doesnât include the Nightingale hospitals that provide extra capacity, or the
beds that have been freed by cancelling operations. Or
that the pressures arenât evenly spread. Some
hospitals like North Middlesex, Southport & Ormskirk, Surrey &
Sussex, and Wrightington, Wigan & Leigh have more than 95% of beds taken. More
hospitals have seen capacity free up this month than have seen it tighten. But
as we move into the months that, in any year, put the most stress on capacity
within the NHS, all eyes will be on these figures. BBC World News This video can not be played Coronavirus: Normality is 'years away' despite vaccines A complete return to normal life after the coronavirus pandemic is years away, Prof Dale Fisher, chairman of the World Health Organisation's global outbreak and response network has said. He told BBC World News: ""I think over the next year or two things will loosen up quite a lot. I think we will eventually get back to normal but will that take three years or 10 years, I don't know."" He said there were a number of challenges ahead with the distribution of vaccines, including encouraging people to have them and not get complacent about the risks from the virus as time went on. Prof Fisher was speaking to Lucy Hocking. Care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the Covid vaccine from 14 December, the Scottish health secretary has confirmed. There had been concerns about getting doses to care homes because of issues with transporting small doses. But Jeanne Freeman said some of those issues had been addressed, making it possible to take the vaccine to homes. The first batches of the vaccine, which arrive in Scotland on Tuesday, will be given to health staff. Read morehere. Nick BeakeBrussels Correspondent, BBC News An exasperated sigh sums up
the reaction from a number of European
capitals to the vaccine victory
proclamations of some British government ministers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamsonâs sweeping
assessment that the UK is a âbetterâ country than many of its allies was seen
as particularly bold. One senior diplomat told me
he was delighted Britons would soon be receiving the vaccine, but that âsomeone
should remind Mr Williamson that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was created by a
German company, founded by scientists of Turkish origin, in partnership with
an American distributor, and is being manufactured in Belgium before being
transported across France to reach the UKâ. The claim that Brexit allowed the UK to approve the vaccine faster than other Europe countries has been disproved, but it does reflect once again a different path the UK is taking. All EU countries have the option to follow the UK example and let their domestic
drug regulator issue emergency approval, but the bloc says it wants to wait for
the European Medicines Agency to give the green light on all their behalf. But if the
Europe-wide delivery of a vaccine which promises to end the coronavirus misery
for millions is pushed back, there will likely be more voices asking: âWhy canât
we have what the Brits have already got?â.  We have more on the latest figures in the US where there have been a record number of cases. As we mentioned earlier, new cases rose by a record 195,695 on Wednesday. These graphs show the extent of the problem faced by health services there.  The number of people in hospital passed 100,000 for the first time, a figure that has doubled since early November, Covid Tracking Project data showed.  And deaths have risen quickly in recent weeks too - the daily death toll of 2,733 was close to a new high.  Nationwide, infections are now closing in on 14 million, with more than 264,000 deaths, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. Asda has become the latest supermarket to return business rates relief it has received from the UK government during the pandemic, announcing it will repay Â£340m. It follows similar moves by Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi and means the grocers will collectively return more than Â£1.7bn. Supermarkets had been allowed to stay open during the lockdown while non-essential shops had to close. Asda said its costs in dealing with Covid had outweighed any state support. But its president and chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: ""As the hope of a vaccine and a more 'normal' life returning in 2021 grows, we have confidence that we are in a strong position to again do the right thing for the communities we serve."" Earlier, England's deputy chief medical officer answered questions from members of the public about Covid-19, including on vaccine safety and effectiveness, in a live BBC News special. Here are some of the highlights, from giving vaccine advice to his mum,  rolling out another football analogy and Father Christmas' position on the vaccine priority list.

"Streaming in lower definitions can reduce emissions Streaming a television show in standard definition can shave a little off your carbon emissions, scientists at the UK's Royal Society says. 4K video streaming - also know as Ultra HD - on a phone generates about eight times more in emissions than standard definition (SD), it says. And, on a small screen, the viewer might not even notice the difference. Platforms and regulators should limit streaming resolution and default to SD, the authors urged. The scientists' report says digital technologyâs estimated contribution to global emissions ranges from 1.4% to 5.9% of the global total. Another simple way to save energy is for people streaming music to turn off any accompanying video if theyâre just listening, not watching, the authors say. They estimate such small moves could save up to 5% of the emissions from a streaming service â a reduction comparable to whatâs achieved by running YouTubeâs servers on renewable energy. The report also suggests owning and using devices for longer before trading them in, because the emissions created in making a new device are significant. Some of the numbers in the report are contested. But it says that if you change your mobile phone every two years, the manufacturing represents about half of all the emissions it will generate through its lifetime. But if individuals keep their phones for four years instead of two, that contribution is significantly reduced. For the same reason, the report says buying a device second-hand - or sharing equipment - also reduce the share of so-called ""embodied emissions"".

Moving computing from home or business desktops and on to the cloud can also help, because the cloud allows more efficient patterns of server use - so they donât consume energy while idle. Tech firms must also play a part, by providing transparent information about the energy consumption of their digital products and services, the report recommends. âThere are many routes to net zero [carbon emissions], but digital technology has a central role to play,â said lead author Prof Andy Hopper from Cambridge University. âWe must stay alert to digital demand outpacing the carbon emission reductions this transition promises.â Another co-author of the report, Prof Corinne Le Querre from the University of East Anglia, told BBC News: âTo be honest, digital tech is a small fraction of your emissions compared with, say flying even once a year â but every bit of CO2 saving is significant. ""Whatâs more, weâre trying to prompt people to harness the power of digital to help tackle climate change. ""The way we heat our homes, for instance, is a nonsense. We occupy part of house but heat the whole thing.

"Steffan Leonard wants to have a test but hopes he doesn't have to self-isolate alone in halls of residence ""I want to make sure before I see my family that I don't carry the virus back."" First-year university student Steffan Leonard is planning to book a Covid test before travelling home to his family in Swansea. Across Wales, universities are offering tests to students who want peace of mind before they go home for Christmas. But Steffan is concerned he may have to self-isolate on his own after others have left his university halls. Most university teaching is due to move online by Tuesday and students are being encouraged to travel by Wednesday 9 December. The aim of offering tests from this week is to make sure anyone who tests positive can complete their period of self-isolation in time to get home for Christmas. Covid: What is the mental health cost to the young? 3 people, 3 different Covid risks. What's yours? Student Covid testing begins for Christmas exodus All Welsh universities are runninga testing programme for students, with most offeringlateral flow tests. However, Cardiff University has had its own saliva testing programme since the start of term, and any positive cases are then encouraged to have an NHS test to confirm the result. They have had around 6,000 bookings as part of a programme for asymptomatic students running until 15 December. James Messenger, outside the test centre, is having a test and self-isolating as much as he can before returning home to Oxford One of them was third-year economics student James Messenger, who said he would also be self-isolating in the days before he returns to his family in Oxford. ""They are very appreciative of the measures that I'm taking to prevent them from possibly having it,"" he said. Cardiff University's vice-chancellor, Prof Colin Riordan, said they could not force students to take tests. ""What we need to do is to explain very clearly to our students the benefits of taking a test which is that they may be asymptomatic and positive,"" he said. Lois Campbell is also thinking ahead to the new year There are also questions about what happens in January when term restarts. Lois Campbell, from Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, and in her first year studying Welsh and journalism, thinks it would be unwise for everyone to return from their Christmas bubbles to university unchecked. ""I think they're going to have to put a scheme in place which means everyone can return to university safely. We might have to self-isolate [beforehand], nobody knows,"" she said. Cardiff University said it was planning a phased return and the continuation of its testing programme for students arriving back. ""We do have slightly different starting dates for different degree programmes anyway so that's helpful,"" Prof Riordan said. ""So we've got plans in place... and refining them as the situation develops."" This video can not be played How will I travel home in time for Christmas? NUS Wales president Becky Ricketts said she would like to see an all-Wales approach to student testing when they return to universities and colleges in January to avoid the circumstances they faced in September. The Welsh Government and Universities Wales said they were working together to ensure students can return safely in the new year. Students still need to socially distance, wash their hands, and wear a face covering where required Cardiff University is reminding students that even if a test is negative, they should still follow the rules and take all necessary precautions to keep themselves and others around them safe. The Welsh Government is also advising studentsto minimise their social contacts and their risk of catching and transmitting the virus,external. Covid: What is the mental health cost to the young?

"There have been renewed calls for defunding, after the death of George Floyd in May Former President Barack Obama has cautioned young Democrat activists against using snappy slogans such as ""defund the police"" if they want to bring about genuine reforms in the US. Defund the Police became a widely-used phrase after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May. Mr Obama said ""you lost a big audience the minute you say it"", making it ""a lot less likely"" to effect change. His comments received a backlash from some key black progressive Democrats. Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar tweeted ""it's not a slogan but a policy demand... for equitable investments and budgets for communities across the country"". Allow Twitter content?

""If you instead say, 'Hey, you know what Let's reform the police department so that everybody's being treated fairly,' suddenly a whole bunch of folks who might not otherwise listen to you are listening to you.""

"Corbyn addressed supporters outside the court after the judgement was handed down Piers Corbyn has been found guilty of breaching coronavirus restrictions at an anti-lockdown gathering. The 73-year-old brother of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was arrested when he refused to leave the event in Hyde Park, London, on 16 May. He was given an absolute discharge after Westminster Magistrates' Court heard he had spent 12 hours in police custody after his arrest. Addressing supporters outside, Corbyn said it had been ""a tremendous result"". District Judge Sam Goozee dismissed a second count of the same charge - linked to a protest on 30 May - after hearing police had issued a fixed penalty notice earlier that day. Prosecutor David Povall had described Corbyn as a ""poster boy for disparate groups"" attending both events near Speakers Corner. Piers Corbyn 'disregarded police protest advice' He told the court there was no reasonable excuse for ""breaching clear and emphatic regulations that were in force at the time"". Corbyn's defence had argued his arrest on 16 May was a ""disproportionate and unnecessary"" contravention of his right to peaceful protest. Returning his decision, judge Mr Goozee said Corbyn's actions would have been lawful if lockdown regulations had not been in force at the time. But their enforcement had been necessary for public health, he said, concluding that police ""took a measured response"". ""You, however, didn't engage with police - police action in arresting you was necessary and proportionate,"" he said.

"The US and China have clashed repeatedly in recent months, over trade, coronavirus and Hong Kong Chinese agents have stepped up their efforts to influence President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration, a US intelligence official has said. William Evanina, from the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said the Chinese were also focusing on people close to Mr Biden's team. Mr Evanina said it was an influence campaign ""on steroids"". Separately, a justice department official said more than 1,000 suspected Chinese agents had fled the US. In Wednesday's virtual discussion at the Aspen Institute think tank, Mr Evanina, chief of the Director of National Intelligence's counter-intelligence branch, said China had been attempting to meddle in the US efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine and recent American elections. He continued: ""We've also seen an uptick, which was planned and we predicted, that China would now re-vector their influence campaigns to the new [Biden] administration. ""And when I say that, that malign foreign influence, that diplomatic influence plus, or on steroids, we're starting to see that play across the country to not only the folks starting in the new administration, but those who are around those folks in the new administration. President Donald Trump accused President Xi Jinping's China of unleashing coronavirus on the United States ""So that's one area we're going to be very keen on making sure the new administration understands that influence, what it looks like, what it tastes like, what it feels like when you see it."" Both Mr Biden and President Donald Trump traded bitter accusations during the recent White House campaign of being influenced by Beijing. Mr Trump focused on business dealings by his rival's son Hunter Biden in China, while the Democratic candidate highlighted Mr Trump's Chinese bank account. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China? During the same think tank discussion on Wednesday, John Demers, chief of the justice department's national security division, said hundreds of Chinese researchers with ties to their country's military had been identified by FBI investigators over the summer. Mr Demers said the inquiry began when US authorities arrested five or six Chinese researchers who had hidden their affiliation with the People's Liberation Army (PLA). âNeither the US nor China wants usâ ""Those five or six arrests were just the tip of the iceberg and honestly the size of the iceberg was one that I don't know that we or other folks realised how large it was,"" he said. He told the discussion that after the FBI conducted dozens of interviews with other individuals, ""more than 1,000 PLA-affiliated Chinese researchers left the country"". Mr Demers said ""only the Chinese have the resources and ability and will"" to conduct such alleged political and economic espionage and ""other malign activity"". He told the discussion these researchers were in addition to a group to 1,000 Chinese students and researchers whose visas were revoked by the US back in September. US revokes visas for 1,000 Chinese students US orders China to close Houston consulate The US state department said back then it would only welcome Chinese students ""who do not further the Chinese Communist Party's goals of military dominance"". In July, the state department also closed China's consulate in Houston, Texas, accusing Beijing of stealing intellectual property. Beijing hit back by accusing the US of racial discrimination, but Mr Demers denied on Wednesday that the American authorities were racially profiling Chinese students. Sino-US relations have hit rock bottom after outgoing President Trump's disputes with Beijing over issues ranging from trade to Hong Kong to the pandemic.

"The US says it has revoked the visas of more than 1,000 Chinese students and researchers who are deemed to be a security risk. The move follows a proclamation by President Donald Trump in May aimed at Chinese nationals suspected of having ties to the military. He said some had stolen data and intellectual property. China has accused the US of racial discrimination. Nearly 370,000 students from China enrolled at US universities in 2018-19. A state department spokeswoman described those whose visas were revoked as ""high-risk graduate students and research scholars"". She said they were a ""small subset"" of the total number of Chinese students. âNeither the US nor China wants usâ Chinese students face scrutiny at US airports ""We continue to welcome legitimate students and scholars from China who do not further the Chinese Communist Party's goals of military dominance,"" the spokeswoman said. The Chinese foreign ministry denounced the move at a daily media briefing in Beijing. ""This is outright political persecution and racial discrimination. It seriously violates the human rights of these Chinese students,"" spokesman Zhao Lijian said, adding that China reserved the right to ""further respond"". Theproclamation of 29 May,externalaccused China of engaging in a ""wide-ranging and heavily resourced campaign to acquire sensitive United States technologies and intellectual property"" and said it was using some students ""to operate as non-traditional collectors of intellectual property"". Some Chinese students in the US say they are facing increased hostility and suspicion on university campuses, and their reasons for studying being questioned. Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese, Washington Though hardly unexpected, this move still comes as a bombshell for nearly 370,000 Chinese nationals studying in the US. Many of them have been anxious about US-China tensions, especially Washington's increased scrutiny of Chinese students in America over technology theft and economic espionage. US Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell told me last month that, against Chinese nationals who concealed military ties and came to the US ""masquerading"" as students, ""we have to defend ourselves"". The US authorities have indicted several Chinese nationals for visa fraud and theft of trade secrets. But many Chinese students see Washington's move as unreasonable, fearing that they are being used as a pawn in the escalating US-China competition. According to an online spreadsheet collecting self-reporting information from affected students, Washington's scope of visa revocation appears to go beyond Chinese graduate students in advanced scientific fields, also targeting undergraduate students and those studying economics and finance. Education used to be low-hanging fruit for US-China co-operation but now it has turned into a new front in the bilateral conflict.

"Doctors may have made ""do not resuscitate"" decisions on a blanket basis in the first wave of the pandemic, the care watchdog has warned. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said it saw a jump in complaints between March and September. Do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR) decisions may have been used inappropriately when care services were under extreme pressure, it found. Blanket use of DNARs was ""totally unacceptable"", an NHS spokeswoman said. PM hails vaccine but warns it is 'not game over' Doctors face agonising life-death care decisions NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' DNAR orders refer to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), so do not cover any other type of treatment someone needs for their condition or care that helps people feel comfortable and pain-free. Only 15% to 20% of those who undergo in hospital survive, with survival rates dropping to between 5% and 10% outside of a hospital setting. Although it can cause punctured lungs, fractured ribs and severe bruising, failing to fully appraise a patient or their loved ones of their options is a breach of their human rights, the CQC warned. The watchdog's guidance states decisions on DNARs must never be dictated by blanket policies, must be free from discrimination, and not made on a clinician's ""subjective view of a person's quality of life"". But despite reminding care providers of their obligations, the CQC said it received evidence from staff and patients' families that DNARs had been applied without consultation. The number of complaints it received about the orders jumped to 40 between March and September, compared to just nine similar complaints in the previous six months. One carer told the CQC an on-call doctor had informed care home staff that if a resident were to catch Covid-19, a DNAR would automatically be put in place. Another witness said some care homes and learning disability services had been told by GPs to place blanket orders on everyone in their care. Some families of patients said they were not made aware such an order was in place until their relative was quite unwell. Others said they had been told their loved one had agreed to a DNAR, but they had concerns over their understanding due to factors such as a lack of English or deafness. The CQC also found examples of routine care not being provided in homes, such as an ambulance or doctor not being called, due to the existence of the do not resuscitate order. Inappropriate DNARs may still be on people's files, the CQC said. Rosie Benneyworth, chief inspector of primary medical services and integrated care at the CQC, said: ""It is unacceptable for clinical decisions - decisions which could dictate whether someone's loved one gets the right care when they need it most - to be applied in a blanket approach to any group of people."" An NHS spokeswoman said: ""The NHS has repeatedly instructed local clinicians that the blanket application of DNARs would be totally unacceptable and that access to treatment and care for people with learning disabilities and autism should always be made on an individual basis and in consultation with family and carers."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters The CQC is undertaking further fieldwork across seven clinical commissioning groups to understand the extent to which DNARs may have been misused during the pandemic.

"Not yet two months old, Molly Gibson has already set a record When Molly Gibson was born in October of this year, it was 27 years in the making. Her embryo was frozen in October 1992, and stayed that way until February 2020, when Tina and Ben Gibson of Tennessee adopted it. Molly is believed to have set a new record for the longest-frozen embryo to have resulted in a birth, breaking a record set by her older sister, Emma. ""We're over the moon,"" Ms Gibson said. ""I still get choked up."" ""If you would have asked me five years ago if I would have not just one girl, but two, I would have said you were crazy,"" she said. The family struggled with infertility for nearly five years before Ms Gibson's parents saw a story about embryo adoption on a local news station. ""That's the only reason that we share our story. If my parents hadn't seen this on the news then we wouldn't be here,"" Ms Gibson, 29, said. ""I feel like it should come full-circle."" Ms Gibson, an elementary school teacher and her husband, a 36-year-old cyber security analyst, connected with the National Embryo Donation Center (NEDC), a Christian non-profit in Knoxville that stores frozen embryos that in vitro fertilisation patients decided not to use and chose to donate instead. Families like the Gibsons can then adopt one of the unused embryos and give birth to a child that is not genetically related to them. There are an estimated one million frozen human embryos stored in the US right now, according to the NEDC. Q&A: Surrogate babies Why I chose to go it alone with IVF 'One boy stood out to me - he's now my son' Mark Mellinger, the NEDC's marketing and development director, said that experience with infertility is common among families who seek embryo donations. ""I'd say probably 95% have encountered some sort of infertility"", he said. ""We feel honoured and privileged to do this work"", and help these couples grow their families. After their first embryo adoption, Ms Gibson gave birth to Emma in 2017, swapping sleepless nights praying for children with the sleepless nights of motherhood. ""It's the best kind of tired and it's the best kind of exhausted,"" she said. Founded 17 years ago, the NEDC has facilitated more than 1,000 embryo adoptions and births, and now conducts around 200 transfers each year.  Similar to a traditional adoption process, couples can decide if they would like a ""closed"" embryo adoption or an ""open"" one - allowing for some form of contact with the donor family. This contact ranges between a couple of emails each year to a cousin-like relationship, Mr Mellinger said. Couples are presented with 200-300 donor profiles, complete with the donor family's demographic history. The Gibsons had wanted a child for so long, the options were overwhelming. ""We did not care what this baby looked like, where it came from,"" Ms Gibson said. She sought advice from the NEDC where an employee told her to pick something ""silly"" and go from there. ""My husband and I are smaller people, and so we went through and narrowed it down by height and weight and looked for something similar to ours. That narrowed it down at ton,"" she said. This video can not be played After years searching, I found my sister next door The Gibson's children, Molly and Emma, are genetic siblings. Both embryos were donated and frozen together in 1992, when Tina Gibson was around a year old. According to the NEDC, Emma's 24-year-old embryo was the oldest in history to have been born, until Molly came along this year. Emma loves her new little sister, Ms Gibson said. ""She introduces her to anyone that sees her as 'my little sister Molly.'"" And Ms Gibson has loved seeing the similarities between her girls, including a tiny wrinkle between their eyebrows when they're mad or upset. According to the NEDC, the shelf-life for frozen embryos is infinite. The time-frame is limited, however, by the age of the technology - the first baby born from an embryo frozen after IVF was born in Australia in 1984. ""It's entirely possible that there will someday be a 30-year-old embryo that comes to birth,"" Mr Mellinger said.

"Students have been taking Covid tests this week ahead of leaving for Christmas Students will have staggered starting dates for returning to universities in England after Christmas - with some not back until 7 February. The government's plan will mean students taking hands-on courses such as medicine or performing arts returning from 4 to 18 January. Other subjects would be taught online at the start of term, with students back between 25 January and 7 February. Students are being promised Covid tests when they return next term. It means some students heading home in the next few days will not be in university again for nine weeks. The National Union of Students said students would still have to pay rent on ""properties they are being told not to live in"". The plan, to avoid a surge of students and the risk of spreading coronavirus, will see a staggered return for students over five weeks in the new year - with most courses starting online before a return to in-person teaching. Mass testing for students gets underway in universities Two Covid tests for students and then leave in 24 hours Testing for Christmas holidays to start from 30 November The first students returning will be for practical courses which are difficult to teach solely online - which will include medicine, nursing and dentistry; sciences which need to use laboratories; or music, dance and drama. Courses are going to be online at the start of next term for many students Those starting later will include subjects such as English literature, history and maths. Students will be offered two lateral-flow Covid tests when they arrive back - similar to the process for their departure. ""This planâ¯willâ¯enable a safer returnâ¯forâ¯all students,"" Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said, who also announced a Â£20m student hardship fund. The UCU lecturers' union, which has called for teaching to be online to avoid the spread of infection, said the plan for a delayed start to in-person teaching was a ""step forward"". Vanessa Wilson, leader of the University Alliance group, welcomed the ""clarity"" about next term - and also the recognition that campus facilities would have to be kept open for students not going home at Christmas. Emma Hardy, Labour's shadow universities minister, said ""the delay in providing this guidance has caused huge, unnecessary stress for students and universities"". The arrangements have been announced on the eve of students being able to return home for Christmas - with the ""travel window"" for students opening on Thursday. Louis will be part of the logistical challenge to get students home this week Louis Chambers, a first year studying geology at the University of Hull, will be among the students heading home this week. HIs parents are coming to take him back to Norfolk - and the university is running a system of one-hour slots for students to be collected, which he says will mean ""not so many leaving at once"". ""It will be a relief to get back home,"" he says, as he has been able to see his family only once this term, because of Covid restrictions. But he thinks the Covid testing and ""travel window"" have been uncomplicated so far - and he has enjoyed his first term. And many students will already have left. Out of the six in Louis's flat, he says, three have already gone home. The ""window"" for students to travel home begins on Thursday University of Hull student services director Anji Gardiner has been organising the staggered departures through the Christmas ""travel window"". As well as slots for those being collected by car - which run from 07:00 to 20:00 - there are coaches being laid on and a booking system for the limited capacity on trains, with the numbers travelling spread out across the week. ""We want to keep it safe - we didn't want a logjam of people trying to get home,"" Dr Gardiner says. The mass Covid testing of students began in universities on Monday - with temporary testing centres set up in sports halls and in rooms on campus. Before leaving for Christmas, students have been encouraged to have two tests three days apart - and to travel within 24 hours of receiving a second negative test result. The ""travel window"", in which students are expected to move out of university, will run from 3 to 9 December. In England, about 1.2 million students will be travelling from a university to a home address in another part of the country, including: 235,000 leaving the South East 217,000 leaving London 126,000 leaving the East Midlands 122,000 leaving the West Midlands 119,000 leaving the North West 110,000 leaving the South West 88,000 leaving the East 64,000 leaving the North East Universities UK welcomed the plans for more testing for students when they returned after Christmas. ""The high demand for tests from students shows they understand the important role testing can play in keeping themselves and their communities safe,"" said a spokesman.

"University students around the UK are beginning their journeys home for Christmas, after mass testing to screen them for coronavirus. Those in England and Wales are being asked to return home during the week-long ''travel window"" starting on Thursday after taking the tests, while Scotland isplanning a more staggered return.,external It is hoped this will reduce the risk of students spreading Covid-19 to their family and friends, following outbreaks on campuses earlier this term. Rapid Covid tests were distributed to universities at the end of November, so that students could be tested at the same time as England's lockdown ended on 2 December. Students who test negative have been asked to travel between 3 and 9 December, while general infection rates are lower. This means students ''pose a much-reduced risk to their loved ones and their community"", Universities Minister Michelle Donelan says. Universities in high-risk areas have been prioritised for testing, with results that can be turned around in an hour. Student Covid testing begins for Christmas exodus Testing facilities were set up at universities earlier in the year following outbreaks Unless they test positive or develop symptoms, students are encouraged to travel home during this timeframe, with any remaining teaching conducted online. Those found to have coronavirus will have to self-isolate for 10 days, but will still be able to get home in time for Christmas. This video can not be played How will I travel home in time for Christmas? Students are ""strongly advised"" to travel during the window, as they may not make it home for Christmas if they have to self-isolate later. Wales will follow a similar procedure to England,with students asked to travel by 9 December at the latest,and offered a rapid turnaround test before they go. Students in Scotland will be allowed to return homeif they return two negative tests,taken five days apart. Those who test positive would have to self-isolate before going home. The end dates of courses will be staggered to avoid a ""great surge of movement"" in December. The Northern Ireland Executive has not announced any specific plans for the travel windows but is also conducting mass testing of students. Students will havestaggered starting dates for returning to universities in England after Christmas- with some not back until 7 February. Students taking hands-on courses like medicine or performing arts would return from 4 to 18 January, with other subjects initially taught online. Other students would then return between 25 January and 7 February. The other UK nations have yet to publish their plans. Scotland's Universities Minister, Richard Lochhead, said lessons must be learned from outbreaks at the start of term in Augustbefore finalising plans for January. It's not yet known whether teaching in January will move online Most universities went into the new academic year offering a blend of in-person and online teaching. But some -including the two main ones in Manchester- had already suspended in-person teaching, while all universities will finish the autumn term online. Even if you can't attend lectures in person, it is unlikely you will get a refund if you can access your course online. The government has saidstudents shouldn't expect a refund,external''if they are receiving adequate online learning"". However, some MPs have called forstudents to receive discounts,externaland the National Union of Students wants refunds if ''quality of learning is severely impacted''. They may be receiving online tuition, but students have a right to access other resources too. ''If they don't have access to libraries and research facilities, students would have a claim for breach of contract,'' says Boz Michalowska-Howells, head of consumer law at Leigh Day solicitors. Any savings universities make by not providing facilities or through government schemes should be passed on to students via fee reductions, she adds. Higher education regulator the Office for Students (OfS) says it ''can and will investigate'' if it believes universities haven't taken all reasonable steps to protect standards. Some of those who have been told to self-isolate at short notice in halls are eligible for extra support. If someone in your accommodationdevelops coronavirus symptoms- a new, continuous cough, fever or loss of taste or smell - they should self-isolate immediately and arrange to be tested. The rest of their household should also self-isolate - for 14 daysuntil they know whether the test is positive.,externalThere arefines of up to Â£10,000 for failing to do so. What is self-isolation and who has to do it? Government guidance says universities should work with Public Health England to identify what a ""whole household isolation"" means in such circumstances. It says it would normally include ""students living in the same flat or on the same floor who share cooking or washing facilities"". In September, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - which works with the government - warned of ""significant outbreaks associated with higher education"". By early October, almost all of the local areas that had coronavirus case rates of over 1,000 also had high density student populations in England. A Sage paper also identified the end of term in mid-December as likely to lead to ""the peak health impacts of newly seeded infections due to...mass movement [of students]"".

"Sending live animals abroad for slaughter and fattening will be banned in England and Wales under new plans. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the ban could be in force by the end of 2021 in a post-Brexit break from EU trade rules. The RSPCA welcomed the move, saying it would be ""a landmark achievement for animal welfare"". But the National Farmers Union is calling for improvements to export rules, rather than an outright ban. The government is launching an eight-week consultation on the plan - which includes measures to cut the amount of time animals spend in trucks within the UK. A package of reforms is then expected to come to Parliament next summer. Are both sides running out of road for a Brexit deal? UK at odds with EU over approval for food exports What happens next with Brexit? Current EU trading rules allow for animals to be transported abroad for slaughter. One local authority in Kenttried to ban the exports in 2012after a lorry full of lame sheep was found at the local port and the animals had to be put down. But the High Court overturned the ban, saying it was a breach of EU free trade rules. Only a few thousand of the millions of animals bred for meat in the UK end up being shipped to Europe for slaughter. But the government said now the UK has left the EU - and will stop following its rules after the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December - a ban can be introduced. Its consultation will also look at further elements of animal welfare in transport, such as reducing maximum journey times, giving animals more space and headroom during transport, and stricter rules on transporting animals in extreme temperatures or by sea. After months of taking a battering on issues like food standards in future trade deals - chlorinated chicken and the like - here is a strong push from the government on animal welfare issues. An outright ban of this kind on live animal exports is stronger than some animal welfare experts had expected the government to propose - although one MP who's campaigned on this issue for years (and was delighted) told me he didn't care how the practice ended, just that it did. Announcing the measure just weeks before the transition period ends sends a strong signal. The government has long maintained that exporting live animals was a practice which could be ended as a result of Brexit - a good example of where leaving the EU would bring benefits. No surprise then that it is keen to deliver on it fully. But included in this consultation are some measures which will limit how far animals can travel within the UK, and it could well be that those measures prove a bumpier ride for the government. The Conservative Party made the pledge to ban live animal exports in its election manifesto. There had been fears a ban may not be possible under global trade rules, but ministers are confident its plans are inline with them. Mr Eustice said the government had ""struck the right balance"" with its plan, saying it would ""remove the trade that most people are concerned about - predominantly the export of lambs for slaughter to continental Europe - but would enable high value breeding stock still to be traded, as they are usually transported in very good conditions"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The move has the support of the RSPCA, which has campaigned on the issue for more than 50 years. The charity's chief executive officer, Chris Sherwood, said: ""There is absolutely no reasonable justification to subject an animal to an unnecessarily stressful journey abroad simply for them to be fattened for slaughter. ""Ending live exports for slaughter and further fattening would be a landmark achievement for animal welfare."" But the NFU is instead calling for improvements to export regulations. The union's livestock board chairman, Richard Findlay, said: ""The NFU has developed a solution to raise the standards for live exports for slaughter. ""We believe that an assurance scheme which goes beyond the current regulation would be best to ensure all animals travel in the best possible conditions and that they arrive at the approved and final destination in the best possible health."" He added: ""Significant regulatory changes could potentially have a massive impact on the UK food supply chain."" However, the chief policy adviser for campaign group Compassion in World Farming, Peter Stevenson, urged farmers not to oppose the plans. Instead he called on the industry to ""recognise that this is an important part of moving forward to a high welfare future"".

"The UK prime minister is set to declare one of the most ambitious targets in the world for tackling climate change. BBC News understands Boris Johnson's goal will be to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 68% or 69% by the end of the decade, based on 1990 levels. This will mean an even faster pace of decarbonisation for industries, transport and homes. It might, for instance, mean a faster switch away from gas boilers for home heating. Or it could, under another scenario, lead to the phase-out of gas-guzzling SUVs. The targets are known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). They're at the heart of the Paris Agreement, the international pact signed in 2016 that's intended to cut emissions with the aim of keeping global temperature rise well under 2C. Humans waging 'suicidal war' on nature - UN chief The year 2020 set to be in top three warmest A really simple guide to climate change NDCs represent the commitments by each country - under the Paris pact - to reduce their own national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Mr Johnson hopes that the UKâs new targets will set an example to other nations, which will join a virtual climate pledges summit on 12 December. This virtual event will occur in place of annual UN climate talks, which were set to have taken place in Glasgow this year, but were postponed because of Covid-19. The UK has assumed the presidency at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP) meeting - in partnership with Italy. The full meeting will take place at the end of next year. The 68% cut was deemed by the EU to be Britainâs fair share towards combating climate change. By adding another percentage point, the PM would attract favourable headlines from some environmentalists â although others think the number should be higher still, given the apparent impact of climate change on the world already. Green groups have called for a 75% cut, and research by consultancy Cambridge Econometrics, commissioned by the Prince of Wales corporate leaders group, said a target of a 70% by 2030 was necessary. Tim Crosland, from the pressure group Extinction Rebellion, said 100% emissions cuts in the UK should be made by 2025 if the world was to avoid over-shooting the 1.5C temperature threshold agreed by the UN. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it wouldnât comment until it had seen the official figures. The true value of the PMâs target wonât be clear until details about background assumptions are revealed officially in coming days. One question is whether the UK could use international credits for achieving its target - in effect paying other nations to cut emissions on its behalf. The government's advisory Climate Change Committee has told the PM that credits would only be allowable if the target is more ambitious than 68%. It says in a letter: ""This trajectory for UK emissions is eminently achievable, provided effective policies are introduced across the economy without delay. These would bring significant benefits for the UK's economic recovery. ""The NDC is more than just a number. It should be accompanied by wider climate commitments, including the development of a policy package and Net Zero Strategy to deliver against the UK goal, clear commitments to reduce international aviation and shipping emissions, and greater support for climate finance, particularly for developing countries. ""It is also imperative that the NDC is accompanied by strengthened climate change adaptation plans."" The 2030 date is important because CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are cumulative. That means that if the UK doesnât radically reduce emissions by that date, it wonât be able to achieve its long-term aim of net zero emissions by mid-century. Net zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and balancing any further releases by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Only a handful of countries have submitted revised NDCs so far.

"South Africans have been questioning the result of the draw (file picture) An unusual sequence of numbers drawn in South Africa's national lottery has sparked accusations of fraud after 20 people won a share of the jackpot. Tuesday's PowerBall lottery saw the numbers five, six, seven, eight and nine drawn, while the PowerBall itself was, you have guessed it, 10. The organisers say the sequence is often picked. But some have alleged a scam and an investigation is under way. It is extremely rare for multiple winners to share the jackpot. The organisers said 20 people purchased a winning ticket and won 5.7m rand ($370,000; Â£278,000) each. Another 79 ticketholders won 6,283 rand each for guessing the sequence from five up to nine but missing the PowerBall. What do lottery winners spend their money on? The chances of winning South Africa's PowerBall lottery are one in 42,375,200 - the number ofdifferent combinations when selecting five balls from a set of 50, plus an additional bonus ball from a pool of 20,external. The odds of the draw resulting in the numbers seen in Tuesday's televised live event are the same as any other combination. Competitions resulting in multiple winners are rare, but this may have something to do with this particular sequence. ""Congratulations to tonight's 20 winners of the PowerBall draw,"" lottery operator Ithuba tweeted, adding: ""These numbers may be unexpected, but we see many players opt to play these sequences.""

"This video can not be played Shoppers queue as stores reopen in Birmingham Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown. Athree-tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into forcein the nation, with gyms and businesses such as hairdressers also able to open. More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households. The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"". At a Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he accepted that the tiered system was ""tough"", but insisted that regional restrictions and mass testing were the way to ""keep the virus under control"". He said he hoped that places would be able ""to come down the tiers"" before Easter, while stressing that the tier restrictions would continue to be a ""very important"" part of battling coronavirus. Government publishes data behind stricter tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? Keeping pools closed 'a catastrophe for health' 'We've lost a day of trade' over lockdown end date There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark. And people arrived promptly to take advantage ofa stock clearance sale at Debenhams department storefrom 07:00 GMT. Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown. It comes after a period which has seenthe collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group,women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ©and the failure ofDebenhams to secure a buyer- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk. Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, butdown by 24.1%on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard. Queues were seen outside Primark in Birmingham early on Wednesday Shoppers also headed to London's Oxford Street A swimmer takes to the water at London's Serpentine Swimming Club as outdoor swimming pools are also allowed to reopen Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates. She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online."" Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy. ""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said. ""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month."" Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.

Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand. There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels. British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers,with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"". The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England willbe able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus. And later on Wednesdayabout 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football Leaguefor the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March. England's new tiered system wasbacked by MPs in a Commons votejust hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan. The latest restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November. Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers. In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors. And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It will be some months before the most vulnerable are protected"" People should not get ""carried away with over optimism"" after the UK approved its first coronavirus vaccine, Boris Johnson has warned. The PM said it did not mean ""our struggle is over"", saying parts of the economy still faced tough restrictions. England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam urged patience over the rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, which begins early next week. But care home residents will have to wait due to logistical challenges. And it could take until April for all those most at-risk to receive the new vaccine, according to the head of NHS England. A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported. What are the safety checks for vaccines? How will I get a vaccine? Did Brexit speed up the process? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' Speaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson saidthe decision to approve the Pfizer jab by regulator MHRAcame amid ""immense logistical challenges"" in getting doses to vulnerable groups. The vaccine needs to be stored at around -70C and comes in packs of 975 doses, which cannot yet be split into smaller batches. Those who receive it will need a a second dose 21 days later to receive full protection. ""It's going to continue to be tough for some sectors - but until the vaccine is deployed our plan relies on all of us making sacrifices to protect the ones we love,"" Mr Johnson said. Meanwhile, Labour's leader Sir Keir Starmer said the vaccine roll-out would require the ""best of Britain"" as he called for cross-party consensus on communications about the effort. This is the day we have been waiting for. But it is clear listening to NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam that huge logistical challenges remain. First of all, supply. The UK is expecting 800,000 doses in the next few days. But given there are 15 million people over the age of 65 and working in health and care sectors, and all need two doses, getting more into the country is essential. Millions more doses are promised - but how quickly they arrive remains to be seen. Roll-out is also difficult. Through a combination of the need to keep the vaccine at ultra-cold storage and the fact that the jab comes in batches of 975 that cannot be split up at the moment, immunisation will only be offered from a network of 50 hospitals to start with. That's because sending it to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted. It is why there is still so much hope pinned to the Oxford University vaccine, that regulators are currently reviewing. That does not need to be kept in ultra-cold storage and so can be distributed much more easily. Plus there are already millions of doses in the country. Prof Van-Tam said he became emotional when the UK became the first country to approve the Pfizer vaccine, but he too warned that social-distancing rules would have to remain in place. ""If we relax too soon it will create a tidal wave of infections,"" he said. ""I don't think we are going to eradicate coronavirus ever. I think it's going to be with humankind forever,"" he added. Prof Van-Tam also said that those offered the vaccine ""must take it"". ""We need people to take it. This vaccine isn't going to help you if you don't take it,"" he said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the vaccine would be rolled out to 50 hospital hubs in England, with the over-80s, care home staff and front-line NHS staff being the first to receive it from next week. Sir Simon said vulnerable people with outpatient appointments scheduled were likely to be among the very first to be offered the jab. The NHS is ""raring to go"" to vaccinate people in care homes, hopefully this month, Sir Simon said, but he admitted they would not be among the first to receive it. Setting out the difficulties faced in getting the vaccine into care homes, he noted that the jab can only be moved a few times, and that each pack of doses cannot be easily split. The 975 doses they contain would be too many for individual care homes, meaning the vaccine would be wasted, he explained. Both Pfizer and BioNTech have said the jab can be sent to care homes, as long as the vaccine travels for no more than six hours after it leaves cold storage and is then put in a normal fridge at 2C to 8C. This video can not be played England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer: 'I don't think we are going to eradicate coronavirus ever' The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the steps that normally span 10 years. The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. These will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said earlier, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland would be immunised on Tuesday, while Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the roll-out to care homes would be particularly difficult. The bulk of the roll-out across the UK will be next year. BioNTech's chief commercial officer Sean Marett said the UK was likely to receive at least 5 million doses of vaccine by the end of the year. Sir Simon said most of the at-risk population would be vaccinated between January and March or April. The order in which people will get the jab has been recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations. But the final decision onwho gets the coronavirus vaccineis made by the government. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh said Pfizer's plan to get doses to hard-to-reach places such as individual care homes had yet to be approved by the MHRA. The NHS will begin contacting people about getting vaccinated, with GP practices to work together to operate local vaccination centres. Aside from the Pfizer vaccine, the UK has options to buy doses of six other candidate jabs. At least four of these have proceeded to phase-three trials. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"GCSE and A-level students missed time in school and continue to face disruption Extra measures to ""boost fairness and support students"" will be used for next summer's GCSE and A-level exams in England, ministers have announced. More generous grading, advance notice of exam topics and additional papers are promised by the Department for Education to make up for the disruption faced by students during the pandemic. Those who cannot sit exams due to self-isolation rules will still get a grade. Heads said it was ""a reasonable package"" of measures for the situation. The DfE says it has had ""extensive engagement"" with exams watchdog Ofqual, exam boards and senior leaders across the education sector. The measures mean: more generous grading than usual, in line with results from summer 2020, so that this year's cohort is not disadvantaged students getting advance notice - at the end of January - of some topic areas covered in exams to focus revision exam aids - such as formula sheets - provided in some exams to cut down on the memorising required additional ""backup"" exams - to be held in July - to give students a second chance to sit a paper if they have to miss main exams or assessments due to illness or self-isolation and a new expert group, which will monitor variation in the impact of the pandemic on students across the country. In extreme cases, where a student misses all their papers, a teacher-assessed grade will be given. Those young people taking vocational and technical qualifications will also see adaptations to their exams to ensure fairness. Schooling 'completely disrupted' in some areas Mixed response as 2021 exams in Wales scrapped Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 NI GCSE and A-level exams 'will go ahead in 2021' Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said exams were the best way of measuring performance, and that it was ""so important"" they took place next summer. ""But this isn't business as usual. I know students are facing unprecedented disruption to their learning. ""That's why exams will be different next year, taking exceptional steps to ensure they are as fair as possible."" Mr Williamson later told the BBC that students have had an ""incredibly difficult"" year and he speaks ""as a father"" as well as education secretary. He told BBC Breakfast: ""I know as a father of a 16-year-old who is taking GCSEs this year, who's been in a situation where she's had to self-isolate and her friends have, that we have to take extra measures, have to take extra steps, to make sure there's as much fairness for them."" He also told Sky News he could ""absolutely"" give a cast-iron guarantee that exams will not be cancelled next year. This video can not be played COVID-19: The students at school in a pandemic A-level and GCSE students in England were this yeargiven grades estimated by their teachers, in a government u-turn, after exams were cancelled because of the pandemic. It followed uproar after about 40% of A-level results were downgraded from students' predicted grades by exams regulator Ofqual, which used an algorithm based on schools' prior marks. Julia: ""I have lots of worries about GCSEs"" Julia, a Year 11 GCSE student at Herne Bay High School in Kent, says the learning lost because of Covid-19 has caused a lot of anxiety. ""I have a lot of worries about GCSEs, because I really feel there's not much being done about the amount of time we missed. ""I'm especially worried about English and maths because those are a must-have for any sixth form. "" Edward, also in Year 11, agrees that the disruption for his year group should be recognised. ""It should be taken into account, everyone should have the same chance as everyone else as we are sitting the same exam."" He says knowing which topics will be coming up will help with revision. ""That would be extremely helpful so that I know what I should prioritise my time on."" Jessica Petherick says she feels ""almost forgotten about by the government"" Jessica Petherick, a Year 13 A-level student from Essex, says she feels ""almost forgotten about by the government"". The 17-year-old adds: ""It's taken them a long time to come up with a plan, and I feel uncertain about what's going to happen. I know there's a plan, but as everyone knows they've made plenty of u-turns."" In primary schools, Year 6 national tests, known as Sats, will go ahead ""to assist with pupils' transition to secondary schools"" and teacher assessment in English reading, writing and mathematics at Key Stage 1 will remain. But the Key Stage 1 tests in reading and maths, and the grammar, punctuation, and spelling tests at Key Stage 1 and 2 will be cancelled for this academic year. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the measures were ""a reasonable package"" to mitigate the damaging impact of the pandemic and made exams ""as fair as they can be in the circumstances"". Mr Barton said advanced notice of exam topics and exam aids would ""help pupils know where to focus their energies in the time that remains"" before exams take place. ""It is not perfect - nothing can be given the fact that learning has been so disrupted by coronavirus and that pupils have been affected to vastly different extents. ""But various options have been discussed exhaustively, and, frankly, schools and colleges just need a decision - the uncertainty has gone on for much too long."" In Wales, A-levels and GCSE exams havebeen cancelledandNationals in Scotlandhave also been cancelled, but Highers and Advanced Highers will be taken, two weeks later than usual. In Northern Ireland,GCSEs and A-levels are going ahead, but will start a week later than usual. The DfE also announced that school inspections by Ofsted inspectors, which were suspended in March, will not resume until after Easter. In the meantime, Ofsted will conduct ""supportive monitoring inspections"" to schools and colleges currently judged to be ""inadequate"" and some that ""require improvement"". Test and exam results will not be included in school performance tables - instead the tables will be replaced by other information such as attendance information and student destinations. Labour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, welcomed the government's announcement but said it had come ""very late"". She told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""We're nearly at the Christmas holidays and students have been very, very anxious ever since September, and teachers uncertain about what they should be preparing their students for."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the announcement brought some ""much needed relief to school leaders who have been operating in 'emergency mode' for most of this year"". But Robin Bevan, headteacher of Southend High School for Boys and National Education Union president, said schools did not yet know how many topics their students would be told about in advance. He said: ""Not knowing this until next year means that the students and teachers may now be 'misusing' their time, catching up on content that may be of educational value but isn't required for the exam. It's a form of curriculum bingo."" At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine is expected to be rolled out in the UK next week Health Secretary Matt Hancock has claimed Brexit allowed the UK to approve a Covid vaccine more quickly than other European Union (EU) countries. ""We do all the same safety checks and the same processes, but we have been able to speed up how they're done because of Brexit,"" he said in an interview with Times Radio. And the Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, tweeted: ""We could only approve this vaccine so quickly because we have left the EU."" Allow Twitter content?

The EU - through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - has yet to approve a coronavirus vaccine. But the idea that Brexit enabled the UK to press ahead and authorise one is not right. It was actually permitted under EU law, a point made by the head of the UK's medicines regulator on Wednesday. Under European law a vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but individual countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market. Britain is still subject to those EU rules during the post-Brexit transition period which runs until the end of the year. The UK's own medicines regulator, the MHRA, confirmed this ina statement last month,external. And its chief executive, Dr June Raine, said on Wednesday that ""we have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January"". This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" We asked Mr Rees-Mogg about his comment that: ""Last month we changed the regulations so a vaccine did not need EU approval which is slower."" He replied with part of the text of an ""explanatory memorandum"" which accompanied new laws passed by Parliament last month. ""The regulation of human medicines is an area of shared competence between the EU and Member States under article 4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU),"" it reads. ""But in light of the EU's comprehensive exercise of the competence, Member States are precluded from exercising the competence nationally."" It is true that, in general, regulation of new medicines is done on an EU-wide basis. But that does not take account of the emergency provisions in EU law which Dr Raine refers to. At the government briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked whether the UK's vaccine approval was down to a ""Brexit bonus"". He refused to answer directly and thanked the NHS and the Vaccine Taskforce instead. The MHRA is well-regarded as a world leader in the regulation of medicine, and it has certainly chosen to move faster with vaccine approval than the EMA. ""Our speed or our progress has been totally dependent on the availability of data in our rolling review, and the rigorous assessment and independent advice we have received,"" Dr Raine said. But again, the MHRA didn't have to rely on Brexit to do that. For example, the European Commission confirmed earlier this week thatHungary - an EU member - could use a Russian Covid vaccine,externalin its domestic market if it chose to do so. The EMA appeared to criticise the UK approach in a statement which said it is using a slightly slower method for licensing Covid vaccines than the UK. An initial batch of 800,000 doses of the vaccine will be shipped to the UK from Pfizer's facilities in Belgium It considers this approach to be ""the most appropriate regulatory mechanism for use in the current pandemic emergency, to grant all EU citizens access to a vaccine and to underpin mass vaccination campaigns"". The agency said this longer process was based on a wider body of evidence. The EMA has said it will decide by 29 December whether to grant provisional approval to the vaccine manufactured by Pfizer and BioNTech. That means distribution of the vaccine across the EU - if it is approved - won't start until January, when the relevant EU laws will no longer apply in the UK. The government says it can be more nimble outside the EU, amidst an ongoing debate about how closely it should stick to EU regulations in all sorts of policy areas. But the fact that the UK is the first country in the world to approve this vaccine has got nothing directly to do with Brexit.

"The government has begun distributing the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. However, it needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C. Most other vaccines do not need this, so how will this be made to work? In the short-term, Pfizer has a plan. The vaccine will be distributed from its own centres in the US, Germany and Belgium. It will need to travel both on land and by air and possibly be stored in distribution centres, before being delivered to anywhere the vaccine will be given. Pfizer hasdeveloped a special transport box,externalthe size of a suitcase, packed with dry ice and installed with GPS trackers. Each reusable box can keep up to 5,000 doses of the vaccine at the right temperature for 10 days, if it remains unopened. Wiltshire-based firm Polar Thermals makes similar boxes for other vaccines and counts Pfizer among its clients, but not yet for this particular purpose. Polar Thermal's ""thermal shipper"" can be reused thousands of times The box is not likely to be cheap. Head of sales Paul Harrison says a standard chilled transport box, which will retain a temperature of up to -8C for five days and is big enough to hold 1,200 vaccines, costs about Â£5,000 per unit - although they can be reused thousands of times. His firm uses aerogel as insulation, rather than dry ice - which could be handy if a global carbon dioxide shortage from earlier this year continues to affect the availability of related products, such as dry ice. The US Compressed Gas Association, however, has saidit is committed to meeting demand.,external The vaccine can survive for a further five days once thawed, Pfizer has said, but this does not buy a great deal of extra time. In the longer-term, Public Health England says that in the UK ""national preparations"" are under way regarding both central storage and distribution of the vaccine across the country, but has not given details. As it stands, extreme cold storage is certainly not commonplace, and your local GP is unlikely to have it. Some institutions, such as universities and research labs, do have the right storage capacity. In the UK, universities shared resources at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, including PPE-making equipment and ventilators. How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine?

"This video can not be played How will I travel home in time for Christmas? The mass Covid testing of students, so they can go home safely for the Christmas break, is starting at many universities across the UK. Universities are opening temporary testing centres where hundreds of thousands of students will be checked for Covid this week before they leave. Students have been asked to take two tests, three days apart. If they test negative, many students will leave university in the ""travel window"" starting from 3 December. But testing is voluntary and it will not be available in all universities. The UCU lecturers' union has warned about the reliability of the testing plans and says there could be ""chaos"". Inshaal says students in Bradford are concerned about bringing back the virus to elderly relatives Caleb Shaw, a journalism student at the University of the West of England in Bristol, is taking a test on Monday. ""I know I'm less likely to get seriously ill with it,"" he says, but he wants to get a test to protect his family. ""If I get a test then I can make sure I don't bring it home to them. It would be stupid to not take advantage of it,"" Caleb says. Two Covid tests for students and then leave in 24 hours Testing for Christmas holidays to start from 30 November Universities to oversee exodus of students at end of term Rapid mass testing plan to get students home at Christmas The university is using its sports centre as a temporary testing site until 6 December with 90 staff and students helping with the testing process. Inshaal Ahmad, a students' union sabbatical officer at the University of Bradford, says most students seem supportive of the testing. A student taking a swab sample at the University of St Andrews He says many students at Bradford live in multi-generational households, including older relatives, and want to ""be on the safe side"" and not risk bringing the virus back from university. Testing at Bradford will continue until 6 December and as with other universities, booking slots for tests will also be a way of staggering the times when students can leave, within the ""travel window"" that ends on 9 December. The mass testing is intended to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus as students travel away from their term-time addresses. Sports halls and rooms on campus are being converted into testing centres, where students will take ""lateral flow"" swab tests, which will provide results within an hour, with the outcome sent by email or text. Caleb will be among the students taking the Covid test on Monday Two tests are recommended to increase accuracy - and students will be expected to travel soon after a second negative result, with students in England and Wales encouraged to leave within 24 hours. If students get a positive result, they will have to take another test to confirm - and if they have coronavirus they will have to stay and self-isolate. Most universities are providing testing - 130 ""expressed an interest"" in taking part in the scheme, according to the Department for Health and Social Care. But the National Union of Students says there should be capacity for all students who want a test to get one before Christmas. ""We are not aware of how universities will decide which students are tested if testing is oversubscribed,"" says the NUS. The UCU lecturers' union says the approach to testing has been rushed and confused and the last-minute arrangements will be a ""recipe for chaos"". The union said it had ""grave concerns"" and ""testing so many people and following necessary safety measures would be an extremely challenging operation"". England's Universities Minister Michelle Donelan has urged students ""to take the tests on offer"". In Wales, testing will begin and students are expected to travel by 9 December, but there have beenconcerns about not all students having access to a test. In Scotlandtesting will be available for students from Monday, with an encouragement to leave for home soon after a second negative test. In Northern Ireland, Grian Ni Dhaimhin, student union president at Queen's University Belfast, said: ""We are all in this together and I'd encourage students to take part in this important programme."" But not all universities in Northern Ireland are planning to offer testing. ""Testing will help to break the line of transmission amongst students, especially when they are infected but are not aware of it,"" said Professor Steve West, vice chancellor at the University of the West of England. Bradford's vice chancellor, Professor Shirley Congdon, told students the tests ""offer extra assurance to you, your families, friends and community"".â¨ How students can get home for Christmas.
