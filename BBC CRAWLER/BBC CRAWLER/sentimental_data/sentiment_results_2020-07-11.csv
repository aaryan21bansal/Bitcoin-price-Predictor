"This video can not be played Obituary: 'Few have blended courage and charisma quite like Jack Charlton' Jack Charlton, whohas died aged 85,will always be remembered as one of the group of 11 England players who won the World Cup against West Germany in 1966. And yet there was so much more to the rounded, wonderful career of one of football's legendary characters - as a player with Leeds United, manager at club and international level and also as one of the first generation of television pundits, going on to enjoy a long and distinguished career in broadcasting. Playing alongside younger brother Bobby, the Ashington-born centre-half was the late developer who went on to the greatest glory with his country. The man simply known as 'Big Jack', of great football stock as a cousin of Newcastle United legend 'Wor Jackie' Milburn, also won the game's major club honours as part of Don Revie's Leeds United side and was a fine manager with Middlesbrough, Sheffield Wednesday and Newcastle before his wonderful spell in charge of the Republic of Ireland. 'He changed Irish football forever' - tributes paid to Charlton Jack Charlton's Desert Island Discs 'He changed our lives' - former players pay tribute Leeds fans pay tribute Football Daily: 'He was a natural leader' - a tribute to Jack Charlton Charlton's spiky, outspoken nature was allied to a genuine, humorous, honest personality which ensured him iconic status not just as an Englishman but also as an honorary Irishman. The giant Charlton, nicknamed 'the Giraffe' because of his long neck and the stature that made him the scourge of forwards and goalkeepers alike - almost inventing the ploy of standing in front of keepers at corners - had a slow-burning playing career. And rather like his great Leeds central defensive partner Norman Hunter, who alsosadly died recently,his no-nonsense approach often disguised the great ability he had as a footballer. Charlton's career, if not exactly going nowhere, was lacking in direction until he fell under the guidance of Revie, who was able to harness the more maverick nature of his personality with his talent to make him an essential element of a wonderful side, going on to make a record 773 appearances for Leeds over a 23-year period as a player. He also scored 96 goals for the club, making him ninth on their list of all-time scorers. This video can not be played Mark Lawrenson reflects on his time with former manager Jack Charlton with Republic of Ireland Revie brought together a group of young players and experienced hands such as Charlton alongside Hunter, Billy Bremner, Peter Lorimer and shrewd signings such as the veteran Bobby Collins and John Giles, signed from Manchester United for a paltry Â£33,000. After gaining promotion to the former First Division in 1964, Charlton helped Leeds reach the 1965 FA Cup final, where they lost to Liverpool, but success was just around the corner and after another losing final, thebrutal two-game affair against Chelsea in 1970,they finally won the coveted trophy by beating Arsenal in 1972. The Holy Grail, the league title, was won in 1968-69, and there was silverware elsewhere such as the League Cup in 1968 and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (the forerunner of the Uefa Cup and Europa League) in 1967-68 and 1970-71. Charlton was never bound by the usual conventions, making him an even more colourful presence in the game. He once courted trouble with the authorities by revealing he had ""a little black book"" of players he intended to, shall we say, meet again on the pitch, if they had ever crossed him - one of whom was believed to be former Everton hard man Johnny Morrissey, a tough Scouser who even his ruthless team-mate Giles suggested was an adversary best avoided. The great Leeds team, and this was a great team, was somewhat overshadowed by their reputation for a physical approach, and should have won more than the honours that came their way - but his presence ensured Charlton still became one of the most decorated players of his era. Jack Charlton, here playing against brother Bobby, spent his entire 21-year playing career at Leeds, making a joint club record 773 appearances, before retiring as a player in 1973 It was with England, however, that Charlton wrote his name indelibly into the history books. And, like his development at Leeds, his emergence as an international came later in his career. Charlton had turned 29 when he made his England debut in a 2-2 draw with Scotland at Wembley in April 1965. He was so surprised at his call-up he subsequently asked manager Sir Alf Ramsey why he had picked him. Charlton revealed Ramsey's deadpan response was: ""I pick the best team for my pattern of play, Jack - I don't always pick the best players."" It was a team that became champions of the world on 30 July the following year, with one of the enduring images of England's 4-2 win after extra time against West Germany a picture of Charlton sinking to his knees, overcome by emotion, before embracing his tearful brother Bobby. ""People say to me 'was that the most memorable day of your life?' and I say 'not really' because unlike our kid [brother Bobby] and Bobby Moore, I hadn't been with them for years and years aiming for this,"" Charlton told Desert Island Discs in 1996. ""I'd just come in , done it and gone. The most joy as a player was winning the league championship with Leeds at Liverpool."" Charlton, who won the Footballer of the Year award in 1967, went on to win 35 caps for England, the last of which came in a 1-0 win over Czechoslovakia in a group game at the Mexico World Cup in June 1970, aged 35. Following his retirement from playing at Leeds, Charlton was appointed manager of Middlesbrough in May 1973, his character proving more suited to the job than his quieter and more reserved brother, who had an undistinguished spell in charge of Preston North End. Legend has it he declined to be interviewed, simply handing the Middlesbrough board a list of what his responsibilities would be and warning any interference on the playing side would not be tolerated. Charlton was an instant success, winning promotion to the First Division with a top-class Middlesbrough side boasting a host of very fine players such as Graeme Souness, Willie Maddren, David Armstrong and many others. He stayed at Middlesbrough for four years before moving on to Sheffield Wednesday, during which time he took the Owls from the bottom of the old Third Division to promotion, reaching the FA Cup semi-final in 1983, only for defeat to soon be followed by his departure. Charlton had a short spell back at Middlesbrough as caretaker before taking over at Newcastle in June 1984 but it was unproductive and he left in 1985 - before what many consider to be the crowning glory of his managerial career. He had applied for the England job when his old boss Revie resigned in 1976 but never received a reply - instead he was appointed manager of the Republic of Ireland in February 1986. What followed was a glorious thrill ride that provided a thousand tales of Charlton's eccentric approach (although he was perhaps wily enough to use some of that to cover up an incredibly shrewd tactical mind and superb knowledge) and a period of success that still brings a warm glow to Ireland whenever it is recalled. Charlton wore an iconic white cap while managing the Republic of Ireland at the 1994 World Cup Charlton made good use of eligibility rules to build a formidable side with players born outside the Republic of Ireland, such as central defender Mick McCarthy and forwards Tony Cascarino and John Aldridge. The first sign of things to come was delivered at the 1988 European Championship when, despite losing world-class players such as Mark Lawrenson after his retirement through injury, Charlton's side beat Bobby Robson's England 1-0 in a group game. Ireland just failed to make it out of the group but Charlton masterminded a run to the quarter-finals of the Italia '90 World Cup, qualifying from a group that included England and the Netherlands, both games drawn 1-1, before a win on penalties over Romania and then a narrow 1-0 defeat against hosts Italy in the last eight.

Charlton guided his team to the last 16 at the next World Cup in the United States four years later, including a win over eventual finalists Italy in the group, before losing to the Netherlands. He was also awarded the freedom of the city of Dublin that year. He was awarded honorary Irish citizenship two years later. And it was the Netherlands who brought the curtain down on his time in charge when they beat the Republic of Ireland 2-0 at Anfield in a play-off to reach Euro '96. If the art of management is to extract the maximum from the players at your disposal, Charlton and his trusted lieutenant Maurice Setters did that and more with Ireland. Charlton had also built a career as a skilled pundit, starting as a member of ITV's revolutionary World Cup 'panel' in 1974, and the recent revisiting of Euro '96 demonstrated his charismatic style as a standout analyst. For a career that came late to prominence, Charlton lived the fullest of football lives and is guaranteed his place in the game's Hall of Fame.

"Cabinet Minister Michael Gove has defended his plans for new post-Brexit border infrastructure after Labour said the government was unprepared. A Â£705m funding package to help manage Britain's borders has been announced as the UK prepares to leave the EU customs union at the end of the year. Mr Gove insisted the government had been ""laying the groundwork for months"". But Labour's Rachel Reeves said the plans were ""too little, too late."" The funding announcement follows a leaked letter from International Trade Secretary Liz Truss raising concerns about the readiness of Britain's ports. Under the plans, new border posts will be created inland where existing ports have no room to expand to cope with the extra checks that will be required. It relates only to the external borders of England, Scotland and Wales. Mr Gove told BBC's Andrew Marr programme that more details will be set out about the situation for Northern Ireland ""later this month"". A really simple guide to Brexit What are the sticking points in the trade talks? 'Injection of momentum' needed in Brexit talks The new funding will include up to Â£470m to build port and inland infrastructure, and Â£235m will be allocated for IT systems and staffing. The money for IT and staffing includes: Â£100m to develop HM Revenue and Customs systems to reduce the burden on traders Â£20m on new equipment Â£15m towards building new data infrastructure to improve border flow and management Â£10m to recruit around 500 more Border Force staff. Cabinet Office Minister Mr Gove said the funding would help the UK ""seize the opportunities"" post-Brexit. The UK left the EU on 31 January and is now in an 11-month transition period, during which existing trading rules and membership of the customs union and single market apply. What the UK's relationship with the EU will look like when the transition period ends will depend on whether a trade deal is reached. Northern Ireland will continue to follow some EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods even after the transition period. Customs checks on EU goodswill be delayed until July 2021. This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake breaks down the next round of Brexit negotiations A leaked letter, firstreported by Business Insider,external, suggested Ms Truss had expressed concerns about the government's plans to phase in checks on EU goods coming into the UK after the Brexit transition period. Ms Truss reportedly warned fellow ministers that failing to impose full border controls until July could see increased smuggling from the EU, lead to legal challenges at the World Trade Organization, and even weaken the union with Northern Ireland. Post-Brexit checks on EU imports to be phased in What is the transition period? Mr Gove said: ""With or without further agreement with the EU, this Â£705m will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world's most effective and secure border."" Former national security adviser Lord Rickettsresponded on Twitter to Mr Gove's comments.,external""It's not clear to me how we will have 'the world's most effective and secure border' (Mr Gove) when we will lose access on 1 Jan to the Schengen Information System which gives alerts on movement of criminals/suspects,"" he said. He added that UK police and border staff consulted the shared Schengen system 600 million times last year. Former director general of UK Border Force Tony Smith said the funding was ""obviously welcome"" but ""a bit late in coming"". A Welsh Government spokesman said the plan showed the ""sheer complexity of the new bureaucracy"" which businesses face from 1 January and said it had been in discussions with the UK government as various sectors in Wales were affected. This video can not be played The customs union explained in 45 seconds Asked about reportsthe government had bought land in Kentto build a large lorry park as part of preparations for post-Brexit border checks, Mr Gove said: ""It is not our intention to create a massive concrete lorry park, it is the intention to provide the smart infrastructure which in Kent and elsewhere will allow the freight to flow."" Labour shadow minister Rachel Reeves said the measures were ""too little, too late"" and accused the government of being unprepared. And on the Brexit talks she said: ""We were promised an oven-ready deal but it looks like the government forgot to turn the oven on,"" referring to the Conservative Party's election slogan. The new Irish Taoiseach, MicheÃ¡l Martin, told the BBC's Andrew Marr that his country does not yet have all the information it needs about the Irish sea border arrangements. ""We do need more details, we need more precision,"" he said. ""I think we need an injection of momentum into the overall talks between the European Union and United Kingdom in relation to Brexit."" He said although he believes progress towards a trade deal has been slow, he added: ""I believe that if there's a will there's a way in terms of resolving outstanding issues."" ""I think there will be a deal, there has to be a deal,"" he said, but added: It can't be at any price."" Mr Gove said there had been ""movement"" in the negotiations but acknowledged that ""differences"" remained. Both sides agreed to ""intensify"" negotiations last month and held the first face-to-face talks since the coronavirus pandemic at the beginning of July. The UK government has ruled out extending the transition period in order to reach a deal. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Gove also said the government will introduce a migration policy ""that ensures we're open to the world's best talent"". The governmentis planning a points-based immigration systemwhich treats EU migrants the same as those from the rest of the world and which takes different factors like skills and language into account when awarding visas allowing people to work in the UK. Mr Gove said: ""And the new technology we're introducing will allow us to monitor with far greater precision exactly who, and what, is coming in and out of the country, enabling us to deal more effectively with organised crime and other security threats."" More details about changes to the immigration system will be revealed on Monday. Writing in the Sun on Sunday,,externalHome Secretary Priti Patel said: ""We will scrap the bureaucratic Resident Labour Market Test, lower the skills and salary threshold and remove the cap on skilled workers."" The so-called ""resident labour market test"" only allows companies to recruit new workers from outside the EU if they are on the shortage list or if they have been unable to find anyone suitable after advertising in the UK. ""Our newHealth and Care Visawill ensure the NHS continues to benefit from the outstanding health and care professionals who have kept this country on its feet throughout the pandemic,"" Ms Patel added. And she said ""a new graduate route will ensure international students can stay in the country once they have completed their studies"".

"The Jubilee Pool in Penzance is hoping to reopen at the end of July Operators of outdoor swimming pools have criticised the timing of the government announcement allowing them to reopen. Some have decided not to open, claiming a lack of preparation time has made a shorter summer season ""unviable"". Many are run by community groups or charities and have mounted fundraising efforts in order to survive. The government said ""comprehensive guidance"" was available to leisure operators. As part of theeasing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions, swimmers can visit outdoor pools from Saturday, while indoor gyms, pools and sports facilities can reopen from 25 July. Pool operators have said the announcement came too late to allow them to go through the process of cleaning and filling pools and meeting both water-quality and coronavirus safety standards. This video can not be played Bathers returned to outdoor swimming, as coronavirus restrictions were eased There aremore than 100 outdoor public swimming bathsaround the country - many restored and run by community groups. The volunteer-run Hilsea Lido in Hampshire said on Facebook, ""with a heavy heart"", it would not reopen until 2021. ""With no clear indication of when we would be allowed to open, we were not able to prepare the pool in advance. ""Hilsea Lido is a massive pool and the preparation costs reflect this,"" it said. Shap Lido in Cumbria - England's ""highest heated pool"" - said it would ""not be financially viable"" to open for a six-week summer period, as did Portishead's community lido in Somerset. The lido in Petersfield, Hampshire, takes two weeks to fill and two weeks to heat up Peterborough's lido is among those not reopening this weekend In Berkshire Covid-19 restrictions meant contractors were not been able to complete repair work on Northcroft Lido, which will remain closed as a result. Peterborough's 1930s art deco lido will also not reopen this weekend after its operator wasforced to hand back its council contractdue to financial difficulties during the crisis. Among those planning to open is Lymington Sea Water Baths in Hampshire which dates back to the early 19th Century. Manager Hugo Ambrose said: ""It's certainly not going to be a good, viable year but I do think there's a community we need to work with."" Cornwall's coastal art deco Jubilee Pool in Penzance is hoping to reopen at the end of July. Operations officer Nicola Murdoch said reopening ""isn't possible at 48 hours notice"" and would require a deep clean, staff training and social distancing measures. ""It's fantastic to have the green light, but a little more notice like indoor leisure centres would have been helpful,"" she added. The covers remain on Droitwich Lido which plans to reopen for six weeks this summer Droitwich Lido plans to open in August thanks to a Â£55,000 grant from Wychavon Council. Manager Tim Kirkham said: ""We're in winter mode - we've got a lot of work and power washing to do but I'm sure we can do it. People have been so supportive."" However its usual capacity of 550 swimmers will be reduced to about 100. In London, the 1930s Parliament Hill Lido has introduced online booking for hour-long socially distanced sessions for an ""adjustment to a new way of swimming"". The Department of Media, Culture and Sport said: ""We recognise the importance of reopening our indoor and outdoor pools as swimming is a great way for people of all ages to stay fit and healthy.

"Belgium has singled Leicester out for stricter restrictions after the city was placed in a local lockdown Leicester has joined a handful of European cities to be placed on the Belgian government's ""red-zone"" list. It means anyone arriving in the country who has recently visited Leicester will be told to place themselves in a two-week mandatory quarantine. It is the only UK city to be included in Belgium's list. The other cities are in Portugal or Spain. Leicester was the site of England'sfirst local lockdown on 29 Junefollowing a spike in coronavirus cases. Sir Peter Soulsby, mayor of Leicester, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier there was ""no clear understanding of what will constitute the threshold that needs to be achieved before we can be released from [the local lockdown]"". He spoke out after the government announced the number of coronavirus cases in Leicesterwas going down. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons the seven-day infection rate had dropped from 135 to 117 cases per 100,000 people. But when he was pressed on what level they had to reach to leave the lockdown, Mr Hancock would not commit to a specific number. Signs are due to be erected around Brussels Airport telling arriving passengers to inform the authorities if they have been in Leicester during the lockdown. The Belgian government has also told its own citizens to avoid travelling to the city if possible. Sir Peter was speaking to the Radio 4 Today programme Sir Peter has previously said the government should have shared its data sooner with Leicester City Council about where the cases were in order for the local authority to target affected areas and communities.

"Boris Johnson was wearing a mask as he visited a shop in Uxbridge on Friday MPs have called for the government to clarify its position on face coverings, after the PM said a ""stricter"" approach to their use in England was needed. Senior sources have said the government is considering making face coverings mandatory in shops in England to slow the spread of coronavirus. Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was ""in favour"" of the change, adding a simple public message was key. Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth said ""strong and clear guidance"" was needed. A further 148 deaths were recorded in the UK on Friday, bringing the total number of recorded deaths to 44,798. Face coverings have been compulsory in shopsin Scotland since Friday. Currently people in England are advised to wear a face covering in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is not possible - on top of the mandatory requirement to wear one on public transport and when visiting hospitals. Mr Hunt, chairman of the Commons Health Select Committee, said he understood the current advice but it did not answer the ""basic question"" of whether people needed to wear a face covering when shopping. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think with public health advice in a pandemic, you just need simplicity so I would favour saying we should wear face masks in shops."" Why aren't more of our politicians wearing masks? Who needs to wear a face covering in the UK? Coronavirus: How to make your own face mask It came as Boris Johnson was pictured wearing a face covering for the first time while visiting businesses in his Uxbridge constituency on Friday. The UK government was initially hesitant - in the early days of the coronavirus crisis - about advising people to wear face coverings, arguing the scientific evidence that they reduce transmission was ""weak"". However, rules compelling people to wear face masks on public transport in England were introduced on 15 June. And on Friday Mr Johnson said ""the balance of scientific opinion seems to have shifted more in favour of them than it was, and we're very keen to follow that"". He told a Facebook Q&A with the public: ""I do think we need to be stricter in insisting people wear face coverings in confined spaces where they are meeting people they don't normally meet. ""We are looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings in shops, for instance, where there is a risk of transmission."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said he did not think the evidence on the benefits of wearing facemasks was ""decisive"" yet but said the ""balance is shifting"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Drakeford said the view of the chief medical officer for Wales was still that face coverings should be recommended but not required. However, he said if the weight of evidence changed ""then we will change our policy"". The rules on face coverings vary across the nations. People in Wales are being asked to wear non-medical face coverings where social distancing is not possible. In Northern Ireland, wearing face coverings on public transport became mandatory on 10 July. Mr Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said it was ""welcome"" ministers were looking again at the evidence on face masks. ""We urge ministers to conclude this review rapidly to provide the strong and clear guidance needed,""he wrote on Twitter,external. Tory MP and former cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions she did not want masks to be mandatory but ""people should be considerate of others"" and start to think about carrying one wherever they go. On Friday Boris Johnson urged people to go back to work. He also hinted at a stricter policy on face masks. Lo and behold he was pictured, out and about at a shop and takeaway, wearing a face mask. It doesn't take a detective to spot an overarching theme. Ministers want people to start embracing the new normal; leaving their homes, spending money and helping businesses get back on their feet - but yes with mitigation measures, like masks, in place. Those mitigations are of course there to help suppress transmission but can also play their part in helping people feel confident. Because public confidence is important; you can urge someone to do something but they may well resist unless they feel safe. Homemade cloth face coverings can help reduce the spread of coronavirus from people who are contagious but have no symptoms or are yet to develop symptoms. Professor Trisha Greenhalgh from Oxford University, who argued for widespread use of face coverings in April, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the vast majority of scientists ""are now persuaded by the evidence"" that wearing masks in crowded places can reduce transmission. Asked about the suggestion that face masks benefit others more than the wearer, she said: ""Broadly speaking, if I'm wearing a face covering it might protect you 80% and it might protect me 20% or 30%. ""There is a little bit of protection for the person wearing the face coverings but it's not nearly as much as it protects other people from the droplets coming out of the person's mouth."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? Prof Greenhalgh added: ""Indoor environments are much, much more dangerous in terms of what we call airborne transmission. Someone coughs or speaks loudly and the virus then gets into the air and it stays in that shop or in that indoor space."" The World Health Organization says non-medical face coverings should be worn where social distancing is not possible. 12 March: England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries says it is ""not a good idea"" for the average member of the public to wear a face mask as they may not use it properly and put themselves at more risk of contracting coronavirus 17 April:The transport secretary saysthe evidence on whether masks work is ""quite mixed"" and it is possible wearing them ""could do more harm than good in certain situations"" 1 May:Downing Street says face coverings have a ""weak but positive effect"" in reducing the spread of coronavirus 11 May:People in Englandare advised to wear face coverings on public transport and in enclosed spaceswhere social distancing is not always possible 15 June:Face coveringsare made compulsoryon public transport in England Meanwhile, outdoor pools can now reopen in England and amateur cricket, theatre and other live performances are also allowed outdoors.

"The coronavirus crisis could spark a ""personal debt time bomb"", according to Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS). It has said the number of people unable to manage their debts may climb as the furlough scheme is reduced and job losses increase. A survey for the service shows 27% of respondents were worried about making repayments during the pandemic. Citizens Advice warned the situation could be causing financial hardship and is pushing more people into poverty. It said support schemes during the lockdown have been welcome, but managing the situation as these begin to lift would ""require thoughtful and significant intervention"". CAS financial health spokesman Myles Fitt said: ""The issue is most often a result of insecure or low incomes which are simply not able to keep pace with the cost of living. ""While concerns about unemployment have understandably replaced it for the time being, the issue of personal debt will become a real challenge in the coming months and years. ""An income shock from a job loss or reduced pay, combined with the cost of arrears such as council tax, housing or energy bills built up due to Covid-19 payment holidays, will put individual and household finances under extreme pressure. ""Our fear is that many households will fall into unmanageable debt, causing financial hardship and pushing more people into poverty, or exacerbate existing poverty."" The company which conducted the poll also warned people who are are already struggling financially could be hardest hit. Spokesman Mark Diffley said: ""Overall, a quarter of Scots remain concerned about paying utility bills and paying their rent (24% and 26% respectively), while 20% are concerned about paying for food and essentials and 35% about their income. ""Of additional concern is the finding that, once again, it is apparent that the highest levels of concern are recorded from those in the poorest socio-economic groups who are least likely be able to bear the financial burdens which they are facing as a result of the virus.""

"Belgium has singled Leicester out for stricter restrictions after the city was placed in a local lockdown Leicester has joined a handful of European cities to be placed on the Belgian government's ""red-zone"" list. It means anyone arriving in the country who has recently visited Leicester will be told to place themselves in a two-week mandatory quarantine. It is the only UK city to be included in Belgium's list. The other cities are in Portugal or Spain. Leicester was the site of England'sfirst local lockdown on 29 Junefollowing a spike in coronavirus cases. Sir Peter Soulsby, mayor of Leicester, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier there was ""no clear understanding of what will constitute the threshold that needs to be achieved before we can be released from [the local lockdown]"". He spoke out after the government announced the number of coronavirus cases in Leicesterwas going down. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons the seven-day infection rate had dropped from 135 to 117 cases per 100,000 people. But when he was pressed on what level they had to reach to leave the lockdown, Mr Hancock would not commit to a specific number. Signs are due to be erected around Brussels Airport telling arriving passengers to inform the authorities if they have been in Leicester during the lockdown. The Belgian government has also told its own citizens to avoid travelling to the city if possible. Sir Peter was speaking to the Radio 4 Today programme Sir Peter has previously said the government should have shared its data sooner with Leicester City Council about where the cases were in order for the local authority to target affected areas and communities.

A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it prioritised giving detailed local data to public health bodies but was now sharing it with councils.

"Men wearing life vests get ready with their paddle boards as the Bala Adventure and Watersports Centre in Bala, Gwynedd The first minister has said Wales is ""absolutely safe"" to visit again after he defended not opening tourism sooner. From Saturday some holiday homeshave reopened for the first time since lockdown began. But with pubs still unable to open, the Welsh Conservatives have accused the Welsh Government of putting jobs at risk. Mark Drakeford, on a visit to the Vale of Glamorgan, said a ""step by step"" approach was right to lifting lockdown. In England,all hotels, B&Bs and campsites have been allowed to reopen since 4 July,external, with cleaning of shared spaces. In Wales, only self contained accommodation, with no shared facilities, such as kitchens and bathrooms, are currently able to open. From Monday, Welsh pubs and restaurants with outdoor spaces, will be able to welcome back customers outdoors for the first time. Holiday homes in Wales reopen after lockdown Your travel questions answered Campsites, beauty salons and cinemas get reopening dates But many businesses have said they will not be opening, saying it will not be viable due to the two-metre (6ft) social distancing rule, which remains in place in Wales. Mark Drakeford visited The Hide in St Donats, in the Vale of Glamorgan Shoppers were out in Cardiff as restrictions ease a little further in Wales Mr Drakeford said easing restrictions had to be done ""step by step"" and he thought there would be a ""gradual build-up"" of people wanting to holiday in Wales and go to pubs, restaurants and cafes. During a visit to The Hide in St Donats, Mr Drakeford said the crisis ""has had a profound impact on the visitor economy"" and a phased approach to reopening tourism would give businesses, staff visitors and communities the confidence for a successful reopening. ""My message to people thinking of making a visit inside Wales or to Wales, is that Wales is open, the tourism industry is beginning again,"" he said. ""Visit Wales and visit Wales safely. Walkers enjoy the fine day and the lockdown restrictions being eased with a stroll in the Brecon Beacons Cars parked near the foot of Pen y Fan as people make the most of the lockdown restriction easing ""The virus hasn't gone away, we still need to do all the things we know. A social distance, hand washing, all those careful things. ""But the virus in Wales is now at a very low ebb of circulation. It's absolutely safe to be here, but you can play your part as well."" Mr Drakeford said he was ""looking forward"" to going on holiday to Pembrokeshire when he had a chance, and people could help keep others safe by avoiding crowded areas. Social distancing in operation on Llandudno pier on Saturday The first weekend of the restrictions being eased and people enjoyed a paddle in Porthcawl But with many hotels in Wales still closed due to restrictions, Welsh Conservative MP David Jones accused the Welsh Government of being behind the UK government in making decisions. The Clwyd West MP wrote on twitter: ""Sadly the tourist season in Wales didn't begin four weeks after England"". Member of the Senedd, Janet Finch-Saunders, said it was not right that pubs and restaurants in Wales had to wait until 3 August before they could allow customers back inside. Mrs Finch-Saunders said with many not having outdoor spaces, or enough room for customers, the first minister's ""uneven"" proposals would have a ""disastrous impact"" on Welsh jobs. Meanwhile, Mr Drakeford said the ""balance is shifting"" on evidence for the use of face masks. The car park at Pen y Pass as Snowdonia National Park is reopened for its first weekend since restrictions were eased Walkers returned to parts of Snowdonia National Park on Saturday But he doesn't yet believe it is ""sensible"" to make use of them mandatory in certain situations. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Drakeford said the view of the Wales's chief medical officer was still that face coverings should be recommended but not required. ""When the weight of evidence changes, if it does, then we will change our policy."" In Wales, face coverings are recommended in situations where people cannot socially distance, like on public transport. But their use is not mandatory - and both the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru are calling for face coverings to be compulsory on public transport and in shops, as is the case in Scotland. Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid health spokesman said ""every possible measure to help us leave lockdown safely should be adopted and we have consistently called for the use of face masks in public spaces where social distancing is difficult"".

"Boris Johnson was wearing a mask as he visited a shop in Uxbridge on Friday MPs have called for the government to clarify its position on face coverings, after the PM said a ""stricter"" approach to their use in England was needed. Senior sources have said the government is considering making face coverings mandatory in shops in England to slow the spread of coronavirus. Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was ""in favour"" of the change, adding a simple public message was key. Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth said ""strong and clear guidance"" was needed. A further 148 deaths were recorded in the UK on Friday, bringing the total number of recorded deaths to 44,798. Face coverings have been compulsory in shopsin Scotland since Friday. Currently people in England are advised to wear a face covering in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is not possible - on top of the mandatory requirement to wear one on public transport and when visiting hospitals. Mr Hunt, chairman of the Commons Health Select Committee, said he understood the current advice but it did not answer the ""basic question"" of whether people needed to wear a face covering when shopping. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think with public health advice in a pandemic, you just need simplicity so I would favour saying we should wear face masks in shops."" Why aren't more of our politicians wearing masks? Who needs to wear a face covering in the UK? Coronavirus: How to make your own face mask It came as Boris Johnson was pictured wearing a face covering for the first time while visiting businesses in his Uxbridge constituency on Friday. The UK government was initially hesitant - in the early days of the coronavirus crisis - about advising people to wear face coverings, arguing the scientific evidence that they reduce transmission was ""weak"". However, rules compelling people to wear face masks on public transport in England were introduced on 15 June. And on Friday Mr Johnson said ""the balance of scientific opinion seems to have shifted more in favour of them than it was, and we're very keen to follow that"". He told a Facebook Q&A with the public: ""I do think we need to be stricter in insisting people wear face coverings in confined spaces where they are meeting people they don't normally meet. ""We are looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings in shops, for instance, where there is a risk of transmission."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said he did not think the evidence on the benefits of wearing facemasks was ""decisive"" yet but said the ""balance is shifting"".

However, he said if the weight of evidence changed ""then we will change our policy"". The rules on face coverings vary across the nations.

"Michail Antonio is the first West Ham player to score four goals in a top-flight match since David Cross in 1981 Norwich City became the first club to be relegated from the Premier League this season as Michail Antonio scored all four goals to ease West Ham's troubles near the bottom of the table. A seventh successive league defeat left Daniel Farke's side anchored at the foot of the table, 13 points from safety with only three games to play. Having struggled to adapt since winning the Championship last season, Norwich's third relegation in seven seasons was sealed by Antonio's superb performance in front of goal. The forward volleyed the first from inside the six-yard area after Issa Diop's flick from a corner before using his head to guide Mark Noble's free-kick beyond Tim Krul. Hammers skipper Noble also provided the ball over the top for Antonio's hat-trick. Krul saved his initial shot but it fell invitingly for the West Ham player to head over the line. His fourth was a tap-in from Ryan Fredericks' pass. West Ham's first Premier League away win under David Moyes lifts them six points above the relegation zone, with two of their remaining three matches at home to fellow strugglers Watford and Aston Villa. Norwich's dreadful form since the Premier League resumed after being suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic meant it was a matter of when - not if - they would be relegated Their 24th league defeat came after an abject performance, the Canaries failing to score for a league-high 17th game this season. Argentine midfielder Emiliano Buendia tested Lukasz Fabianski while Teemu Pukki, who has not scored since netting his 11th league goal of the season on 22 January, headed a good chance wide. 'The outcome is more or less what was expected' - Farke has no regrets after relegation Reaction from Carrow Road as Norwich City are relegated There were emotional scenes at Carrow Road when referee Kevin Friend signalled the end of the match. A number of Norwich players dropped to the ground while boss Farke consoled his team. Having spent the majority of this prolonged campaign in the bottom three, the end of the season cannot come soon enough. This video can not be played Norwich boss Daniel Farke 'expected' relegation The Canaries depart England's top flight having caused one of the biggest shocks of the season, a3-2 win over defending champions Manchester City, while Farke's side also held Arsenal and Tottenham at home, and won at Everton. WhenJamal Lewis hit the winneragainst Champions League hopefuls Leicester on 28 February, shortly before the season was suspended, Norwich were just four points from safety with 10 games remaining. But they have been woeful since the restart, losing all six league games by an aggregate score of 15-1. Farke opted to keep the core of last season's team that finished with five more points than Sheffield United on the way to winning the Championship in impressive style. Nine of the 11 players that started against West Ham also started the final Championship game of last season against Villa. While Villa spent more than Â£100m after winning promotion via the play-offs, Norwich spent a fraction of that sum, with Â£750,000 for West Ham right-back Sam Byram one of their biggest outlays. They have managed just five clean sheets and scored only seven times away from Carrow Road. With two of their three remaining games at third-placed Chelsea and second-placed Manchester City, they are on course to finish the season with the fewest away goals in the Premier League era. Fewest away goals in a season Season Team Goals 2019-20 Norwich City 7 1995-96 Middlesbrough 8 1998-99 Southampton 8 2006-07 Sheffield United 8 2007-08 Derby County 8 Farke insists Norwichwill not do anything ""crazy"",externalin the transfer market as they look to bounce back in 2020-21 - but there are some important decisions to be made. The former Borussia Dortmund reserve-team boss has a contract until 2022 and is keen to stay and rebuild a team capable of making an immediate return to the Premier League. Whether Farke will be in charge after a dreadful run of form remains to be seen, while Norwich's hierarchy has some tough decisions to make concerning the future of the club's playing assets. In November 2019, the Canaries announcedlosses of Â£38m,externalfor the financial year ending June 2019 before senior staff forecast a profit in the region of Â£16m for 2019-20. That was before the season was suspended, Norwich warning in April that they couldlose up to Â£35mbecause of the coronavirus pandemic. It may prompt Norwich to cash in on highly-rated young players like Ben Godfrey and Todd Cantwell, although Farke stated on the eve of the West Ham game: ""If we want to bounce back next season it is important we keep our best players to be competitive."" Defender Godfrey, 22, has been linked with German teamsBorussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig,,externalwhileSheffield United,externalare reported to be interested in 22-year-old midfielder Cantwell. This video can not be played Moyes pleased with West Ham's 'big win' This was a huge win for West Ham - and not just in terms of the score. Having started the game three points above the relegation zone, they have created some breathing space before the last three games of the season - and left Bournemouth and Aston Villa in big trouble. The Hammers had failed to win any of their previous seven away league games under Moyes - but they made up for it as they claimed their biggest away win in the Premier League since November 2007. In addition to scoring the first hat-trick of his professional career, Antonio became the first West Ham player to score four goals in a league match since David Cross against Tottenham in September 1981. Since the restart, Antonio has been involved in 78% of West Ham's Premier League goals, scoring six and assisting one - form Moyes will hope he can continue to the end of the season. Michail Antonio destroyed Norwich with a devastating performance in front of goal Norwich have been relegated from the Premier League for a record fifth time. West Ham picked up their first away win in the Premier League since December (1-0 v Southampton), ending a run of eight games on the road without a win (D1 L7). Norwich have lost 24 Premier League games this season - in no league season in their history have they ever lost more. The Canaries have conceded 17 goals from set-piece situations in the Premier League this season (excluding penalties), more than any other side. While Norwich are back in action on Tuesday at Chelsea (20:15 BST), West Ham host fellow strugglers Watford next Friday (20:00 BST).

"I missed an appointment the other day because it took me 10 minutes to figure out how to leave Broadcasting House. My place of work has changed a bit since I last set foot in W1A pre-lockdown. A one-way system has been introduced to allow for social distancing, which is a good idea. That the job was given to a brilliant escape-room game designer is evidence that someone, somewhere has a mischievous sense of humour. Still, better get used to it. One-way is the new way nowadays. Supermarkets, coffee shops, and now arts venues have all gone down the same one-way street. The National Gallery in London was the first of the major national museums to reopen to the public on Wednesday, offering a lockdown-easing visitor experience that is markedly different from the pre-pandemic wander-at-will affair. It is still free to see its collection of world-class paintings but tickets have to be booked online for a specific day and time. Once in the gallery you are encouraged to wear a face covering, use the hand sanitiser stations, and choose from one of three prescribed one-way routes: A, B or C (you can do them all if you want). To help maintain social distancing, the National Gallery has devised a strict one-way system with three routes Each trail takes around 30 minutes and features hundreds of stunning paintings. All three options are something of a smorgasbord of styles and epochs, but broadly speaking route A focuses on Italian paintings, route B is more Flemish and Dutch, and C is German and British. There are way-finding arrows on the floor which double-up as two-metre markers for social distancing. They work well on the whole, but become a little confusing when the B and C routes converge. I was whisked off in the direction of Lucas Cranach the Elder's mean-mouthed masterpieces when I'd set my sights on the swirling Baroque of Peter Paul Rubens. Adam and Eve, 1526 by Lucas Cranach the Elder is on route C Aurora abducting Cephalus (1636-37) by Rubens is on route B As wrong turnings go, that's hardly a disaster. But you can't rectify your mistake. The defined routes are like motorways, once you're on one you have to go with the flow until the next exit, which in this case, istheexit. That said, there are plenty of visor-wearing gallery assistants to ask for directions. They are very helpful as long as you don't try to swim against the tide; if you do they'll read you the riot act (moon walking won't fool them, I tried). Fair enough. The safety of visitors and staff alike is paramount, and with levels of anxiety running high, the gallery can't afford to have people going off-piste. The digressive pleasures of gallery-going have gone, for the time being at least. The new normal is the curated walking tour, which, it turns out, has a lot going for it. It is helpful, for instance, if you're not a regular at the National Gallery, which can be overwhelming: which way should you turn, what should you see? Now, you can't go wrong, each of the three routes serves up room after room of exquisite paintings, contextualised within their period and style. Take your pick: do you fancy a gallery full of Rembrandts or one chock-a-block with Holbein's (my advice, go around twice, see them both). The Ambassadors (also known as Jean de Dinteville and Georges de Selve), 1533 by Hans Holbein the Younger is on route C Route A is the shortest and has fewest pictures, and conveniently takes you back to the starting point for all three options, unlike B and C which both finish with the Impressionists and a five-minute hike back to the beginning if you want to try another option. It also features some wonderful pictures including Leonardo da Vinci's Virgin of the Rocks, Jan van Eyck's The Arnolfini Portrait, and Piero della Francesca's The Baptism of Christ, which is one of the most exceptional paintings you will ever set eyes upon. The Virgin of the Rocks (1491 - 1508) by Leonardo da Vinci is on route A Route B is just as good. Not only has it the aforementioned rooms dedicated to Rubens and Rembrandt (including the splendid A Woman bathing in a Stream, and a very late, very moving self-portrait), but also VelÃ¡zquez's The Toilet of Venus, Seurat's magnificent Bathers at AsniÃ¨res, and Caravaggio's Supper at Emmaus. A Woman bathing in a Stream (perhaps Hendrickje Stoffels), 1654 by Rembrandt is on route B Bathers at AsniÃ¨res, 1884 by Georges Seurat is on route B Does that mean Route C is the weakest link? Absolutely not. It has Turner's The Fighting Temeraire, Constable's The Hay Wain, and Joseph Wright of Derby's An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump. And that's just a few of the Britons. Elsewhere, you'll also see Van Gogh's A Wheatfield with Cypresses, Holbein's The Ambassadors, and Bruegel's Christ and the Woman taken in Adultery. JMW Turner's breathtaking painting The Fighting Temeraire is on route C A visor-wearing National Gallery assistant looking at Vincent van Gogh's A Wheatfield, with Cypresses, 1889, which is on route C It's like a feast of all your favourite dishes, served at once, leaving you with no choice other than to gorge yourself until you can't take any more. Maybe it is too much, but it's difficult to see what more the National Gallery could do in the current circumstances. It has clearly thought long and hard about how to best display its collection in a manner that will give the greatest access to its greatest pictures, while also giving confidence to the public visiting at a time when Covid-19 still lurks ominously like the black spot of syphilis in Hogarth's famous moralising satire Marriage A-la-Mode (route C). Marriage A-la-Mode: The Inspection is the third in a series of six satirical works by Hogarth, which shows the terrible consequences of marrying for money rather than love I was just happy to be back among one of the finest fine art collections in the world, and grateful to all of those who have made it possible. It felt safe enough, and the few small teething problems are insignificant compared to the show that has been put on in such a challenging climate. Welcome back the National Gallery.

"Estimates suggested up to 40,000 people took part Thousands of people have taken part in protests in Russia's far east over the arrest of a regional leader. They marched to the regional government in Khabarovsk shouting slogans against President Vladimir Putin. Khabarovsk governor Sergei Furgal was detained on Thursday, accused of having ordered the killing of several business people 15 years ago. Mr Furgal defeated the candidate of Mr Putin's United Russia party in elections two years ago. His party, the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrat Party of Russia, is usually seen as loyal to the Kremlin. But correspondents say Mr Furgal's victory was seen as a blow to United Russia's grip on power in the regions, and he is a popular figure in the far east. Sergei Furgal was remanded in custody on Friday Estimates by regional media and opposition put the number of demonstrators at between 5,000 and 40,000, in a city of about 600,000 inhabitants.

Summer Statement: Key points at a glance UK economy hit by worst contraction in 41 years Stamp duty holiday: The winners and the losers The UK economy shrank by 2.2% during the first three months of this year, according to official figures - the joint-largest quarterly fall since 1979. And the Office for National Statistics' data for April show a monthly fall of 20.4% - by far the biggest on record. In a pre-recorded speech for the Durham Miners' Gala, the annual labour movement and trade union celebration which  takes place online on Saturday, Ms Rayner spoke of her fears that the government might use the downturn to justify a policy of ""managed decline"" for northern England. She said: ""The north-south divide is continuing to grow and we cannot afford for the economic impact of coronavirus to increase this gap even more. ""The Tories talk a good game on this issue but their record of turning their backs on the North speaks for itself."" In his summer statement this week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a temporary holiday on stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of all property sales in England to reinvigorate the property market. Ms Rayner, citing research by the Resolution Foundation think tank, said this would not help the average homebuyer in north-east England, while the average buyer in London would save Â£14,200. She added that the large rises in unemployment seen in former industrial areas of the North during the 1980s should not be allowed to happen again. Labour is keen to regain many former safe seats across northern England and the Midlands - once known as the ""red wall"" - that it lost in December's landslide general election victory for Boris Johnson. Last month, the prime minister said his plans would ensure ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" and that there would be no return to austerity during the coronavirus downturn.

"Andrzej Duda (L) is facing Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski Poland's presidential election on Sunday will be crucial in shaping the country's future and its strained relations with the EU for at least the next three years and perhaps beyond. If the incumbent President Andrzej Duda is re-elected for another five-year term, his allies, the nationalist Law and Justice-led government will continue their socially conservative policies, efforts to control independent institutions and generous state handout programme. If the more liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafal Trzaskowski, wins, he has said he will stand up for minorities and use the president's right to veto legislation to block what he sees as the government's attempts to politicise the judiciary and attack democratic values. Mr Trzaskowski says he will co-operate with the government but a victory for him would almost certainly start a war between the two branches of power. Both men have distinct visions for the future of Poland. President Duda, 48, is a lawyer by training. He won a surprising victory in 2015 representing the young, moderate face of the Law and Justice party, which had lost a string of elections under all powerful party leader and candidate, Jaroslaw Kaczynski. He is a socially conservative Roman Catholic, who says he wants to defend the traditional family model. The socially conservative Mr Duda has a lot of support in small towns and villages On the one hand, he supports the government's popular and generous welfare scheme, symbolised by the 500+ programme, under which families receive 500 zloty (Â£100; â¬110; $125) per month for each child until the age of 18. Many Polish families have been lifted out of poverty as a result of the government's policies, and, for the first time since the end of communism in 1989, feel there is a party that cares about their needs. This is especially true in villages and small towns, where President Duda won an absolute majority of votes in the first round of the election two weeks ago. On the other hand, he has vowed to protect Polish families from whathe calls an imported ""LGBT ideology""that is aggressively trying to sexualise Polish children. This video can not be played Poland has been called the worst country in the EU for LGBT rights In practice, sex education classes in Polish state schools do not exist. Instead students have more wide-ranging ""family life education"" classes, which may include sex education, often led by priests or nuns. Polish court bans 'LGBT-free zone' sticker The leader who sees gay rights as a threat to Poland President Duda is also a supporter of the government's legislative changes to take greater control over independent institutions, most prominently the public media and judiciary. This video can not be played Presidential adviser Andrzej Zybertowicz says Mr Duda is opposed to discrimination Poland's public broadcaster, Polish TV, is funded by the taxpayer and is bound by its charter to present balanced coverage of political events. Instead, its main evening news bulletin praises the government and Mr Duda daily and attacks Mr Trzaskowski, accusing him of being in cahoots with Jewish and LGBT interest groups. Mr Duda supports greater government control over the media Mr Duda has also strongly backed most of the government's changes to the judiciary that the EU and multiple international organisations say have undermined its independence and the rule of law. Poland becoming an authoritarian state - top judge Supreme Court warns Poland may have to leave EU Relations with the EU have been strained as a result and Mr Duda once called it an ""imaginary community from which we don't gain much"". Under the current budget, Poland is the biggest net recipient of EU funds. Mr Trzaskowski, also 48, is a deputy leader of Poland's centre-right Civic Platform party, which governed Poland between 2007-2015, mostly under Donald Tusk before he was elected to head the European Council. His party has always performed best in large metropolitan cities. Mr Trzaskowski is pro-EU and has support in Poland's major cities In the first round, he won 30.46% of the vote to Mr Duda's 43.5%, scoring his biggest victory in the affluent Warsaw district of Wilanow. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Trzaskowski acknowledged that some members of the government he was a minister in had at times been a ""bit patronising"" towards voters. Although he's economically liberal, he said Law and Justice had correctly identified income inequality as a problem that needed to be addressed with programmes like 500+, a policy he says he supports. He represents the more liberal wing of the party, and, as Warsaw mayor, has taken part in LGBTQ Equality marches and proposed introducing classes in the capital's schools to counteract bullying against minorities. However, he said recently he opposed the adoption of children by same sex couples, which most Poles do according to surveys, after President Duda tabled an amendment to the country's constitution to expressly forbid it. This video can not be played Polish democracy is 'under attack' As president, Mr Trzaskowski's power would mostly be limited to vetoing legislation as any bills he presents himself could be rejected by the governing camp's majority in parliament. He told the BBC that Poland was still democratic but its ""democracy is under attack"" as the government was politicising independent institutions, such as the judiciary, and trying to strip local government of its powers. He said he would veto further attempts to politicise the courts and propose making the office of prosecutor general independent once again. Why Poles want more of this man's populist message Poland broke EU law by cut to judge retirement age Poland must suspend judge discipline panel â ECJ Under the current government the justice minister is also prosecutor general, giving him extraordinary power over the conduct of prosecutions. As a former Europe minister, Mr Trzaskowski says he wants Poland to take a more active role in the EU negotiations. He worries that once the financial benefit of membership is reduced in future, the current government's antipathy to some aspects of the European project could eventually lead to Poland leaving the EU.

"Boris Johnson was wearing a mask as he visited a shop in Uxbridge on Friday MPs have called for the government to clarify its position on face coverings, after the PM said a ""stricter"" approach to their use in England was needed. Senior sources have said the government is considering making face coverings mandatory in shops in England to slow the spread of coronavirus. Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was ""in favour"" of the change, adding a simple public message was key. Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth said ""strong and clear guidance"" was needed. A further 148 deaths were recorded in the UK on Friday, bringing the total number of recorded deaths to 44,798. Face coverings have been compulsory in shopsin Scotland since Friday. Currently people in England are advised to wear a face covering in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is not possible - on top of the mandatory requirement to wear one on public transport and when visiting hospitals. Mr Hunt, chairman of the Commons Health Select Committee, said he understood the current advice but it did not answer the ""basic question"" of whether people needed to wear a face covering when shopping. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think with public health advice in a pandemic, you just need simplicity so I would favour saying we should wear face masks in shops."" Why aren't more of our politicians wearing masks? Who needs to wear a face covering in the UK? Coronavirus: How to make your own face mask It came as Boris Johnson was pictured wearing a face covering for the first time while visiting businesses in his Uxbridge constituency on Friday. The UK government was initially hesitant - in the early days of the coronavirus crisis - about advising people to wear face coverings, arguing the scientific evidence that they reduce transmission was ""weak"". However, rules compelling people to wear face masks on public transport in England were introduced on 15 June. And on Friday Mr Johnson said ""the balance of scientific opinion seems to have shifted more in favour of them than it was, and we're very keen to follow that"". He told a Facebook Q&A with the public: ""I do think we need to be stricter in insisting people wear face coverings in confined spaces where they are meeting people they don't normally meet. ""We are looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings in shops, for instance, where there is a risk of transmission."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said he did not think the evidence on the benefits of wearing facemasks was ""decisive"" yet but said the ""balance is shifting"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Drakeford said the view of the chief medical officer for Wales was still that face coverings should be recommended but not required. However, he said if the weight of evidence changed ""then we will change our policy"". The rules on face coverings vary across the nations. People in Wales are being asked to wear non-medical face coverings where social distancing is not possible. In Northern Ireland, wearing face coverings on public transport became mandatory on 10 July. Mr Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said it was ""welcome"" ministers were looking again at the evidence on face masks. ""We urge ministers to conclude this review rapidly to provide the strong and clear guidance needed,""he wrote on Twitter,external. Tory MP and former cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions she did not want masks to be mandatory but ""people should be considerate of others"" and start to think about carrying one wherever they go. On Friday Boris Johnson urged people to go back to work. He also hinted at a stricter policy on face masks. Lo and behold he was pictured, out and about at a shop and takeaway, wearing a face mask. It doesn't take a detective to spot an overarching theme. Ministers want people to start embracing the new normal; leaving their homes, spending money and helping businesses get back on their feet - but yes with mitigation measures, like masks, in place. Those mitigations are of course there to help suppress transmission but can also play their part in helping people feel confident. Because public confidence is important; you can urge someone to do something but they may well resist unless they feel safe. Homemade cloth face coverings can help reduce the spread of coronavirus from people who are contagious but have no symptoms or are yet to develop symptoms. Professor Trisha Greenhalgh from Oxford University, who argued for widespread use of face coverings in April, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the vast majority of scientists ""are now persuaded by the evidence"" that wearing masks in crowded places can reduce transmission. Asked about the suggestion that face masks benefit others more than the wearer, she said: ""Broadly speaking, if I'm wearing a face covering it might protect you 80% and it might protect me 20% or 30%. ""There is a little bit of protection for the person wearing the face coverings but it's not nearly as much as it protects other people from the droplets coming out of the person's mouth."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? TWO METRES:Could less than 2m work? Prof Greenhalgh added: ""Indoor environments are much, much more dangerous in terms of what we call airborne transmission. Someone coughs or speaks loudly and the virus then gets into the air and it stays in that shop or in that indoor space."" The World Health Organization says non-medical face coverings should be worn where social distancing is not possible. 12 March: England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries says it is ""not a good idea"" for the average member of the public to wear a face mask as they may not use it properly and put themselves at more risk of contracting coronavirus 17 April:The transport secretary saysthe evidence on whether masks work is ""quite mixed"" and it is possible wearing them ""could do more harm than good in certain situations"" 1 May:Downing Street says face coverings have a ""weak but positive effect"" in reducing the spread of coronavirus 11 May:People in Englandare advised to wear face coverings on public transport and in enclosed spaceswhere social distancing is not always possible 15 June:Face coveringsare made compulsoryon public transport in England Meanwhile, outdoor pools can now reopen in England and amateur cricket, theatre and other live performances are also allowed outdoors. In Wales, holiday accommodation without shared facilitiesis also allowed to reopen from Saturday.
