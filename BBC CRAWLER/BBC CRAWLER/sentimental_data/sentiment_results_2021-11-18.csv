"The government has scrapped the Leeds leg of the HS2 high-speed rail lineas part of a package,externalthat ministers promise will transform services. The prime minister said the overhaul would mean faster travel up to 10 years earlier than planned, and said claims of broken promises are ""total rubbish"". The package won support from some business leaders, and anti-HS2 groups. But Boris Johnson faced criticism that he had reneged on investment promises to the Midlands and north of England. Live updates on HS2 announcement What is HS2 and where will it go? Rail plan 'resigns city to second-class service' Doomed estate in limbo after HS2 leg axed The axing of a new East Midlands-Leeds high-speed line, with HS2 trains now to run on existing upgraded routes, and a scaling back of the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project, drew strong condemnation. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson had ""ripped up"" promises he made that HS2 would go all the way to Leeds and that there would be a new NPR line from Manchester to Leeds. ""This was the first test of 'levelling up' and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North. You can't believe a word the Prime Minister says,"" he said. This video can not be played 'We're building in the most efficient possible way' There was also criticism that a significant portion of the Â£96bn pledged as new investment has already been announced, such as Â£360m to improve ticketing. On a visit to a Network Rail logistics hub near Selby, Mr Johnson dismissed the charges of broken promises as ""total rubbish"", insisting the government would deliver on them ""eventually"". ""Of course there are going to be people who always want everything at once. And there are lots of people who are [going to] say, look, what we should do is carve huge new railways through virgin territory, smashing through unspoilt countryside and villages and do it all at once,"" he said. And in a BBC interview later the prime minister said that laying new track through countryside would take decades to complete. Mr Johnson said: ""You can wait decades and dig up virgin countryside and plough through villages, but you have to wait an awful lot longer and it costs an awful lot more. ""I'm afraid that we are going to be building a huge amount of new line but what we're doing is doing it in the most efficient possible way and to bring the maximum possible commuter benefits."" The completion of HS2 from Crewe to Manchester, with new stations at Manchester Airport and Manchester Piccadilly A new high-speed line between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway The delivery of Northern Powerhouse Rail via a new high-speed line between Warrington, Manchester and Marsden in Yorkshire The upgrading or electrification of the existing Midland Main Line, East Coast Main Line and Transpennine Main Line A new mass transit system for Leeds and West Yorkshire Money for a programme of fares and ticketing reform, including contactless pay-as-you-go ticketing in the North and Midlands A study to look at the best way to take HS2 trains to Leeds, including capacity at Leeds Station In addition to the HS2 changes, there is also a scaling back of a new Trans-Pennine rail route between Manchester and Leeds as part of the NPR project to improve links between major northern cities. The route between Leeds and Manchester will now be a combination of new track and enhancements to existing infrastructure. ""We're cutting journey times from Manchester in half from 2 hours 9 min to 1 hour 11 min,"" said Mr Johnson. ""We're also cutting times from Manchester to Leeds from 55 min to 33 min and [creating] a crossrail for the Midlands for the first time."" He added that there would also be a new high-speed line taking the time needed to travel from the West Midlands to East Midlands, from 1 hour 14 min down to 26 min. ""What that means is you will be able to have HS2 trains all the way up to Sheffield, taking half an hour off the time up to Sheffield,"" Mr Johnson stressed. ""You will have a crossrail for the north, a crossrail for the Midlands and then the HS2."" Tory MP Robbie Moore, whose Keighley seat sits close to Bradford, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the plan, which had ""completely short-changed"" his constituents. Bradford had expected to be included on the proposed Leeds to Manchester route and to see a station built to accommodate new trains. ""We are one of the most socially deprived parts of the UK and we must get better transport connectivity,"" Mr Moore said. Revised HS2 plans a betrayal of North, say critics HS2 downgrade met with mixed reaction Residents rejoice as HS2 eastern leg shelved Delivering the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) in the Commons, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs it was an ""ambitious and unparalleled programme"" to overhaul inter-city links across the north and Midlands, and ""speed up the benefits for local areas and serves destinations people most want to reach"". Work has already started on the first phase of HS2, linking London and the West Midlands. The next section will extend the line to Crewe. The final phase was to take HS2 to Manchester and Leeds. A proposed HS2 train Commenting on plans for rail links between the East Midlands to Leeds, Mr Shapps said: ""We'll study how best to take HS2 trains into Leeds as well"". However, that is likely to be via upgrades to existing rail network, a move condemned by MPs and regional business leaders who said a high-speed line was vital to the economic growth of the Midlands and north England. Labour MP Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said: ""Today that promise has been broken, and Leeds and the North have been betrayed."" Andy Bagnall, director general of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: ""While millions of people will benefit from this major investment in boosting connectivity between major cities in the North of England and the Midlands, leaving out key pieces of the jigsaw will inevitably hold back the ability for the railways to power the levelling up agenda and the drive to net zero."" by Katy Austin, BBC transport correspondent The government's argument is that faster delivery at lower cost is now the best approach. It also makes the case for putting cash towards better local services, not just high speed inter-city connections. That won't wash with those who will accept nothing but the original proposals for both HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail - with their full capacity benefits, as well as journey times. They feel a promise is being broken. Bradford is one example of this; a city whose leaders view a new, full high-speed link to both Manchester and Leeds as essential to regeneration. Opponents of HS2 - a controversial project - will see today's news as a relief. Although the door has not been fully closed to the eastern leg being completed at some future date. However, businesses in Yorkshire who hoped HS2 would bring jobs, investment and confidence, albeit not for a while, feel that opportunity has just been diminished. Labour also point out that despite the Â£96bn label, much of this money had already been earmarked for HS2. 'Waste of money' News that part of HS2 was being scrapped was met with ""elation"" by campaigners against the line. Sandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was pleased, ""not only as a resident of Bramley, but as a taxpayer. It's a complete waste of money"". Sandra Haith (far right) has spent years fighting the plans She said: ""The eastern leg costs a lot of money and it basically connects two cities. We can't get on it. We've got all the pain and no gain."" However, business people warned about the economic loss from scrapping the HS2 line. James Greenhalgh, who runs the Flamingos Coffee House, in Leeds, told the BBC it would deter investment in the city. ""We want to encourage other businesses to move up from London, up to Leeds, get people moving around and coming to our city centre. It is really tough, it is stopping businesses from expanding,"" he said. There was praise, though, from business leaders at regional trade body Midlands Connect. Chairman Sir John Peace said: ""Although these plans are different in some respects to what we'd expected, there are a lot of positives in here and lots of things to be excited about - a new high-speed connection between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway, direct links onto HS2 for Derby, Nottingham, and Chesterfield and a commitment to the Midlands Rail Hub.""

"Construction on the HS2 route between London and Birmingham has already started As part of its Integrated Rail Plan, the government has scrapped most of the eastern leg of HS2 as well as plans for a new high-speed line between Leeds and Manchester. Despite this, the government insists that its new rail plan will transform services in the Midlands and northern England, with quicker improvements in speed and capacity. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""total rubbish"" that he had broken promises on delivering a Leeds to Manchester line. In 2019,external, Mr Johnson reaffirmed in a speech that he wanted to deliver Northern Powerhouse Rail: ""I want to be the prime minister who does with Northern Powerhouse Rail what we did for Crossrail in London. ""And today I am going to deliver on my commitment to that vision with a pledge to fund the Leeds to Manchester route."" The government insists it still delivering Northern Powerhouse Rail due to the additional investment. This will be spent, it says, on upgrading existing routes which will cut journey times and increase capacity much sooner than the previous plans. In February 2020, while confirming that HS2 would go ahead, Mr Johnson appeared to hint to MPs that there could be alterations. He said that ""something has to change"" as the HS2 plan at the time would effectively condemn the North ""to get nothing for 20 years"". ""The question is how we can bring a transport revolution to the North sooner,"" he added. However,in February this year,external, Mr Johnson told MPs the project was going ahead: ""I can certainly confirm that we are going to develop the eastern leg as well as the whole of the HS2."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps was also committed to the project six months ago. ""We are going to complete HS2 and include HS2 on the eastern leg to Leeds,""he told an eventrun by the Policy Exchange think tank. Grant Shapps announced the government's rail plans on Thursday After the new plan was announced, Boris Johnson said: ""In virtually every station along the line it's either faster or the same."" The report lists 28 routes,externalwith their new journey times and the journey times that would have been achieved under the old proposals. Of those routes: Five have faster journey times under the new plan Four have the same times Nineteen have worse times Of those 19, five are within 10% so could be described as ""similar"". The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a business pressure group chaired by former chancellor George Osborne, has been looking at the Â£96bn rail investment announced by the government. It estimates the full HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail projects, as previously planned, would have ended up costing about Â£36bn more than the programme set out on Thursday. A big contribution to the savings will come from the difference in cost between the scrapped eastern leg of HS2 to Leeds and the proposed new lines and upgrades proposed for the area. Cheaper options on Northern Powerhouse Rail make up much of the rest. But estimates of costs of big rail projects are notoriously unreliable. When HS2 was first announced, the whole thing was only supposed to cost about Â£33bn. Nonetheless, some might argue it's hard to describe any of the Â£96bn as new money if it's a result of scrapping some rail projects and spending the money on alternatives. In response, the Department for Transport suggested the figures could not be compared because the government was not committed to all of the previous projects in the way that it now has committed to the Â£96bn. It also stressed that the previous plans would have drained money away from other services. Bridget Rosewell from the National Infrastructure Commission told BBC News that going ahead with all the rail project proposals would have cost almost twice as much as the government is spending. She said her organisation had set out some options for these projects and that ""the government has gone for one of the lower ones"". What is HS2 and where will it go? HS2 rail extension to Leeds scrapped Some work has already been done on the stretch of HS2 that has been cancelled. The rail consultant Michael Byng estimates that the work done on that stretch so far will have cost about Â£61m. That is a combination of construction costs, project and design team costs and unforeseen expenses. Higher figures have been reported for this, especially for the cost of buying up property along the eastern leg. But those figures are inflated partly because not all of that stretch has been cancelled and partly because the property bought can be sold again, which should recoup some of the costs.

"The eastern leg eastern leg of the HS2 rail scheme running to Sheffield and Leeds has been axed The government's decision to scale back its rail plans has been branded a ""betrayal"" of northern England. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the eastern leg of HS2 - running from the Midlands to Leeds - had been cut. MPs have also accused the government of breaking promises over Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) - a raft of upgrades and additions to the network. Mr Shapps said the new Integrated Rail Plan would bring benefits much sooner. Boris Johnson doubled down on the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project after he became prime minister, and would later include it as a manifesto promise. In 2019 Mr Johnson pledged ""to fund the Leeds to Manchester route"" and ""turbo-charge the economy"". The government insists it is still delivering NPR through additional investment, and said upgrades to existing routes would cut journey times and increase capacity much sooner than the previous plans. Some have said the new announcement marks a significant shift away from previous plans and recommendations, with politicians and businesses in some northern cities angry at the government's changes. HS2 Leeds link cut amid promise to transform rail What is HS2 and where will it go? The HS2 line was due to be extended from the West Midlands to Leeds. This would have cut journey times between London and Leeds to one hour and 21 minutes. MPs from Yorkshire said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had repeatedly promised that HS2 and a new Leeds-Manchester line going via Bradford as part of NPR would be ""built in full"". However, HS2 will only be built as far as a new East Midlands Parkway station, about six miles south-west of Nottingham. That means London-Leeds journey times will be one hour and 53 minutes, some 32 minutes longer than planned. The government has not ruled out bringing HS2 to Leeds, but no timescale has been given. The dropping of the Leeds to Manchester NPR plan means Bradford will miss out on inclusion along the new line. Ministers have promised upgrades to the existing links between the cities and shorter journey times. Rail plan 'resigns Bradford to second-class service' Labour MP Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said the promise to build the new line to Manchester had been broken ""and Leeds and the North have been betrayed"". Adding to Mr Benn's criticism of the plans was Tory MP Robbie Moore, whose Keighley seat sits close to Bradford. The city had expected to be included on the proposed Leeds to Manchester route and to see a station built to accommodate new trains. Mr Moore said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the new plan, which had ""completely short-changed"" his constituents. ""We are one of the most socially deprived parts of the UK and we must get better transport connectivity,"" he said. ""I still want to see Northern Powerhouse Rail delivered with a main stop in Bradford, so that we can unlock our economic opportunities."" The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA), which represents rail workers, concluded that Bradford would be ""the biggest loser"". It said Bradford had been found to have the worst transport connections of any UK city due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections. A report out earlier this week found the city had the worst connections of any city in the UK, despite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located. Manuel Cortes, the TSSA's general secretary, said the plan showed the government had ""sold out the North with more broken promises"". The government said it would upgrade the Tanspennine Main Line between Manchester, Leeds and York In June, Transport for the North recommended that new lines should be built between Liverpool and Leeds via Manchester and Bradford. A high-speed line will instead be built between Warrington, in Cheshire, and Marsden, on the West Yorkshire border. Existing lines on the remainder of the route between Liverpool and Leeds will be upgraded. Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham described it as ""second best for the North again"". ""What we are hearing today [is] part new line, part upgrades; that isn't what we were promised and that isn't good enough,"" he said. ""I am thinking about everyone living here today, but what about the people's grandchildren and great grandchildren. We are going to saddle them with the wrong railway system for centuries."" In Sheffield and surrounding towns and cities, concerns were raised about damage to the countryside and disturbance of local communities as a result of HS2's construction. The high-speed service will still run to Sheffield, but the announcement it would not go further was cautiously welcomed in some areas. Chris Read, Labour leader of Rotherham Council, which has lobbied against plans to route HS2 through the area, said the U-turn was a ""victory for common sense at last"", but urged ministers to keep their promises on the scale of investment in northern rail services. Doomed South Yorkshire estate in limbo after HS2 leg axed But the new announcement has brought uncertainty in some places, such as the Shimmer estate in Mexborough, near Doncaster. It was due to be demolished to make way for the eastern leg, and many homeowners left when they learned an 60ft (18m) high viaduct was due to be built to carry high-speed lines. After the announcement, local councillor Andy Pickering said those who remained had been ""left in complete limbo"". The Integrated Rail Plan has effectively ""wiped Hull off the mainline rail map"", according to the Labour Party. The city had hoped the plan would include the electrification of the line between Hull and Selby, to improve its connection to the East Coast Mainline and cut journey times to Leeds. Hull's Labour leader, councillor Daren Hale, said it was an ""absolute scandal"" for ministers to say that journey times between Hull and Manchester would improve due to upgrades to the line between Leeds and Manchester. ""Yet again the people of Hull and this area have been overlooked,"" he said. Politicians in Hull are expecting to meet with rail ministers to discuss the announcement and repeat their demands for direct improvements. If life is about comprises then a very big one has just been put upon northern England. It doesn't have the same train commuter culture as south east England because the stations and rail lines aren't there but it does aspire to have something which allows better use of public transport. To level up. Currently it is a land where new trains run on old lines. Yorkshire wanted to be at one end of HS2. A new high speed line across the Pennines has been seriously talked about - arguably promised by Boris Johnson. The compromise is the new connection between Yorkshire and Birmingham will be partially high speed and the new line between West Yorkshire and Manchester will be high speed west of the Pennines. The rest of the existing line via Huddersfield will be upgraded. Journey times will be quicker - and many people will be satisfied with that. Others will be left wondering what could have been. At present, Leeds to Manchester Victoria takes 53 minutes on the fastest service. This will get much better but not before years of engineering work. Journey times cross country from York and the north-east will also improve. There's a pledge to give a large part of urban West Yorkshire a mass transit system. That could finally see trams in Leeds - something talked about for decades. Bradford gets a faster connection to Leeds but is left in the sidings again in trans pennine terms. Â£96bn on the railways is a lot of money - change will be noticeable - but it falls far short of aspirations this government built up.

"A proposed design for a HS2 train Plans to scrap the eastern leg of HS2 in favour of a link that terminates in the East Midlands have met with a mixed reaction in the region. The government's new Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) states the Birmingham to Leeds route will now terminate at East Midlands Parkway, in Nottinghamshire. It also plans to electrify the existing Midlands Mainline and invest about Â£11bn in rail links in the region. While some were relieved at the decision, others were disappointed. Ben Bradley, Conservative MP for Mansfield and the leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, described the proposals to link the East and West Midlands through Leicestershire as ""fantastic"". ""The biggest thing for us in Nottinghamshire is our economic development and jobs creation,"" he said. ""Off the back of this, we are linking disadvantaged communities into huge sites for jobs."" MP Ben Bradley says the new plans will connect Nottinghamshire communities However, Lilian Greenwood, Labour MP for Nottingham South, accused the government of selling the region short and branded the axing of the eastern leg a ""rail betrayal"". She said: ""The [plan] is a huge betrayal of our region and, by spinning this as a good deal, Ben Bradley is simply selling our county and our region short. ""We'll lose out on massively improved connections to Leeds, the North East and Scotland. ""By scrapping the full eastern leg, we won't get the extra capacity needed to create more local rail services and get more freight on rail - and lorries off our roads."" I've been travelling with the Prime Minister this morning. I joined him at Newark for a short hop to Doncaster. He pored over a rail map and pointed out that HS2 is going to be delivered to the East Midlands despite earlier reports of its demise. A multi-billion pound investment which will, however, only take the new line to East Midlands Parkway. He also pledged the long-awaited and long-demanded electrification of the whole Midlands mainline which runs through Leicester and Nottingham to Sheffield. And while HS2 will halt at the Parkway station near East Midlands Airport, the line will continue to Toton and a new rail transport hub will still be built there connecting local services. And it may not be the end of the full eastern leg. That could still happen in the long term. Alex Norris, Labour MP for Nottingham North, added: ""This U-turn will be a blow to our regional and local economies."" Original proposals for the route suggested it would run through communities on the Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire border to a major hub at Toton, connecting the cities of Nottingham and Derby. Under the new plans, the Midlands Mainline will be electrified as far as Sheffield -something rail campaigners have long called for- and Toton will become a mainline station. This will connect to the reopened Maid Marian Line - closed during the 1960s Beeching Cuts - to provide passenger connectivity with places like Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Selston and Pinxton. It comes alongside a commitment to extending the Robin Hood Line out to Edwinstowe and Ollerton. The Local Democracy Reporting Servicesuggests this is a project long campaigned for by politicians including the Government's chief whip and Sherwood MP Mark Spencer. This would connect with the Maid Marian Line in Ashfield to reach the Toton station, and eventually on to HS2 via the light rail connection. Jason Zadrozny, the independent leader of Ashfield District Council, welcomed the Maid Marian Line news but criticised the overall HS2 plans. ""We've always said reopening the Maid Marian Line to passengers was a no-brainer,"" he said. ""With regards to HS2 - it's been the worst kept secret in Nottinghamshire for years that HS2 would not stop at Toton. ""[The government] talks about levelling up, yet this looks like it will further exacerbate issues in Nottinghamshire and put us further behind the rest of the UK."" However Midlands Connect - the government-funded regional transport group - said there were positives in the plans. Chair Sir John Peace said: ""Today's announcement gives businesses and local leaders the reassurance they've been waiting for - that HS2 is coming to the East Midlands. ""Although these plans are different in some respects to what we'd expected, there are a lot of... things to be excited about - a new high speed connection between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway [and] direct links on to HS2 for Derby, Nottingham, and Chesterfield."" He added the delivery of a new station at Toton could start, which would help kickstart regeneration in that area. ""The plans around Toton, the adjacent freeport and the wider Development Corporation could create 84,000 jobs and add billions in value to the regional economy; the developments cover the size of three Olympic Parks,"" he said. He added an upgrade of an East Coast Mainline junction at Newark - also mentioned in the plan - would allow better connectivity with Nottingham, Lincoln and other regional hubs. Geoff Cotton says people's lives have been put on hold Residents in the towns and villages affected by the original HS2 scheme, said they were relieved about its axing. Geoff Cotton, who has lived in Trowell since 1988, would have seen HS2 come past his house. ""Obviously it's pleasing from a selfish point of view, but I do also feel that the way the economy is working at the moment with people working from home more, the need to travel down to London fast isn't as significant as it would have been,"" he said. However, he criticised the amount of time the decision had taken. ""People's lives have been totally put on hold for a long time because nobody is saying what is going to happen,"" he said. ""People haven't been able to move on with their lives because they can't sell their properties."" Jill Sisson, who has lived in Trowell for more than 50 years, would have seen her home demolished. ""I'm quite happy to be staying here,"" she said. ""To have been living with all this pressure is very hard. I don't think it's been handled very well. One minute you're hearing one thing and the next minute you're hearing something else. ""It leaves you up in the air as to what's going to happen. It's all the uncertainty."" Sim Harris, editor of Rail News, said the proposals for the eastern leg of HS2 had always had problems. ""The idea of running the line to the east of Derby and the west of Nottingham meant neither city got a high speed station,"" he said. ""Putting it at Toton was an unfortunate compromise. By the time residents had travelled there, they could have been on their way to London on a regular train."" He viewed the location of East Midlands Parkway as a better choice. ""It will prove a useful east-west corridor and could mean a faster service between Derby, Nottingham and Birmingham,"" he said.

"About 150 British army Royal Engineers will be sent to help reinforce Poland's border with Belarus, the defence secretary has said. The border is seen as an entry point to the EU, and there have been tensions in recent weeks with Belarus being accused of pushing migrants towards it. Ben Wallace said a small reconnaissance team of engineers had already been to the area to assess the situation. They would not be combat troops but ""guys with diggers"", he added. Belarus's long-time authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, denies facilitating the arrival of migrants and sending them towards the border with Poland in revenge forEU sanctions imposed in June. The crisis deepened on Tuesday when Polish forces used tear gas and water cannon to repel those trying to cross into the country. Some attempted to breach a heavily fortified crossing and threw missiles at the Polish forces, leaving several with injuries. Belarus moves migrants stuck in border stand-off Polish forces tear-gas migrants at Belarus border How are migrants getting to the border with Poland? Mr Wallace said the engineers would be dispatched ""within days or weeks"" but said he would first inform parliament about the planned deployment. Speaking to the BBC during a visit to Poland Mr Wallace said: ""What we will do is send some Royal Engineers - that is part of the Army designed for building or making fences or roads or putting in infrastructure. ""We are going to be using that part of our forces to help the Poles and potentially other Baltic states to secure their border."" He stressed the soldiers would not be combat troops but people with ""the ability to build roads and checkpoints and observation posts"", adding: ""This is not combat this is support to the Poles."" On the humanitarian situation, the defence secretary said: ""I'm particularly worried for the women and children and the vulnerable people who are being trafficked by the Belarusians into this game they seem to be playing. ""It's a horrendous thing to do to force migrants to be a tool in a game to try to destabilise their neighbours.""

"People can still go to the pub, a cafÃ© or restaurant without using a Covid pass, the Welsh government says Covid passes may be used over Christmas in order to keep pubs and restaurants open, the Welsh government has said. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said no decision would be made on introducing the pass to the hospitality sector until early December. Mr Drakeford made the comments as he unveiled the latest 21-day review of Covid regulations. He said there would be no rule changes in the next three weeks, following the latest review on Thursday. Some hospitality businesses said they needed ""time to react"" if Covid passes were going to be introduced and not a ""snap decision"". Mr Drakeford said the government would be ""keeping the option of extending the use of the Covid pass"" to the hospitality sector, if case rates climbed and pandemic pressures on the NHS increased. ""We will continue to monitor the public health situation and we will work with the hospitality sector as we prepare for Christmas,"" he added. The Conservatives said the passes were coercive, ineffective and anti-business, and demanded conditions for their removal. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Pubs fear Covid passes as law extended to cinemas Cinema refuses to follow law on Covid passes Covid passes are used to demonstrate if someone has been fully vaccinated or has tested negative in the past 48 hours. They are already required for cinemas, theatres, nightclubs and large events. Wales' Heath Minister Eluned Morgan toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastit's too early to say if Christmas will be ""normal"". ""The good news is that for this period we will not be introducing the Covid passes because the people of Wales have responded positively, they have really been respectful of the protection measures we have put in place. ""The last thing any of us want is to see the kind of crash-out Christmas that we saw last year and so we are obviously going to be keeping an eye on the situation."" Businesswoman Emma Downey said the passes have no place in the hospitality industry Emma Downey, the co-owner of Tides Kitchen and Wine Bar in Newport, Pembrokeshire, said she would be ""loathed to implement them"" in her business. ""In my opinion, Covid passports have no place in our industry or in society in general,"" she said. ""They have no place and it is already difficult with this uncertainty."" She said First Minister Mark Drakeford was bringing ""never-ending doom and gloom"" to the industry. ""We were looking forward to a more normal Christmas, which is how Mark Drakeford described it a few weeks ago, and now we are going into yet more uncertainty and it's just not good enough,"" she said. ""We are constantly taking the brunt of all these regulations... it's just too much for us now. ""I want to see the scientific evidence that Covid passes make any difference to the Covid cases because I don't think there is any out there."" Simon Buckley, chairman of the Brewers of Wales, said the industry needed ""optimism"". ""We need the determination that we are going to be able to trade over Christmas and we will be able to do so unfettered and without undue influence,"" he said. He claimed Covid passports had already had an adverse effect on nightclubs. ""We are in a position where the industry is on its knees and we are facing staff shortages, not caused by Brexit or anything else but by this constant fear,"" he said. Ian Williams of Oxwich Bay Hotel said the industry is afraid of another ""snap decision"" Ian Williams, the owner of Oxwich Bay Hotel on Gower, said ""what we don't want is what happened last year where something comes out of the bag and we have five hours to react"". ""The worst-case scenario for us is we would have to introduce a way of checking the Covid passes, whether that is something where people are able to go online like they did previously, I don't know, but I would have to manage it as we were informed,"" he said. ""The last thing we want is where it got to last year, when it went on and on, and then doing a snap decision, a decision that was made and pulled the rug from under us. ""If it keeps us open, the business going and customers who pre-booked are able to come, then fantastic, that's what we all want."" Wales remains atalert level zero,externalso all businesses can stay open. Although Covid cases continue to rise in Wales, they are going up at a slower rate. The seven-day rolling case rate per 100,000 people has risen again to 504.9, compared to 495.4 reported last week. Gwynedd now has the highest case rate in Wales at 694.4, followed by the Vale of Glamorgan on 685.7 and Monmouthshire on 569.8. On Thursday, Public Health Wales reported 20 further deaths with Covid and 2,576 new cases. In the seven days to the 16 November, an average 6.8 people a day died with Covid in Wales. Mr Drakeford added that pandemic ""hasn't gone away"", with many countries in Europe introducing tougher restrictions. The Welsh government will have another review on 10 December. Russell George, Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said: ""Vaccine passports are bad law: there is no evidence they work, whether that be limiting the spread of the virus or increasing uptake of the vaccine, and conditions for their withdrawal should be set out by the Labour government.""

"This video can not be played What's the Irish PM's message to the UK? There is ""serious intent"" in the EU to solve post-Brexit difficulties over the Northern Ireland border, Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin has said. Speaking to the BBC, he said the ""mood music"" surrounding EU-UK negotiations had improved in recent weeks. The Northern Ireland Protocol in the Brexit deal aims to avoid implementing border checks on the island of Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But the protocol also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, meaning some goods such as meat and eggs are subject to checks when they enter Northern Ireland from Great Britain. This has angered some Northern Irish politicians, including DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who said the protocol was disrupting businesses and harming trade. Laura Kuenssberg: Is harmony about to break out? Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem UK looks likely to trigger Article 16 - then what? What is Article 16 and why does it matter? In aninterview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg,Mr Martin admitted feeling ""frustrated"" that the issue had hindered the ""full flowering"" of the two sides' alliance. And he warned the UK against acting unilaterally, saying it would ""undermine"" relationships. The Taoiseach's comments come ahead of a meeting between the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost and the EU Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ in Brussels on Friday aimed at resolving problems arising from the protocol. Speaking immediately before his meeting with Lord Frost, Mr Å efÄoviÄ warned the post-Brexit trade deal was ""intrinsically linked"" to settling the protocol, adding: ""One cannot exist without the other"". He ruled out a renegotiation of the protocol, insisting solutions were available within its framework, which could ""become reality if the UK plays its part"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ welcomed what he said was a ""change in tone"" from the UK during the negotiations, adding that he hoped ""actions will follow the words"". Ahead of the meeting, Lord Frost told reporters there were still ""significant gaps"" between the two sides Arriving for the talks, Lord Frost told reporters he was ""very much"" looking forward to seeing if progress could be made, adding that his preference was for a ""negotiated"" way through the problem, but if not, Article 16 of the protocol remained on the table. The article allows either side to suspend any part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that causes ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". If the UK did trigger Article 16, the EU could respond by imposing tariffs on trade between the two sides. Lord Frost warned there were still ""quite significant gaps"" between the two sides but welcomed the Taoiseach's comment about the EU's ""serious intent"" to resolve the difficulties. Loyalist demonstrators protesting against the Northern Ireland protocol in Belfast earlier this year In his BBC interview, Mr Martin insisted there was ""not an abundance of checks"" on the border and that Northern Ireland benefitted from having access to both the European and UK markets. However, he added that the EU ""sincerely"" wanted to engage with the problems, which he said could be ""resolved with goodwill on all sides"". He acknowledged that ""there have been periods during these talks when they've dragged on with very little happening"" but added that ""now there's a bit of engagement, of serious intent"". Mr Martin said the protocol was ""never going to be perfect"", adding: ""It's important that we don't allow perfect become the enemy of the good."" He also urged the prime minister to believe that Brussels' offer of compromise was genuine and urged him not to take too long to move towards a deal saying ""don't leave it to Christmas Eve this year"" - a reference to last year's Brexit deal which was agreed on 24 December. Mr Martin is an affable kind of politician. UK ministers talk well of him in private. And clearly, like many leaders around the continent, and indeed like Downing Street, he would rather that a deal was done. It seems that he himself, having warned only a couple of weeks ago that the UK's threatened course of action would be ""reckless"" and ""unwise"", has concluded that it's wiser in contrast, to play down the tensions, to talk up the chances of a deal. But there's still a rub. Read more from Laura Earlier this month, Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned that the whole post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU could collapse over the Northern Ireland Protocol. But, Mr Martin suggested the ""mood music"" had since changed. ""A number of weeks ago there was a different atmosphere governing the situation and there was all sorts of rumours and vibes... since then, that has calmed down somewhat,"" he said. But he still warned the UK against acting ""unilaterally"", arguing it could ""undermine"" the two countries' relationship.

"Former cabinet minister Sir Geoffrey Cox earned Â£54,400 for legal work that he carried out in August, the latest details on MPs' earnings show. They also reveal that Prime Minister Boris Johnson received free use of a suite at Heathrow Airport worth Â£1,800. MPs must reveal any additional income - along with gifts, donations and shareholdings over 15% - in the register of members' interests. It is updated every two weeks and MPs may be sanctioned if they don't comply. The latest register shows Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross made Â£6,728 for football referee work from November 2020 to January this year. He hadapologised for failing to fully record his MSP salary and earningsas a football referee. Former PM Theresa May declared flights, meals and accommodation for three people worth Â£7,611 for a visit to San Marino. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has declared book royalties of Â£135.78. In the last year, 200 MPs have declared earnings on top of their Â£81,932 annual salary. The register of interests shows Sir Geoffrey, Conservative MP for Torridge and West Devon, made Â£54,404.49 for around 45 hours' work undertaken as a barrister between 1 August 2021 and 31 August. Mr Johnson's free use of the Windsor Lounge at Heathrow, shared with two other people, happened en route to his holiday in Marbella, Spain, in October.

"The sale of Sophie Grayling's flat fell through after dangerous external cladding was discovered ""It's like a crippling depression where you can't get up. My anxiety is really bad, some days I can't leave the house."" Sophie Grayling, 28, bought a two-bed flat in Chelmsford, Essex just weeks after her son Reuben was born in 2017. It was supposed to be a safe, secure place to bring up a child, but all that quickly changed. In December 2020, the mother-of-one was told the building had dangerous external cladding and as a result, the sale on her property fell through. Since then, she tells the BBC she has felt ""trapped and helpless"", living constantly in fear that she might lose the roof over her head and have to declare bankruptcy. Concerns over building safety were triggered by the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 in which 72 people died. An inquiry found the type of cladding used was the primary cause of the fire's rapid spread. It's estimated more than half a million people are still living in flats with dangerous cladding and flammable materials. Some are facing bills of more than Â£100,000 to make their properties safe. This video can not be played Sarah Corker investigates the severe financial impact on those trapped in dangerous homes. New research, shared exclusively with the BBC by the University of Sheffield and UK Collaborative Centre for Housing Evidence, concluded the building safety crisis is having a ""catastrophic impact on the mental health of some leaseholders"". Dr Jenny Preece's research is based on a series of in-depth interviews carried out over the summer with affected leaseholders from England and Wales. ""Several people talked about a point of crisis and needing to get help from a GP; they felt trapped and it was leading to feelings of suicide and self-harm,"" she said. ""Some participants were taking anti-depressants as a result of the mental health impact of the problems they were living with: you're stuck and there's literally nothing you can do about it."" Dr Jenny Preece's research among leaseholders found some had ""feelings of suicide and self-harm"" The impacts were likened to living through ""ongoing trauma"". Leaseholders talked about the loss of control over their own lives, the inability to plan for the future, no timeframe for building safety problems to be resolved and the crippling financial burden on their shoulders. Another cladding victim, Will Martin, 33, described it as being ""like a ball and chain wrapped around your legs"". Mr Martin is a junior doctor who owns a flat in Sheffield with dangerous cladding. He is the co-founder of the campaign Organisation UK Cladding Action Group and has helped to organise nationwide protests and demonstrations. That has been his coping mechanism, but Mr Martin says he deeply regrets his decision ever to buy a flat. Will Martin co-founded the campaign organisation UK Cladding Action Group ""I was so embarrassed and utterly ashamed that I, a sensible person, made this colossal mistake and error of judgement by buying this property. The last four years and the impact it has had on my mental health will stay with me forever. It has been torturous,"" he said. ""Government has always said 'leaseholders should not have to pay', but the reality is that many face a constant barrage of entirely unaffordable bills and, in addition to paying through their pockets, today's research by the University of Sheffield lays bare the mental health costs faced by many on a daily basis."" Back in Essex, Ms Grayling went to her GP for help and was prescribed anti-anxiety medication. Her doctor was so shocked by the situation he wrote to her local MP, Vicky Ford, asking for the issues to be raised in Parliament. ""Sophie feels utterly trapped. She cannot remortgage, she cannot sell."" Last year, the House of Commons Housing Select Committee, made up of a group of cross-party MPs, warned that the cladding scandal was becoming a public health crisis. Psychologists have told the BBC that people living in these conditions for long periods of time will need counselling and therapy to get through it. Professor Sir Cary Cooper says the affected leaseholders will need ""counselling support"" Professor Sir Cary Cooper is a leading stress expert and occupational psychologist at the University of Manchester. ""In life, uncertainty and lack of control are the two leading causes of stress, and these people have it in tonnes,"" said Professor Cooper. ""Number one, you know you are going to have to cough up some money. Number two, you don't know how much and it could be substantial. So the worries about that, on top of everything else, these people really do need support and they will need counselling support."" This video can not be played ""We're paying to live in a dark, dull box"" According to Dr Preece, the financial burden, rather than safety concerns, has often been the great source of concern for leaseholders: ""If we don't see a change in policy or government action where is it going end?"" Her report makes a series of recommendations, including urging the government to carry out an audit of the number of buildings affected and extend the funding to cover buildings of all heights and all types of fire safety faults. It also calls for a taskforce to be established to pursue residential developers and manufacturers of cladding materials for compensation. Sophie Grayling hopes she will soon be able to sell her flat because the developer has agreed to pay to replace the cladding Ms Grayling's building in Chelmsford is less than 18 metres in height, and, therefore, not eligible for government funding to fix the faults. But after months of uncertainty, the developer of her block has now agreed to pay to remove and replace the dangerous cladding. She hopes she may soon be able to sell the flat and move on with her life. ""I am at the tip of the iceberg, I feel lucky,"" she says.  ""I have support from friends and family [and] my love for my son got me through, pulled me out of the deepest despair and meant I did get help."" Cladding being removed from a tower block in Manchester The government has promised a Â£5bn Building Safety Fund to remove flammable cladding on high-rise buildings of above 18 metres in height, but MPs have estimated the total cost would be Â£15bn. A Department for Levelling Up Housing and Communities (DLUHC) spokesperson said the department would be setting out ""further proposals in due course"" to support leaseholders in low and mid-rise blocks. ""It is unacceptable and unfair that leaseholders are facing excessive bills - they are innocent parties in this and we recognise the impact it can have on their mental health,"" the DLUHC spokesperson said. ""Building owners and industry must make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders. ""Most blocks of flats are safe and do not need expensive works, and we continue to drive extreme risk aversion out of the market, by encouraging a more proportionate, evidence-based approach from lenders and insurers.""

"HS2 platforms in Manchester Piccadilly would be covered by a folded roof The HS2 high-speed rail link between Birmingham and Manchester will be scrapped, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said. Another part of the route, between the East Midlands and Leeds,has already been cancelled. Instead, Â£36bn funding will be put into alternative transport projects, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was intended to create high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England. That has been pared down to a high-speed link between Birmingham and London. It is aimed at cutting journey times, creating more space on the rail network and more jobs outside London. But HS2 has faced delays, spiralling costs and cuts. HS2 was meant to connectLondonwithBirmingham,ManchesterandLeeds. Lots of work has been done on the section linking London and Birmingham. Butthe government scrapped the Leeds leg in 2021,external. It decided to upgrade existing routes for HS2 trains, instead of building new ones. In June, the government said it would still build HS2 from London Euston to Manchester and the East Midlands. However,Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said recently that costs were getting ""totally out of control"". Now, thealready-delayedBirmingham to Manchester leg has been cancelled. The 13-mile (21km) Golborne Link to connect HS2 and the West Coast Main Line in Cheshire and Greater Manchesterhad already been scrapped. Speaking at the Conservative party conference, Mr Sunak said the latest decision would save Â£36bn, which would be used instead in ""hundreds of new transport projects in the North and the Midlands, and across the country"". This will include road and rail schemes. HS2 will now eventually run from London to Birmingham Interchange, with branches to central Birmingham and Handsacre, near Lichfield. HS2 trains for Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland will join the West Coast Main Line at Handsacre. The government previously said HS2 would cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes, to 52 minutes. Before the link was scrapped, HS2 was projected to take an hour off Manchester to London journeys - from just over two hours to just over one hour. HS2 trains will still run to Manchester, and journey times will be cut between Manchester, Birmingham and London by up to 30 minutes, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was originally meant to reach Euston in central London, although demolition work was paused due to rising costs. The government said it would ""get a grip"" on plans for the station's ""unaffordable designs"". It has already cut the number of planned platforms for high-speed trains from 11 to six. But if cash is not put forward by private investorsthen the high-speed line will only run from Birmingham to Old Oak Commonin London's western suburbs. It is unclear whether the same capacity across the line will be needed now the HS2 line to Manchester has been discarded. The cost of the project, the biggest of its kind in Europe, has grown. The first estimate in 2010 was for about Â£33bn. The government's most recent official estimate was about Â£71bn in 2019 prices. But this included Â£26bn for Birmingham to Manchester, which will now not be built. The government is currently updating its cost estimates. About Â£24.7bn had been spent on HS2 as of February 2023. This includes at least Â£22.5bn on Phase 1 and Â£2.3bn on Phase 2, including on the purchase of more than 400 properties between Birmingham and Manchester. HS2: Six reasons why the rail route is so expensive HS2 was due to open by 2026. Under current plans, HS2 trains would carry their first passengers between Old Oak Common and Birmingham, between 2029 and 2033. Timescales for when Euston will open have yet to be announced. The government has announced the ""Network North"" scheme, with Â£36bn redirected from HS2 to road and rail projects. This will allow the objectives of the previous ""Northern Powerhouse Rail"" project to be met, it said. ""Network North"" plans including upgraded and electrified lines between Manchester and Sheffield, Sheffield and Leeds, Sheffield and Hull, and Hull and Leeds. In addition, there will be an extra Â£12bn set aside for faster links between Liverpool and Manchester. A section of the HS2 line was due to run from Manchester Airport to Manchester Piccadilly, the city's main station. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham recently said scrapping the Manchester link ""rips the heart"" out of Northern Powerhouse Rail. However, the government said Northern Powerhouse Rail, including high speed rail links, will be delivered ""as previously planned"". Big decisions await as HS2 row simmers on What is levelling up and who is it helping? Mr Sunak diverting money from HS2 to road schemes ""shows how little he really cares about tackling air pollution, traffic and cutting carbon emissions"", Greenpeace says. Previously the HS2 project said it could provide ""zero carbon rail travel"" and create new wildlife habitats along its route. But environmental campaigners and conservation organisations had objected, saying it would destroy irreplaceable natural habitats. How much?

"The leader of LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall says the organisation has not had ""any real influence"" over the BBC's editorial policy and output. Nancy Kelley said she understood that the BBC left Stonewall's workplace diversity scheme as it could create a perception the BBC was not impartial. She said the BBC was not aggressively pro-trans rights - with some coverage ""tilted the other way"". The BBC has said it is committed to being a leading employer for inclusion. The corporation said being part of the charity's diversity scheme ""has never required the BBC to support the campaigns of Stonewall"". ""As a broadcaster, we have our own values and editorial standards,"" it added. Ms Kelley, chief executive of the charity since June 2020, was speaking during a wide-ranging interviewon BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hourprogramme - which also covered her thoughts on the opinions of JK Rowling and academic Kathleen Stock. The Stonewall Diversity Champions scheme is a paid-for programme which advises and assesses on creating inclusive workplaces. There is also a separate workplace equality index, in which Stonewall scores employers on their diversity efforts. The BBC said last month it would leave both of Stonewall's schemes because its participation had raised questions about whether it could be impartial on issues the LGBTQ+ charity is campaigning on. In recent months, Channel 4, Ofcom, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Cabinet Office have all made similar decisions. Ms Kelley said: ""I definitely agree that the BBC needs to be seen to be impartial on all issues, it's the national broadcaster. ""It's really important that people can trust it, particularly news programming."" Ms Kelley added: ""In reality, I don't think we've had any real influence over editorial policy. It will be lovely to have more, we would love to be able to kind of have a great amount of influence over the way that the LGBTQ stories are covered by everyone."" ""We'd love to have more influence in the world, we want to grow more inclusive,"" she said. Last month,a Stephen Nolan investigation for BBC Soundslooked at the relationship between Stonewall and public organisations, including the Scottish government and the BBC. There has also been controversy over a BBC online article, published last month, which asked: ""Is a lesbian transphobic if she does not want to have sex with trans women?"" The BBC said at the time it must ""ensure debate and make sure a wide a range of voices are heard"". Asked about the example of Stonewall encouraging workplace staff to declare their pronouns at the same time as the BBC was trying to cover the debate around whether that should happen, Ms Kelley said that would have come down to editorial decision-making. She acknowledged that, if the BBC was effectively being marked down on the charity's equality index for not following Stonewall's guidance, that could create a perception of being on one side or the other. ""Of course I understand how that would create the perception,"" she said. ""On the other side, what the BBC actually does in terms of its coverage, which I don't think does evidence any sign of being aggressively pro-trans rights. And in fact, some of the coverage has tilted a bit the other way recently.""

"The government has named 50 companies given fast-track ""VIP"" contracts to supply protective equipment after the outbreak of Covid-19. Eighteen were nominated by Conservative politicians, Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) data shows. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and former Health Secretary Matt Hancock were among those involved. VIP contracts were introduced as the NHS struggled for masks, gloves, gowns and other safety equipment. The government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies offering to supply personal protective equipment (PPE), which would usually be opened to competing bids. A ""High Priority Lane"" was set up, allowing MPs, ministers and senior officials to pass on offers of help from suppliers and others to a special email inbox. What is going on with government Covid contracts? Timeline: Covid contracts and 'chumocracy' claims The information on the firms,externalchosen for VIP contracts follows a freedom-of-information request by the Good Law Project campaign group. It shows that Mr Hancock referred four companies - Excalibur Healthcare, JD.COM, Monarch Acoustics Ltd and Nine United Ltd. Mr Shapps referred Eyespace Eyewear, while the Office of the Duchy of Lancaster, at that point overseen by Michael Gove, referred two firms - Liaoning Zhongquiao Overseas Exchange Co Ltd and Meller Design Ltd. The then education minister Lord Agnew - who now works in the Cabinet Office - referred three companies - Euthenia Investments Ltd, Uniserve Ltd and Worldlink Resource. Conservative MPs Andrew Percy, Steve Brine, Julian Lewis, Esther McVey also referred firms, as did fellow Tories Lord Leigh, Baroness Mone, Lord Chadlington and Lord Deighton. And Dominic Cummings, then the prime minister's chief adviser, referred Global United Trading. A fast-track system to get much needed supplies to the front line or a short cut to lucrative contracts with minimal oversight? The truth is perhaps somewhere in the middle. Ministers make no apology for allowing MPs, businesses and the civil service to recommend PPE suppliers during a national emergency. The government may hope the publication of this information proves they are prepared to be transparent. But politicians from any party other than the Conservatives are conspicuous by their absence on the list of those whose suggestions resulted in a contract. Whatever the reasons for that, it allows Labour and others to again accuse the government of doing favours for its friends. Good Law Project director Jo Maugham said: ""We really need to be looking at the process whereby so many friends of the Conservative Party came to benefit from vast, and vastly profitable, contracts. ""How did so many come to understand that there were contracts there for the taking?"" The DHSC said that, in March last year, when the crisis struck, global demand for PPE had ""skyrocketed"", while supplies were limited. It added: ""It was essential that government adapted its approach to sourcing PPE for health and social care frontline workers, moving extremely quickly where necessary and taking carefully considered risks with new suppliers where appropriate, in order to secure vital supplies in the teeth of stiff competition all around the world. ""To save lives, we focused our efforts, resources and attention on sourcing PPE."" the DHSC said. ""We continue to stand by the efforts we made at the height of the early pandemic to prioritise and protect our staff in the front line.""

"Police are investigating how the baby ended up in a drain A five-day-old baby girl, who was rescued from a drain where she was left to die in the Indian city of Mumbai, is recovering in a local hospital. Doctors at the Rajawadi hospital told the BBC that she was ""doing fine"" and her health was being monitored. Police said residents found the baby after a group of cats gathered at a spot along the road and began creating a ruckus - hissing, and purring loudly. Officials are investigating how she ended up in the drain. Police have not speculated on possible motives, but similar abandonments in the past have been blamed on India's preference for sons. Women are often discriminated against socially and girls are seen as a financial burden, particularly among poor communities. The country's gender ratio is one of the worst in the world. And although most unwanted female foetuses are aborted with help from illegal sex determination clinics, cases of baby girls being killed or abandoned after birth are not uncommon either. In the latest incident, the baby was rescued by a women-led police team from a suburban Mumbai neighbourhood on Sunday. When the police arrived, they found the infant lying inside the drain. They said the baby - dressed in a flimsy shirt and soaked in sewage water - was wailing in distress. Two officers then scooped her out, wrapped her in a cloth and took her to the hospital. ""When we lifted the the baby out, she was freezing; her arms had turned blue. We asked for some warm water and cloth to clean the baby,"" police constable Sheetal Sonawane told the Times of India newspaper. Doctors at the Rajawadi hospital said the baby was ""stable"". Newborn found alive in shallow grave now thriving The Indian baby girl left to die ""Doctors are constantly monitoring her health. We will keep her under observation for the next few days,"" Dr Vidya Thakur, the medical superintendent of the hospital, told BBC Marathi. The incident created a stir on social media. A photo shot by the Mumbai police at the scene showed officers cradling the newborn - wrapped in a white cloth - in their arms. Allow Twitter content?

Similar incidents involving infant girls are routinely reported in India. Two years back, a newborn baby was discovered buried alive in a clay pot in Bareilly town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. In the winter of 2016, an infant was found abandoned inside a plastic bag without any clothes in the capital, Delhi. And in June, a boatman in Uttar Pradesh state was praised after he rescued a baby girl found floating in a wooden box in the Ganges river. Campaigners say India's skewed preference for sons has resulted in millions of female foetuses being aborted over the past few decades. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described it as a ""national shame"" and called for a ""crusade"" to save girl babies. And soon after taking over in the summer of 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modiappealed to Indians to stop killing their daughters.

"The financial help poorer people get to cover their care will not count towards a new cap on costs, the government has said. It was announced in September that from 2023 no one in England would pay more than Â£86,000 in care fees during their lifetime. Now it has been confirmed that support payments from local councils will not count towards this personal limit. Labour said it makes the cap ""an even bigger con than we initially thought"". Critics also argue it will make the cap harder to reach than under a previous version suggested by an official commission a decade ago. But Boris Johnson has defended the government's plan, calling it a ""massive improvement"" on the current funding situation. MPs will vote on whether to support the plans next week. Will the cap really fix the social care system? Social care changes at-a-glance The cap on personal care costs is a central element of the government's plans to change how adult social care in England is funded. From October 2023, the idea is that no one will pay more than Â£86,000 over their lifetime for personal care, such as washing, dressing and eating. Once people have reached this cap, ongoing costs for personal care will be paid for by local authorities. Money spent on living costs - such as food, energy bills and accommodation - would not count towards the limit. The threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will also be made more generous, with people with assets up to Â£100,000 able to qualify, rather than Â£23,250 currently. The government did not specify in September whether people receiving these payments would be able to put them towards reaching the cap. But on Wednesday, itpublished guidance,externalconfirming that only payments people make out of their own pocket will count. Funding social care in England has been a long-running political issue This contrasts with a previous blueprint for how the cap should work, made by economist Sir Andrew Dilnot in an official report in 2011. This was put into law in the 2014 Care Act under the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, but delayed and then eventually ditched under David Cameron. Under Sir Andrew's recommendations, payments from local authorities would be used to reach the cap. He argued this was important to ensure poorer people receiving support for a long time did not just end up taking longer to reach the limit, rather than contributing less overall. Giving evidence to MPs on Thursday, Sir Andrew said he was ""very disappointed"" with the government plans announced on Wednesday. He told them that it will mean poorer people will only hit the cap ""significantly later"" and won't end up benefiting as much. ""It will tend to hit people in regions of the country with lower house prices harder than it does those in regions with higher house prices,"" he added. ""So there is a sort of North-South axis to this, that people living in northern and other less high house price areas are likely to be hit harder by this on average."" Chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, Torsten Bell, also criticised the move, saying the new version of the cap ""will now offer little protection to poorer households' assets, while doing much more for those with significant assets - especially in the south of England."" Director of policy at charity The Kings Fund, Sally Warren, also called the change ""disappointing"". She said those with low to moderate levels of wealth with be the worst affected, adding: ""They may well wonder why the prime minister's promise that no one need to sell their house to pay for care will benefit wealthier people but doesn't seem to apply to them."" Liz Kendall, Labour's shadow social care minister, said it showed ""Boris Johnson's so-called cap on care costs is an even bigger con than we initially thought."" ""It has now been revealed that the poorest pensioners will have to pay even more,"" she added. ""This Tory government has failed to be straight with those who've given so much to our country is a total disgrace, but utterly unsurprising. Our elderly people deserve better."" Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Boris Johnson said the government's plans would be a ""massive improvement for everybody in the whole country"". ""What we're saying is for the first time in history we're stopping people having to pay unlimited quantities for their care,"" he added.

"Germany's Covid cases hit another high with 65,371 daily cases recorded Chancellor Angela Merkel has said a fourth wave of Covid is ""hitting us with full force"" German MPs vote in favour of a new set of measures, including access to public transport only for people who have been vaccinated or tested Germany's upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat, will consider the measures on Friday Much of Europe is facing a spike in cases, with new measures introduced in countries including Austria and Belgium The World Health Organization is warning of a ""hard winter ahead"" for Europe Covid passes may be used over Christmas in order to keep pubs and restaurants open, the Welsh government says No decision will be made on introducing the pass to the hospitality sector until early December, First Minister Mark Drakeford says We're bringing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic around the world to a close. This live page was written by Lauren Turner, Adam Durbin, Alexandra Fouche and Matt Murphy, and edited by John Hand and Emma Harrison. Thanks for reading and we hope you'll join us again soon. If you are just joining us here's what has been happening today: Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have announced tighter restrictions for unvaccinated people, in a bid to encourage vaccine uptake. The Czech government has approved rules which allow only those who
are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid in the past six
months to enter restaurants, attend certain events and use
various other services from Monday, the Reuters news agency reports. Slovakia took a similar step, in what Prime Minister Eduard
Heger describes as a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"" - echoing themove in Austria earlier this week. Both governments will also require testing at workplaces. ""The main goal of these measures is motivation for
vaccinations,"" Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtech says. With 58% of the population inoculated, the Czech vaccination
rate is below the European Union average, while Slovakia has the EU's
third-lowest rate, with 45% of the population inoculated. Spanish beach resort Benidorm has opened a Covid vaccination centre specifically for tourists to combat rising case numbers in the area. The clinic is located near the hotel district and was drawing queues of
tourists this week, while further mobile vaccination points will be
set up by Valencian health authorities in areas where big crowds gather, Reuters is reporting. Mayor
Antonio Perez tells the news agency they are extending a public service to tourists  and it ""sends a message of safety"" to people. Spain requires all visitors entering the country to present
either a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR test, but bars
and restaurants do not require vaccine passports. New figures have been released showing that 92.5% of staff in care homes for older adults in England have now had two doses of a Covid vaccine, as of 14 November. It means 7.5% of staff - 34,291 people - have not been fully vaccinated. They're the first figures to be released by NHS England since the 11 November deadline set by the government for all staff working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home to be vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. The NHS figures also show 21.7% of social care staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers were not fully jabbed as of 14 November - that's an estimated 108,510 people. Our reporters spoke to care workers when the deadline passed last week -read more on what they had to say here. The US has bought
10 million treatment courses of a Covid-19
antiviral drug,US President Joe Biden said on Thursday,external. The contract with pharmaceutical giantPfizer for its Paxlovid treatmentwill cost the US government $5.29bn (Â£3.93bn at today's exchange rate), the Reuters news agency reports. Biden says the delivery of the pills would start by the end of 2021, if it is authorised by US  regulators. In a statement, the president said his administration was making
preparations to ensure the pills would be easily accessible and
free. ""This is positive news,"" he says. ""This treatment could prove to be another critical tool in our arsenal that will accelerate our path out of the pandemic."" But, he adds, vaccines remain ""our strongest tool"". The Netherlands has reported its highest number of daily Covid infections, exceeding new 20,000 cases for the third day in a row, Reuters news agency reports. About 23,600 people tested positive for the virus, the country's
national health institute says - up from just under 21,000 a day
before. The country has already brought in a partial lockdown. Back now to the situation in Germany. As we've been reporting today the number of Covid cases in the country has hit a record high. But where are cases worst? Saxony is the German region that has currently been hardest hit by the fourth wave of coronavirus. The state - in the east of the country, which has Dresden as its capital - has the highest infection rate as well as the lowest vaccination rate. Because of its status, it's considering measures like closing concerts, theatres and football games to the public and closing bars and nightclubs, Bild newspaper says. Daily infections there have risen 14 times in the past month, Reuters has reported. Infection rates are also high in Bavaria, in the south-east, and more measures are being considered there. The UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures. Overall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old. More than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. The UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period. There were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. The UK government has named 50 companies given fast-track ""VIP"" contracts to supply protective equipment to the NHS. Eighteen of them were nominated by Conservative politicians, Department of Health and Social Care data shows - with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and former health secretary Matt Hancock involved. VIP contracts were introduced as the NHS struggled for masks, gloves, gowns and other safety equipment after the outbreak of coronavirus. The government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies offering to supply the equipment. Contracts would usually be opened to competing bids. The information on the firms,externalchosen for VIP contracts follows a freedom-of-information request by the Good Law Project campaign group. The government said that ""to save lives, we focused our efforts, resources and attention on sourcing PPE"", adding it stood by efforts made to protect staff. Read more here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Covid case
rates are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly
surveillance figures for England reveal. The report from
the UK Health Security Agency, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group
has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time. In recent
months, the 10-19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per
100,000 tested. It is too soon
to say what is behind the change and whether it will continue. In recent weeks
children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs. The data also
shows confirmed Covid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those
aged 80 plus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The widow of a top official dealing with Scotland's pandemic response, who died after contracting Covid, believes the full details of his illness were concealed to protect a troubled hospital's reputation. Andrew Slorance went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago, where his wife Louise believes he caught the virus - as well as another life-threatening infection. He was the Scottish government's head of response and communication unit, in charge of its handling of the Covid pandemic. His widow tells the BBC she believes officials wanted to protect the hospital, which is already the subject of a public inquiry, as well as its reputation, ""no matter what the cost"". The hospital's health board says it had been ""open and honest"" and there had been no attempt to conceal any information from the family. You can read more on what happenedhere. There have been some changes this week in the UK about who can get their booster jabs - and about teenagers' vaccinations. So what is the new guidance? Here's a recap. All over-40s in the UK can now have a booster jab, as long as it's been six months after their second vaccine. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed. Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according toUK Health Security Agency data,external. You can now get a third dose if you're in one of these categories:  Those aged 16 and 17 can now have a second vaccine, 12 weeks after their first jab. And pregnant women are being urged to take up their offer of a vaccine, as they can be particularly at risk. The changes follow new recommendations from the government's advisers, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. All the details arehere. This video can not be played Covid in Wales: Maternity visiting rules unfair, says mum Visitors should be allowed into maternity units in Wales without restrictions, a charity says. Since the pandemic started, some units have stopped all visiting while others have limited times parents can spend with newborns. The rules currently vary between health boards, with some of them including banning visits entirely, other limiting visits to a few hours and some only allowing designated partners in within certain times of the day. But with restrictions on movement and social distancing eased across the country, Birthrights wants hospital maternity units to also open up. The Welsh government says maternity services keep their rules under review and there was a ""delicate balance"" between protecting vulnerable individuals and allowing visiting. Read morehere. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin The debate in Germanyâs parliament today was emotional, with
plenty of finger-pointing for the sharp rise in infections. The mood in the
country is equally fractious, with commentators asking why politicians didnât
use the lull in infections during the summer, to prepare the booster campaign
and plan for a predictably tough winter. Some hospitals say they are at full capacity, and worry they will
be overwhelmed when the current high rates translate into more
hospitalisations. These
stark warnings mean that, in polls, most Germans support tougher measures. Until
now, excluding unvaccinated people from some activities has not sparked
widespread protest. In one survey, a majority supports allowing only vaccinated
people to access leisure services, such as restaurants. These measures have
been easy to implement. Customers have quickly become used to showing waiters
proof of vaccine before ordering food. The newer measures decided on Thursday might be more difficult to
implement. Transport trade unions say their members shouldnât have to police
the vaccine status of passengers because of potential aggression. And some
employers question how they can organise daily tests for workers. But
if the choice is between more deaths or making life more difficult for
unvaccinated people, the consensus in Germany is more restrictions for people
who donât want the jab. Germany is facing its highest case numbers since the coronavirus pandemic began. We've been looking at the pattern of how case numbers have been going up and down. There was a small peak early in the pandemic, if you look at the seven-day averages, but the first big wave peaked at the end of December. There was another surge - although not as big as the one at the end of 2020 - at the end of April before a decrease. There was a rise again to a new peak in September which plateaued for a while before rapidly climbing again to the new highs we see now. There's information on theJohns Hopkins world coronavirus map,externalas well, which breaks down the figures if you're keen for more detail. The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning there is a ""hard winter ahead"" for Europe. Asked by the BBC if it was concerned vaccines did not appear to be preventing a surge in cases, its regional director for Europe Hans Kluge says: ""Of course vaccines have been a game-changer. ""But far too many remain unvaccinated, so we have pockets in which the virus continues to spread and cause strain on local and national health systems."" He was speaking amid a surge in European countries, as we've been reporting on here today. This public health emergency is far from being over, and the current rise of cases in most countries in the region, caused by the combination of insufficient vaccination coverage, the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant, shows that a hard winter is ahead of us."" Dr Hans Kluge, WHO We were telling you earlier about Covid passes in Wales and Scotland - another country considering extending their use is Spain. The Basque Country wants to make it mandatory for people visiting bars, clubs or restaurants to show a vaccination certificate, reports Spanish newspaper El Pais. It would show whether they have been fully vaccinated, at least 14 days previously, if they have had Covid over the previous six months, or tested negative for the virus. Spanish regions are in charge of their own healthcare systems, including Covid-19 measures and vaccinations. Overall in Spain, 79% of the population is now fully vaccinated. The daily case rate is rising at the moment with latest 14-day figures showing 88.6 cases per 100,000 people. As we've been reporting, there has been some fierce debate in the German lower house of parliament over proposed new measures to curb the current spike in the country's cases. Here are some excerpts that give a flavour of what was said in the chamber.  More people will get infected and become ill, many of them seriously.

"This video can not be played Karen Jankulak, left, was attacked by her son Huw after the health board ended his specialist care A mum whose severely autistic son attacked her, self-harmed and damaged their home after support was ended by the health board has spoken of her ordeal. Karen Jankulak said it was ""hard to understand"" why nothing replaced Hywel Dda health board's service. Without help for Huw, life became ""awful"" and ""frightening"", she said. The health board apologised after being criticised in a report, citing staffing issues. The report by the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales, Nick Bennett,concluded a ""significant injustice"" had been done to the family. Ms Jankulak's son, Huw Wooding, now 19, does not speak and has learning disabilities. 'They said bleach would cure my daughter' Autism: Workplaces 'need to be more supportive' Whistleblowers claim children with autism 'abused' at Cardiff home Mr Bennett's report said it was likely Huw's challenging behaviour worsened and became more entrenched without specialist help. Psychologists and psychiatrists from the health board's specialist service had often helped prevent or deal with that behaviour. But when it ended in late 2019, it was not replaced. Huw's father Jonathan became stuck in Australia while working there at the start of the coronavirus pandemic At the time, Ms Jankulak's husband - Huw's father - Jonathan was working in Australia. He later became trapped there due lockdown restrictions. Ms Jankulak, from Lampeter, in Ceredigion, was left in ""pure despair"" by the end of the service. ""He would chew his hands and then all the way up his arm when the hands got too painful,"" she recalled. ""He would smash things, he would break things, he seemed to have a genius for seeking out really dangerous things, like bits of glass, and smashing them. ""He would attack anyone in reach but he would actually go for me as well."" She added: ""It was the only way he could express how out-of-control and how unhappy he was."" Huw would self-harm and damage their home Retired lecturer Ms Jankulak complained to Hywel Dda in February 2020, but received no response for months. Then, in August 2020, Ms Jankulak had to call police and take Huw to Glangwili Hospital A&E in Carmarthen after his behaviour became too much. The ombudsman upheld her complaint. In his report, Mr Bennett described a ""significant injustice"" against the family. He shared Ms Jankulak's concerns about the effect axing the service was having on other families. Ms Jankulak said life was ""awful"" and ""frightening"" without the health board's help ""The health board identified in its risk assessment three individuals who were 18, or nearing 18, with identified ongoing needs,"" he said. ""It remains unclear how many younger patients were affected and whether the health board took any steps to find ways to address the outstanding needs in the cases of all of those other patients. ""I have seen no evidence of contingency planning should this service come to an end, meaning that the health board and the patients receiving the service were unprepared for the abrupt end of the service."" Huw is now in a specialist residential college. Ms Jankulak said: ""There's the sense that you are without a safety net and that's quite scary. ""That makes everything so much harder when the support that should be there, and it's really the only support that could be helpful, just isn't there. ""You always fear falling off the cliff and then you fall off the cliff."" She described her experience as ""absolutely horrific."" ""I can't quite believe we went through that,"" she said. ""At the time it was indescribably awful and just so frightening."" Public services ombudsman Nick Bennett called it a ""highly concerning case"" Hywel Dda chief executive Steve Moore said the health board had written an apology to the family. ""This was a very challenging period for the health board's learning disability team and the psychology service in particular, due to high levels of staff absence, vacancies and unsuccessful recruitment initiatives,"" he said. A health board spokeswoman added it was ""ensuring full compliance"" with the plan put forward by the ombudsman. Mencap's Wayne Crocker called the report ""damning"" and expressed concern it contravened the Social Services and Wellbeing Act. He said: ""I'm concerned that what will happen, especially after Covid, is money will be diverted to other front-line services and specialist services like this could cease."" Prof Edwin Jones, of the British Institute of Learning Disabilities, said specialist staff recruitment was a problem in Wales. ""We don't have enough skilled behavioural experts or people with behavioural expertise,"" he said. The Welsh government said it had a programme called Improving Lives that focused on helping people live healthy, happy, active lives as independently as possible. A spokesman said: ""We are working to respond to challenges caused by the pandemic while also building on the Improving Lives programme.""

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Conservative MPs he ""crashed the car"" in his handling of the case of the party's former MP Owen Paterson. It comes after Tory MPs voted through a proposal that is expected to lead to a ban on them taking paid political consultancy work. Labour abstained from the vote, saying the government's plan was a watered down version of its own plan. No 10 has faced weeks of political pressure over the Paterson row. Mr Johnson has conceded publicly that he made a mistake in ""conflating"" changes to the Parliamentary standards system with the disciplinary process for Mr Paterson, who broke lobbying rules. But the PM stopped short of apologising for the debacle, during a grilling by senior MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee. In private, at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers on Wednesday night, he was even more candid - telling them he had ""crashed the car"" over the Paterson case. His message was greeted with the traditional desk banging to show approval, but some MPs leaving the meeting had a more downbeat assessment. One told the BBC the prime minister had looked and sounded ""weak"". Another, who backed him in the leadership campaign, said the meeting had been ""very flat"", with ""hostile questioning from all factions"". BBC Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt said one Brexit grandee told him ""it was awful - he's like an old rock star in need of new material"". Labour wanted the standards committee to draw up new rules by 31 January to implement the ban on MPs working as political consultants. But the government ordered its MPs to vote against the opposition's motion, defeating it by 51 votes. The government's amendment was passed by 297 to zero, after Labour ordered its MPs not to take part. MPs back government plans to curb second jobs PM follows Labour call to ban MP paid adviser jobs Which MPs have second jobs? Under the government's plan any outside role, paid or unpaid, should be ""within reasonable limits"" and not stop MPs fully serving their constituents. This is yet to be defined, but International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has suggested 15 hours a week would be a reasonable limit. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said limits could be placed on hours worked or the amount earned. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said there was a lack of urgency in the government's plan, which has no timetable. ""People look at MPs and think it is just mired in sleaze. I think we need to sort this out quickly to restore the reputation of Parliament,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. In a statement after the vote, the government said MPs had backed updating the code of conduct for MPs. ""This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents,"" it said. ""This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this."" The Commons Committee on Standards is due to report its recommendations early next year. The committee's chairman, Labour MP Chris Bryant, said it would then be up to ministers to find the necessary time to debate any planned changes. On Wednesday night, MPs did vote to tighten up the rules on what they are allowed to do to earn money on the side. Or, at least, that when there are precise proposals, they will make decisions on it, at some not entirely precise date in the future... No 10 hopes that it will be the end - or at least the beginning of the end - of the self-inflicted fortnight of bad headlines and claims of sleaze that have come, day after day after day. And, with that, allow the government to move on to make noise about what they are trying to get done, rather than the things that are going wrong. Will they get their way? Read more from Laura Arguments over second jobs held by MPs outside of Westminster have intensified in recent weeks in the wake of the Owen Paterson case. The Conservative MP was found to have broken Commons rules by using his position to lobby for two companies paying him. The government tried to block his suspension from Parliament and get the whole disciplinary process for MPs reviewed. But it abandoned the plan a day later, after an outcry from opposition MPs and some Tories. Mr Paterson then resigned as an MP. Appearing in front of the Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson said he believed the MP had broken the rules, saying it was ""extraordinary"" that some of his colleagues ""behave in these ways"". There's nothing to stop MPs - other than ministers - doing extra work on top of the job they were elected to do. The rules do not prohibit them earning money - in addition to their Â£81,932 salary - or gaining greater experience of the world beyond Westminster. So, MPs can continue to work in professions such as the law or medicine. Or they can work as consultants for companies, offering advice on strategy. But they must not lobby - try to alter government policy - for firms, individuals or organisations who pay them, or use Commons facilities to do work on behalf of employers or clients. MPs have to register their outside earnings and if they take part in a debate or other parliamentary activities in which their employer or client is involved, they have to declare an interest. Any breaches of Parliament's code of conduct can result in punishment, including a suspension from the Commons.

"This video can not be played Michelle says: ""People think it's poor parenting... they don't really understand."" A couple are spending hours hunting for a specific type of Walkers crisp amid a national shortage as it is one of the only things their daughter will eat. Due to an eating disorder, Walkers oven baked sea salt-flavour crisps form a major part of the diet of four-year-old Ava, from Narborough, Leicestershire. But her mother Michelle says she is struggling to find any. Walkers said it was working to resolve the supply problems and apologised for the inconvenience. The disruption, which started last month, is due to a glitch caused by an IT upgrade. Michelle said she tried to shop for the packets online, but even stores advertising the product as in stock told her they had run out Ava has a number of conditions, including avoidant or restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and a condition that affects her development. According to her mother, she only eats these crisps, toastie waffles and a specific kind of baby fruit puree. She only drinks sweetened almond milk and a prescription vitamin mix. Michelle said Ava would rather go on a drip than eat something she does not like. They have been struggling to get hold of the crisps for almost a month. At one point Ava, who usually eats two packets a day, was without the crisps for five days and became lethargic and withdrawn. ""When your child relies on a food, and you can't get it, it's really hard,"" Michelle said. ""[Me and my husband] go looking round the shops for the crisps every day for an hour or two. ""We have a big extended family and everyone is looking out for them too. ""There's not a huge nutritional value in the crisps but the salt helps. It makes her drink more. ""[If she doesn't have them] it makes her really sleep, she lays around and doesn't have enough energy."" ""Our big fear is having to go to hospital and if we cannot find these crisps, that's 100% a possibility,"" she added. ""It makes me very, very anxious. What seems like such a simple thing is huge for her."" She added many children with disorders that limit their eating tend to favour crisps, and she was aware of many families through social media who were also struggling. There have been reports of empty shelves in some shops across the country On Thursday, Michelle told the BBC News Channel the family had received messages online from people around the country offering to supply them with crisps. She added: ""There is a lot of people that experience this at all ages, but there has been a lot of judgement and a lot of very, very negative comments. ""This is a registered eating disorder and a lot of people don't really understand learning disabilities, autism, sensory eating or ARFID so there are misconceptions about what it is."" Supply disruption is set to continue for a few more weeks Nicole Kirkland, co-founder of charity ARFID Awareness UK, said many often looked down on the condition and those dealing with it. She said: ""It often deals with complex carbohydrates and processed foods, just by the very nature that they are consistent, so you end up with crisps, white bread, cereal or fast food fries, so it can come across as lazy parenting. ""It really opens itself up to judgement but this is not just a kid that is a fussy eater. ""The mum is doing the best she can and unfortunately there is very little in the way of help and support for people out there."" Walkers has said supply issues are expected to continue for several more weeks. The Leicester-based firm is prioritising its more popular crisp flavours, such as cheese and onion and salt and vinegar. A spokeswoman said: ""We're doing everything we can to increase production and get people's favourites back on shelves. ""We're very sorry for the inconvenience caused.""

"A proposed HS2 line to Leeds will not go ahead, the government has confirmed That goes back on previous pledges that the high-speed route to Leeds would be built Transport Secretary Grant Shapps outlined the government's rail plan in the Commons A Â£96bn improvement programme will target services in the Midlands and northern England Labour criticise the new plans as ""a betrayal"" of promises to ""level up"" the country Mr Shapps says Â£625m will be spent on the electrification of lines between Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds HS2 was originally meant to connect London with the city centres of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds But Mr Shapps says ""a rethink was needed"" on HS2 and claims the new plan will deliver improvements sooner Edited by Emma Owen HS2 platforms in Manchester Piccadilly would be covered by a folded roof We're winding up our live coverage now. Thanks for joining us. As we've been reporting, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs earlier that his plan would include the scrapping of HS2's eastern line to Leeds. If you'd like to know more about the new direction for HS2, have a read ofour explainer. For more local and political reaction to the government's new rail plan, take a look at some of our latest storieshereandhere. And what do politicians mean when they say 'levelling up'? Get the lowdownhere. Today's live page was written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, Mary O'Connor and Paul Seddon. It was edited by Emma Owen. Before we go, we just want to tell you what passengers on a train from Hull to Leeds have been saying about theIntergrated Rail Plan,external. Businessman Phil Jones said: ""I'm more interested in the link between Hull and Manchester across the north than I've ever been about HS2 and want towns across the north better connected by rail and by electrification and by a better service in general."" HS2 will not go to Leeds as planned but will stop at East Midlands Parkway and the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme will not deliver a new line between Manchester and Leeds. However, the transport secretary said there will be a high speed link between Manchester and on to West Yorkshire. Meanwhile commuter Katie Haddock  said: ""It's a massive disappointment for me because I've just started a new job working in Leeds and London and I'm having to decide whether I can continue with that, because the commute is such a problem and really affects daily life. The government says its Â£96bn plan is an ""ambitious and unparalleled programme"" to overhaul inter-city links across the north and Midlands. It says it will ""study how best to take HS2 trains into Leeds"" and will look at a mass transport system for West Yorkshire. We're going to be wrapping up our coverage shortly so here's a reminder of what has happened today:  You can see the full planhere,external. Residents in the East Midlands towns and villages affected by the original HS2 scheme say they are relieved that part of the route is being axed. Geoff Cotton, who has lived in Trowell since 1988, says he would have seen HS2 come past his house. ""Obviously it's pleasing from a selfish point of view, but I do also feel that the way the economy is working at the moment with people working from home more, the need to travel down to London fast isn't as significant as it would have been,"" he says. However, he criticises the amount of time the decision has taken. ""People haven't been able to move on with their lives because they can't sell their properties."" Jill Sisson, who has lived in Trowell for more than 50 years, says she is ""quite happy"" her home will no longer be demolished. ""To have been living with all this pressure is very hard. I don't think it's been handled very well. One minute you're hearing one thing and the next minute you're hearing something else. ""It leaves you up in the air as to what's going to happen. It's all the uncertainty."" You can read more reaction from the East Midlandshere. More reaction to today's announcement... Newcastle North MPCatherine McKinnell, Labour, says people
will struggle to understand why the government ""expects Northerners to be
grateful for piecemeal improvements to our creaking, 20th century rail system"" when there are state-of-the-art HS2 links that benefit the South and Crossrail in London. She says it is ""mend and make do"" for the North. She describes the plan as a ""major strategic blunder"" and says it was an opportunity to transform the North. Andy McDonald, Labour MP for Middlesborough, says that the North East has been forgotten for too long, with rail commuters facing poor service on inadequate infrastructure. He says: ""Itâs a different world
compared with the South East."" ConservativeAndy Carter,Warrington South MP, says it is ""really reassuring"" to see Warrington feature prominently in the government's rail plan. He says the new high speed line between Warrington and Manchester will release capacity on the existing network and will have benefits for the town centre. But he says that he wants to see those benefits realised as soon as possible, adding ""people cannot wait forever to see material differences"". And Sheffield MPLouise Haigh, Labour, is critical of the plan. ""This report was more than 12 months overdue, and it definitely was not worth the wait. ""The prime minister has once again shown people across the north of England that they do not matter to him or his government. ""This is another in a long line of broken promises by this prime minister to the people of the North."" More union reaction, and Unite has described the governmentâs
decision to cancel the HS2 spur to Leeds as an ""act of industrial vandalism."" Unite national officer for construction Jerry Swain said: ""This decision has put back national infrastructure planning by a generation. It is nothing short of industrial vandalism. âBy cancelling the Leeds spur the government's demonstrating it's not serious about its levelling up agenda and that its manifesto commitment to improving regional connectivity was nothing but hot air. ""HS2 should be the gold standard of construction projects for the next decade and beyond. The entire UK should be benefiting from this development."" The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, said the Â£96bn programme will ""transform services in the north and the Midlands,"" calling the scheme the ""largest single rail investment ever made by a UK government"".  Reality Check Announcing the Integrated Rail Plan, Transport Secretary
Grant Shapps spoke not just of rail investment but of wider transport
commitments. He said the plan was also about those places that âconnect
and interactâ with HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail,
adding âwe are investing Â£2bn in walking and cyclingâ. However, this is not a new funding announcement. In May last year, the government announced Â£2bn for walking
and cycling as part of a UK-wide package toâboost greener, active transportâ.,external Some reaction has been coming in from business leaders and travel groups. Matthew Fell, chief policy director at theConfederation of British Industry, says the plan involves significant investment which goes some way ""towards modernising our ageing rail networks"". But he says businesses across the Midlands and northern England will be ""justifiably disappointed to see the goalposts have moved at the eleventh hour"". Sir John Peace, chair of transport research groupMidlands Connectsays while the plans have changed ""there are a lot of positives in here and lots of things to be excited about"". He says the government ""should move as quickly as possible to get spades in the ground and bring benefits to local people sooner"". Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdogTransport Focus, says to help meet decarbonisation targets sustained investment in public transport in the North and Midlands must continue. ""Ultimately passengers will judge the success of these plans on the extent to which they meet their priorities for improvement: more punctual, reliable services, increased capacity and the chance of getting a seat on the train,"" he says. Andy Bagnall, director general of theRail Delivery Group,which represents independent train operators, says rail has a vital role to play in ""driving the economy"" and a ""fair, clean recovery"" - with millions of people set to benefit from boosting connectivity between northern cities and the Midlands. However, he warns that ""leaving out key pieces of the jigsaw will inevitably hold back the ability for the railways to power the levelling up agenda and the drive to net zero"". Reality Check The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a business pressure group chaired by former chancellor George Osborne, has been looking at the Â£96bn rail investment announced by the government. It estimates the full HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail projects, as previously planned, would have ended up costing about Â£127.5bn. That estimate would make the alternative Â£96bn programme set out on Thursday at least Â£30bn cheaper. The pressure group reckons about Â£17bn of the savings will come from the difference in cost between the scrapped eastern leg of HS2 to Leeds and the proposed new lines and upgrades proposed for the area. The rest comes from cheaper options on Northern Powerhouse Rail. Theyâre working through the figures in the governmentâs publication and expect to have more precise numbers later in the day. Estimates of costs of big rail projects are notoriously unreliable. When HS2 was first announced, the whole thing was only supposed to cost about Â£33bn. Nonetheless, some might argue it's hard to describe any of the Â£96bn as new money if itâs a result of scrapping some rail projects and spending the money on alternatives. We have asked the Department for Transport for its response to these costings. The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) has given its reaction to the government's plans - and concluded that Bradford will be ""the biggest loser"". A report out earlier this week found the city hasthe worst connections of any city in the UK, despite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located. It came bottom of the list due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections. There are only four trains to London, for example, each day. The West Yorkshire city had been hoping to be connected to Manchester and Leeds along a new high-speed line, which today's plan confirms will not go ahead in full. Instead, there will be a mixture of newly-built line and upgrades to existing track. The government says journey times to and from Bradford will still be cut. But Manuel Cortes, the TSSA's general secretary, says the plan shows the government has ""sold out the North with more broken promises"".  We're still catching up on a few threads from the Commons discussion earlier, and Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park, made the point that today's announcement scraps ""much-needed"" plans to improve rail capacity and connections, and comes weeks afterthe Chancellor announced cuts to domestic flight taxes. She challenged the transport secretary to answer ""how these plans together deliver against either of their stated objectives to level up or to tackle climate change?"" Shapps responded by saying: ""In all of these decisions we're having to balance the wider purse, the taxpayers' money."" He notes the expenditure on rail, adding ""it's always my goal to get more people travelling on the trains"" and that ""these plans will help that"". Sandra Haith (far right) has spent years fighting the plans Grant Shapps' announcement - in particular news that HS2's eastern leg is to be scrapped  - has been met with elation by some campaigners in south Yorkshire. Sandra Haith has spent five and half years fighting the original plans, which would have seen the line cut through the east side of the village of Bramley, Rotherham, as it followed the M18 motorway. She says: ""Not only as a resident of Bramley, but as a taxpayer, it's a complete waste of money. ""The eastern leg costs a lot of money and it basically connects two cities. We can't get on it. We've got all the pain and no gain. ""This village and other villages have been under this blight for five and a half years. ""People have already sold up and moved out because they can't live with the stress."" You can read morehere. The government has now published itsIntegrated Rail Plan,externaland in a foreword, Boris Johnson says the old plans had ""got the balance wrong"". ""They focused too much on showpiece, high speed links and too little on local services - less glamorous perhaps, but more important to most people,"" he writes. He says the new plan helps larger cities but also smaller places and does not neglect short-distance services ""which people use every day"". He writes that it has become clear under the original plan ""high speed lines would not have reached the East Midlands and Yorkshire, until at best the early to mid 2040s"". The prime minister adds that while some people had called for the government to ""rigidly stick  to the old plans"", they were in effect ""condemning the North and the East Midlands to get nothing for ten years or more"". Danny SavageNorth of England correspondent If life is about compromises then a very big one has just
been put upon northern England. It doesnât have the same train commuter culture
as south east England because the stations and rail lines arenât there but it
does aspire to have something which allows better use of public transport. To
level up. Currently it is a land where new trains run on old lines. Yorkshire wanted to be at one end of HS2. A new high speed line across the Pennines has been
seriously talked about - arguably promised by Boris Johnson. The compromise is the new connection between Yorkshire
and Birmingham will be partially high speed and the new line between West
Yorkshire and Manchester will be high speed west of the Pennines. The rest of
the existing line via Huddersfield will be upgraded. Journey times will be quicker - and many people will be
satisfied with that. Others will be left wondering what could have been. At present, Leeds to Manchester Victoria takes 53 minutes
on the fastest service. This will get much better but not before years of
engineering work. Journey times cross country from York and the north-east will
also improve. Thereâs a pledge to give a large part of urban West Yorkshire a
mass transit system. That could finally see trams in Leeds - something talked
about for decades. Bradford gets a faster connection to Leeds but is left in the sidings again in transpennine terms. Â£96bn on the railways is a lot of money - change will be
noticeable - but it falls far short of aspirations this government built up. A commuter from Leeds who travels by train for work in Birmingham, Sheffield and London says the decision to scrap the HS2 line to Leeds is no surprise to him. Speaking to the BBC on the train to Birmingham Anthony Stalgis tells us: ""I knew this would happen"". âThe government is so
London-centric that the risk of HS2 turning into a project to expand the London
commuter belt was very high indeed. âIf the project had been
properly risk assessed, that risk would have led to starting from Leeds and
working down to make sure the risk didn't take place. âItâs hard not to believe
that scrapping the northern bit was the plan all along. âAs for the North, the rail
connections between Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield are a national disgrace. We
call it snail rail. Itâs quicker to drive in
some cases. âAs usual it's London making
decisions from London by Londoners."" Labour leader Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson has today ""ripped up"" his promises to take HS2 all the way to Leeds, and build a new line between the city and Manchester. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Bradford, he says the north of England has been betrayed. ""This was the first test of levelling up, and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North,"" he says. He adds that today's plan reveals the levelling up ambition is ""just a slogan"". A reminder on what levelling up is,here. Tony RoeBBC East Midlands political editor I've been travelling with the Prime Minister this morning. I joined him at Newark for a
short hop to Doncaster. He pored over a rail map and pointed out that HS2
is going to be delivered to the East Midlands despite earlier reports of its
demise. A multi-billion pound investment which will, however, only take the new
line to East Midlands Parkway. He also pledged the long-awaited and long-demanded electrification of the whole Midlands mainline which runs through Leicester and
Nottingham to Sheffield. And while HS2 will halt at the Parkway station near
East Midlands Airport, the line will continue to Toton and a new rail transport
hub will still be built there connecting local services. And it may not be the
end of the full eastern leg. That could still happen in the long term.

Here's a recap of what's been said:  You can see the full planhere,external(a word of warning it does come to 161 pages). The PM says the rail plans announced earlier will produce commuter benefits, even if it does destroy parts of the English countryside. ""We are not just digging huge swathes of new rail across virgin countryside through peaceful villages which is what some of the critics are saying we should be doing more of,"" he says. ""We are doing a bit of that, there's no doubt about it, we are building 100 miles of high speed line. But we are also improving and upgrading the commuter network to shorten journey times across the whole north of the country,"" he says. Asked how he will make sure people can afford to travel by train, he says: ""The way to cut costs on train travel is to modernise and electrify and that's what we are doing."" He says setting mass footfall will enable government to start to drive the cost down. The PM says HS2 plus Northern Powerhouse rail ""will offer for young people commuting in the Midlands and the North the same type of confidence about their daily lives, about their commutes, as people have been used to for a century in the south."" Conservative Huw Merriman, the chairman of the Transport Select Committee, has told the Commons that the prime minister promised that HS2 and Northern Powerhouse rail ""was not an either/or option"" but says that those in Leeds and Bradford may view it as ""neither"". ""This is the danger in selling perpetual sunlight and then leaving it for others to explain the arrival of moonlight,"" he says. He says that the new plan includes some ""fantastic projects"" which will slash journey times and better connect northern cities. He then asks, given the expense of electrification in the UK, what steps have been taken to ensure the projects will be delivered on time and on budget. Grant Shapps says the rail minister is carrying out an electrification challenge to bring the industry in and push them to build on electrification ""much faster than currently happens"".

This live page was written by Lauren Turner, Adam Durbin, Alexandra Fouche and Matt Murphy, and edited by John Hand and Emma Harrison. Thanks for reading and we hope you'll join us again soon. If you are just joining us here's what has been happening today: Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have announced tighter restrictions for unvaccinated people, in a bid to encourage vaccine uptake. The Czech government has approved rules which allow only those who
are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid in the past six
months to enter restaurants, attend certain events and use
various other services from Monday, the Reuters news agency reports. Slovakia took a similar step, in what Prime Minister Eduard
Heger describes as a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"" - echoing themove in Austria earlier this week. Both governments will also require testing at workplaces. ""The main goal of these measures is motivation for
vaccinations,"" Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtech says. With 58% of the population inoculated, the Czech vaccination
rate is below the European Union average, while Slovakia has the EU's
third-lowest rate, with 45% of the population inoculated. Spanish beach resort Benidorm has opened a Covid vaccination centre specifically for tourists to combat rising case numbers in the area. The clinic is located near the hotel district and was drawing queues of
tourists this week, while further mobile vaccination points will be
set up by Valencian health authorities in areas where big crowds gather, Reuters is reporting. Mayor
Antonio Perez tells the news agency they are extending a public service to tourists  and it ""sends a message of safety"" to people. Spain requires all visitors entering the country to present
either a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR test, but bars
and restaurants do not require vaccine passports. New figures have been released showing that 92.5% of staff in care homes for older adults in England have now had two doses of a Covid vaccine, as of 14 November. It means 7.5% of staff - 34,291 people - have not been fully vaccinated. They're the first figures to be released by NHS England since the 11 November deadline set by the government for all staff working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home to be vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. The NHS figures also show 21.7% of social care staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers were not fully jabbed as of 14 November - that's an estimated 108,510 people. Our reporters spoke to care workers when the deadline passed last week -read more on what they had to say here. The US has bought
10 million treatment courses of a Covid-19
antiviral drug,US President Joe Biden said on Thursday,external. The contract with pharmaceutical giantPfizer for its Paxlovid treatmentwill cost the US government $5.29bn (Â£3.93bn at today's exchange rate), the Reuters news agency reports. Biden says the delivery of the pills would start by the end of 2021, if it is authorised by US  regulators. In a statement, the president said his administration was making
preparations to ensure the pills would be easily accessible and
free. ""This is positive news,"" he says. ""This treatment could prove to be another critical tool in our arsenal that will accelerate our path out of the pandemic."" But, he adds, vaccines remain ""our strongest tool"". The Netherlands has reported its highest number of daily Covid infections, exceeding new 20,000 cases for the third day in a row, Reuters news agency reports. About 23,600 people tested positive for the virus, the country's
national health institute says - up from just under 21,000 a day
before. The country has already brought in a partial lockdown. Back now to the situation in Germany. As we've been reporting today the number of Covid cases in the country has hit a record high. But where are cases worst? Saxony is the German region that has currently been hardest hit by the fourth wave of coronavirus. The state - in the east of the country, which has Dresden as its capital - has the highest infection rate as well as the lowest vaccination rate. Because of its status, it's considering measures like closing concerts, theatres and football games to the public and closing bars and nightclubs, Bild newspaper says. Daily infections there have risen 14 times in the past month, Reuters has reported. Infection rates are also high in Bavaria, in the south-east, and more measures are being considered there. The UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures. Overall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old. More than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. The UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period. There were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. The UK government has named 50 companies given fast-track ""VIP"" contracts to supply protective equipment to the NHS. Eighteen of them were nominated by Conservative politicians, Department of Health and Social Care data shows - with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and former health secretary Matt Hancock involved. VIP contracts were introduced as the NHS struggled for masks, gloves, gowns and other safety equipment after the outbreak of coronavirus. The government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies offering to supply the equipment. Contracts would usually be opened to competing bids. The information on the firms,externalchosen for VIP contracts follows a freedom-of-information request by the Good Law Project campaign group. The government said that ""to save lives, we focused our efforts, resources and attention on sourcing PPE"", adding it stood by efforts made to protect staff. Read more here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Covid case
rates are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly
surveillance figures for England reveal. The report from
the UK Health Security Agency, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group
has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time. In recent
months, the 10-19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per
100,000 tested. It is too soon
to say what is behind the change and whether it will continue. In recent weeks
children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs. The data also
shows confirmed Covid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those
aged 80 plus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The widow of a top official dealing with Scotland's pandemic response, who died after contracting Covid, believes the full details of his illness were concealed to protect a troubled hospital's reputation. Andrew Slorance went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago, where his wife Louise believes he caught the virus - as well as another life-threatening infection. He was the Scottish government's head of response and communication unit, in charge of its handling of the Covid pandemic. His widow tells the BBC she believes officials wanted to protect the hospital, which is already the subject of a public inquiry, as well as its reputation, ""no matter what the cost"". The hospital's health board says it had been ""open and honest"" and there had been no attempt to conceal any information from the family. You can read more on what happenedhere. There have been some changes this week in the UK about who can get their booster jabs - and about teenagers' vaccinations. So what is the new guidance? Here's a recap. All over-40s in the UK can now have a booster jab, as long as it's been six months after their second vaccine. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed. Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according toUK Health Security Agency data,external. You can now get a third dose if you're in one of these categories:  Those aged 16 and 17 can now have a second vaccine, 12 weeks after their first jab. And pregnant women are being urged to take up their offer of a vaccine, as they can be particularly at risk. The changes follow new recommendations from the government's advisers, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. All the details arehere. This video can not be played Covid in Wales: Maternity visiting rules unfair, says mum Visitors should be allowed into maternity units in Wales without restrictions, a charity says. Since the pandemic started, some units have stopped all visiting while others have limited times parents can spend with newborns. The rules currently vary between health boards, with some of them including banning visits entirely, other limiting visits to a few hours and some only allowing designated partners in within certain times of the day. But with restrictions on movement and social distancing eased across the country, Birthrights wants hospital maternity units to also open up. The Welsh government says maternity services keep their rules under review and there was a ""delicate balance"" between protecting vulnerable individuals and allowing visiting. Read morehere. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin The debate in Germanyâs parliament today was emotional, with
plenty of finger-pointing for the sharp rise in infections. The mood in the
country is equally fractious, with commentators asking why politicians didnât
use the lull in infections during the summer, to prepare the booster campaign
and plan for a predictably tough winter. Some hospitals say they are at full capacity, and worry they will
be overwhelmed when the current high rates translate into more
hospitalisations. These
stark warnings mean that, in polls, most Germans support tougher measures. Until
now, excluding unvaccinated people from some activities has not sparked
widespread protest. In one survey, a majority supports allowing only vaccinated
people to access leisure services, such as restaurants. These measures have
been easy to implement. Customers have quickly become used to showing waiters
proof of vaccine before ordering food. The newer measures decided on Thursday might be more difficult to
implement. Transport trade unions say their members shouldnât have to police
the vaccine status of passengers because of potential aggression. And some
employers question how they can organise daily tests for workers. But
if the choice is between more deaths or making life more difficult for
unvaccinated people, the consensus in Germany is more restrictions for people
who donât want the jab. Germany is facing its highest case numbers since the coronavirus pandemic began. We've been looking at the pattern of how case numbers have been going up and down. There was a small peak early in the pandemic, if you look at the seven-day averages, but the first big wave peaked at the end of December. There was another surge - although not as big as the one at the end of 2020 - at the end of April before a decrease. There was a rise again to a new peak in September which plateaued for a while before rapidly climbing again to the new highs we see now. There's information on theJohns Hopkins world coronavirus map,externalas well, which breaks down the figures if you're keen for more detail. The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning there is a ""hard winter ahead"" for Europe. Asked by the BBC if it was concerned vaccines did not appear to be preventing a surge in cases, its regional director for Europe Hans Kluge says: ""Of course vaccines have been a game-changer. ""But far too many remain unvaccinated, so we have pockets in which the virus continues to spread and cause strain on local and national health systems."" He was speaking amid a surge in European countries, as we've been reporting on here today. This public health emergency is far from being over, and the current rise of cases in most countries in the region, caused by the combination of insufficient vaccination coverage, the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant, shows that a hard winter is ahead of us."" Dr Hans Kluge, WHO We were telling you earlier about Covid passes in Wales and Scotland - another country considering extending their use is Spain. The Basque Country wants to make it mandatory for people visiting bars, clubs or restaurants to show a vaccination certificate, reports Spanish newspaper El Pais. It would show whether they have been fully vaccinated, at least 14 days previously, if they have had Covid over the previous six months, or tested negative for the virus. Spanish regions are in charge of their own healthcare systems, including Covid-19 measures and vaccinations. Overall in Spain, 79% of the population is now fully vaccinated. The daily case rate is rising at the moment with latest 14-day figures showing 88.6 cases per 100,000 people. As we've been reporting, there has been some fierce debate in the German lower house of parliament over proposed new measures to curb the current spike in the country's cases. Here are some excerpts that give a flavour of what was said in the chamber.  More people will get infected and become ill, many of them seriously. That worries me deeply and I will say clearly: we are in an emergency situation, especially the hospitals and we must react now, resolutely and together, the government, the German states and communities. This is what today's parliamentary debate is about, as is customary in a democracy."" Katrin Goering-Eckardt, Green Party parliamentary chairwoman Today's debate is not about the conservatives or the [incoming] SPD, FDP and Greens government, it's about protecting our country and in order to do so, we are putting the right measures in place, ladies and gentlemen."" Marco Buschmann, Senior FDP lawmaker If you decide to go down that road with the majority you have here, against our and my proposals, please don't use someone else as a scapegoat every time or as a punching ball. If you want to represent the new majority here, you have to take on the responsibility. No-one can relieve you of that duty."" Jens Spahn, Outgoing Health Minister Â© 2025 BBC.

"A proposed HS2 line to Leeds will not go ahead, the government has confirmed That goes back on previous pledges that the high-speed route to Leeds would be built Transport Secretary Grant Shapps outlined the government's rail plan in the Commons A Â£96bn improvement programme will target services in the Midlands and northern England Labour criticise the new plans as ""a betrayal"" of promises to ""level up"" the country Mr Shapps says Â£625m will be spent on the electrification of lines between Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds HS2 was originally meant to connect London with the city centres of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds But Mr Shapps says ""a rethink was needed"" on HS2 and claims the new plan will deliver improvements sooner Edited by Emma Owen HS2 platforms in Manchester Piccadilly would be covered by a folded roof We're winding up our live coverage now. Thanks for joining us. As we've been reporting, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs earlier that his plan would include the scrapping of HS2's eastern line to Leeds. If you'd like to know more about the new direction for HS2, have a read ofour explainer. For more local and political reaction to the government's new rail plan, take a look at some of our latest storieshereandhere. And what do politicians mean when they say 'levelling up'? Get the lowdownhere. Today's live page was written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, Mary O'Connor and Paul Seddon. It was edited by Emma Owen. Before we go, we just want to tell you what passengers on a train from Hull to Leeds have been saying about theIntergrated Rail Plan,external. Businessman Phil Jones said: ""I'm more interested in the link between Hull and Manchester across the north than I've ever been about HS2 and want towns across the north better connected by rail and by electrification and by a better service in general."" HS2 will not go to Leeds as planned but will stop at East Midlands Parkway and the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme will not deliver a new line between Manchester and Leeds. However, the transport secretary said there will be a high speed link between Manchester and on to West Yorkshire. Meanwhile commuter Katie Haddock  said: ""It's a massive disappointment for me because I've just started a new job working in Leeds and London and I'm having to decide whether I can continue with that, because the commute is such a problem and really affects daily life. The government says its Â£96bn plan is an ""ambitious and unparalleled programme"" to overhaul inter-city links across the north and Midlands. It says it will ""study how best to take HS2 trains into Leeds"" and will look at a mass transport system for West Yorkshire. We're going to be wrapping up our coverage shortly so here's a reminder of what has happened today:  You can see the full planhere,external. Residents in the East Midlands towns and villages affected by the original HS2 scheme say they are relieved that part of the route is being axed. Geoff Cotton, who has lived in Trowell since 1988, says he would have seen HS2 come past his house. ""Obviously it's pleasing from a selfish point of view, but I do also feel that the way the economy is working at the moment with people working from home more, the need to travel down to London fast isn't as significant as it would have been,"" he says. However, he criticises the amount of time the decision has taken. ""People haven't been able to move on with their lives because they can't sell their properties."" Jill Sisson, who has lived in Trowell for more than 50 years, says she is ""quite happy"" her home will no longer be demolished. ""To have been living with all this pressure is very hard. I don't think it's been handled very well. One minute you're hearing one thing and the next minute you're hearing something else. ""It leaves you up in the air as to what's going to happen. It's all the uncertainty."" You can read more reaction from the East Midlandshere. More reaction to today's announcement... Newcastle North MPCatherine McKinnell, Labour, says people
will struggle to understand why the government ""expects Northerners to be
grateful for piecemeal improvements to our creaking, 20th century rail system"" when there are state-of-the-art HS2 links that benefit the South and Crossrail in London. She says it is ""mend and make do"" for the North. She describes the plan as a ""major strategic blunder"" and says it was an opportunity to transform the North. Andy McDonald, Labour MP for Middlesborough, says that the North East has been forgotten for too long, with rail commuters facing poor service on inadequate infrastructure. He says: ""Itâs a different world
compared with the South East."" ConservativeAndy Carter,Warrington South MP, says it is ""really reassuring"" to see Warrington feature prominently in the government's rail plan. He says the new high speed line between Warrington and Manchester will release capacity on the existing network and will have benefits for the town centre. But he says that he wants to see those benefits realised as soon as possible, adding ""people cannot wait forever to see material differences"". And Sheffield MPLouise Haigh, Labour, is critical of the plan. ""This report was more than 12 months overdue, and it definitely was not worth the wait. ""The prime minister has once again shown people across the north of England that they do not matter to him or his government. ""This is another in a long line of broken promises by this prime minister to the people of the North."" More union reaction, and Unite has described the governmentâs
decision to cancel the HS2 spur to Leeds as an ""act of industrial vandalism."" Unite national officer for construction Jerry Swain said: ""This decision has put back national infrastructure planning by a generation. It is nothing short of industrial vandalism. âBy cancelling the Leeds spur the government's demonstrating it's not serious about its levelling up agenda and that its manifesto commitment to improving regional connectivity was nothing but hot air. ""HS2 should be the gold standard of construction projects for the next decade and beyond. The entire UK should be benefiting from this development."" The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, said the Â£96bn programme will ""transform services in the north and the Midlands,"" calling the scheme the ""largest single rail investment ever made by a UK government"".  Reality Check Announcing the Integrated Rail Plan, Transport Secretary
Grant Shapps spoke not just of rail investment but of wider transport
commitments. He said the plan was also about those places that âconnect
and interactâ with HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail,
adding âwe are investing Â£2bn in walking and cyclingâ. However, this is not a new funding announcement. In May last year, the government announced Â£2bn for walking
and cycling as part of a UK-wide package toâboost greener, active transportâ.,external Some reaction has been coming in from business leaders and travel groups. Matthew Fell, chief policy director at theConfederation of British Industry, says the plan involves significant investment which goes some way ""towards modernising our ageing rail networks"". But he says businesses across the Midlands and northern England will be ""justifiably disappointed to see the goalposts have moved at the eleventh hour"". Sir John Peace, chair of transport research groupMidlands Connectsays while the plans have changed ""there are a lot of positives in here and lots of things to be excited about"". He says the government ""should move as quickly as possible to get spades in the ground and bring benefits to local people sooner"". Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdogTransport Focus, says to help meet decarbonisation targets sustained investment in public transport in the North and Midlands must continue. ""Ultimately passengers will judge the success of these plans on the extent to which they meet their priorities for improvement: more punctual, reliable services, increased capacity and the chance of getting a seat on the train,"" he says. Andy Bagnall, director general of theRail Delivery Group,which represents independent train operators, says rail has a vital role to play in ""driving the economy"" and a ""fair, clean recovery"" - with millions of people set to benefit from boosting connectivity between northern cities and the Midlands. However, he warns that ""leaving out key pieces of the jigsaw will inevitably hold back the ability for the railways to power the levelling up agenda and the drive to net zero"". Reality Check The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a business pressure group chaired by former chancellor George Osborne, has been looking at the Â£96bn rail investment announced by the government. It estimates the full HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail projects, as previously planned, would have ended up costing about Â£127.5bn. That estimate would make the alternative Â£96bn programme set out on Thursday at least Â£30bn cheaper. The pressure group reckons about Â£17bn of the savings will come from the difference in cost between the scrapped eastern leg of HS2 to Leeds and the proposed new lines and upgrades proposed for the area. The rest comes from cheaper options on Northern Powerhouse Rail. Theyâre working through the figures in the governmentâs publication and expect to have more precise numbers later in the day. Estimates of costs of big rail projects are notoriously unreliable. When HS2 was first announced, the whole thing was only supposed to cost about Â£33bn. Nonetheless, some might argue it's hard to describe any of the Â£96bn as new money if itâs a result of scrapping some rail projects and spending the money on alternatives. We have asked the Department for Transport for its response to these costings. The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) has given its reaction to the government's plans - and concluded that Bradford will be ""the biggest loser"". A report out earlier this week found the city hasthe worst connections of any city in the UK, despite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located. It came bottom of the list due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections. There are only four trains to London, for example, each day. The West Yorkshire city had been hoping to be connected to Manchester and Leeds along a new high-speed line, which today's plan confirms will not go ahead in full. Instead, there will be a mixture of newly-built line and upgrades to existing track. The government says journey times to and from Bradford will still be cut. But Manuel Cortes, the TSSA's general secretary, says the plan shows the government has ""sold out the North with more broken promises"".  We're still catching up on a few threads from the Commons discussion earlier, and Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park, made the point that today's announcement scraps ""much-needed"" plans to improve rail capacity and connections, and comes weeks afterthe Chancellor announced cuts to domestic flight taxes. She challenged the transport secretary to answer ""how these plans together deliver against either of their stated objectives to level up or to tackle climate change?"" Shapps responded by saying: ""In all of these decisions we're having to balance the wider purse, the taxpayers' money."" He notes the expenditure on rail, adding ""it's always my goal to get more people travelling on the trains"" and that ""these plans will help that"". Sandra Haith (far right) has spent years fighting the plans Grant Shapps' announcement - in particular news that HS2's eastern leg is to be scrapped  - has been met with elation by some campaigners in south Yorkshire. Sandra Haith has spent five and half years fighting the original plans, which would have seen the line cut through the east side of the village of Bramley, Rotherham, as it followed the M18 motorway. She says: ""Not only as a resident of Bramley, but as a taxpayer, it's a complete waste of money. ""The eastern leg costs a lot of money and it basically connects two cities. We can't get on it. We've got all the pain and no gain. ""This village and other villages have been under this blight for five and a half years. ""People have already sold up and moved out because they can't live with the stress."" You can read morehere. The government has now published itsIntegrated Rail Plan,externaland in a foreword, Boris Johnson says the old plans had ""got the balance wrong"". ""They focused too much on showpiece, high speed links and too little on local services - less glamorous perhaps, but more important to most people,"" he writes. He says the new plan helps larger cities but also smaller places and does not neglect short-distance services ""which people use every day"". He writes that it has become clear under the original plan ""high speed lines would not have reached the East Midlands and Yorkshire, until at best the early to mid 2040s"". The prime minister adds that while some people had called for the government to ""rigidly stick  to the old plans"", they were in effect ""condemning the North and the East Midlands to get nothing for ten years or more"". Danny SavageNorth of England correspondent If life is about compromises then a very big one has just
been put upon northern England. It doesnât have the same train commuter culture
as south east England because the stations and rail lines arenât there but it
does aspire to have something which allows better use of public transport. To
level up. Currently it is a land where new trains run on old lines. Yorkshire wanted to be at one end of HS2. A new high speed line across the Pennines has been
seriously talked about - arguably promised by Boris Johnson. The compromise is the new connection between Yorkshire
and Birmingham will be partially high speed and the new line between West
Yorkshire and Manchester will be high speed west of the Pennines. The rest of
the existing line via Huddersfield will be upgraded. Journey times will be quicker - and many people will be
satisfied with that. Others will be left wondering what could have been. At present, Leeds to Manchester Victoria takes 53 minutes
on the fastest service. This will get much better but not before years of
engineering work. Journey times cross country from York and the north-east will
also improve. Thereâs a pledge to give a large part of urban West Yorkshire a
mass transit system. That could finally see trams in Leeds - something talked
about for decades. Bradford gets a faster connection to Leeds but is left in the sidings again in transpennine terms. Â£96bn on the railways is a lot of money - change will be
noticeable - but it falls far short of aspirations this government built up. A commuter from Leeds who travels by train for work in Birmingham, Sheffield and London says the decision to scrap the HS2 line to Leeds is no surprise to him. Speaking to the BBC on the train to Birmingham Anthony Stalgis tells us: ""I knew this would happen"". âThe government is so
London-centric that the risk of HS2 turning into a project to expand the London
commuter belt was very high indeed. âIf the project had been
properly risk assessed, that risk would have led to starting from Leeds and
working down to make sure the risk didn't take place. âItâs hard not to believe
that scrapping the northern bit was the plan all along. âAs for the North, the rail
connections between Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield are a national disgrace. We
call it snail rail. Itâs quicker to drive in
some cases. âAs usual it's London making
decisions from London by Londoners."" Labour leader Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson has today ""ripped up"" his promises to take HS2 all the way to Leeds, and build a new line between the city and Manchester. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Bradford, he says the north of England has been betrayed. ""This was the first test of levelling up, and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North,"" he says. He adds that today's plan reveals the levelling up ambition is ""just a slogan"". A reminder on what levelling up is,here. Tony RoeBBC East Midlands political editor I've been travelling with the Prime Minister this morning. I joined him at Newark for a
short hop to Doncaster. He pored over a rail map and pointed out that HS2
is going to be delivered to the East Midlands despite earlier reports of its
demise. A multi-billion pound investment which will, however, only take the new
line to East Midlands Parkway. He also pledged the long-awaited and long-demanded electrification of the whole Midlands mainline which runs through Leicester and
Nottingham to Sheffield. And while HS2 will halt at the Parkway station near
East Midlands Airport, the line will continue to Toton and a new rail transport
hub will still be built there connecting local services. And it may not be the
end of the full eastern leg. That could still happen in the long term.

Here's a recap of what's been said:  You can see the full planhere,external(a word of warning it does come to 161 pages). The PM says the rail plans announced earlier will produce commuter benefits, even if it does destroy parts of the English countryside. ""We are not just digging huge swathes of new rail across virgin countryside through peaceful villages which is what some of the critics are saying we should be doing more of,"" he says. ""We are doing a bit of that, there's no doubt about it, we are building 100 miles of high speed line. But we are also improving and upgrading the commuter network to shorten journey times across the whole north of the country,"" he says. Asked how he will make sure people can afford to travel by train, he says: ""The way to cut costs on train travel is to modernise and electrify and that's what we are doing."" He says setting mass footfall will enable government to start to drive the cost down. The PM says HS2 plus Northern Powerhouse rail ""will offer for young people commuting in the Midlands and the North the same type of confidence about their daily lives, about their commutes, as people have been used to for a century in the south."" Conservative Huw Merriman, the chairman of the Transport Select Committee, has told the Commons that the prime minister promised that HS2 and Northern Powerhouse rail ""was not an either/or option"" but says that those in Leeds and Bradford may view it as ""neither"". ""This is the danger in selling perpetual sunlight and then leaving it for others to explain the arrival of moonlight,"" he says. He says that the new plan includes some ""fantastic projects"" which will slash journey times and better connect northern cities. He then asks, given the expense of electrification in the UK, what steps have been taken to ensure the projects will be delivered on time and on budget. Grant Shapps says the rail minister is carrying out an electrification challenge to bring the industry in and push them to build on electrification ""much faster than currently happens"".

"Police are investigating how the baby ended up in a drain A five-day-old baby girl, who was rescued from a drain where she was left to die in the Indian city of Mumbai, is recovering in a local hospital.

Police said residents found the baby after a group of cats gathered at a spot along the road and began creating a ruckus - hissing, and purring loudly.

"Germany's Covid cases hit another high with 65,371 daily cases recorded Chancellor Angela Merkel has said a fourth wave of Covid is ""hitting us with full force"" German MPs vote in favour of a new set of measures, including access to public transport only for people who have been vaccinated or tested Germany's upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat, will consider the measures on Friday Much of Europe is facing a spike in cases, with new measures introduced in countries including Austria and Belgium The World Health Organization is warning of a ""hard winter ahead"" for Europe Covid passes may be used over Christmas in order to keep pubs and restaurants open, the Welsh government says No decision will be made on introducing the pass to the hospitality sector until early December, First Minister Mark Drakeford says We're bringing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic around the world to a close. This live page was written by Lauren Turner, Adam Durbin, Alexandra Fouche and Matt Murphy, and edited by John Hand and Emma Harrison. Thanks for reading and we hope you'll join us again soon. If you are just joining us here's what has been happening today: Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have announced tighter restrictions for unvaccinated people, in a bid to encourage vaccine uptake. The Czech government has approved rules which allow only those who
are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid in the past six
months to enter restaurants, attend certain events and use
various other services from Monday, the Reuters news agency reports. Slovakia took a similar step, in what Prime Minister Eduard
Heger describes as a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"" - echoing themove in Austria earlier this week. Both governments will also require testing at workplaces. ""The main goal of these measures is motivation for
vaccinations,"" Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtech says. With 58% of the population inoculated, the Czech vaccination
rate is below the European Union average, while Slovakia has the EU's
third-lowest rate, with 45% of the population inoculated. Spanish beach resort Benidorm has opened a Covid vaccination centre specifically for tourists to combat rising case numbers in the area. The clinic is located near the hotel district and was drawing queues of
tourists this week, while further mobile vaccination points will be
set up by Valencian health authorities in areas where big crowds gather, Reuters is reporting. Mayor
Antonio Perez tells the news agency they are extending a public service to tourists  and it ""sends a message of safety"" to people. Spain requires all visitors entering the country to present
either a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR test, but bars
and restaurants do not require vaccine passports. New figures have been released showing that 92.5% of staff in care homes for older adults in England have now had two doses of a Covid vaccine, as of 14 November. It means 7.5% of staff - 34,291 people - have not been fully vaccinated. They're the first figures to be released by NHS England since the 11 November deadline set by the government for all staff working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home to be vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. The NHS figures also show 21.7% of social care staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers were not fully jabbed as of 14 November - that's an estimated 108,510 people. Our reporters spoke to care workers when the deadline passed last week -read more on what they had to say here. The US has bought
10 million treatment courses of a Covid-19
antiviral drug,US President Joe Biden said on Thursday,external. The contract with pharmaceutical giantPfizer for its Paxlovid treatmentwill cost the US government $5.29bn (Â£3.93bn at today's exchange rate), the Reuters news agency reports. Biden says the delivery of the pills would start by the end of 2021, if it is authorised by US  regulators. In a statement, the president said his administration was making
preparations to ensure the pills would be easily accessible and
free. ""This is positive news,"" he says. ""This treatment could prove to be another critical tool in our arsenal that will accelerate our path out of the pandemic."" But, he adds, vaccines remain ""our strongest tool"". The Netherlands has reported its highest number of daily Covid infections, exceeding new 20,000 cases for the third day in a row, Reuters news agency reports. About 23,600 people tested positive for the virus, the country's
national health institute says - up from just under 21,000 a day
before. The country has already brought in a partial lockdown. Back now to the situation in Germany. As we've been reporting today the number of Covid cases in the country has hit a record high. But where are cases worst? Saxony is the German region that has currently been hardest hit by the fourth wave of coronavirus. The state - in the east of the country, which has Dresden as its capital - has the highest infection rate as well as the lowest vaccination rate. Because of its status, it's considering measures like closing concerts, theatres and football games to the public and closing bars and nightclubs, Bild newspaper says. Daily infections there have risen 14 times in the past month, Reuters has reported. Infection rates are also high in Bavaria, in the south-east, and more measures are being considered there. The UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures. Overall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old. More than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. The UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period. There were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. The UK government has named 50 companies given fast-track ""VIP"" contracts to supply protective equipment to the NHS. Eighteen of them were nominated by Conservative politicians, Department of Health and Social Care data shows - with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and former health secretary Matt Hancock involved. VIP contracts were introduced as the NHS struggled for masks, gloves, gowns and other safety equipment after the outbreak of coronavirus. The government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies offering to supply the equipment. Contracts would usually be opened to competing bids. The information on the firms,externalchosen for VIP contracts follows a freedom-of-information request by the Good Law Project campaign group. The government said that ""to save lives, we focused our efforts, resources and attention on sourcing PPE"", adding it stood by efforts made to protect staff. Read more here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Covid case
rates are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly
surveillance figures for England reveal. The report from
the UK Health Security Agency, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group
has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time. In recent
months, the 10-19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per
100,000 tested. It is too soon
to say what is behind the change and whether it will continue. In recent weeks
children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs. The data also
shows confirmed Covid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those
aged 80 plus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The widow of a top official dealing with Scotland's pandemic response, who died after contracting Covid, believes the full details of his illness were concealed to protect a troubled hospital's reputation. Andrew Slorance went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago, where his wife Louise believes he caught the virus - as well as another life-threatening infection. He was the Scottish government's head of response and communication unit, in charge of its handling of the Covid pandemic. His widow tells the BBC she believes officials wanted to protect the hospital, which is already the subject of a public inquiry, as well as its reputation, ""no matter what the cost"". The hospital's health board says it had been ""open and honest"" and there had been no attempt to conceal any information from the family. You can read more on what happenedhere. There have been some changes this week in the UK about who can get their booster jabs - and about teenagers' vaccinations. So what is the new guidance? Here's a recap. All over-40s in the UK can now have a booster jab, as long as it's been six months after their second vaccine. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed. Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according toUK Health Security Agency data,external. You can now get a third dose if you're in one of these categories:  Those aged 16 and 17 can now have a second vaccine, 12 weeks after their first jab. And pregnant women are being urged to take up their offer of a vaccine, as they can be particularly at risk. The changes follow new recommendations from the government's advisers, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. All the details arehere. This video can not be played Covid in Wales: Maternity visiting rules unfair, says mum Visitors should be allowed into maternity units in Wales without restrictions, a charity says. Since the pandemic started, some units have stopped all visiting while others have limited times parents can spend with newborns. The rules currently vary between health boards, with some of them including banning visits entirely, other limiting visits to a few hours and some only allowing designated partners in within certain times of the day. But with restrictions on movement and social distancing eased across the country, Birthrights wants hospital maternity units to also open up. The Welsh government says maternity services keep their rules under review and there was a ""delicate balance"" between protecting vulnerable individuals and allowing visiting. Read morehere. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin The debate in Germanyâs parliament today was emotional, with
plenty of finger-pointing for the sharp rise in infections. The mood in the
country is equally fractious, with commentators asking why politicians didnât
use the lull in infections during the summer, to prepare the booster campaign
and plan for a predictably tough winter. Some hospitals say they are at full capacity, and worry they will
be overwhelmed when the current high rates translate into more
hospitalisations. These
stark warnings mean that, in polls, most Germans support tougher measures. Until
now, excluding unvaccinated people from some activities has not sparked
widespread protest. In one survey, a majority supports allowing only vaccinated
people to access leisure services, such as restaurants. These measures have
been easy to implement. Customers have quickly become used to showing waiters
proof of vaccine before ordering food. The newer measures decided on Thursday might be more difficult to
implement. Transport trade unions say their members shouldnât have to police
the vaccine status of passengers because of potential aggression. And some
employers question how they can organise daily tests for workers. But
if the choice is between more deaths or making life more difficult for
unvaccinated people, the consensus in Germany is more restrictions for people
who donât want the jab. Germany is facing its highest case numbers since the coronavirus pandemic began. We've been looking at the pattern of how case numbers have been going up and down. There was a small peak early in the pandemic, if you look at the seven-day averages, but the first big wave peaked at the end of December. There was another surge - although not as big as the one at the end of 2020 - at the end of April before a decrease. There was a rise again to a new peak in September which plateaued for a while before rapidly climbing again to the new highs we see now. There's information on theJohns Hopkins world coronavirus map,externalas well, which breaks down the figures if you're keen for more detail. The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning there is a ""hard winter ahead"" for Europe. Asked by the BBC if it was concerned vaccines did not appear to be preventing a surge in cases, its regional director for Europe Hans Kluge says: ""Of course vaccines have been a game-changer. ""But far too many remain unvaccinated, so we have pockets in which the virus continues to spread and cause strain on local and national health systems."" He was speaking amid a surge in European countries, as we've been reporting on here today. This public health emergency is far from being over, and the current rise of cases in most countries in the region, caused by the combination of insufficient vaccination coverage, the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant, shows that a hard winter is ahead of us."" Dr Hans Kluge, WHO We were telling you earlier about Covid passes in Wales and Scotland - another country considering extending their use is Spain. The Basque Country wants to make it mandatory for people visiting bars, clubs or restaurants to show a vaccination certificate, reports Spanish newspaper El Pais. It would show whether they have been fully vaccinated, at least 14 days previously, if they have had Covid over the previous six months, or tested negative for the virus. Spanish regions are in charge of their own healthcare systems, including Covid-19 measures and vaccinations. Overall in Spain, 79% of the population is now fully vaccinated. The daily case rate is rising at the moment with latest 14-day figures showing 88.6 cases per 100,000 people. As we've been reporting, there has been some fierce debate in the German lower house of parliament over proposed new measures to curb the current spike in the country's cases. Here are some excerpts that give a flavour of what was said in the chamber.  More people will get infected and become ill, many of them seriously. That worries me deeply and I will say clearly: we are in an emergency situation, especially the hospitals and we must react now, resolutely and together, the government, the German states and communities. This is what today's parliamentary debate is about, as is customary in a democracy."" Katrin Goering-Eckardt, Green Party parliamentary chairwoman Today's debate is not about the conservatives or the [incoming] SPD, FDP and Greens government, it's about protecting our country and in order to do so, we are putting the right measures in place, ladies and gentlemen."" Marco Buschmann, Senior FDP lawmaker If you decide to go down that road with the majority you have here, against our and my proposals, please don't use someone else as a scapegoat every time or as a punching ball. If you want to represent the new majority here, you have to take on the responsibility. No-one can relieve you of that duty."" Jens Spahn, Outgoing Health Minister Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Michelle says: ""People think it's poor parenting... they don't really understand."" A couple are spending hours hunting for a specific type of Walkers crisp amid a national shortage as it is one of the only things their daughter will eat. Due to an eating disorder, Walkers oven baked sea salt-flavour crisps form a major part of the diet of four-year-old Ava, from Narborough, Leicestershire. But her mother Michelle says she is struggling to find any. Walkers said it was working to resolve the supply problems and apologised for the inconvenience. The disruption, which started last month, is due to a glitch caused by an IT upgrade. Michelle said she tried to shop for the packets online, but even stores advertising the product as in stock told her they had run out Ava has a number of conditions, including avoidant or restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and a condition that affects her development. According to her mother, she only eats these crisps, toastie waffles and a specific kind of baby fruit puree. She only drinks sweetened almond milk and a prescription vitamin mix. Michelle said Ava would rather go on a drip than eat something she does not like. They have been struggling to get hold of the crisps for almost a month. At one point Ava, who usually eats two packets a day, was without the crisps for five days and became lethargic and withdrawn. ""When your child relies on a food, and you can't get it, it's really hard,"" Michelle said. ""[Me and my husband] go looking round the shops for the crisps every day for an hour or two. ""We have a big extended family and everyone is looking out for them too. ""There's not a huge nutritional value in the crisps but the salt helps. It makes her drink more. ""[If she doesn't have them] it makes her really sleep, she lays around and doesn't have enough energy."" ""Our big fear is having to go to hospital and if we cannot find these crisps, that's 100% a possibility,"" she added. ""It makes me very, very anxious. What seems like such a simple thing is huge for her."" She added many children with disorders that limit their eating tend to favour crisps, and she was aware of many families through social media who were also struggling. There have been reports of empty shelves in some shops across the country On Thursday, Michelle told the BBC News Channel the family had received messages online from people around the country offering to supply them with crisps. She added: ""There is a lot of people that experience this at all ages, but there has been a lot of judgement and a lot of very, very negative comments. ""This is a registered eating disorder and a lot of people don't really understand learning disabilities, autism, sensory eating or ARFID so there are misconceptions about what it is."" Supply disruption is set to continue for a few more weeks Nicole Kirkland, co-founder of charity ARFID Awareness UK, said many often looked down on the condition and those dealing with it. She said: ""It often deals with complex carbohydrates and processed foods, just by the very nature that they are consistent, so you end up with crisps, white bread, cereal or fast food fries, so it can come across as lazy parenting. ""It really opens itself up to judgement but this is not just a kid that is a fussy eater. ""The mum is doing the best she can and unfortunately there is very little in the way of help and support for people out there."" Walkers has said supply issues are expected to continue for several more weeks. The Leicester-based firm is prioritising its more popular crisp flavours, such as cheese and onion and salt and vinegar. A spokeswoman said: ""We're doing everything we can to increase production and get people's favourites back on shelves. ""We're very sorry for the inconvenience caused.""

HS2 will not go to Leeds as planned but will stop at East Midlands Parkway and the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme will not deliver a new line between Manchester and Leeds. However, the transport secretary said there will be a high speed link between Manchester and on to West Yorkshire. Meanwhile commuter Katie Haddock  said: ""It's a massive disappointment for me because I've just started a new job working in Leeds and London and I'm having to decide whether I can continue with that, because the commute is such a problem and really affects daily life. The government says its Â£96bn plan is an ""ambitious and unparalleled programme"" to overhaul inter-city links across the north and Midlands. It says it will ""study how best to take HS2 trains into Leeds"" and will look at a mass transport system for West Yorkshire. We're going to be wrapping up our coverage shortly so here's a reminder of what has happened today:  You can see the full planhere,external. Residents in the East Midlands towns and villages affected by the original HS2 scheme say they are relieved that part of the route is being axed. Geoff Cotton, who has lived in Trowell since 1988, says he would have seen HS2 come past his house. ""Obviously it's pleasing from a selfish point of view, but I do also feel that the way the economy is working at the moment with people working from home more, the need to travel down to London fast isn't as significant as it would have been,"" he says. However, he criticises the amount of time the decision has taken. ""People haven't been able to move on with their lives because they can't sell their properties."" Jill Sisson, who has lived in Trowell for more than 50 years, says she is ""quite happy"" her home will no longer be demolished. ""To have been living with all this pressure is very hard. I don't think it's been handled very well. One minute you're hearing one thing and the next minute you're hearing something else. ""It leaves you up in the air as to what's going to happen. It's all the uncertainty."" You can read more reaction from the East Midlandshere. More reaction to today's announcement... Newcastle North MPCatherine McKinnell, Labour, says people
will struggle to understand why the government ""expects Northerners to be
grateful for piecemeal improvements to our creaking, 20th century rail system"" when there are state-of-the-art HS2 links that benefit the South and Crossrail in London. She says it is ""mend and make do"" for the North. She describes the plan as a ""major strategic blunder"" and says it was an opportunity to transform the North. Andy McDonald, Labour MP for Middlesborough, says that the North East has been forgotten for too long, with rail commuters facing poor service on inadequate infrastructure. He says: ""Itâs a different world
compared with the South East."" ConservativeAndy Carter,Warrington South MP, says it is ""really reassuring"" to see Warrington feature prominently in the government's rail plan. He says the new high speed line between Warrington and Manchester will release capacity on the existing network and will have benefits for the town centre. But he says that he wants to see those benefits realised as soon as possible, adding ""people cannot wait forever to see material differences"". And Sheffield MPLouise Haigh, Labour, is critical of the plan. ""This report was more than 12 months overdue, and it definitely was not worth the wait. ""The prime minister has once again shown people across the north of England that they do not matter to him or his government. ""This is another in a long line of broken promises by this prime minister to the people of the North."" More union reaction, and Unite has described the governmentâs
decision to cancel the HS2 spur to Leeds as an ""act of industrial vandalism."" Unite national officer for construction Jerry Swain said: ""This decision has put back national infrastructure planning by a generation. It is nothing short of industrial vandalism. âBy cancelling the Leeds spur the government's demonstrating it's not serious about its levelling up agenda and that its manifesto commitment to improving regional connectivity was nothing but hot air. ""HS2 should be the gold standard of construction projects for the next decade and beyond. The entire UK should be benefiting from this development."" The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, said the Â£96bn programme will ""transform services in the north and the Midlands,"" calling the scheme the ""largest single rail investment ever made by a UK government"".  Reality Check Announcing the Integrated Rail Plan, Transport Secretary
Grant Shapps spoke not just of rail investment but of wider transport
commitments. He said the plan was also about those places that âconnect
and interactâ with HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail,
adding âwe are investing Â£2bn in walking and cyclingâ. However, this is not a new funding announcement. In May last year, the government announced Â£2bn for walking
and cycling as part of a UK-wide package toâboost greener, active transportâ.,external Some reaction has been coming in from business leaders and travel groups. Matthew Fell, chief policy director at theConfederation of British Industry, says the plan involves significant investment which goes some way ""towards modernising our ageing rail networks"". But he says businesses across the Midlands and northern England will be ""justifiably disappointed to see the goalposts have moved at the eleventh hour"". Sir John Peace, chair of transport research groupMidlands Connectsays while the plans have changed ""there are a lot of positives in here and lots of things to be excited about"". He says the government ""should move as quickly as possible to get spades in the ground and bring benefits to local people sooner"". Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdogTransport Focus, says to help meet decarbonisation targets sustained investment in public transport in the North and Midlands must continue. ""Ultimately passengers will judge the success of these plans on the extent to which they meet their priorities for improvement: more punctual, reliable services, increased capacity and the chance of getting a seat on the train,"" he says. Andy Bagnall, director general of theRail Delivery Group,which represents independent train operators, says rail has a vital role to play in ""driving the economy"" and a ""fair, clean recovery"" - with millions of people set to benefit from boosting connectivity between northern cities and the Midlands. However, he warns that ""leaving out key pieces of the jigsaw will inevitably hold back the ability for the railways to power the levelling up agenda and the drive to net zero"". Reality Check The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a business pressure group chaired by former chancellor George Osborne, has been looking at the Â£96bn rail investment announced by the government. It estimates the full HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail projects, as previously planned, would have ended up costing about Â£127.5bn. That estimate would make the alternative Â£96bn programme set out on Thursday at least Â£30bn cheaper. The pressure group reckons about Â£17bn of the savings will come from the difference in cost between the scrapped eastern leg of HS2 to Leeds and the proposed new lines and upgrades proposed for the area. The rest comes from cheaper options on Northern Powerhouse Rail. Theyâre working through the figures in the governmentâs publication and expect to have more precise numbers later in the day. Estimates of costs of big rail projects are notoriously unreliable. When HS2 was first announced, the whole thing was only supposed to cost about Â£33bn. Nonetheless, some might argue it's hard to describe any of the Â£96bn as new money if itâs a result of scrapping some rail projects and spending the money on alternatives. We have asked the Department for Transport for its response to these costings. The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) has given its reaction to the government's plans - and concluded that Bradford will be ""the biggest loser"". A report out earlier this week found the city hasthe worst connections of any city in the UK, despite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located. It came bottom of the list due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections. There are only four trains to London, for example, each day. The West Yorkshire city had been hoping to be connected to Manchester and Leeds along a new high-speed line, which today's plan confirms will not go ahead in full. Instead, there will be a mixture of newly-built line and upgrades to existing track. The government says journey times to and from Bradford will still be cut. But Manuel Cortes, the TSSA's general secretary, says the plan shows the government has ""sold out the North with more broken promises"".  We're still catching up on a few threads from the Commons discussion earlier, and Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park, made the point that today's announcement scraps ""much-needed"" plans to improve rail capacity and connections, and comes weeks afterthe Chancellor announced cuts to domestic flight taxes. She challenged the transport secretary to answer ""how these plans together deliver against either of their stated objectives to level up or to tackle climate change?"" Shapps responded by saying: ""In all of these decisions we're having to balance the wider purse, the taxpayers' money."" He notes the expenditure on rail, adding ""it's always my goal to get more people travelling on the trains"" and that ""these plans will help that"". Sandra Haith (far right) has spent years fighting the plans Grant Shapps' announcement - in particular news that HS2's eastern leg is to be scrapped  - has been met with elation by some campaigners in south Yorkshire. Sandra Haith has spent five and half years fighting the original plans, which would have seen the line cut through the east side of the village of Bramley, Rotherham, as it followed the M18 motorway. She says: ""Not only as a resident of Bramley, but as a taxpayer, it's a complete waste of money. ""The eastern leg costs a lot of money and it basically connects two cities. We can't get on it. We've got all the pain and no gain. ""This village and other villages have been under this blight for five and a half years. ""People have already sold up and moved out because they can't live with the stress."" You can read morehere. The government has now published itsIntegrated Rail Plan,externaland in a foreword, Boris Johnson says the old plans had ""got the balance wrong"". ""They focused too much on showpiece, high speed links and too little on local services - less glamorous perhaps, but more important to most people,"" he writes. He says the new plan helps larger cities but also smaller places and does not neglect short-distance services ""which people use every day"". He writes that it has become clear under the original plan ""high speed lines would not have reached the East Midlands and Yorkshire, until at best the early to mid 2040s"". The prime minister adds that while some people had called for the government to ""rigidly stick  to the old plans"", they were in effect ""condemning the North and the East Midlands to get nothing for ten years or more"". Danny SavageNorth of England correspondent If life is about compromises then a very big one has just
been put upon northern England. It doesnât have the same train commuter culture
as south east England because the stations and rail lines arenât there but it
does aspire to have something which allows better use of public transport. To
level up. Currently it is a land where new trains run on old lines. Yorkshire wanted to be at one end of HS2. A new high speed line across the Pennines has been
seriously talked about - arguably promised by Boris Johnson. The compromise is the new connection between Yorkshire
and Birmingham will be partially high speed and the new line between West
Yorkshire and Manchester will be high speed west of the Pennines. The rest of
the existing line via Huddersfield will be upgraded. Journey times will be quicker - and many people will be
satisfied with that. Others will be left wondering what could have been. At present, Leeds to Manchester Victoria takes 53 minutes
on the fastest service. This will get much better but not before years of
engineering work. Journey times cross country from York and the north-east will
also improve. Thereâs a pledge to give a large part of urban West Yorkshire a
mass transit system. That could finally see trams in Leeds - something talked
about for decades. Bradford gets a faster connection to Leeds but is left in the sidings again in transpennine terms. Â£96bn on the railways is a lot of money - change will be
noticeable - but it falls far short of aspirations this government built up. A commuter from Leeds who travels by train for work in Birmingham, Sheffield and London says the decision to scrap the HS2 line to Leeds is no surprise to him. Speaking to the BBC on the train to Birmingham Anthony Stalgis tells us: ""I knew this would happen"". âThe government is so
London-centric that the risk of HS2 turning into a project to expand the London
commuter belt was very high indeed. âIf the project had been
properly risk assessed, that risk would have led to starting from Leeds and
working down to make sure the risk didn't take place. âItâs hard not to believe
that scrapping the northern bit was the plan all along. âAs for the North, the rail
connections between Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield are a national disgrace. We
call it snail rail. Itâs quicker to drive in
some cases. âAs usual it's London making
decisions from London by Londoners."" Labour leader Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson has today ""ripped up"" his promises to take HS2 all the way to Leeds, and build a new line between the city and Manchester. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Bradford, he says the north of England has been betrayed. ""This was the first test of levelling up, and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North,"" he says. He adds that today's plan reveals the levelling up ambition is ""just a slogan"". A reminder on what levelling up is,here. Tony RoeBBC East Midlands political editor I've been travelling with the Prime Minister this morning. I joined him at Newark for a
short hop to Doncaster. He pored over a rail map and pointed out that HS2
is going to be delivered to the East Midlands despite earlier reports of its
demise. A multi-billion pound investment which will, however, only take the new
line to East Midlands Parkway. He also pledged the long-awaited and long-demanded electrification of the whole Midlands mainline which runs through Leicester and
Nottingham to Sheffield. And while HS2 will halt at the Parkway station near
East Midlands Airport, the line will continue to Toton and a new rail transport
hub will still be built there connecting local services. And it may not be the
end of the full eastern leg. That could still happen in the long term. This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has outlined the government's Integrated Rail Plan in the House of Commons. Here's a recap of what's been said:  You can see the full planhere,external(a word of warning it does come to 161 pages). The PM says the rail plans announced earlier will produce commuter benefits, even if it does destroy parts of the English countryside. ""We are not just digging huge swathes of new rail across virgin countryside through peaceful villages which is what some of the critics are saying we should be doing more of,"" he says. ""We are doing a bit of that, there's no doubt about it, we are building 100 miles of high speed line. But we are also improving and upgrading the commuter network to shorten journey times across the whole north of the country,"" he says. Asked how he will make sure people can afford to travel by train, he says: ""The way to cut costs on train travel is to modernise and electrify and that's what we are doing."" He says setting mass footfall will enable government to start to drive the cost down. The PM says HS2 plus Northern Powerhouse rail ""will offer for young people commuting in the Midlands and the North the same type of confidence about their daily lives, about their commutes, as people have been used to for a century in the south."" Conservative Huw Merriman, the chairman of the Transport Select Committee, has told the Commons that the prime minister promised that HS2 and Northern Powerhouse rail ""was not an either/or option"" but says that those in Leeds and Bradford may view it as ""neither"". ""This is the danger in selling perpetual sunlight and then leaving it for others to explain the arrival of moonlight,"" he says. He says that the new plan includes some ""fantastic projects"" which will slash journey times and better connect northern cities. He then asks, given the expense of electrification in the UK, what steps have been taken to ensure the projects will be delivered on time and on budget. Grant Shapps says the rail minister is carrying out an electrification challenge to bring the industry in and push them to build on electrification ""much faster than currently happens"".

If you are just joining us here's what has been happening today: Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have announced tighter restrictions for unvaccinated people, in a bid to encourage vaccine uptake. The Czech government has approved rules which allow only those who
are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid in the past six
months to enter restaurants, attend certain events and use
various other services from Monday, the Reuters news agency reports. Slovakia took a similar step, in what Prime Minister Eduard
Heger describes as a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"" - echoing themove in Austria earlier this week. Both governments will also require testing at workplaces. ""The main goal of these measures is motivation for
vaccinations,"" Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtech says. With 58% of the population inoculated, the Czech vaccination
rate is below the European Union average, while Slovakia has the EU's
third-lowest rate, with 45% of the population inoculated. Spanish beach resort Benidorm has opened a Covid vaccination centre specifically for tourists to combat rising case numbers in the area. The clinic is located near the hotel district and was drawing queues of
tourists this week, while further mobile vaccination points will be
set up by Valencian health authorities in areas where big crowds gather, Reuters is reporting. Mayor
Antonio Perez tells the news agency they are extending a public service to tourists  and it ""sends a message of safety"" to people. Spain requires all visitors entering the country to present
either a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR test, but bars
and restaurants do not require vaccine passports. New figures have been released showing that 92.5% of staff in care homes for older adults in England have now had two doses of a Covid vaccine, as of 14 November. It means 7.5% of staff - 34,291 people - have not been fully vaccinated. They're the first figures to be released by NHS England since the 11 November deadline set by the government for all staff working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home to be vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. The NHS figures also show 21.7% of social care staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers were not fully jabbed as of 14 November - that's an estimated 108,510 people. Our reporters spoke to care workers when the deadline passed last week -read more on what they had to say here. The US has bought
10 million treatment courses of a Covid-19
antiviral drug,US President Joe Biden said on Thursday,external. The contract with pharmaceutical giantPfizer for its Paxlovid treatmentwill cost the US government $5.29bn (Â£3.93bn at today's exchange rate), the Reuters news agency reports. Biden says the delivery of the pills would start by the end of 2021, if it is authorised by US  regulators. In a statement, the president said his administration was making
preparations to ensure the pills would be easily accessible and
free. ""This is positive news,"" he says. ""This treatment could prove to be another critical tool in our arsenal that will accelerate our path out of the pandemic."" But, he adds, vaccines remain ""our strongest tool"". The Netherlands has reported its highest number of daily Covid infections, exceeding new 20,000 cases for the third day in a row, Reuters news agency reports. About 23,600 people tested positive for the virus, the country's
national health institute says - up from just under 21,000 a day
before. The country has already brought in a partial lockdown. Back now to the situation in Germany. As we've been reporting today the number of Covid cases in the country has hit a record high. But where are cases worst? Saxony is the German region that has currently been hardest hit by the fourth wave of coronavirus. The state - in the east of the country, which has Dresden as its capital - has the highest infection rate as well as the lowest vaccination rate. Because of its status, it's considering measures like closing concerts, theatres and football games to the public and closing bars and nightclubs, Bild newspaper says. Daily infections there have risen 14 times in the past month, Reuters has reported. Infection rates are also high in Bavaria, in the south-east, and more measures are being considered there. The UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures. Overall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old. More than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. The UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period. There were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. The UK government has named 50 companies given fast-track ""VIP"" contracts to supply protective equipment to the NHS. Eighteen of them were nominated by Conservative politicians, Department of Health and Social Care data shows - with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and former health secretary Matt Hancock involved. VIP contracts were introduced as the NHS struggled for masks, gloves, gowns and other safety equipment after the outbreak of coronavirus. The government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies offering to supply the equipment. Contracts would usually be opened to competing bids. The information on the firms,externalchosen for VIP contracts follows a freedom-of-information request by the Good Law Project campaign group. The government said that ""to save lives, we focused our efforts, resources and attention on sourcing PPE"", adding it stood by efforts made to protect staff. Read more here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Covid case
rates are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly
surveillance figures for England reveal. The report from
the UK Health Security Agency, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group
has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time. In recent
months, the 10-19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per
100,000 tested. It is too soon
to say what is behind the change and whether it will continue. In recent weeks
children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs. The data also
shows confirmed Covid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those

The widow of a top official dealing with Scotland's pandemic response, who died after contracting Covid, believes the full details of his illness were concealed to protect a troubled hospital's reputation. Andrew Slorance went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago, where his wife Louise believes he caught the virus - as well as another life-threatening infection. He was the Scottish government's head of response and communication unit, in charge of its handling of the Covid pandemic. His widow tells the BBC she believes officials wanted to protect the hospital, which is already the subject of a public inquiry, as well as its reputation, ""no matter what the cost"". The hospital's health board says it had been ""open and honest"" and there had been no attempt to conceal any information from the family. You can read more on what happenedhere. There have been some changes this week in the UK about who can get their booster jabs - and about teenagers' vaccinations. So what is the new guidance? Here's a recap. All over-40s in the UK can now have a booster jab, as long as it's been six months after their second vaccine. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed. Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according toUK Health Security Agency data,external. You can now get a third dose if you're in one of these categories:  Those aged 16 and 17 can now have a second vaccine, 12 weeks after their first jab. And pregnant women are being urged to take up their offer of a vaccine, as they can be particularly at risk. The changes follow new recommendations from the government's advisers, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. All the details arehere. This video can not be played Covid in Wales: Maternity visiting rules unfair, says mum Visitors should be allowed into maternity units in Wales without restrictions, a charity says. Since the pandemic started, some units have stopped all visiting while others have limited times parents can spend with newborns. The rules currently vary between health boards, with some of them including banning visits entirely, other limiting visits to a few hours and some only allowing designated partners in within certain times of the day. But with restrictions on movement and social distancing eased across the country, Birthrights wants hospital maternity units to also open up. The Welsh government says maternity services keep their rules under review and there was a ""delicate balance"" between protecting vulnerable individuals and allowing visiting. Read morehere. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin The debate in Germanyâs parliament today was emotional, with
plenty of finger-pointing for the sharp rise in infections. The mood in the
country is equally fractious, with commentators asking why politicians didnât
use the lull in infections during the summer, to prepare the booster campaign
and plan for a predictably tough winter. Some hospitals say they are at full capacity, and worry they will
be overwhelmed when the current high rates translate into more
hospitalisations. These
stark warnings mean that, in polls, most Germans support tougher measures. Until
now, excluding unvaccinated people from some activities has not sparked
widespread protest. In one survey, a majority supports allowing only vaccinated
people to access leisure services, such as restaurants. These measures have
been easy to implement. Customers have quickly become used to showing waiters
proof of vaccine before ordering food. The newer measures decided on Thursday might be more difficult to
implement. Transport trade unions say their members shouldnât have to police
the vaccine status of passengers because of potential aggression. And some
employers question how they can organise daily tests for workers. But
if the choice is between more deaths or making life more difficult for
unvaccinated people, the consensus in Germany is more restrictions for people
who donât want the jab. Germany is facing its highest case numbers since the coronavirus pandemic began. We've been looking at the pattern of how case numbers have been going up and down. There was a small peak early in the pandemic, if you look at the seven-day averages, but the first big wave peaked at the end of December. There was another surge - although not as big as the one at the end of 2020 - at the end of April before a decrease. There was a rise again to a new peak in September which plateaued for a while before rapidly climbing again to the new highs we see now. There's information on theJohns Hopkins world coronavirus map,externalas well, which breaks down the figures if you're keen for more detail. The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning there is a ""hard winter ahead"" for Europe. Asked by the BBC if it was concerned vaccines did not appear to be preventing a surge in cases, its regional director for Europe Hans Kluge says: ""Of course vaccines have been a game-changer. ""But far too many remain unvaccinated, so we have pockets in which the virus continues to spread and cause strain on local and national health systems."" He was speaking amid a surge in European countries, as we've been reporting on here today. This public health emergency is far from being over, and the current rise of cases in most countries in the region, caused by the combination of insufficient vaccination coverage, the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant, shows that a hard winter is ahead of us."" Dr Hans Kluge, WHO We were telling you earlier about Covid passes in Wales and Scotland - another country considering extending their use is Spain. The Basque Country wants to make it mandatory for people visiting bars, clubs or restaurants to show a vaccination certificate, reports Spanish newspaper El Pais. It would show whether they have been fully vaccinated, at least 14 days previously, if they have had Covid over the previous six months, or tested negative for the virus. Spanish regions are in charge of their own healthcare systems, including Covid-19 measures and vaccinations. Overall in Spain, 79% of the population is now fully vaccinated. The daily case rate is rising at the moment with latest 14-day figures showing 88.6 cases per 100,000 people. As we've been reporting, there has been some fierce debate in the German lower house of parliament over proposed new measures to curb the current spike in the country's cases. Here are some excerpts that give a flavour of what was said in the chamber.  More people will get infected and become ill, many of them seriously. That worries me deeply and I will say clearly: we are in an emergency situation, especially the hospitals and we must react now, resolutely and together, the government, the German states and communities. This is what today's parliamentary debate is about, as is customary in a democracy."" Katrin Goering-Eckardt, Green Party parliamentary chairwoman Today's debate is not about the conservatives or the [incoming] SPD, FDP and Greens government, it's about protecting our country and in order to do so, we are putting the right measures in place, ladies and gentlemen."" Marco Buschmann, Senior FDP lawmaker If you decide to go down that road with the majority you have here, against our and my proposals, please don't use someone else as a scapegoat every time or as a punching ball. If you want to represent the new majority here, you have to take on the responsibility. No-one can relieve you of that duty."" Jens Spahn, Outgoing Health Minister Â© 2025 BBC.

Residents in the East Midlands towns and villages affected by the original HS2 scheme say they are relieved that part of the route is being axed. Geoff Cotton, who has lived in Trowell since 1988, says he would have seen HS2 come past his house. ""Obviously it's pleasing from a selfish point of view, but I do also feel that the way the economy is working at the moment with people working from home more, the need to travel down to London fast isn't as significant as it would have been,"" he says. However, he criticises the amount of time the decision has taken. ""People haven't been able to move on with their lives because they can't sell their properties."" Jill Sisson, who has lived in Trowell for more than 50 years, says she is ""quite happy"" her home will no longer be demolished. ""To have been living with all this pressure is very hard. I don't think it's been handled very well. One minute you're hearing one thing and the next minute you're hearing something else. ""It leaves you up in the air as to what's going to happen. It's all the uncertainty."" You can read more reaction from the East Midlandshere. More reaction to today's announcement... Newcastle North MPCatherine McKinnell, Labour, says people
will struggle to understand why the government ""expects Northerners to be
grateful for piecemeal improvements to our creaking, 20th century rail system"" when there are state-of-the-art HS2 links that benefit the South and Crossrail in London. She says it is ""mend and make do"" for the North. She describes the plan as a ""major strategic blunder"" and says it was an opportunity to transform the North. Andy McDonald, Labour MP for Middlesborough, says that the North East has been forgotten for too long, with rail commuters facing poor service on inadequate infrastructure. He says: ""Itâs a different world
compared with the South East."" ConservativeAndy Carter,Warrington South MP, says it is ""really reassuring"" to see Warrington feature prominently in the government's rail plan. He says the new high speed line between Warrington and Manchester will release capacity on the existing network and will have benefits for the town centre. But he says that he wants to see those benefits realised as soon as possible, adding ""people cannot wait forever to see material differences"". And Sheffield MPLouise Haigh, Labour, is critical of the plan. ""This report was more than 12 months overdue, and it definitely was not worth the wait. ""The prime minister has once again shown people across the north of England that they do not matter to him or his government. ""This is another in a long line of broken promises by this prime minister to the people of the North."" More union reaction, and Unite has described the governmentâs
decision to cancel the HS2 spur to Leeds as an ""act of industrial vandalism."" Unite national officer for construction Jerry Swain said: ""This decision has put back national infrastructure planning by a generation. It is nothing short of industrial vandalism. âBy cancelling the Leeds spur the government's demonstrating it's not serious about its levelling up agenda and that its manifesto commitment to improving regional connectivity was nothing but hot air. ""HS2 should be the gold standard of construction projects for the next decade and beyond. The entire UK should be benefiting from this development."" The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, said the Â£96bn programme will ""transform services in the north and the Midlands,"" calling the scheme the ""largest single rail investment ever made by a UK government"".  Reality Check Announcing the Integrated Rail Plan, Transport Secretary
Grant Shapps spoke not just of rail investment but of wider transport
commitments. He said the plan was also about those places that âconnect
and interactâ with HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail,
adding âwe are investing Â£2bn in walking and cyclingâ. However, this is not a new funding announcement. In May last year, the government announced Â£2bn for walking
and cycling as part of a UK-wide package toâboost greener, active transportâ.,external Some reaction has been coming in from business leaders and travel groups. Matthew Fell, chief policy director at theConfederation of British Industry, says the plan involves significant investment which goes some way ""towards modernising our ageing rail networks"". But he says businesses across the Midlands and northern England will be ""justifiably disappointed to see the goalposts have moved at the eleventh hour"". Sir John Peace, chair of transport research groupMidlands Connectsays while the plans have changed ""there are a lot of positives in here and lots of things to be excited about"". He says the government ""should move as quickly as possible to get spades in the ground and bring benefits to local people sooner"". Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdogTransport Focus, says to help meet decarbonisation targets sustained investment in public transport in the North and Midlands must continue. ""Ultimately passengers will judge the success of these plans on the extent to which they meet their priorities for improvement: more punctual, reliable services, increased capacity and the chance of getting a seat on the train,"" he says. Andy Bagnall, director general of theRail Delivery Group,which represents independent train operators, says rail has a vital role to play in ""driving the economy"" and a ""fair, clean recovery"" - with millions of people set to benefit from boosting connectivity between northern cities and the Midlands. However, he warns that ""leaving out key pieces of the jigsaw will inevitably hold back the ability for the railways to power the levelling up agenda and the drive to net zero"". Reality Check The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a business pressure group chaired by former chancellor George Osborne, has been looking at the Â£96bn rail investment announced by the government. It estimates the full HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail projects, as previously planned, would have ended up costing about Â£127.5bn. That estimate would make the alternative Â£96bn programme set out on Thursday at least Â£30bn cheaper. The pressure group reckons about Â£17bn of the savings will come from the difference in cost between the scrapped eastern leg of HS2 to Leeds and the proposed new lines and upgrades proposed for the area. The rest comes from cheaper options on Northern Powerhouse Rail. Theyâre working through the figures in the governmentâs publication and expect to have more precise numbers later in the day. Estimates of costs of big rail projects are notoriously unreliable. When HS2 was first announced, the whole thing was only supposed to cost about Â£33bn. Nonetheless, some might argue it's hard to describe any of the Â£96bn as new money if itâs a result of scrapping some rail projects and spending the money on alternatives. We have asked the Department for Transport for its response to these costings. The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) has given its reaction to the government's plans - and concluded that Bradford will be ""the biggest loser"". A report out earlier this week found the city hasthe worst connections of any city in the UK, despite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located. It came bottom of the list due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections. There are only four trains to London, for example, each day. The West Yorkshire city had been hoping to be connected to Manchester and Leeds along a new high-speed line, which today's plan confirms will not go ahead in full. Instead, there will be a mixture of newly-built line and upgrades to existing track. The government says journey times to and from Bradford will still be cut. But Manuel Cortes, the TSSA's general secretary, says the plan shows the government has ""sold out the North with more broken promises"".  We're still catching up on a few threads from the Commons discussion earlier, and Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park, made the point that today's announcement scraps ""much-needed"" plans to improve rail capacity and connections, and comes weeks afterthe Chancellor announced cuts to domestic flight taxes. She challenged the transport secretary to answer ""how these plans together deliver against either of their stated objectives to level up or to tackle climate change?"" Shapps responded by saying: ""In all of these decisions we're having to balance the wider purse, the taxpayers' money."" He notes the expenditure on rail, adding ""it's always my goal to get more people travelling on the trains"" and that ""these plans will help that"". Sandra Haith (far right) has spent years fighting the plans Grant Shapps' announcement - in particular news that HS2's eastern leg is to be scrapped  - has been met with elation by some campaigners in south Yorkshire. Sandra Haith has spent five and half years fighting the original plans, which would have seen the line cut through the east side of the village of Bramley, Rotherham, as it followed the M18 motorway. She says: ""Not only as a resident of Bramley, but as a taxpayer, it's a complete waste of money. ""The eastern leg costs a lot of money and it basically connects two cities. We can't get on it. We've got all the pain and no gain. ""This village and other villages have been under this blight for five and a half years. ""People have already sold up and moved out because they can't live with the stress."" You can read morehere. The government has now published itsIntegrated Rail Plan,externaland in a foreword, Boris Johnson says the old plans had ""got the balance wrong"". ""They focused too much on showpiece, high speed links and too little on local services - less glamorous perhaps, but more important to most people,"" he writes. He says the new plan helps larger cities but also smaller places and does not neglect short-distance services ""which people use every day"". He writes that it has become clear under the original plan ""high speed lines would not have reached the East Midlands and Yorkshire, until at best the early to mid 2040s"". The prime minister adds that while some people had called for the government to ""rigidly stick  to the old plans"", they were in effect ""condemning the North and the East Midlands to get nothing for ten years or more"". Danny SavageNorth of England correspondent If life is about compromises then a very big one has just
been put upon northern England. It doesnât have the same train commuter culture
as south east England because the stations and rail lines arenât there but it
does aspire to have something which allows better use of public transport. To
level up. Currently it is a land where new trains run on old lines. Yorkshire wanted to be at one end of HS2. A new high speed line across the Pennines has been
seriously talked about - arguably promised by Boris Johnson. The compromise is the new connection between Yorkshire
and Birmingham will be partially high speed and the new line between West
Yorkshire and Manchester will be high speed west of the Pennines. The rest of
the existing line via Huddersfield will be upgraded. Journey times will be quicker - and many people will be
satisfied with that. Others will be left wondering what could have been. At present, Leeds to Manchester Victoria takes 53 minutes
on the fastest service. This will get much better but not before years of
engineering work. Journey times cross country from York and the north-east will
also improve. Thereâs a pledge to give a large part of urban West Yorkshire a
mass transit system. That could finally see trams in Leeds - something talked
about for decades. Bradford gets a faster connection to Leeds but is left in the sidings again in transpennine terms. Â£96bn on the railways is a lot of money - change will be
noticeable - but it falls far short of aspirations this government built up. A commuter from Leeds who travels by train for work in Birmingham, Sheffield and London says the decision to scrap the HS2 line to Leeds is no surprise to him. Speaking to the BBC on the train to Birmingham Anthony Stalgis tells us: ""I knew this would happen"". âThe government is so
London-centric that the risk of HS2 turning into a project to expand the London
commuter belt was very high indeed. âIf the project had been
properly risk assessed, that risk would have led to starting from Leeds and
working down to make sure the risk didn't take place. âItâs hard not to believe
that scrapping the northern bit was the plan all along. âAs for the North, the rail
connections between Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield are a national disgrace. We
call it snail rail. Itâs quicker to drive in
some cases. âAs usual it's London making
decisions from London by Londoners."" Labour leader Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson has today ""ripped up"" his promises to take HS2 all the way to Leeds, and build a new line between the city and Manchester. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Bradford, he says the north of England has been betrayed. ""This was the first test of levelling up, and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North,"" he says. He adds that today's plan reveals the levelling up ambition is ""just a slogan"". A reminder on what levelling up is,here. Tony RoeBBC East Midlands political editor I've been travelling with the Prime Minister this morning. I joined him at Newark for a
short hop to Doncaster. He pored over a rail map and pointed out that HS2
is going to be delivered to the East Midlands despite earlier reports of its
demise. A multi-billion pound investment which will, however, only take the new
line to East Midlands Parkway. He also pledged the long-awaited and long-demanded electrification of the whole Midlands mainline which runs through Leicester and
Nottingham to Sheffield. And while HS2 will halt at the Parkway station near
East Midlands Airport, the line will continue to Toton and a new rail transport
hub will still be built there connecting local services. And it may not be the
end of the full eastern leg. That could still happen in the long term. This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has outlined the government's Integrated Rail Plan in the House of Commons. Here's a recap of what's been said:  You can see the full planhere,external(a word of warning it does come to 161 pages). The PM says the rail plans announced earlier will produce commuter benefits, even if it does destroy parts of the English countryside. ""We are not just digging huge swathes of new rail across virgin countryside through peaceful villages which is what some of the critics are saying we should be doing more of,"" he says. ""We are doing a bit of that, there's no doubt about it, we are building 100 miles of high speed line. But we are also improving and upgrading the commuter network to shorten journey times across the whole north of the country,"" he says. Asked how he will make sure people can afford to travel by train, he says: ""The way to cut costs on train travel is to modernise and electrify and that's what we are doing."" He says setting mass footfall will enable government to start to drive the cost down. The PM says HS2 plus Northern Powerhouse rail ""will offer for young people commuting in the Midlands and the North the same type of confidence about their daily lives, about their commutes, as people have been used to for a century in the south."" Conservative Huw Merriman, the chairman of the Transport Select Committee, has told the Commons that the prime minister promised that HS2 and Northern Powerhouse rail ""was not an either/or option"" but says that those in Leeds and Bradford may view it as ""neither"". ""This is the danger in selling perpetual sunlight and then leaving it for others to explain the arrival of moonlight,"" he says. He says that the new plan includes some ""fantastic projects"" which will slash journey times and better connect northern cities. He then asks, given the expense of electrification in the UK, what steps have been taken to ensure the projects will be delivered on time and on budget. Grant Shapps says the rail minister is carrying out an electrification challenge to bring the industry in and push them to build on electrification ""much faster than currently happens"".

"The government has scrapped the Leeds leg of the HS2 high-speed rail lineas part of a package,externalthat ministers promise will transform services. The prime minister said the overhaul would mean faster travel up to 10 years earlier than planned, and said claims of broken promises are ""total rubbish"". The package won support from some business leaders, and anti-HS2 groups. But Boris Johnson faced criticism that he had reneged on investment promises to the Midlands and north of England. Live updates on HS2 announcement What is HS2 and where will it go? Rail plan 'resigns city to second-class service' Doomed estate in limbo after HS2 leg axed The axing of a new East Midlands-Leeds high-speed line, with HS2 trains now to run on existing upgraded routes, and a scaling back of the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project, drew strong condemnation.

This video can not be played 'We're building in the most efficient possible way' There was also criticism that a significant portion of the Â£96bn pledged as new investment has already been announced, such as Â£360m to improve ticketing. On a visit to a Network Rail logistics hub near Selby, Mr Johnson dismissed the charges of broken promises as ""total rubbish"", insisting the government would deliver on them ""eventually"". ""Of course there are going to be people who always want everything at once. And there are lots of people who are [going to] say, look, what we should do is carve huge new railways through virgin territory, smashing through unspoilt countryside and villages and do it all at once,"" he said. And in a BBC interview later the prime minister said that laying new track through countryside would take decades to complete. Mr Johnson said: ""You can wait decades and dig up virgin countryside and plough through villages, but you have to wait an awful lot longer and it costs an awful lot more. ""I'm afraid that we are going to be building a huge amount of new line but what we're doing is doing it in the most efficient possible way and to bring the maximum possible commuter benefits.""

The route between Leeds and Manchester will now be a combination of new track and enhancements to existing infrastructure. ""We're cutting journey times from Manchester in half from 2 hours 9 min to 1 hour 11 min,"" said Mr Johnson. ""We're also cutting times from Manchester to Leeds from 55 min to 33 min and [creating] a crossrail for the Midlands for the first time."" He added that there would also be a new high-speed line taking the time needed to travel from the West Midlands to East Midlands, from 1 hour 14 min down to 26 min. ""What that means is you will be able to have HS2 trains all the way up to Sheffield, taking half an hour off the time up to Sheffield,"" Mr Johnson stressed. ""You will have a crossrail for the north, a crossrail for the Midlands and then the HS2."" Tory MP Robbie Moore, whose Keighley seat sits close to Bradford, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the plan, which had ""completely short-changed"" his constituents.

"A rail improvement programme will help transform services in the Midlands and northern England, the government has said ahead of the expected scrapping of part of the HS2 scheme. Local service upgrades, bringing faster journeys, will happen up to 10 years earlier than planned, ministers say. The plan will cost Â£96bn, but only half of that is thought to be new money. It comes as businesses reacted angrily to reports the East Midlands-Leeds HS2 high-speed line would not be built. However, campaigners against the HS2 have said they are ""elated"" by the reports. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will unveil the plans this morning. Speaking to the BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab denied that the government was rowing back on promises to ""level up"" the country with HS2. He called the new plan ""good for the whole country"", adding: ""We are entirely delivering on the aspiration and ambition of the levelling up agenda."" The Department for Transport (DfT) says its Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) will improve journey times and capacity ""from London and across the Pennines"" and ""strengthen connections between major cities in the North and Midlands"". What is HS2 and where will it go? Scaling back North rail plans is 'ludicrous' City has the UK's worst rail connections Scrapping HS2 extension 'undermines' levelling up HS2 was originally meant to connect London with the city centres of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. But sources have told the BBC that the eastern leg to Leeds is set to be scrapped. Writing in the Yorkshire Post,,externalMr Johnson appears to confirm reports that a shorter high-speed route will be created from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway, with the HS2 trains then running up as far as Sheffield on mainline tracks. A proposed HS2 train, which could be running from London to Birmingham by the end of the decade In his article Mr Johnson wrote: ""HS2 will come to Sheffield, meaning a trip to or from London will take just one hour 27 minutes - precisely the same as under the old HS2 plans. ""We'll look at how to get HS2 to Leeds too, with a new study on the best way to make it happen. ""But high-speed rail is grindingly slow to build. Under the original blueprint, first drawn up more than a decade ago, Yorkshire would have not have seen the benefits of our investment until at least the 2040s. Levelling up can't wait that long."" The government is also expected to put money aside to explore setting up a tram service for Leeds and spend Â£360m on contactless ticketing across commuter rail networks. The IRP was initiated after the 2020 Oakervee Review into major transport schemes including HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). But the prime minister has come under pressure recently over claims the government intends to ""water down"" planned rail upgrades. There has been outcry from some politicians and businesses in the north of England at reports that there will not be an entire new fast line between Leeds and Manchester, via Bradford. The improvements to the NPR east-west connections are likely to involve upgrades to existing infrastructure. Tracy Brabin, Labour Mayor for West Yorkshire, told the BBC: ""If what we're hearing is true, it's a betrayal of the North and a betrayal of the people I represent. ""It's going to affect our potential and investment and opportunity, and it's just not good enough."" Many towns and villages along the route, such as Crofton in Yorkshire, have opposed the line However, earlier this week, Sandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 campaign group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was ""absolutely elated"", saying the proposed route would have brought ""untold devastation"" and ""heartbreak"" to communities along the line. Nick Garthwaite, director of chemical manufacturer Christeyns Ltd in Bradford and vice chair of the West & North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, says he is disappointed by the reports that a new line between Manchester and Leeds may not be built. ""I feel the city and its people have been betrayed - we might not get the through railway station that Bradford so desperately needs and indeed was tacitly promised by government over a long period of time,"" he told the BBC. A key concern for businesses in Bradford is trying to attract more talent to come to work there, so not having good transport links is a problem. ""What I'm worried about is that these young talented people in Bradford will be thinking twice about staying in the city,"" he said. Mr Garthwaite said it was likely that businesses would also consider locating new factories in other parts of England. His concerns seem to be shared by others. A student told the BBC that many young people were now moving away from Bradford and Leeds to live in cities like Nottingham and Manchester, because the transport links were so poor. ""I'm definitely not going to be staying in Leeds or Bradford because it's not reliable enough,"" she said. Speaking to the PA news agency on Tuesday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""[People in the North] should definitely feel optimistic. ""Not only are we going to spend a huge amount of money doing this, we are going to deliver it decades before it would have otherwise happened."" Mr Shapps added that if he had been transport secretary 15 years ago with responsibility for HS2, then ""I would have started in the North and moved south, I think that would have made sense"". He went on: ""The Northern Powerhouse Rail, the Midlands Connect - all of those did not exist when HS2 was first mooted, but we are where we are and it's being built and we need to make sure we connect it all up and that's what the Integrated Rail Plan intends to achieve."" However, Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I think we've got a real risk of disappointment across the North. ""The budget that's been promised, Â£96bn, is about Â£30bn less than the previous plans and what we were being offered. That means real cuts on the eastern leg, real cuts to the new line across the Pennines through Bradford."" He said it was now vital to ensure better connectivity between Leeds and Sheffield, as the North was ""going to lose on that connectivity to the West Midlands and London"". Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, accused the government of using ""smoke and mirrors"" while breaking its promises. ""HS2 was meant to be a world-beater... instead, the Tories are letting us down,"" he said. ""This government is a government of broken promises. It has announced Northern Powerhouse Rail an incredible 60 times - and I know because we've counted - and now it puts the project in the bin."" Do you live or work in Nottingham, Bradford or Leeds?

"The government has scrapped the Leeds leg of the HS2 high-speed rail lineas part of a package,externalthat ministers promise will transform services. The prime minister said the overhaul would mean faster travel up to 10 years earlier than planned, and said claims of broken promises are ""total rubbish"". The package won support from some business leaders, and anti-HS2 groups. But Boris Johnson faced criticism that he had reneged on investment promises to the Midlands and north of England. Live updates on HS2 announcement What is HS2 and where will it go? Rail plan 'resigns city to second-class service' Doomed estate in limbo after HS2 leg axed The axing of a new East Midlands-Leeds high-speed line, with HS2 trains now to run on existing upgraded routes, and a scaling back of the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) project, drew strong condemnation. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson had ""ripped up"" promises he made that HS2 would go all the way to Leeds and that there would be a new NPR line from Manchester to Leeds. ""This was the first test of 'levelling up' and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North. You can't believe a word the Prime Minister says,"" he said. This video can not be played 'We're building in the most efficient possible way' There was also criticism that a significant portion of the Â£96bn pledged as new investment has already been announced, such as Â£360m to improve ticketing. On a visit to a Network Rail logistics hub near Selby, Mr Johnson dismissed the charges of broken promises as ""total rubbish"", insisting the government would deliver on them ""eventually"". ""Of course there are going to be people who always want everything at once. And there are lots of people who are [going to] say, look, what we should do is carve huge new railways through virgin territory, smashing through unspoilt countryside and villages and do it all at once,"" he said. And in a BBC interview later the prime minister said that laying new track through countryside would take decades to complete. Mr Johnson said: ""You can wait decades and dig up virgin countryside and plough through villages, but you have to wait an awful lot longer and it costs an awful lot more. ""I'm afraid that we are going to be building a huge amount of new line but what we're doing is doing it in the most efficient possible way and to bring the maximum possible commuter benefits."" The completion of HS2 from Crewe to Manchester, with new stations at Manchester Airport and Manchester Piccadilly A new high-speed line between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway The delivery of Northern Powerhouse Rail via a new high-speed line between Warrington, Manchester and Marsden in Yorkshire The upgrading or electrification of the existing Midland Main Line, East Coast Main Line and Transpennine Main Line A new mass transit system for Leeds and West Yorkshire Money for a programme of fares and ticketing reform, including contactless pay-as-you-go ticketing in the North and Midlands A study to look at the best way to take HS2 trains to Leeds, including capacity at Leeds Station In addition to the HS2 changes, there is also a scaling back of a new Trans-Pennine rail route between Manchester and Leeds as part of the NPR project to improve links between major northern cities. The route between Leeds and Manchester will now be a combination of new track and enhancements to existing infrastructure. ""We're cutting journey times from Manchester in half from 2 hours 9 min to 1 hour 11 min,"" said Mr Johnson. ""We're also cutting times from Manchester to Leeds from 55 min to 33 min and [creating] a crossrail for the Midlands for the first time."" He added that there would also be a new high-speed line taking the time needed to travel from the West Midlands to East Midlands, from 1 hour 14 min down to 26 min. ""What that means is you will be able to have HS2 trains all the way up to Sheffield, taking half an hour off the time up to Sheffield,"" Mr Johnson stressed. ""You will have a crossrail for the north, a crossrail for the Midlands and then the HS2."" Tory MP Robbie Moore, whose Keighley seat sits close to Bradford, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the plan, which had ""completely short-changed"" his constituents. Bradford had expected to be included on the proposed Leeds to Manchester route and to see a station built to accommodate new trains. ""We are one of the most socially deprived parts of the UK and we must get better transport connectivity,"" Mr Moore said. Revised HS2 plans a betrayal of North, say critics HS2 downgrade met with mixed reaction Residents rejoice as HS2 eastern leg shelved Delivering the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) in the Commons, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs it was an ""ambitious and unparalleled programme"" to overhaul inter-city links across the north and Midlands, and ""speed up the benefits for local areas and serves destinations people most want to reach"". Work has already started on the first phase of HS2, linking London and the West Midlands. The next section will extend the line to Crewe. The final phase was to take HS2 to Manchester and Leeds. A proposed HS2 train Commenting on plans for rail links between the East Midlands to Leeds, Mr Shapps said: ""We'll study how best to take HS2 trains into Leeds as well"". However, that is likely to be via upgrades to existing rail network, a move condemned by MPs and regional business leaders who said a high-speed line was vital to the economic growth of the Midlands and north England. Labour MP Hilary Benn, who represents Leeds Central, said: ""Today that promise has been broken, and Leeds and the North have been betrayed."" Andy Bagnall, director general of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: ""While millions of people will benefit from this major investment in boosting connectivity between major cities in the North of England and the Midlands, leaving out key pieces of the jigsaw will inevitably hold back the ability for the railways to power the levelling up agenda and the drive to net zero."" by Katy Austin, BBC transport correspondent The government's argument is that faster delivery at lower cost is now the best approach. It also makes the case for putting cash towards better local services, not just high speed inter-city connections. That won't wash with those who will accept nothing but the original proposals for both HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail - with their full capacity benefits, as well as journey times. They feel a promise is being broken. Bradford is one example of this; a city whose leaders view a new, full high-speed link to both Manchester and Leeds as essential to regeneration. Opponents of HS2 - a controversial project - will see today's news as a relief. Although the door has not been fully closed to the eastern leg being completed at some future date. However, businesses in Yorkshire who hoped HS2 would bring jobs, investment and confidence, albeit not for a while, feel that opportunity has just been diminished. Labour also point out that despite the Â£96bn label, much of this money had already been earmarked for HS2. 'Waste of money' News that part of HS2 was being scrapped was met with ""elation"" by campaigners against the line. Sandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was pleased, ""not only as a resident of Bramley, but as a taxpayer. It's a complete waste of money"". Sandra Haith (far right) has spent years fighting the plans She said: ""The eastern leg costs a lot of money and it basically connects two cities. We can't get on it. We've got all the pain and no gain."" However, business people warned about the economic loss from scrapping the HS2 line. James Greenhalgh, who runs the Flamingos Coffee House, in Leeds, told the BBC it would deter investment in the city. ""We want to encourage other businesses to move up from London, up to Leeds, get people moving around and coming to our city centre. It is really tough, it is stopping businesses from expanding,"" he said. There was praise, though, from business leaders at regional trade body Midlands Connect. Chairman Sir John Peace said: ""Although these plans are different in some respects to what we'd expected, there are a lot of positives in here and lots of things to be excited about - a new high-speed connection between Birmingham and East Midlands Parkway, direct links onto HS2 for Derby, Nottingham, and Chesterfield and a commitment to the Midlands Rail Hub.""

"Bradford is hoping for a new station as part of the Northern Powerhouse Rail line. Bradford has the worst rail connections of any major British city, a report has found. Despite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located, it came bottom of the list due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections. There are four trains to London - the best connected city - each day. Local politicians said the findings proved Bradford needs a stop on the Northern Powerhouse Rail line. According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service,the data analysis, by the Be The Best Communications' People, Places, Policy and Data Unit, looked at more than 3,000 real-life train journeys between 20 cities and compared them with the same journey by road. The report comes ahead of the publication of the government's Integrated Rail Plan, which will set out how major projects, including Northern Powerhouse Rail will be delivered. Bradford Council and West Yorkshire Combined Authority has been campaigning for a Northern Powerhouse Rail station in Bradford city centre that would cut journey times to Manchester and Leeds. Bradford has four trains to London a day Leaders claim it would bring 6.7 million people and an area of more than Â£167 billion of annual economic output to within a 35-minute journey of central Bradford. According to Bradford Council the stop would boost the Bradford district economy by about Â£30 billion over ten years, creating 27,000 new jobs. Leader Susan Hinchcliffe said: ""This new research shows that the city that would be the most improved by investing in better rail connections is Bradford."" She added it would ""transform the connectivity of three of Britain's largest cities [Bradford, Leeds and Manchester] using existing rail services, while also delivering a station able to handle Northern Powerhouse Rail services"" and ""cut around 44,000 daily car journeys between Leeds and Bradford, cutting congestion and delivering greener, more sustainable transport across the north [of England].""

"Newcastle North MP Catherine McKinnell criticised the ""watered-down, piecemeal plans"" Newcastle's politicians have attacked ""ludicrous"" proposals to water down rail upgrades for the north of England. The government isexpected to scrapplans for a new line between Manchester and Leeds and the eastern leg of HS2. Newcastle North Labour MP Catherine McKinnell said she thought ministers saw the region as a ""problem... rather than an opportunity to invest in"". Downing Street said improving transport links across the north was an ""absolute priority"". But Ms McKinnell said: ""The idea that such watered-down, piecemeal plans could successfully unlock the north of England's potential is ludicrous."" Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said he was ""absolutely appalled"" the region would be ""bypassed"" when new routes were developed elsewhere. ""To make matters worse, not only are we being denied the investment that has been promised and has now been pulled from under our feet, there is absolutely no announcement of any additional rail services or investment here in the North East to replace that lost funding,"" he said. Transport for the North chief executive Martin Tugwell said he was ""deeply worried"" Downing Street said ministers ""recognise the importance of improving transport links across the north as a way to level up the country"". A spokesperson said: ""That's why it is an absolute priority for the government. ""We are fully committed to strengthening the rail links in our cities, across the Midlands and the North."" It is expected the government's Integrated Rail Plan, which is to be released on Thursday, will only commit to upgrading the existing transpennine track rather than building a new rail line between Leeds and Manchester, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid. The chief executive of Transport for the North (TfN), Martin Tugwell, said the expected change was ""deeply worrying"". The Birmingham to Leeds section of HS2 and the proposed east-west line would be the ""catalyst"" for thousands of new jobs, he said. During a visit to the North East on Tuesday, Mr Tugwell said there needed to be a ""step change"" by building new rail links rather than ""a little bit of a tweak here and there"".

"A proposed HS2 line to Leeds will not go ahead, the government has confirmed That goes back on previous pledges that the high-speed route to Leeds would be built Transport Secretary Grant Shapps outlined the government's rail plan in the Commons A Â£96bn improvement programme will target services in the Midlands and northern England Labour criticise the new plans as ""a betrayal"" of promises to ""level up"" the country Mr Shapps says Â£625m will be spent on the electrification of lines between Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds HS2 was originally meant to connect London with the city centres of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds But Mr Shapps says ""a rethink was needed"" on HS2 and claims the new plan will deliver improvements sooner Edited by Emma Owen HS2 platforms in Manchester Piccadilly would be covered by a folded roof We're winding up our live coverage now. Thanks for joining us. As we've been reporting, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs earlier that his plan would include the scrapping of HS2's eastern line to Leeds. If you'd like to know more about the new direction for HS2, have a read ofour explainer. For more local and political reaction to the government's new rail plan, take a look at some of our latest storieshereandhere. And what do politicians mean when they say 'levelling up'? Get the lowdownhere. Today's live page was written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, Mary O'Connor and Paul Seddon. It was edited by Emma Owen. Before we go, we just want to tell you what passengers on a train from Hull to Leeds have been saying about theIntergrated Rail Plan,external. Businessman Phil Jones said: ""I'm more interested in the link between Hull and Manchester across the north than I've ever been about HS2 and want towns across the north better connected by rail and by electrification and by a better service in general."" HS2 will not go to Leeds as planned but will stop at East Midlands Parkway and the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme will not deliver a new line between Manchester and Leeds. However, the transport secretary said there will be a high speed link between Manchester and on to West Yorkshire. Meanwhile commuter Katie Haddock  said: ""It's a massive disappointment for me because I've just started a new job working in Leeds and London and I'm having to decide whether I can continue with that, because the commute is such a problem and really affects daily life. The government says its Â£96bn plan is an ""ambitious and unparalleled programme"" to overhaul inter-city links across the north and Midlands. It says it will ""study how best to take HS2 trains into Leeds"" and will look at a mass transport system for West Yorkshire. We're going to be wrapping up our coverage shortly so here's a reminder of what has happened today:  You can see the full planhere,external. Residents in the East Midlands towns and villages affected by the original HS2 scheme say they are relieved that part of the route is being axed. Geoff Cotton, who has lived in Trowell since 1988, says he would have seen HS2 come past his house. ""Obviously it's pleasing from a selfish point of view, but I do also feel that the way the economy is working at the moment with people working from home more, the need to travel down to London fast isn't as significant as it would have been,"" he says. However, he criticises the amount of time the decision has taken. ""People haven't been able to move on with their lives because they can't sell their properties."" Jill Sisson, who has lived in Trowell for more than 50 years, says she is ""quite happy"" her home will no longer be demolished. ""To have been living with all this pressure is very hard. I don't think it's been handled very well. One minute you're hearing one thing and the next minute you're hearing something else. ""It leaves you up in the air as to what's going to happen. It's all the uncertainty."" You can read more reaction from the East Midlandshere. More reaction to today's announcement... Newcastle North MPCatherine McKinnell, Labour, says people
will struggle to understand why the government ""expects Northerners to be
grateful for piecemeal improvements to our creaking, 20th century rail system"" when there are state-of-the-art HS2 links that benefit the South and Crossrail in London. She says it is ""mend and make do"" for the North. She describes the plan as a ""major strategic blunder"" and says it was an opportunity to transform the North. Andy McDonald, Labour MP for Middlesborough, says that the North East has been forgotten for too long, with rail commuters facing poor service on inadequate infrastructure. He says: ""Itâs a different world
compared with the South East."" ConservativeAndy Carter,Warrington South MP, says it is ""really reassuring"" to see Warrington feature prominently in the government's rail plan. He says the new high speed line between Warrington and Manchester will release capacity on the existing network and will have benefits for the town centre. But he says that he wants to see those benefits realised as soon as possible, adding ""people cannot wait forever to see material differences"". And Sheffield MPLouise Haigh, Labour, is critical of the plan. ""This report was more than 12 months overdue, and it definitely was not worth the wait. ""The prime minister has once again shown people across the north of England that they do not matter to him or his government. ""This is another in a long line of broken promises by this prime minister to the people of the North."" More union reaction, and Unite has described the governmentâs
decision to cancel the HS2 spur to Leeds as an ""act of industrial vandalism."" Unite national officer for construction Jerry Swain said: ""This decision has put back national infrastructure planning by a generation. It is nothing short of industrial vandalism. âBy cancelling the Leeds spur the government's demonstrating it's not serious about its levelling up agenda and that its manifesto commitment to improving regional connectivity was nothing but hot air. ""HS2 should be the gold standard of construction projects for the next decade and beyond. The entire UK should be benefiting from this development."" The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, said the Â£96bn programme will ""transform services in the north and the Midlands,"" calling the scheme the ""largest single rail investment ever made by a UK government"".  Reality Check Announcing the Integrated Rail Plan, Transport Secretary
Grant Shapps spoke not just of rail investment but of wider transport
commitments. He said the plan was also about those places that âconnect
and interactâ with HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail,
adding âwe are investing Â£2bn in walking and cyclingâ. However, this is not a new funding announcement. In May last year, the government announced Â£2bn for walking
and cycling as part of a UK-wide package toâboost greener, active transportâ.,external Some reaction has been coming in from business leaders and travel groups. Matthew Fell, chief policy director at theConfederation of British Industry, says the plan involves significant investment which goes some way ""towards modernising our ageing rail networks"". But he says businesses across the Midlands and northern England will be ""justifiably disappointed to see the goalposts have moved at the eleventh hour"". Sir John Peace, chair of transport research groupMidlands Connectsays while the plans have changed ""there are a lot of positives in here and lots of things to be excited about"". He says the government ""should move as quickly as possible to get spades in the ground and bring benefits to local people sooner"". Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdogTransport Focus, says to help meet decarbonisation targets sustained investment in public transport in the North and Midlands must continue. ""Ultimately passengers will judge the success of these plans on the extent to which they meet their priorities for improvement: more punctual, reliable services, increased capacity and the chance of getting a seat on the train,"" he says. Andy Bagnall, director general of theRail Delivery Group,which represents independent train operators, says rail has a vital role to play in ""driving the economy"" and a ""fair, clean recovery"" - with millions of people set to benefit from boosting connectivity between northern cities and the Midlands. However, he warns that ""leaving out key pieces of the jigsaw will inevitably hold back the ability for the railways to power the levelling up agenda and the drive to net zero"". Reality Check The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a business pressure group chaired by former chancellor George Osborne, has been looking at the Â£96bn rail investment announced by the government. It estimates the full HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail projects, as previously planned, would have ended up costing about Â£127.5bn. That estimate would make the alternative Â£96bn programme set out on Thursday at least Â£30bn cheaper. The pressure group reckons about Â£17bn of the savings will come from the difference in cost between the scrapped eastern leg of HS2 to Leeds and the proposed new lines and upgrades proposed for the area. The rest comes from cheaper options on Northern Powerhouse Rail. Theyâre working through the figures in the governmentâs publication and expect to have more precise numbers later in the day. Estimates of costs of big rail projects are notoriously unreliable. When HS2 was first announced, the whole thing was only supposed to cost about Â£33bn. Nonetheless, some might argue it's hard to describe any of the Â£96bn as new money if itâs a result of scrapping some rail projects and spending the money on alternatives. We have asked the Department for Transport for its response to these costings. The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) has given its reaction to the government's plans - and concluded that Bradford will be ""the biggest loser"". A report out earlier this week found the city hasthe worst connections of any city in the UK, despite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located. It came bottom of the list due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections. There are only four trains to London, for example, each day. The West Yorkshire city had been hoping to be connected to Manchester and Leeds along a new high-speed line, which today's plan confirms will not go ahead in full. Instead, there will be a mixture of newly-built line and upgrades to existing track. The government says journey times to and from Bradford will still be cut. But Manuel Cortes, the TSSA's general secretary, says the plan shows the government has ""sold out the North with more broken promises"".  We're still catching up on a few threads from the Commons discussion earlier, and Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park, made the point that today's announcement scraps ""much-needed"" plans to improve rail capacity and connections, and comes weeks afterthe Chancellor announced cuts to domestic flight taxes. She challenged the transport secretary to answer ""how these plans together deliver against either of their stated objectives to level up or to tackle climate change?"" Shapps responded by saying: ""In all of these decisions we're having to balance the wider purse, the taxpayers' money."" He notes the expenditure on rail, adding ""it's always my goal to get more people travelling on the trains"" and that ""these plans will help that"". Sandra Haith (far right) has spent years fighting the plans Grant Shapps' announcement - in particular news that HS2's eastern leg is to be scrapped  - has been met with elation by some campaigners in south Yorkshire. Sandra Haith has spent five and half years fighting the original plans, which would have seen the line cut through the east side of the village of Bramley, Rotherham, as it followed the M18 motorway. She says: ""Not only as a resident of Bramley, but as a taxpayer, it's a complete waste of money. ""The eastern leg costs a lot of money and it basically connects two cities. We can't get on it. We've got all the pain and no gain. ""This village and other villages have been under this blight for five and a half years. ""People have already sold up and moved out because they can't live with the stress."" You can read morehere. The government has now published itsIntegrated Rail Plan,externaland in a foreword, Boris Johnson says the old plans had ""got the balance wrong"". ""They focused too much on showpiece, high speed links and too little on local services - less glamorous perhaps, but more important to most people,"" he writes. He says the new plan helps larger cities but also smaller places and does not neglect short-distance services ""which people use every day"". He writes that it has become clear under the original plan ""high speed lines would not have reached the East Midlands and Yorkshire, until at best the early to mid 2040s"". The prime minister adds that while some people had called for the government to ""rigidly stick  to the old plans"", they were in effect ""condemning the North and the East Midlands to get nothing for ten years or more"". Danny SavageNorth of England correspondent If life is about compromises then a very big one has just
been put upon northern England. It doesnât have the same train commuter culture
as south east England because the stations and rail lines arenât there but it
does aspire to have something which allows better use of public transport. To
level up. Currently it is a land where new trains run on old lines. Yorkshire wanted to be at one end of HS2. A new high speed line across the Pennines has been
seriously talked about - arguably promised by Boris Johnson. The compromise is the new connection between Yorkshire
and Birmingham will be partially high speed and the new line between West
Yorkshire and Manchester will be high speed west of the Pennines. The rest of
the existing line via Huddersfield will be upgraded. Journey times will be quicker - and many people will be
satisfied with that. Others will be left wondering what could have been. At present, Leeds to Manchester Victoria takes 53 minutes
on the fastest service. This will get much better but not before years of
engineering work. Journey times cross country from York and the north-east will
also improve. Thereâs a pledge to give a large part of urban West Yorkshire a
mass transit system. That could finally see trams in Leeds - something talked
about for decades. Bradford gets a faster connection to Leeds but is left in the sidings again in transpennine terms. Â£96bn on the railways is a lot of money - change will be
noticeable - but it falls far short of aspirations this government built up. A commuter from Leeds who travels by train for work in Birmingham, Sheffield and London says the decision to scrap the HS2 line to Leeds is no surprise to him. Speaking to the BBC on the train to Birmingham Anthony Stalgis tells us: ""I knew this would happen"". âThe government is so
London-centric that the risk of HS2 turning into a project to expand the London
commuter belt was very high indeed. âIf the project had been
properly risk assessed, that risk would have led to starting from Leeds and
working down to make sure the risk didn't take place. âItâs hard not to believe
that scrapping the northern bit was the plan all along. âAs for the North, the rail
connections between Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield are a national disgrace. We
call it snail rail. Itâs quicker to drive in
some cases. âAs usual it's London making
decisions from London by Londoners."" Labour leader Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson has today ""ripped up"" his promises to take HS2 all the way to Leeds, and build a new line between the city and Manchester. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Bradford, he says the north of England has been betrayed. ""This was the first test of levelling up, and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North,"" he says. He adds that today's plan reveals the levelling up ambition is ""just a slogan"". A reminder on what levelling up is,here. Tony RoeBBC East Midlands political editor I've been travelling with the Prime Minister this morning. I joined him at Newark for a
short hop to Doncaster. He pored over a rail map and pointed out that HS2
is going to be delivered to the East Midlands despite earlier reports of its
demise. A multi-billion pound investment which will, however, only take the new
line to East Midlands Parkway. He also pledged the long-awaited and long-demanded electrification of the whole Midlands mainline which runs through Leicester and
Nottingham to Sheffield. And while HS2 will halt at the Parkway station near
East Midlands Airport, the line will continue to Toton and a new rail transport
hub will still be built there connecting local services. And it may not be the
end of the full eastern leg. That could still happen in the long term. This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has outlined the government's Integrated Rail Plan in the House of Commons. Here's a recap of what's been said:  You can see the full planhere,external(a word of warning it does come to 161 pages). The PM says the rail plans announced earlier will produce commuter benefits, even if it does destroy parts of the English countryside. ""We are not just digging huge swathes of new rail across virgin countryside through peaceful villages which is what some of the critics are saying we should be doing more of,"" he says. ""We are doing a bit of that, there's no doubt about it, we are building 100 miles of high speed line. But we are also improving and upgrading the commuter network to shorten journey times across the whole north of the country,"" he says. Asked how he will make sure people can afford to travel by train, he says: ""The way to cut costs on train travel is to modernise and electrify and that's what we are doing."" He says setting mass footfall will enable government to start to drive the cost down. The PM says HS2 plus Northern Powerhouse rail ""will offer for young people commuting in the Midlands and the North the same type of confidence about their daily lives, about their commutes, as people have been used to for a century in the south."" Conservative Huw Merriman, the chairman of the Transport Select Committee, has told the Commons that the prime minister promised that HS2 and Northern Powerhouse rail ""was not an either/or option"" but says that those in Leeds and Bradford may view it as ""neither"". ""This is the danger in selling perpetual sunlight and then leaving it for others to explain the arrival of moonlight,"" he says. He says that the new plan includes some ""fantastic projects"" which will slash journey times and better connect northern cities. He then asks, given the expense of electrification in the UK, what steps have been taken to ensure the projects will be delivered on time and on budget. Grant Shapps says the rail minister is carrying out an electrification challenge to bring the industry in and push them to build on electrification ""much faster than currently happens"".

"A rail improvement programme will help transform services in the Midlands and northern England, the government has said ahead of the expected scrapping of part of the HS2 scheme. Local service upgrades, bringing faster journeys, will happen up to 10 years earlier than planned, ministers say. The plan will cost Â£96bn, but only half of that is thought to be new money. It comes as businesses reacted angrily to reports the East Midlands-Leeds HS2 high-speed line would not be built. However, campaigners against the HS2 have said they are ""elated"" by the reports. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will unveil the plans this morning. Speaking to the BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab denied that the government was rowing back on promises to ""level up"" the country with HS2. He called the new plan ""good for the whole country"", adding: ""We are entirely delivering on the aspiration and ambition of the levelling up agenda.""

But sources have told the BBC that the eastern leg to Leeds is set to be scrapped. Writing in the Yorkshire Post,,externalMr Johnson appears to confirm reports that a shorter high-speed route will be created from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway, with the HS2 trains then running up as far as Sheffield on mainline tracks. A proposed HS2 train, which could be running from London to Birmingham by the end of the decade In his article Mr Johnson wrote: ""HS2 will come to Sheffield, meaning a trip to or from London will take just one hour 27 minutes - precisely the same as under the old HS2 plans.

Under the original blueprint, first drawn up more than a decade ago, Yorkshire would have not have seen the benefits of our investment until at least the 2040s. Levelling up can't wait that long."" The government is also expected to put money aside to explore setting up a tram service for Leeds and spend Â£360m on contactless ticketing across commuter rail networks. The IRP was initiated after the 2020 Oakervee Review into major transport schemes including HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). But the prime minister has come under pressure recently over claims the government intends to ""water down"" planned rail upgrades. There has been outcry from some politicians and businesses in the north of England at reports that there will not be an entire new fast line between Leeds and Manchester, via Bradford. The improvements to the NPR east-west connections are likely to involve upgrades to existing infrastructure. Tracy Brabin, Labour Mayor for West Yorkshire, told the BBC: ""If what we're hearing is true, it's a betrayal of the North and a betrayal of the people I represent. ""It's going to affect our potential and investment and opportunity, and it's just not good enough."" Many towns and villages along the route, such as Crofton in Yorkshire, have opposed the line However, earlier this week, Sandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 campaign group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was ""absolutely elated"", saying the proposed route would have brought ""untold devastation"" and ""heartbreak"" to communities along the line. Nick Garthwaite, director of chemical manufacturer Christeyns Ltd in Bradford and vice chair of the West & North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, says he is disappointed by the reports that a new line between Manchester and Leeds may not be built. ""I feel the city and its people have been betrayed - we might not get the through railway station that Bradford so desperately needs and indeed was tacitly promised by government over a long period of time,"" he told the BBC. A key concern for businesses in Bradford is trying to attract more talent to come to work there, so not having good transport links is a problem. ""What I'm worried about is that these young talented people in Bradford will be thinking twice about staying in the city,"" he said. Mr Garthwaite said it was likely that businesses would also consider locating new factories in other parts of England. His concerns seem to be shared by others. A student told the BBC that many young people were now moving away from Bradford and Leeds to live in cities like Nottingham and Manchester, because the transport links were so poor. ""I'm definitely not going to be staying in Leeds or Bradford because it's not reliable enough,"" she said. Speaking to the PA news agency on Tuesday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""[People in the North] should definitely feel optimistic. ""Not only are we going to spend a huge amount of money doing this, we are going to deliver it decades before it would have otherwise happened."" Mr Shapps added that if he had been transport secretary 15 years ago with responsibility for HS2, then ""I would have started in the North and moved south, I think that would have made sense"". He went on: ""The Northern Powerhouse Rail, the Midlands Connect - all of those did not exist when HS2 was first mooted, but we are where we are and it's being built and we need to make sure we connect it all up and that's what the Integrated Rail Plan intends to achieve.""

""Not only are we going to spend a huge amount of money doing this, we are going to deliver it decades before it would have otherwise happened."" Mr Shapps added that if he had been transport secretary 15 years ago with responsibility for HS2, then ""I would have started in the North and moved south, I think that would have made sense"". He went on: ""The Northern Powerhouse Rail, the Midlands Connect - all of those did not exist when HS2 was first mooted, but we are where we are and it's being built and we need to make sure we connect it all up and that's what the Integrated Rail Plan intends to achieve."" However, Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I think we've got a real risk of disappointment across the North. ""The budget that's been promised, Â£96bn, is about Â£30bn less than the previous plans and what we were being offered. That means real cuts on the eastern leg, real cuts to the new line across the Pennines through Bradford."" He said it was now vital to ensure better connectivity between Leeds and Sheffield, as the North was ""going to lose on that connectivity to the West Midlands and London"". Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, accused the government of using ""smoke and mirrors"" while breaking its promises. ""HS2 was meant to be a world-beater... instead, the Tories are letting us down,"" he said. ""This government is a government of broken promises. It has announced Northern Powerhouse Rail an incredible 60 times - and I know because we've counted - and now it puts the project in the bin."" Do you live or work in Nottingham, Bradford or Leeds?

Businessman Phil Jones said: ""I'm more interested in the link between Hull and Manchester across the north than I've ever been about HS2 and want towns across the north better connected by rail and by electrification and by a better service in general."" HS2 will not go to Leeds as planned but will stop at East Midlands Parkway and the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme will not deliver a new line between Manchester and Leeds. However, the transport secretary said there will be a high speed link between Manchester and on to West Yorkshire.

grateful for piecemeal improvements to our creaking, 20th century rail system"" when there are state-of-the-art HS2 links that benefit the South and Crossrail in London. She says it is ""mend and make do"" for the North. She describes the plan as a ""major strategic blunder"" and says it was an opportunity to transform the North. Andy McDonald, Labour MP for Middlesborough, says that the North East has been forgotten for too long, with rail commuters facing poor service on inadequate infrastructure.

The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, said the Â£96bn programme will ""transform services in the north and the Midlands,"" calling the scheme the ""largest single rail investment ever made by a UK government"".  Reality Check Announcing the Integrated Rail Plan, Transport Secretary
Grant Shapps spoke not just of rail investment but of wider transport
commitments. He said the plan was also about those places that âconnect
and interactâ with HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail,
adding âwe are investing Â£2bn in walking and cyclingâ. However, this is not a new funding announcement. In May last year, the government announced Â£2bn for walking
and cycling as part of a UK-wide package toâboost greener, active transportâ.,external Some reaction has been coming in from business leaders and travel groups. Matthew Fell, chief policy director at theConfederation of British Industry, says the plan involves significant investment which goes some way ""towards modernising our ageing rail networks"". But he says businesses across the Midlands and northern England will be ""justifiably disappointed to see the goalposts have moved at the eleventh hour"". Sir John Peace, chair of transport research groupMidlands Connectsays while the plans have changed ""there are a lot of positives in here and lots of things to be excited about"". He says the government ""should move as quickly as possible to get spades in the ground and bring benefits to local people sooner"". Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdogTransport Focus, says to help meet decarbonisation targets sustained investment in public transport in the North and Midlands must continue. ""Ultimately passengers will judge the success of these plans on the extent to which they meet their priorities for improvement: more punctual, reliable services, increased capacity and the chance of getting a seat on the train,"" he says. Andy Bagnall, director general of theRail Delivery Group,which represents independent train operators, says rail has a vital role to play in ""driving the economy"" and a ""fair, clean recovery"" - with millions of people set to benefit from boosting connectivity between northern cities and the Midlands. However, he warns that ""leaving out key pieces of the jigsaw will inevitably hold back the ability for the railways to power the levelling up agenda and the drive to net zero"". Reality Check The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a business pressure group chaired by former chancellor George Osborne, has been looking at the Â£96bn rail investment announced by the government. It estimates the full HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail projects, as previously planned, would have ended up costing about Â£127.5bn. That estimate would make the alternative Â£96bn programme set out on Thursday at least Â£30bn cheaper. The pressure group reckons about Â£17bn of the savings will come from the difference in cost between the scrapped eastern leg of HS2 to Leeds and the proposed new lines and upgrades proposed for the area. The rest comes from cheaper options on Northern Powerhouse Rail. Theyâre working through the figures in the governmentâs publication and expect to have more precise numbers later in the day. Estimates of costs of big rail projects are notoriously unreliable. When HS2 was first announced, the whole thing was only supposed to cost about Â£33bn. Nonetheless, some might argue it's hard to describe any of the Â£96bn as new money if itâs a result of scrapping some rail projects and spending the money on alternatives. We have asked the Department for Transport for its response to these costings. The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) has given its reaction to the government's plans - and concluded that Bradford will be ""the biggest loser"". A report out earlier this week found the city hasthe worst connections of any city in the UK, despite being the UK's seventh largest city and being centrally located. It came bottom of the list due to a lack of direct rail routes and slow connections. There are only four trains to London, for example, each day. The West Yorkshire city had been hoping to be connected to Manchester and Leeds along a new high-speed line, which today's plan confirms will not go ahead in full. Instead, there will be a mixture of newly-built line and upgrades to existing track. The government says journey times to and from Bradford will still be cut. But Manuel Cortes, the TSSA's general secretary, says the plan shows the government has ""sold out the North with more broken promises"".  We're still catching up on a few threads from the Commons discussion earlier, and Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park, made the point that today's announcement scraps ""much-needed"" plans to improve rail capacity and connections, and comes weeks afterthe Chancellor announced cuts to domestic flight taxes. She challenged the transport secretary to answer ""how these plans together deliver against either of their stated objectives to level up or to tackle climate change?"" Shapps responded by saying: ""In all of these decisions we're having to balance the wider purse, the taxpayers' money."" He notes the expenditure on rail, adding ""it's always my goal to get more people travelling on the trains"" and that ""these plans will help that"". Sandra Haith (far right) has spent years fighting the plans Grant Shapps' announcement - in particular news that HS2's eastern leg is to be scrapped  - has been met with elation by some campaigners in south Yorkshire. Sandra Haith has spent five and half years fighting the original plans, which would have seen the line cut through the east side of the village of Bramley, Rotherham, as it followed the M18 motorway. She says: ""Not only as a resident of Bramley, but as a taxpayer, it's a complete waste of money. ""The eastern leg costs a lot of money and it basically connects two cities. We can't get on it. We've got all the pain and no gain. ""This village and other villages have been under this blight for five and a half years. ""People have already sold up and moved out because they can't live with the stress."" You can read morehere. The government has now published itsIntegrated Rail Plan,externaland in a foreword, Boris Johnson says the old plans had ""got the balance wrong"". ""They focused too much on showpiece, high speed links and too little on local services - less glamorous perhaps, but more important to most people,"" he writes. He says the new plan helps larger cities but also smaller places and does not neglect short-distance services ""which people use every day"". He writes that it has become clear under the original plan ""high speed lines would not have reached the East Midlands and Yorkshire, until at best the early to mid 2040s"". The prime minister adds that while some people had called for the government to ""rigidly stick  to the old plans"", they were in effect ""condemning the North and the East Midlands to get nothing for ten years or more"". Danny SavageNorth of England correspondent If life is about compromises then a very big one has just
been put upon northern England. It doesnât have the same train commuter culture
as south east England because the stations and rail lines arenât there but it
does aspire to have something which allows better use of public transport. To
level up. Currently it is a land where new trains run on old lines. Yorkshire wanted to be at one end of HS2. A new high speed line across the Pennines has been
seriously talked about - arguably promised by Boris Johnson. The compromise is the new connection between Yorkshire
and Birmingham will be partially high speed and the new line between West
Yorkshire and Manchester will be high speed west of the Pennines. The rest of
the existing line via Huddersfield will be upgraded. Journey times will be quicker - and many people will be
satisfied with that. Others will be left wondering what could have been. At present, Leeds to Manchester Victoria takes 53 minutes
on the fastest service. This will get much better but not before years of
engineering work. Journey times cross country from York and the north-east will
also improve. Thereâs a pledge to give a large part of urban West Yorkshire a
mass transit system. That could finally see trams in Leeds - something talked
about for decades. Bradford gets a faster connection to Leeds but is left in the sidings again in transpennine terms. Â£96bn on the railways is a lot of money - change will be
noticeable - but it falls far short of aspirations this government built up. A commuter from Leeds who travels by train for work in Birmingham, Sheffield and London says the decision to scrap the HS2 line to Leeds is no surprise to him. Speaking to the BBC on the train to Birmingham Anthony Stalgis tells us: ""I knew this would happen"". âThe government is so
London-centric that the risk of HS2 turning into a project to expand the London
commuter belt was very high indeed. âIf the project had been
properly risk assessed, that risk would have led to starting from Leeds and
working down to make sure the risk didn't take place. âItâs hard not to believe
that scrapping the northern bit was the plan all along. âAs for the North, the rail
connections between Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield are a national disgrace. We
call it snail rail. Itâs quicker to drive in
some cases. âAs usual it's London making
decisions from London by Londoners."" Labour leader Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson has today ""ripped up"" his promises to take HS2 all the way to Leeds, and build a new line between the city and Manchester. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Bradford, he says the north of England has been betrayed. ""This was the first test of levelling up, and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North,"" he says. He adds that today's plan reveals the levelling up ambition is ""just a slogan"". A reminder on what levelling up is,here. Tony RoeBBC East Midlands political editor I've been travelling with the Prime Minister this morning. I joined him at Newark for a
short hop to Doncaster. He pored over a rail map and pointed out that HS2
is going to be delivered to the East Midlands despite earlier reports of its
demise. A multi-billion pound investment which will, however, only take the new
line to East Midlands Parkway. He also pledged the long-awaited and long-demanded electrification of the whole Midlands mainline which runs through Leicester and
Nottingham to Sheffield. And while HS2 will halt at the Parkway station near
East Midlands Airport, the line will continue to Toton and a new rail transport
hub will still be built there connecting local services. And it may not be the
end of the full eastern leg. That could still happen in the long term. This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has outlined the government's Integrated Rail Plan in the House of Commons. Here's a recap of what's been said:  You can see the full planhere,external(a word of warning it does come to 161 pages). The PM says the rail plans announced earlier will produce commuter benefits, even if it does destroy parts of the English countryside. ""We are not just digging huge swathes of new rail across virgin countryside through peaceful villages which is what some of the critics are saying we should be doing more of,"" he says. ""We are doing a bit of that, there's no doubt about it, we are building 100 miles of high speed line. But we are also improving and upgrading the commuter network to shorten journey times across the whole north of the country,"" he says. Asked how he will make sure people can afford to travel by train, he says: ""The way to cut costs on train travel is to modernise and electrify and that's what we are doing."" He says setting mass footfall will enable government to start to drive the cost down. The PM says HS2 plus Northern Powerhouse rail ""will offer for young people commuting in the Midlands and the North the same type of confidence about their daily lives, about their commutes, as people have been used to for a century in the south."" Conservative Huw Merriman, the chairman of the Transport Select Committee, has told the Commons that the prime minister promised that HS2 and Northern Powerhouse rail ""was not an either/or option"" but says that those in Leeds and Bradford may view it as ""neither"". ""This is the danger in selling perpetual sunlight and then leaving it for others to explain the arrival of moonlight,"" he says. He says that the new plan includes some ""fantastic projects"" which will slash journey times and better connect northern cities. He then asks, given the expense of electrification in the UK, what steps have been taken to ensure the projects will be delivered on time and on budget. Grant Shapps says the rail minister is carrying out an electrification challenge to bring the industry in and push them to build on electrification ""much faster than currently happens"".

""They focused too much on showpiece, high speed links and too little on local services - less glamorous perhaps, but more important to most people,"" he writes. He says the new plan helps larger cities but also smaller places and does not neglect short-distance services ""which people use every day"". He writes that it has become clear under the original plan ""high speed lines would not have reached the East Midlands and Yorkshire, until at best the early to mid 2040s"". The prime minister adds that while some people had called for the government to ""rigidly stick  to the old plans"", they were in effect ""condemning the North and the East Midlands to get nothing for ten years or more"". Danny SavageNorth of England correspondent If life is about compromises then a very big one has just
been put upon northern England. It doesnât have the same train commuter culture
as south east England because the stations and rail lines arenât there but it
does aspire to have something which allows better use of public transport. To
level up. Currently it is a land where new trains run on old lines. Yorkshire wanted to be at one end of HS2. A new high speed line across the Pennines has been
seriously talked about - arguably promised by Boris Johnson. The compromise is the new connection between Yorkshire
and Birmingham will be partially high speed and the new line between West
Yorkshire and Manchester will be high speed west of the Pennines. The rest of
the existing line via Huddersfield will be upgraded. Journey times will be quicker - and many people will be
satisfied with that. Others will be left wondering what could have been. At present, Leeds to Manchester Victoria takes 53 minutes
on the fastest service. This will get much better but not before years of
engineering work. Journey times cross country from York and the north-east will
also improve. Thereâs a pledge to give a large part of urban West Yorkshire a
mass transit system. That could finally see trams in Leeds - something talked
about for decades. Bradford gets a faster connection to Leeds but is left in the sidings again in transpennine terms. Â£96bn on the railways is a lot of money - change will be
noticeable - but it falls far short of aspirations this government built up. A commuter from Leeds who travels by train for work in Birmingham, Sheffield and London says the decision to scrap the HS2 line to Leeds is no surprise to him. Speaking to the BBC on the train to Birmingham Anthony Stalgis tells us: ""I knew this would happen"". âThe government is so
London-centric that the risk of HS2 turning into a project to expand the London
commuter belt was very high indeed. âIf the project had been
properly risk assessed, that risk would have led to starting from Leeds and
working down to make sure the risk didn't take place. âItâs hard not to believe
that scrapping the northern bit was the plan all along. âAs for the North, the rail
connections between Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield are a national disgrace. We
call it snail rail. Itâs quicker to drive in
some cases. âAs usual it's London making
decisions from London by Londoners."" Labour leader Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson has today ""ripped up"" his promises to take HS2 all the way to Leeds, and build a new line between the city and Manchester. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Bradford, he says the north of England has been betrayed. ""This was the first test of levelling up, and the government has completely failed and let down everybody in the North,"" he says. He adds that today's plan reveals the levelling up ambition is ""just a slogan"". A reminder on what levelling up is,here. Tony RoeBBC East Midlands political editor I've been travelling with the Prime Minister this morning. I joined him at Newark for a
short hop to Doncaster. He pored over a rail map and pointed out that HS2
is going to be delivered to the East Midlands despite earlier reports of its
demise. A multi-billion pound investment which will, however, only take the new
line to East Midlands Parkway. He also pledged the long-awaited and long-demanded electrification of the whole Midlands mainline which runs through Leicester and
Nottingham to Sheffield. And while HS2 will halt at the Parkway station near
East Midlands Airport, the line will continue to Toton and a new rail transport
hub will still be built there connecting local services. And it may not be the
end of the full eastern leg. That could still happen in the long term. This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has outlined the government's Integrated Rail Plan in the House of Commons. Here's a recap of what's been said:  You can see the full planhere,external(a word of warning it does come to 161 pages). The PM says the rail plans announced earlier will produce commuter benefits, even if it does destroy parts of the English countryside. ""We are not just digging huge swathes of new rail across virgin countryside through peaceful villages which is what some of the critics are saying we should be doing more of,"" he says. ""We are doing a bit of that, there's no doubt about it, we are building 100 miles of high speed line. But we are also improving and upgrading the commuter network to shorten journey times across the whole north of the country,"" he says. Asked how he will make sure people can afford to travel by train, he says: ""The way to cut costs on train travel is to modernise and electrify and that's what we are doing."" He says setting mass footfall will enable government to start to drive the cost down. The PM says HS2 plus Northern Powerhouse rail ""will offer for young people commuting in the Midlands and the North the same type of confidence about their daily lives, about their commutes, as people have been used to for a century in the south."" Conservative Huw Merriman, the chairman of the Transport Select Committee, has told the Commons that the prime minister promised that HS2 and Northern Powerhouse rail ""was not an either/or option"" but says that those in Leeds and Bradford may view it as ""neither"". ""This is the danger in selling perpetual sunlight and then leaving it for others to explain the arrival of moonlight,"" he says. He says that the new plan includes some ""fantastic projects"" which will slash journey times and better connect northern cities. He then asks, given the expense of electrification in the UK, what steps have been taken to ensure the projects will be delivered on time and on budget. Grant Shapps says the rail minister is carrying out an electrification challenge to bring the industry in and push them to build on electrification ""much faster than currently happens"".

If you are just joining us here's what has been happening today: Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have announced tighter restrictions for unvaccinated people, in a bid to encourage vaccine uptake. The Czech government has approved rules which allow only those who
are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid in the past six
months to enter restaurants, attend certain events and use
various other services from Monday, the Reuters news agency reports. Slovakia took a similar step, in what Prime Minister Eduard
Heger describes as a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"" - echoing themove in Austria earlier this week. Both governments will also require testing at workplaces. ""The main goal of these measures is motivation for
vaccinations,"" Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtech says. With 58% of the population inoculated, the Czech vaccination
rate is below the European Union average, while Slovakia has the EU's
third-lowest rate, with 45% of the population inoculated. Spanish beach resort Benidorm has opened a Covid vaccination centre specifically for tourists to combat rising case numbers in the area. The clinic is located near the hotel district and was drawing queues of
tourists this week, while further mobile vaccination points will be
set up by Valencian health authorities in areas where big crowds gather, Reuters is reporting. Mayor
Antonio Perez tells the news agency they are extending a public service to tourists  and it ""sends a message of safety"" to people. Spain requires all visitors entering the country to present
either a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR test, but bars
and restaurants do not require vaccine passports. New figures have been released showing that 92.5% of staff in care homes for older adults in England have now had two doses of a Covid vaccine, as of 14 November. It means 7.5% of staff - 34,291 people - have not been fully vaccinated. They're the first figures to be released by NHS England since the 11 November deadline set by the government for all staff working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home to be vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. The NHS figures also show 21.7% of social care staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers were not fully jabbed as of 14 November - that's an estimated 108,510 people. Our reporters spoke to care workers when the deadline passed last week -read more on what they had to say here. The US has bought
10 million treatment courses of a Covid-19
antiviral drug,US President Joe Biden said on Thursday,external. The contract with pharmaceutical giantPfizer for its Paxlovid treatmentwill cost the US government $5.29bn (Â£3.93bn at today's exchange rate), the Reuters news agency reports. Biden says the delivery of the pills would start by the end of 2021, if it is authorised by US  regulators. In a statement, the president said his administration was making
preparations to ensure the pills would be easily accessible and
free. ""This is positive news,"" he says. ""This treatment could prove to be another critical tool in our arsenal that will accelerate our path out of the pandemic."" But, he adds, vaccines remain ""our strongest tool"". The Netherlands has reported its highest number of daily Covid infections, exceeding new 20,000 cases for the third day in a row, Reuters news agency reports. About 23,600 people tested positive for the virus, the country's
national health institute says - up from just under 21,000 a day
before. The country has already brought in a partial lockdown. Back now to the situation in Germany. As we've been reporting today the number of Covid cases in the country has hit a record high. But where are cases worst? Saxony is the German region that has currently been hardest hit by the fourth wave of coronavirus. The state - in the east of the country, which has Dresden as its capital - has the highest infection rate as well as the lowest vaccination rate. Because of its status, it's considering measures like closing concerts, theatres and football games to the public and closing bars and nightclubs, Bild newspaper says. Daily infections there have risen 14 times in the past month, Reuters has reported. Infection rates are also high in Bavaria, in the south-east, and more measures are being considered there. The UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures. Overall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old. More than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. The UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period. There were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. The UK government has named 50 companies given fast-track ""VIP"" contracts to supply protective equipment to the NHS. Eighteen of them were nominated by Conservative politicians, Department of Health and Social Care data shows - with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and former health secretary Matt Hancock involved. VIP contracts were introduced as the NHS struggled for masks, gloves, gowns and other safety equipment after the outbreak of coronavirus. The government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies offering to supply the equipment. Contracts would usually be opened to competing bids. The information on the firms,externalchosen for VIP contracts follows a freedom-of-information request by the Good Law Project campaign group. The government said that ""to save lives, we focused our efforts, resources and attention on sourcing PPE"", adding it stood by efforts made to protect staff. Read more here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Covid case
rates are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly
surveillance figures for England reveal. The report from
the UK Health Security Agency, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group
has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time. In recent
months, the 10-19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per
100,000 tested. It is too soon
to say what is behind the change and whether it will continue. In recent weeks
children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs. The data also
shows confirmed Covid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those
aged 80 plus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The widow of a top official dealing with Scotland's pandemic response, who died after contracting Covid, believes the full details of his illness were concealed to protect a troubled hospital's reputation. Andrew Slorance went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago, where his wife Louise believes he caught the virus - as well as another life-threatening infection. He was the Scottish government's head of response and communication unit, in charge of its handling of the Covid pandemic. His widow tells the BBC she believes officials wanted to protect the hospital, which is already the subject of a public inquiry, as well as its reputation, ""no matter what the cost"". The hospital's health board says it had been ""open and honest"" and there had been no attempt to conceal any information from the family. You can read more on what happenedhere. There have been some changes this week in the UK about who can get their booster jabs - and about teenagers' vaccinations. So what is the new guidance? Here's a recap. All over-40s in the UK can now have a booster jab, as long as it's been six months after their second vaccine. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed. Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according toUK Health Security Agency data,external. You can now get a third dose if you're in one of these categories:  Those aged 16 and 17 can now have a second vaccine, 12 weeks after their first jab. And pregnant women are being urged to take up their offer of a vaccine, as they can be particularly at risk. The changes follow new recommendations from the government's advisers, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. All the details arehere. This video can not be played Covid in Wales: Maternity visiting rules unfair, says mum Visitors should be allowed into maternity units in Wales without restrictions, a charity says. Since the pandemic started, some units have stopped all visiting while others have limited times parents can spend with newborns. The rules currently vary between health boards, with some of them including banning visits entirely, other limiting visits to a few hours and some only allowing designated partners in within certain times of the day. But with restrictions on movement and social distancing eased across the country, Birthrights wants hospital maternity units to also open up. The Welsh government says maternity services keep their rules under review and there was a ""delicate balance"" between protecting vulnerable individuals and allowing visiting. Read morehere. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin The debate in Germanyâs parliament today was emotional, with
plenty of finger-pointing for the sharp rise in infections. The mood in the
country is equally fractious, with commentators asking why politicians didnât
use the lull in infections during the summer, to prepare the booster campaign
and plan for a predictably tough winter. Some hospitals say they are at full capacity, and worry they will
be overwhelmed when the current high rates translate into more
hospitalisations. These
stark warnings mean that, in polls, most Germans support tougher measures. Until
now, excluding unvaccinated people from some activities has not sparked
widespread protest. In one survey, a majority supports allowing only vaccinated
people to access leisure services, such as restaurants. These measures have
been easy to implement. Customers have quickly become used to showing waiters
proof of vaccine before ordering food. The newer measures decided on Thursday might be more difficult to
implement. Transport trade unions say their members shouldnât have to police
the vaccine status of passengers because of potential aggression. And some
employers question how they can organise daily tests for workers. But
if the choice is between more deaths or making life more difficult for
unvaccinated people, the consensus in Germany is more restrictions for people
who donât want the jab. Germany is facing its highest case numbers since the coronavirus pandemic began. We've been looking at the pattern of how case numbers have been going up and down. There was a small peak early in the pandemic, if you look at the seven-day averages, but the first big wave peaked at the end of December. There was another surge - although not as big as the one at the end of 2020 - at the end of April before a decrease. There was a rise again to a new peak in September which plateaued for a while before rapidly climbing again to the new highs we see now. There's information on theJohns Hopkins world coronavirus map,externalas well, which breaks down the figures if you're keen for more detail. The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning there is a ""hard winter ahead"" for Europe. Asked by the BBC if it was concerned vaccines did not appear to be preventing a surge in cases, its regional director for Europe Hans Kluge says: ""Of course vaccines have been a game-changer. ""But far too many remain unvaccinated, so we have pockets in which the virus continues to spread and cause strain on local and national health systems."" He was speaking amid a surge in European countries, as we've been reporting on here today. This public health emergency is far from being over, and the current rise of cases in most countries in the region, caused by the combination of insufficient vaccination coverage, the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant, shows that a hard winter is ahead of us."" Dr Hans Kluge, WHO We were telling you earlier about Covid passes in Wales and Scotland - another country considering extending their use is Spain. The Basque Country wants to make it mandatory for people visiting bars, clubs or restaurants to show a vaccination certificate, reports Spanish newspaper El Pais. It would show whether they have been fully vaccinated, at least 14 days previously, if they have had Covid over the previous six months, or tested negative for the virus. Spanish regions are in charge of their own healthcare systems, including Covid-19 measures and vaccinations. Overall in Spain, 79% of the population is now fully vaccinated. The daily case rate is rising at the moment with latest 14-day figures showing 88.6 cases per 100,000 people. As we've been reporting, there has been some fierce debate in the German lower house of parliament over proposed new measures to curb the current spike in the country's cases. Here are some excerpts that give a flavour of what was said in the chamber.  More people will get infected and become ill, many of them seriously. That worries me deeply and I will say clearly: we are in an emergency situation, especially the hospitals and we must react now, resolutely and together, the government, the German states and communities. This is what today's parliamentary debate is about, as is customary in a democracy."" Katrin Goering-Eckardt, Green Party parliamentary chairwoman Today's debate is not about the conservatives or the [incoming] SPD, FDP and Greens government, it's about protecting our country and in order to do so, we are putting the right measures in place, ladies and gentlemen."" Marco Buschmann, Senior FDP lawmaker If you decide to go down that road with the majority you have here, against our and my proposals, please don't use someone else as a scapegoat every time or as a punching ball. If you want to represent the new majority here, you have to take on the responsibility. No-one can relieve you of that duty."" Jens Spahn, Outgoing Health Minister Â© 2025 BBC.

The Basque Country wants to make it mandatory for people visiting bars, clubs or restaurants to show a vaccination certificate, reports Spanish newspaper El Pais. It would show whether they have been fully vaccinated, at least 14 days previously, if they have had Covid over the previous six months, or tested negative for the virus. Spanish regions are in charge of their own healthcare systems, including Covid-19 measures and vaccinations. Overall in Spain, 79% of the population is now fully vaccinated. The daily case rate is rising at the moment with latest 14-day figures showing 88.6 cases per 100,000 people. As we've been reporting, there has been some fierce debate in the German lower house of parliament over proposed new measures to curb the current spike in the country's cases. Here are some excerpts that give a flavour of what was said in the chamber.  More people will get infected and become ill, many of them seriously. That worries me deeply and I will say clearly: we are in an emergency situation, especially the hospitals and we must react now, resolutely and together, the government, the German states and communities. This is what today's parliamentary debate is about, as is customary in a democracy."" Katrin Goering-Eckardt, Green Party parliamentary chairwoman Today's debate is not about the conservatives or the [incoming] SPD, FDP and Greens government, it's about protecting our country and in order to do so, we are putting the right measures in place, ladies and gentlemen."" Marco Buschmann, Senior FDP lawmaker If you decide to go down that road with the majority you have here, against our and my proposals, please don't use someone else as a scapegoat every time or as a punching ball. If you want to represent the new majority here, you have to take on the responsibility. No-one can relieve you of that duty."" Jens Spahn, Outgoing Health Minister Â© 2025 BBC.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Conservative MPs he ""crashed the car"" in his handling of the case of the party's former MP Owen Paterson. It comes after Tory MPs voted through a proposal that is expected to lead to a ban on them taking paid political consultancy work. Labour abstained from the vote, saying the government's plan was a watered down version of its own plan. No 10 has faced weeks of political pressure over the Paterson row. Mr Johnson has conceded publicly that he made a mistake in ""conflating"" changes to the Parliamentary standards system with the disciplinary process for Mr Paterson, who broke lobbying rules. But the PM stopped short of apologising for the debacle, during a grilling by senior MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee. In private, at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers on Wednesday night, he was even more candid - telling them he had ""crashed the car"" over the Paterson case. His message was greeted with the traditional desk banging to show approval, but some MPs leaving the meeting had a more downbeat assessment. One told the BBC the prime minister had looked and sounded ""weak"". Another, who backed him in the leadership campaign, said the meeting had been ""very flat"", with ""hostile questioning from all factions"". BBC Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt said one Brexit grandee told him ""it was awful - he's like an old rock star in need of new material"". Labour wanted the standards committee to draw up new rules by 31 January to implement the ban on MPs working as political consultants. But the government ordered its MPs to vote against the opposition's motion, defeating it by 51 votes. The government's amendment was passed by 297 to zero, after Labour ordered its MPs not to take part. MPs back government plans to curb second jobs PM follows Labour call to ban MP paid adviser jobs Which MPs have second jobs? Under the government's plan any outside role, paid or unpaid, should be ""within reasonable limits"" and not stop MPs fully serving their constituents. This is yet to be defined, but International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has suggested 15 hours a week would be a reasonable limit. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said limits could be placed on hours worked or the amount earned. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said there was a lack of urgency in the government's plan, which has no timetable. ""People look at MPs and think it is just mired in sleaze. I think we need to sort this out quickly to restore the reputation of Parliament,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. In a statement after the vote, the government said MPs had backed updating the code of conduct for MPs. ""This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents,"" it said. ""This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this."" The Commons Committee on Standards is due to report its recommendations early next year. The committee's chairman, Labour MP Chris Bryant, said it would then be up to ministers to find the necessary time to debate any planned changes. On Wednesday night, MPs did vote to tighten up the rules on what they are allowed to do to earn money on the side. Or, at least, that when there are precise proposals, they will make decisions on it, at some not entirely precise date in the future... No 10 hopes that it will be the end - or at least the beginning of the end - of the self-inflicted fortnight of bad headlines and claims of sleaze that have come, day after day after day. And, with that, allow the government to move on to make noise about what they are trying to get done, rather than the things that are going wrong. Will they get their way? Read more from Laura Arguments over second jobs held by MPs outside of Westminster have intensified in recent weeks in the wake of the Owen Paterson case. The Conservative MP was found to have broken Commons rules by using his position to lobby for two companies paying him. The government tried to block his suspension from Parliament and get the whole disciplinary process for MPs reviewed. But it abandoned the plan a day later, after an outcry from opposition MPs and some Tories. Mr Paterson then resigned as an MP. Appearing in front of the Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson said he believed the MP had broken the rules, saying it was ""extraordinary"" that some of his colleagues ""behave in these ways"". There's nothing to stop MPs - other than ministers - doing extra work on top of the job they were elected to do. The rules do not prohibit them earning money - in addition to their Â£81,932 salary - or gaining greater experience of the world beyond Westminster. So, MPs can continue to work in professions such as the law or medicine. Or they can work as consultants for companies, offering advice on strategy. But they must not lobby - try to alter government policy - for firms, individuals or organisations who pay them, or use Commons facilities to do work on behalf of employers or clients. MPs have to register their outside earnings and if they take part in a debate or other parliamentary activities in which their employer or client is involved, they have to declare an interest. Any breaches of Parliament's code of conduct can result in punishment, including a suspension from the Commons.

"UK employers should stop asking jobseekers about their previous salaries, a campaign group is urging. The Fawcett Society says asking about previous pay when recruiting contributes to the gender pay gap, by keeping women on lower wages. Its survey of 2,200 working adults found that 47% of people had been asked about past salaries. Meanwhile, 61% of women said the question had an impact on their confidence to negotiate better pay. The Fawcett Society's chief executive Jemima Olchawski told the BBC that unless more is done, the gender pay gap will not be closed until at least 2050. ""We're calling on employers to make a simple change and stop asking potential employees about salary history,"" she said. ""Evidence shows that this will help to stamp out pay inequality, not only for women but for people of colour, and people with disabilities."" Workers call the shots as job vacancies boom Where are all the job vacancies? Firms step up graduate pay amid fierce competition The campaign group warned that asking prospective candidates about their salary history meant companies could end up replicating gender pay gaps from other organisations. The survey also found that 58% of women and 54% of men felt salary history questions meant they were offered a lower wage than they might otherwise have been paid. Only a quarter of people feel that pay should be based on past salaries, compared to 80% of respondents, who felt that their pay should be based on their skill and responsibilities. The campaign group also found that 77% of people felt their salaries should reflect the value of the work they do. The report added that the pace of change to close the gender pay gap was ""glacial"". The Fawcett Society stressed that more needed to be done by the government and employers to tackle its causes, such as stamping out discrimination. Peter Cheese, head of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), agrees that setting pay grades based on what people were paid in previous jobs can ""exacerbate the problem"". But he believed questions about previous salaries were legitimate. ""I'm not convinced that employers should never ask about previous pay because it's not an unnatural question to ask,"" he told the BBC. ""Indeed, prospective employees will tend to raise their expectations about pay and that's a perfectly natural question in the recruitment process."" He said that the issue was becoming prominent now because the UK was in a tight labour market with ""upwards pressure"" on pay. ""We need to be honest about that - if we think we can get away with paying the absolute minimum, we might be disappointed about our ability to recruit,"" Mr Cheese added.

This live page was written by Lauren Turner, Adam Durbin, Alexandra Fouche and Matt Murphy, and edited by John Hand and Emma Harrison. Thanks for reading and we hope you'll join us again soon. If you are just joining us here's what has been happening today: Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have announced tighter restrictions for unvaccinated people, in a bid to encourage vaccine uptake. The Czech government has approved rules which allow only those who
are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid in the past six
months to enter restaurants, attend certain events and use
various other services from Monday, the Reuters news agency reports. Slovakia took a similar step, in what Prime Minister Eduard
Heger describes as a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"" - echoing themove in Austria earlier this week. Both governments will also require testing at workplaces. ""The main goal of these measures is motivation for
vaccinations,"" Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtech says. With 58% of the population inoculated, the Czech vaccination
rate is below the European Union average, while Slovakia has the EU's
third-lowest rate, with 45% of the population inoculated. Spanish beach resort Benidorm has opened a Covid vaccination centre specifically for tourists to combat rising case numbers in the area. The clinic is located near the hotel district and was drawing queues of
tourists this week, while further mobile vaccination points will be
set up by Valencian health authorities in areas where big crowds gather, Reuters is reporting. Mayor
Antonio Perez tells the news agency they are extending a public service to tourists  and it ""sends a message of safety"" to people. Spain requires all visitors entering the country to present
either a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR test, but bars
and restaurants do not require vaccine passports. New figures have been released showing that 92.5% of staff in care homes for older adults in England have now had two doses of a Covid vaccine, as of 14 November. It means 7.5% of staff - 34,291 people - have not been fully vaccinated. They're the first figures to be released by NHS England since the 11 November deadline set by the government for all staff working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home to be vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. The NHS figures also show 21.7% of social care staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers were not fully jabbed as of 14 November - that's an estimated 108,510 people. Our reporters spoke to care workers when the deadline passed last week -read more on what they had to say here. The US has bought
10 million treatment courses of a Covid-19
antiviral drug,US President Joe Biden said on Thursday,external. The contract with pharmaceutical giantPfizer for its Paxlovid treatmentwill cost the US government $5.29bn (Â£3.93bn at today's exchange rate), the Reuters news agency reports. Biden says the delivery of the pills would start by the end of 2021, if it is authorised by US  regulators. In a statement, the president said his administration was making
preparations to ensure the pills would be easily accessible and
free. ""This is positive news,"" he says. ""This treatment could prove to be another critical tool in our arsenal that will accelerate our path out of the pandemic."" But, he adds, vaccines remain ""our strongest tool"". The Netherlands has reported its highest number of daily Covid infections, exceeding new 20,000 cases for the third day in a row, Reuters news agency reports. About 23,600 people tested positive for the virus, the country's
national health institute says - up from just under 21,000 a day
before. The country has already brought in a partial lockdown. Back now to the situation in Germany. As we've been reporting today the number of Covid cases in the country has hit a record high. But where are cases worst? Saxony is the German region that has currently been hardest hit by the fourth wave of coronavirus. The state - in the east of the country, which has Dresden as its capital - has the highest infection rate as well as the lowest vaccination rate. Because of its status, it's considering measures like closing concerts, theatres and football games to the public and closing bars and nightclubs, Bild newspaper says. Daily infections there have risen 14 times in the past month, Reuters has reported. Infection rates are also high in Bavaria, in the south-east, and more measures are being considered there. The UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures. Overall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old. More than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. The UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period. There were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. The UK government has named 50 companies given fast-track ""VIP"" contracts to supply protective equipment to the NHS. Eighteen of them were nominated by Conservative politicians, Department of Health and Social Care data shows - with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and former health secretary Matt Hancock involved. VIP contracts were introduced as the NHS struggled for masks, gloves, gowns and other safety equipment after the outbreak of coronavirus. The government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies offering to supply the equipment. Contracts would usually be opened to competing bids. The information on the firms,externalchosen for VIP contracts follows a freedom-of-information request by the Good Law Project campaign group. The government said that ""to save lives, we focused our efforts, resources and attention on sourcing PPE"", adding it stood by efforts made to protect staff. Read more here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Covid case
rates are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly
surveillance figures for England reveal. The report from
the UK Health Security Agency, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group
has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time. In recent
months, the 10-19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per
100,000 tested. It is too soon
to say what is behind the change and whether it will continue. In recent weeks
children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs. The data also
shows confirmed Covid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those
aged 80 plus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The widow of a top official dealing with Scotland's pandemic response, who died after contracting Covid, believes the full details of his illness were concealed to protect a troubled hospital's reputation. Andrew Slorance went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago, where his wife Louise believes he caught the virus - as well as another life-threatening infection. He was the Scottish government's head of response and communication unit, in charge of its handling of the Covid pandemic. His widow tells the BBC she believes officials wanted to protect the hospital, which is already the subject of a public inquiry, as well as its reputation, ""no matter what the cost"". The hospital's health board says it had been ""open and honest"" and there had been no attempt to conceal any information from the family. You can read more on what happenedhere. There have been some changes this week in the UK about who can get their booster jabs - and about teenagers' vaccinations. So what is the new guidance? Here's a recap. All over-40s in the UK can now have a booster jab, as long as it's been six months after their second vaccine. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed. Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according toUK Health Security Agency data,external. You can now get a third dose if you're in one of these categories:  Those aged 16 and 17 can now have a second vaccine, 12 weeks after their first jab. And pregnant women are being urged to take up their offer of a vaccine, as they can be particularly at risk. The changes follow new recommendations from the government's advisers, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. All the details arehere. This video can not be played Covid in Wales: Maternity visiting rules unfair, says mum Visitors should be allowed into maternity units in Wales without restrictions, a charity says. Since the pandemic started, some units have stopped all visiting while others have limited times parents can spend with newborns. The rules currently vary between health boards, with some of them including banning visits entirely, other limiting visits to a few hours and some only allowing designated partners in within certain times of the day. But with restrictions on movement and social distancing eased across the country, Birthrights wants hospital maternity units to also open up. The Welsh government says maternity services keep their rules under review and there was a ""delicate balance"" between protecting vulnerable individuals and allowing visiting. Read morehere. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin The debate in Germanyâs parliament today was emotional, with
plenty of finger-pointing for the sharp rise in infections. The mood in the
country is equally fractious, with commentators asking why politicians didnât
use the lull in infections during the summer, to prepare the booster campaign
and plan for a predictably tough winter. Some hospitals say they are at full capacity, and worry they will
be overwhelmed when the current high rates translate into more
hospitalisations. These
stark warnings mean that, in polls, most Germans support tougher measures. Until
now, excluding unvaccinated people from some activities has not sparked
widespread protest. In one survey, a majority supports allowing only vaccinated
people to access leisure services, such as restaurants. These measures have
been easy to implement. Customers have quickly become used to showing waiters
proof of vaccine before ordering food. The newer measures decided on Thursday might be more difficult to
implement. Transport trade unions say their members shouldnât have to police
the vaccine status of passengers because of potential aggression. And some
employers question how they can organise daily tests for workers. But
if the choice is between more deaths or making life more difficult for
unvaccinated people, the consensus in Germany is more restrictions for people
who donât want the jab. Germany is facing its highest case numbers since the coronavirus pandemic began. We've been looking at the pattern of how case numbers have been going up and down. There was a small peak early in the pandemic, if you look at the seven-day averages, but the first big wave peaked at the end of December. There was another surge - although not as big as the one at the end of 2020 - at the end of April before a decrease. There was a rise again to a new peak in September which plateaued for a while before rapidly climbing again to the new highs we see now. There's information on theJohns Hopkins world coronavirus map,externalas well, which breaks down the figures if you're keen for more detail. The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning there is a ""hard winter ahead"" for Europe. Asked by the BBC if it was concerned vaccines did not appear to be preventing a surge in cases, its regional director for Europe Hans Kluge says: ""Of course vaccines have been a game-changer. ""But far too many remain unvaccinated, so we have pockets in which the virus continues to spread and cause strain on local and national health systems."" He was speaking amid a surge in European countries, as we've been reporting on here today. This public health emergency is far from being over, and the current rise of cases in most countries in the region, caused by the combination of insufficient vaccination coverage, the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant, shows that a hard winter is ahead of us."" Dr Hans Kluge, WHO We were telling you earlier about Covid passes in Wales and Scotland - another country considering extending their use is Spain. The Basque Country wants to make it mandatory for people visiting bars, clubs or restaurants to show a vaccination certificate, reports Spanish newspaper El Pais. It would show whether they have been fully vaccinated, at least 14 days previously, if they have had Covid over the previous six months, or tested negative for the virus. Spanish regions are in charge of their own healthcare systems, including Covid-19 measures and vaccinations. Overall in Spain, 79% of the population is now fully vaccinated. The daily case rate is rising at the moment with latest 14-day figures showing 88.6 cases per 100,000 people. As we've been reporting, there has been some fierce debate in the German lower house of parliament over proposed new measures to curb the current spike in the country's cases. Here are some excerpts that give a flavour of what was said in the chamber.  More people will get infected and become ill, many of them seriously. That worries me deeply and I will say clearly: we are in an emergency situation, especially the hospitals and we must react now, resolutely and together, the government, the German states and communities. This is what today's parliamentary debate is about, as is customary in a democracy."" Katrin Goering-Eckardt, Green Party parliamentary chairwoman Today's debate is not about the conservatives or the [incoming] SPD, FDP and Greens government, it's about protecting our country and in order to do so, we are putting the right measures in place, ladies and gentlemen.""

This live page was written by Lauren Turner, Adam Durbin, Alexandra Fouche and Matt Murphy, and edited by John Hand and Emma Harrison. Thanks for reading and we hope you'll join us again soon. If you are just joining us here's what has been happening today: Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have announced tighter restrictions for unvaccinated people, in a bid to encourage vaccine uptake. The Czech government has approved rules which allow only those who
are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid in the past six
months to enter restaurants, attend certain events and use
various other services from Monday, the Reuters news agency reports. Slovakia took a similar step, in what Prime Minister Eduard
Heger describes as a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"" - echoing themove in Austria earlier this week. Both governments will also require testing at workplaces. ""The main goal of these measures is motivation for
vaccinations,"" Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtech says. With 58% of the population inoculated, the Czech vaccination
rate is below the European Union average, while Slovakia has the EU's
third-lowest rate, with 45% of the population inoculated. Spanish beach resort Benidorm has opened a Covid vaccination centre specifically for tourists to combat rising case numbers in the area. The clinic is located near the hotel district and was drawing queues of
tourists this week, while further mobile vaccination points will be
set up by Valencian health authorities in areas where big crowds gather, Reuters is reporting. Mayor
Antonio Perez tells the news agency they are extending a public service to tourists  and it ""sends a message of safety"" to people. Spain requires all visitors entering the country to present
either a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR test, but bars
and restaurants do not require vaccine passports. New figures have been released showing that 92.5% of staff in care homes for older adults in England have now had two doses of a Covid vaccine, as of 14 November. It means 7.5% of staff - 34,291 people - have not been fully vaccinated. They're the first figures to be released by NHS England since the 11 November deadline set by the government for all staff working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home to be vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. The NHS figures also show 21.7% of social care staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers were not fully jabbed as of 14 November - that's an estimated 108,510 people. Our reporters spoke to care workers when the deadline passed last week -read more on what they had to say here. The US has bought
10 million treatment courses of a Covid-19
antiviral drug,US President Joe Biden said on Thursday,external. The contract with pharmaceutical giantPfizer for its Paxlovid treatmentwill cost the US government $5.29bn (Â£3.93bn at today's exchange rate), the Reuters news agency reports. Biden says the delivery of the pills would start by the end of 2021, if it is authorised by US  regulators. In a statement, the president said his administration was making
preparations to ensure the pills would be easily accessible and
free. ""This is positive news,"" he says. ""This treatment could prove to be another critical tool in our arsenal that will accelerate our path out of the pandemic."" But, he adds, vaccines remain ""our strongest tool"". The Netherlands has reported its highest number of daily Covid infections, exceeding new 20,000 cases for the third day in a row, Reuters news agency reports. About 23,600 people tested positive for the virus, the country's
national health institute says - up from just under 21,000 a day
before. The country has already brought in a partial lockdown. Back now to the situation in Germany. As we've been reporting today the number of Covid cases in the country has hit a record high. But where are cases worst? Saxony is the German region that has currently been hardest hit by the fourth wave of coronavirus. The state - in the east of the country, which has Dresden as its capital - has the highest infection rate as well as the lowest vaccination rate. Because of its status, it's considering measures like closing concerts, theatres and football games to the public and closing bars and nightclubs, Bild newspaper says. Daily infections there have risen 14 times in the past month, Reuters has reported. Infection rates are also high in Bavaria, in the south-east, and more measures are being considered there. The UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures. Overall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old. More than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. The UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period. There were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. The UK government has named 50 companies given fast-track ""VIP"" contracts to supply protective equipment to the NHS. Eighteen of them were nominated by Conservative politicians, Department of Health and Social Care data shows - with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and former health secretary Matt Hancock involved. VIP contracts were introduced as the NHS struggled for masks, gloves, gowns and other safety equipment after the outbreak of coronavirus. The government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies offering to supply the equipment. Contracts would usually be opened to competing bids. The information on the firms,externalchosen for VIP contracts follows a freedom-of-information request by the Good Law Project campaign group. The government said that ""to save lives, we focused our efforts, resources and attention on sourcing PPE"", adding it stood by efforts made to protect staff. Read more here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Covid case
rates are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly
surveillance figures for England reveal. The report from
the UK Health Security Agency, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group
has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time. In recent
months, the 10-19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per
100,000 tested. It is too soon
to say what is behind the change and whether it will continue. In recent weeks
children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs. The data also
shows confirmed Covid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those
aged 80 plus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The widow of a top official dealing with Scotland's pandemic response, who died after contracting Covid, believes the full details of his illness were concealed to protect a troubled hospital's reputation. Andrew Slorance went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago, where his wife Louise believes he caught the virus - as well as another life-threatening infection. He was the Scottish government's head of response and communication unit, in charge of its handling of the Covid pandemic. His widow tells the BBC she believes officials wanted to protect the hospital, which is already the subject of a public inquiry, as well as its reputation, ""no matter what the cost"". The hospital's health board says it had been ""open and honest"" and there had been no attempt to conceal any information from the family. You can read more on what happenedhere. There have been some changes this week in the UK about who can get their booster jabs - and about teenagers' vaccinations. So what is the new guidance? Here's a recap. All over-40s in the UK can now have a booster jab, as long as it's been six months after their second vaccine. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed. Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according toUK Health Security Agency data,external. You can now get a third dose if you're in one of these categories:  Those aged 16 and 17 can now have a second vaccine, 12 weeks after their first jab. And pregnant women are being urged to take up their offer of a vaccine, as they can be particularly at risk. The changes follow new recommendations from the government's advisers, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. All the details arehere. This video can not be played Covid in Wales: Maternity visiting rules unfair, says mum Visitors should be allowed into maternity units in Wales without restrictions, a charity says. Since the pandemic started, some units have stopped all visiting while others have limited times parents can spend with newborns. The rules currently vary between health boards, with some of them including banning visits entirely, other limiting visits to a few hours and some only allowing designated partners in within certain times of the day. But with restrictions on movement and social distancing eased across the country, Birthrights wants hospital maternity units to also open up. The Welsh government says maternity services keep their rules under review and there was a ""delicate balance"" between protecting vulnerable individuals and allowing visiting. Read morehere. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin The debate in Germanyâs parliament today was emotional, with
plenty of finger-pointing for the sharp rise in infections. The mood in the
country is equally fractious, with commentators asking why politicians didnât
use the lull in infections during the summer, to prepare the booster campaign
and plan for a predictably tough winter. Some hospitals say they are at full capacity, and worry they will
be overwhelmed when the current high rates translate into more
hospitalisations. These
stark warnings mean that, in polls, most Germans support tougher measures. Until
now, excluding unvaccinated people from some activities has not sparked
widespread protest. In one survey, a majority supports allowing only vaccinated
people to access leisure services, such as restaurants. These measures have
been easy to implement. Customers have quickly become used to showing waiters
proof of vaccine before ordering food. The newer measures decided on Thursday might be more difficult to
implement. Transport trade unions say their members shouldnât have to police

This live page was written by Lauren Turner, Adam Durbin, Alexandra Fouche and Matt Murphy, and edited by John Hand and Emma Harrison. Thanks for reading and we hope you'll join us again soon. If you are just joining us here's what has been happening today: Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have announced tighter restrictions for unvaccinated people, in a bid to encourage vaccine uptake. The Czech government has approved rules which allow only those who
are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid in the past six
months to enter restaurants, attend certain events and use
various other services from Monday, the Reuters news agency reports. Slovakia took a similar step, in what Prime Minister Eduard
Heger describes as a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"" - echoing themove in Austria earlier this week. Both governments will also require testing at workplaces. ""The main goal of these measures is motivation for
vaccinations,"" Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtech says. With 58% of the population inoculated, the Czech vaccination
rate is below the European Union average, while Slovakia has the EU's
third-lowest rate, with 45% of the population inoculated. Spanish beach resort Benidorm has opened a Covid vaccination centre specifically for tourists to combat rising case numbers in the area. The clinic is located near the hotel district and was drawing queues of
tourists this week, while further mobile vaccination points will be
set up by Valencian health authorities in areas where big crowds gather, Reuters is reporting. Mayor
Antonio Perez tells the news agency they are extending a public service to tourists  and it ""sends a message of safety"" to people. Spain requires all visitors entering the country to present
either a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR test, but bars
and restaurants do not require vaccine passports. New figures have been released showing that 92.5% of staff in care homes for older adults in England have now had two doses of a Covid vaccine, as of 14 November. It means 7.5% of staff - 34,291 people - have not been fully vaccinated. They're the first figures to be released by NHS England since the 11 November deadline set by the government for all staff working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home to be vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. The NHS figures also show 21.7% of social care staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers were not fully jabbed as of 14 November - that's an estimated 108,510 people. Our reporters spoke to care workers when the deadline passed last week -read more on what they had to say here. The US has bought
10 million treatment courses of a Covid-19
antiviral drug,US President Joe Biden said on Thursday,external. The contract with pharmaceutical giantPfizer for its Paxlovid treatmentwill cost the US government $5.29bn (Â£3.93bn at today's exchange rate), the Reuters news agency reports. Biden says the delivery of the pills would start by the end of 2021, if it is authorised by US  regulators. In a statement, the president said his administration was making
preparations to ensure the pills would be easily accessible and
free. ""This is positive news,"" he says. ""This treatment could prove to be another critical tool in our arsenal that will accelerate our path out of the pandemic."" But, he adds, vaccines remain ""our strongest tool"". The Netherlands has reported its highest number of daily Covid infections, exceeding new 20,000 cases for the third day in a row, Reuters news agency reports. About 23,600 people tested positive for the virus, the country's
national health institute says - up from just under 21,000 a day
before. The country has already brought in a partial lockdown. Back now to the situation in Germany. As we've been reporting today the number of Covid cases in the country has hit a record high. But where are cases worst? Saxony is the German region that has currently been hardest hit by the fourth wave of coronavirus. The state - in the east of the country, which has Dresden as its capital - has the highest infection rate as well as the lowest vaccination rate. Because of its status, it's considering measures like closing concerts, theatres and football games to the public and closing bars and nightclubs, Bild newspaper says. Daily infections there have risen 14 times in the past month, Reuters has reported. Infection rates are also high in Bavaria, in the south-east, and more measures are being considered there. The UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures. Overall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old. More than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. The UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period. There were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. The UK government has named 50 companies given fast-track ""VIP"" contracts to supply protective equipment to the NHS. Eighteen of them were nominated by Conservative politicians, Department of Health and Social Care data shows - with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and former health secretary Matt Hancock involved. VIP contracts were introduced as the NHS struggled for masks, gloves, gowns and other safety equipment after the outbreak of coronavirus. The government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies offering to supply the equipment. Contracts would usually be opened to competing bids. The information on the firms,externalchosen for VIP contracts follows a freedom-of-information request by the Good Law Project campaign group. The government said that ""to save lives, we focused our efforts, resources and attention on sourcing PPE"", adding it stood by efforts made to protect staff. Read more here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Covid case
rates are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly
surveillance figures for England reveal. The report from
the UK Health Security Agency, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group
has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time. In recent
months, the 10-19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per
100,000 tested. It is too soon
to say what is behind the change and whether it will continue. In recent weeks
children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs. The data also
shows confirmed Covid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those
aged 80 plus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The widow of a top official dealing with Scotland's pandemic response, who died after contracting Covid, believes the full details of his illness were concealed to protect a troubled hospital's reputation. Andrew Slorance went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago, where his wife Louise believes he caught the virus - as well as another life-threatening infection. He was the Scottish government's head of response and communication unit, in charge of its handling of the Covid pandemic. His widow tells the BBC she believes officials wanted to protect the hospital, which is already the subject of a public inquiry, as well as its reputation, ""no matter what the cost"". The hospital's health board says it had been ""open and honest"" and there had been no attempt to conceal any information from the family. You can read more on what happenedhere. There have been some changes this week in the UK about who can get their booster jabs - and about teenagers' vaccinations. So what is the new guidance? Here's a recap. All over-40s in the UK can now have a booster jab, as long as it's been six months after their second vaccine. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed. Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according toUK Health Security Agency data,external. You can now get a third dose if you're in one of these categories:  Those aged 16 and 17 can now have a second vaccine, 12 weeks after their first jab. And pregnant women are being urged to take up their offer of a vaccine, as they can be particularly at risk. The changes follow new recommendations from the government's advisers, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. All the details arehere. This video can not be played Covid in Wales: Maternity visiting rules unfair, says mum Visitors should be allowed into maternity units in Wales without restrictions, a charity says. Since the pandemic started, some units have stopped all visiting while others have limited times parents can spend with newborns. The rules currently vary between health boards, with some of them including banning visits entirely, other limiting visits to a few hours and some only allowing designated partners in within certain times of the day. But with restrictions on movement and social distancing eased across the country, Birthrights wants hospital maternity units to also open up. The Welsh government says maternity services keep their rules under review and there was a ""delicate balance"" between protecting vulnerable individuals and allowing visiting. Read morehere. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin The debate in Germanyâs parliament today was emotional, with
plenty of finger-pointing for the sharp rise in infections. The mood in the
country is equally fractious, with commentators asking why politicians didnât
use the lull in infections during the summer, to prepare the booster campaign
and plan for a predictably tough winter. Some hospitals say they are at full capacity, and worry they will
be overwhelmed when the current high rates translate into more
hospitalisations. These
stark warnings mean that, in polls, most Germans support tougher measures. Until
now, excluding unvaccinated people from some activities has not sparked
widespread protest. In one survey, a majority supports allowing only vaccinated
people to access leisure services, such as restaurants. These measures have
been easy to implement. Customers have quickly become used to showing waiters
proof of vaccine before ordering food. The newer measures decided on Thursday might be more difficult to
implement. Transport trade unions say their members shouldnât have to police
the vaccine status of passengers because of potential aggression. And some
employers question how they can organise daily tests for workers. But
if the choice is between more deaths or making life more difficult for
unvaccinated people, the consensus in Germany is more restrictions for people
who donât want the jab. Germany is facing its highest case numbers since the coronavirus pandemic began. We've been looking at the pattern of how case numbers have been going up and down. There was a small peak early in the pandemic, if you look at the seven-day averages, but the first big wave peaked at the end of December. There was another surge - although not as big as the one at the end of 2020 - at the end of April before a decrease. There was a rise again to a new peak in September which plateaued for a while before rapidly climbing again to the new highs we see now. There's information on theJohns Hopkins world coronavirus map,externalas well, which breaks down the figures if you're keen for more detail. The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning there is a ""hard winter ahead"" for Europe. Asked by the BBC if it was concerned vaccines did not appear to be preventing a surge in cases, its regional director for Europe Hans Kluge says: ""Of course vaccines have been a game-changer. ""But far too many remain unvaccinated, so we have pockets in which the virus continues to spread and cause strain on local and national health systems."" He was speaking amid a surge in European countries, as we've been reporting on here today. This public health emergency is far from being over, and the current rise of cases in most countries in the region, caused by the combination of insufficient vaccination coverage, the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant, shows that a hard winter is ahead of us."" Dr Hans Kluge, WHO We were telling you earlier about Covid passes in Wales and Scotland - another country considering extending their use is Spain. The Basque Country wants to make it mandatory for people visiting bars, clubs or restaurants to show a vaccination certificate, reports Spanish newspaper El Pais. It would show whether they have been fully vaccinated, at least 14 days previously, if they have had Covid over the previous six months, or tested negative for the virus. Spanish regions are in charge of their own healthcare systems, including Covid-19 measures and vaccinations. Overall in Spain, 79% of the population is now fully vaccinated. The daily case rate is rising at the moment with latest 14-day figures showing 88.6 cases per 100,000 people. As we've been reporting, there has been some fierce debate in the German lower house of parliament over proposed new measures to curb the current spike in the country's cases. Here are some excerpts that give a flavour of what was said in the chamber.  More people will get infected and become ill, many of them seriously. That worries me deeply and I will say clearly: we are in an emergency situation, especially the hospitals and we must react now, resolutely and together, the government, the German states and communities. This is what today's parliamentary debate is about, as is customary in a democracy."" Katrin Goering-Eckardt, Green Party parliamentary chairwoman Today's debate is not about the conservatives or the [incoming] SPD, FDP and Greens government, it's about protecting our country and in order to do so, we are putting the right measures in place, ladies and gentlemen.""

third-lowest rate, with 45% of the population inoculated. Spanish beach resort Benidorm has opened a Covid vaccination centre specifically for tourists to combat rising case numbers in the area. The clinic is located near the hotel district and was drawing queues of
tourists this week, while further mobile vaccination points will be
set up by Valencian health authorities in areas where big crowds gather, Reuters is reporting. Mayor
Antonio Perez tells the news agency they are extending a public service to tourists  and it ""sends a message of safety"" to people. Spain requires all visitors entering the country to present
either a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR test, but bars
and restaurants do not require vaccine passports. New figures have been released showing that 92.5% of staff in care homes for older adults in England have now had two doses of a Covid vaccine, as of 14 November. It means 7.5% of staff - 34,291 people - have not been fully vaccinated. They're the first figures to be released by NHS England since the 11 November deadline set by the government for all staff working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home to be vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. The NHS figures also show 21.7% of social care staff working in independent Care Quality Commission-registered younger adult care homes and domiciliary care providers were not fully jabbed as of 14 November - that's an estimated 108,510 people. Our reporters spoke to care workers when the deadline passed last week -read more on what they had to say here. The US has bought
10 million treatment courses of a Covid-19
antiviral drug,US President Joe Biden said on Thursday,external. The contract with pharmaceutical giantPfizer for its Paxlovid treatmentwill cost the US government $5.29bn (Â£3.93bn at today's exchange rate), the Reuters news agency reports. Biden says the delivery of the pills would start by the end of 2021, if it is authorised by US  regulators. In a statement, the president said his administration was making
preparations to ensure the pills would be easily accessible and
free. ""This is positive news,"" he says. ""This treatment could prove to be another critical tool in our arsenal that will accelerate our path out of the pandemic."" But, he adds, vaccines remain ""our strongest tool"". The Netherlands has reported its highest number of daily Covid infections, exceeding new 20,000 cases for the third day in a row, Reuters news agency reports. About 23,600 people tested positive for the virus, the country's
national health institute says - up from just under 21,000 a day
before. The country has already brought in a partial lockdown. Back now to the situation in Germany. As we've been reporting today the number of Covid cases in the country has hit a record high. But where are cases worst? Saxony is the German region that has currently been hardest hit by the fourth wave of coronavirus. The state - in the east of the country, which has Dresden as its capital - has the highest infection rate as well as the lowest vaccination rate. Because of its status, it's considering measures like closing concerts, theatres and football games to the public and closing bars and nightclubs, Bild newspaper says. Daily infections there have risen 14 times in the past month, Reuters has reported. Infection rates are also high in Bavaria, in the south-east, and more measures are being considered there. The UK administered 384,421 doses of a booster vaccine on Wednesday, according to the latest UK government figures. Overall nearly 13.9m people have had a third dose of a Covid jab - about 24% of the population over 12 years old. More than 50.6m people - or 88.1% of the UK population over 12 - have had one jab and more than 46m people - or 80.1% of people aged 12 and over - have had two vaccine doses. The UK has reported 46,807 coronavirus cases in the last 24-hour period. There were also 199 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. The UK government has named 50 companies given fast-track ""VIP"" contracts to supply protective equipment to the NHS. Eighteen of them were nominated by Conservative politicians, Department of Health and Social Care data shows - with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and former health secretary Matt Hancock involved. VIP contracts were introduced as the NHS struggled for masks, gloves, gowns and other safety equipment after the outbreak of coronavirus. The government directly awarded contracts worth billions of pounds to companies offering to supply the equipment. Contracts would usually be opened to competing bids. The information on the firms,externalchosen for VIP contracts follows a freedom-of-information request by the Good Law Project campaign group. The government said that ""to save lives, we focused our efforts, resources and attention on sourcing PPE"", adding it stood by efforts made to protect staff. Read more here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Covid case
rates are now highest among children aged five to nine, latest weekly
surveillance figures for England reveal. The report from
the UK Health Security Agency, up to 14 November, shows this younger age group
has overtaken older, secondary school aged children for the first time. In recent
months, the 10-19 age group maintained the highest rate of infections per
100,000 tested. It is too soon
to say what is behind the change and whether it will continue. In recent weeks
children aged 12 and over have started being offered Covid jabs. The data also
shows confirmed Covid infections are lowest among the eldest in society - those
aged 80 plus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The widow of a top official dealing with Scotland's pandemic response, who died after contracting Covid, believes the full details of his illness were concealed to protect a troubled hospital's reputation. Andrew Slorance went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago, where his wife Louise believes he caught the virus - as well as another life-threatening infection. He was the Scottish government's head of response and communication unit, in charge of its handling of the Covid pandemic. His widow tells the BBC she believes officials wanted to protect the hospital, which is already the subject of a public inquiry, as well as its reputation, ""no matter what the cost"". The hospital's health board says it had been ""open and honest"" and there had been no attempt to conceal any information from the family. You can read more on what happenedhere. There have been some changes this week in the UK about who can get their booster jabs - and about teenagers' vaccinations. So what is the new guidance? Here's a recap. All over-40s in the UK can now have a booster jab, as long as it's been six months after their second vaccine. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed. Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according toUK Health Security Agency data,external. You can now get a third dose if you're in one of these categories:  Those aged 16 and 17 can now have a second vaccine, 12 weeks after their first jab. And pregnant women are being urged to take up their offer of a vaccine, as they can be particularly at risk. The changes follow new recommendations from the government's advisers, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. All the details arehere. This video can not be played Covid in Wales: Maternity visiting rules unfair, says mum Visitors should be allowed into maternity units in Wales without restrictions, a charity says. Since the pandemic started, some units have stopped all visiting while others have limited times parents can spend with newborns. The rules currently vary between health boards, with some of them including banning visits entirely, other limiting visits to a few hours and some only allowing designated partners in within certain times of the day. But with restrictions on movement and social distancing eased across the country, Birthrights wants hospital maternity units to also open up. The Welsh government says maternity services keep their rules under review and there was a ""delicate balance"" between protecting vulnerable individuals and allowing visiting. Read morehere. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin The debate in Germanyâs parliament today was emotional, with
plenty of finger-pointing for the sharp rise in infections. The mood in the
country is equally fractious, with commentators asking why politicians didnât
use the lull in infections during the summer, to prepare the booster campaign
and plan for a predictably tough winter. Some hospitals say they are at full capacity, and worry they will
be overwhelmed when the current high rates translate into more
hospitalisations. These
stark warnings mean that, in polls, most Germans support tougher measures. Until
now, excluding unvaccinated people from some activities has not sparked
widespread protest. In one survey, a majority supports allowing only vaccinated
people to access leisure services, such as restaurants. These measures have
been easy to implement. Customers have quickly become used to showing waiters
proof of vaccine before ordering food. The newer measures decided on Thursday might be more difficult to
implement. Transport trade unions say their members shouldnât have to police
the vaccine status of passengers because of potential aggression. And some
employers question how they can organise daily tests for workers. But
if the choice is between more deaths or making life more difficult for
unvaccinated people, the consensus in Germany is more restrictions for people
who donât want the jab. Germany is facing its highest case numbers since the coronavirus pandemic began. We've been looking at the pattern of how case numbers have been going up and down. There was a small peak early in the pandemic, if you look at the seven-day averages, but the first big wave peaked at the end of December. There was another surge - although not as big as the one at the end of 2020 - at the end of April before a decrease. There was a rise again to a new peak in September which plateaued for a while before rapidly climbing again to the new highs we see now. There's information on theJohns Hopkins world coronavirus map,externalas well, which breaks down the figures if you're keen for more detail. The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning there is a ""hard winter ahead"" for Europe. Asked by the BBC if it was concerned vaccines did not appear to be preventing a surge in cases, its regional director for Europe Hans Kluge says: ""Of course vaccines have been a game-changer. ""But far too many remain unvaccinated, so we have pockets in which the virus continues to spread and cause strain on local and national health systems."" He was speaking amid a surge in European countries, as we've been reporting on here today. This public health emergency is far from being over, and the current rise of cases in most countries in the region, caused by the combination of insufficient vaccination coverage, the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant, shows that a hard winter is ahead of us."" Dr Hans Kluge, WHO We were telling you earlier about Covid passes in Wales and Scotland - another country considering extending their use is Spain. The Basque Country wants to make it mandatory for people visiting bars, clubs or restaurants to show a vaccination certificate, reports Spanish newspaper El Pais. It would show whether they have been fully vaccinated, at least 14 days previously, if they have had Covid over the previous six months, or tested negative for the virus. Spanish regions are in charge of their own healthcare systems, including Covid-19 measures and vaccinations. Overall in Spain, 79% of the population is now fully vaccinated. The daily case rate is rising at the moment with latest 14-day figures showing 88.6 cases per 100,000 people. As we've been reporting, there has been some fierce debate in the German lower house of parliament over proposed new measures to curb the current spike in the country's cases. Here are some excerpts that give a flavour of what was said in the chamber.  More people will get infected and become ill, many of them seriously. That worries me deeply and I will say clearly: we are in an emergency situation, especially the hospitals and we must react now, resolutely and together, the government, the German states and communities. This is what today's parliamentary debate is about, as is customary in a democracy."" Katrin Goering-Eckardt, Green Party parliamentary chairwoman Today's debate is not about the conservatives or the [incoming] SPD, FDP and Greens government, it's about protecting our country and in order to do so, we are putting the right measures in place, ladies and gentlemen."" Marco Buschmann, Senior FDP lawmaker If you decide to go down that road with the majority you have here, against our and my proposals, please don't use someone else as a scapegoat every time or as a punching ball. If you want to represent the new majority here, you have to take on the responsibility. No-one can relieve you of that duty."" Jens Spahn, Outgoing Health Minister Â© 2025 BBC.

"More than 500 excess deaths may have occurred in Northern Ireland's emergency departments between 2020 and 2021 due to crowding, a report has said. The findings are from a Royal College of Emergency Medicine report. Excess deaths are a measure of how many more people died than would be expected based on figures from previous years. The Department of Health said it would study the report carefully, adding patient safety was its priority. The UK-wide report, which looked at the harm crowding has on patients, calculated the Northern Ireland figure using a mathematical model. Emergency department overcrowding has made headlines recentlyas UK hospitals struggle to cope with rising numbers. The report, which also examined the impact of prolonged waits, said that crowding has always been ""unconscionable"". It said the figures for across the UK ""lay bare the reality that lives are being lost to an issue that could be eradicated for good"". It calculated that as many as 566 excess deaths could have occurred in Northern Ireland between 2020 and 2021. While they cannot confirm at this stage the actual number, the report also suggested that, in time and with further research, the figure could prove to be higher. 2020 saw a huge and unexpected rise in deaths because of the pandemic. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Northern Ireland, Dr Paul Kerr, told BBC News NI that the findings should be ""treated with caution"". ""These figures are concerning,"" he said. ""However the calculation of the extra deaths associated with prolonged waits in emergency departments is complex and the methodology used in NHS England may not be directly applicable to Northern Ireland,"" he added. ""We hope this early work will lead to further work specifically for local hospitals, which we have been recommending for some time, to give a better insight into the harm caused by crowding and long waits for admission,"" he said. In a statement, the Department of Health said emergency departments continue to face ""sustained and severe pressures"". It said it had taken a range of actions to support them, including financial supports. ""The HSCB (Health and Social Care Board) is also working collaboratively with the Public Health Agency, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and the five provider Trusts to improve waiting times at our emergency departments, enhance flows through the system and facilitate timely discharge,"" the department said. The report, which specifically examines hospitals in England, calls on the government to restore bed capacity to what it was pre-pandemic. Hospital overcrowding caused deaths, say doctors Why the NHS is struggling like never before Ambulances diverted due to hospital pressures It said workforce planning is also essential, which must include actions to retain existing staff who are reaching burnout as well as efforts to recruit new staff. By applying mortality data and figures for those who waited between eight to 12 hours in an emergency department, the report estimated 303 excess deaths in Scotland, 709 in Wales and 4,519 in England. The report also said that what these figures do not show is the harm that may come to those waiting even longer than 12 hours.

"UK employers should stop asking jobseekers about their previous salaries, a campaign group is urging. The Fawcett Society says asking about previous pay when recruiting contributes to the gender pay gap, by keeping women on lower wages. Its survey of 2,200 working adults found that 47% of people had been asked about past salaries. Meanwhile, 61% of women said the question had an impact on their confidence to negotiate better pay. The Fawcett Society's chief executive Jemima Olchawski told the BBC that unless more is done, the gender pay gap will not be closed until at least 2050. ""We're calling on employers to make a simple change and stop asking potential employees about salary history,"" she said. ""Evidence shows that this will help to stamp out pay inequality, not only for women but for people of colour, and people with disabilities."" Workers call the shots as job vacancies boom Where are all the job vacancies? Firms step up graduate pay amid fierce competition The campaign group warned that asking prospective candidates about their salary history meant companies could end up replicating gender pay gaps from other organisations. The survey also found that 58% of women and 54% of men felt salary history questions meant they were offered a lower wage than they might otherwise have been paid. Only a quarter of people feel that pay should be based on past salaries, compared to 80% of respondents, who felt that their pay should be based on their skill and responsibilities. The campaign group also found that 77% of people felt their salaries should reflect the value of the work they do. The report added that the pace of change to close the gender pay gap was ""glacial"". The Fawcett Society stressed that more needed to be done by the government and employers to tackle its causes, such as stamping out discrimination. Peter Cheese, head of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), agrees that setting pay grades based on what people were paid in previous jobs can ""exacerbate the problem"". But he believed questions about previous salaries were legitimate. ""I'm not convinced that employers should never ask about previous pay because it's not an unnatural question to ask,"" he told the BBC. ""Indeed, prospective employees will tend to raise their expectations about pay and that's a perfectly natural question in the recruitment process."" He said that the issue was becoming prominent now because the UK was in a tight labour market with ""upwards pressure"" on pay. ""We need to be honest about that - if we think we can get away with paying the absolute minimum, we might be disappointed about our ability to recruit,"" Mr Cheese added. ""What we want is to encourage employers to be transparent about how they pay; the basis under which they pay and how that reflects things like market dynamics; and that they communicate that to their own organisation, as well as to external recruits.""

"This video can not be played Michelle says: ""People think it's poor parenting... they don't really understand."" A couple are spending hours hunting for a specific type of Walkers crisp amid a national shortage as it is one of the only things their daughter will eat. Due to an eating disorder, Walkers oven baked sea salt-flavour crisps form a major part of the diet of four-year-old Ava, from Narborough, Leicestershire. But her mother Michelle says she is struggling to find any. Walkers said it was working to resolve the supply problems and apologised for the inconvenience. The disruption, which started last month, is due to a glitch caused by an IT upgrade. Michelle said she tried to shop for the packets online, but even stores advertising the product as in stock told her they had run out Ava has a number of conditions, including avoidant or restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and a condition that affects her development. According to her mother, she only eats these crisps, toastie waffles and a specific kind of baby fruit puree. She only drinks sweetened almond milk and a prescription vitamin mix. Michelle said Ava would rather go on a drip than eat something she does not like. They have been struggling to get hold of the crisps for almost a month. At one point Ava, who usually eats two packets a day, was without the crisps for five days and became lethargic and withdrawn. ""When your child relies on a food, and you can't get it, it's really hard,"" Michelle said. ""[Me and my husband] go looking round the shops for the crisps every day for an hour or two. ""We have a big extended family and everyone is looking out for them too. ""There's not a huge nutritional value in the crisps but the salt helps. It makes her drink more. ""[If she doesn't have them] it makes her really sleep, she lays around and doesn't have enough energy."" ""Our big fear is having to go to hospital and if we cannot find these crisps, that's 100% a possibility,"" she added. ""It makes me very, very anxious. What seems like such a simple thing is huge for her."" She added many children with disorders that limit their eating tend to favour crisps, and she was aware of many families through social media who were also struggling. There have been reports of empty shelves in some shops across the country On Thursday, Michelle told the BBC News Channel the family had received messages online from people around the country offering to supply them with crisps. She added: ""There is a lot of people that experience this at all ages, but there has been a lot of judgement and a lot of very, very negative comments. ""This is a registered eating disorder and a lot of people don't really understand learning disabilities, autism, sensory eating or ARFID so there are misconceptions about what it is."" Supply disruption is set to continue for a few more weeks Nicole Kirkland, co-founder of charity ARFID Awareness UK, said many often looked down on the condition and those dealing with it. She said: ""It often deals with complex carbohydrates and processed foods, just by the very nature that they are consistent, so you end up with crisps, white bread, cereal or fast food fries, so it can come across as lazy parenting. ""It really opens itself up to judgement but this is not just a kid that is a fussy eater. ""The mum is doing the best she can and unfortunately there is very little in the way of help and support for people out there."" Walkers has said supply issues are expected to continue for several more weeks. The Leicester-based firm is prioritising its more popular crisp flavours, such as cheese and onion and salt and vinegar. A spokeswoman said: ""We're doing everything we can to increase production and get people's favourites back on shelves. ""We're very sorry for the inconvenience caused.""

"The calf was found by villagers in the town of Aceh Jaya A baby Sumatran elephant has died after losing half its trunk to a trap set by poachers in Indonesia. The critically endangered one-year-old calf was left behind by its herd after being caught in the snare trap. It  was found by villagers in the town of Aceh Jaya and was brought to a conservation agency to be treated. Conservation officials say they tried to save its life by amputating its trunk, but it succumbed to an infection from its injuries two days later. ""We couldn't save it because the injury was severe and infected,"" Agus Arianto, head of the Aceh Natural Resources Conservation Agency said. ""We did our best to help it."" The calf's death is the most recent in a string of poaching-related deaths The Sumatran elephant is considered a critically endangered species due to rapid rates of deforestation in its natural habitat of Borneo and Sumatra. Male elephants are especially vulnerable to poachers because of their highly-prized tusks, which are sold on the illegal ivory market. The calf's death is the most recent in a string of poaching-related deaths. The latest incident was in July this year, where an adult elephant was found decapitated with its tusks ripped off.

"A rail improvement programme will help transform services in the Midlands and northern England, the government has said ahead of the expected scrapping of part of the HS2 scheme. Local service upgrades, bringing faster journeys, will happen up to 10 years earlier than planned, ministers say. The plan will cost Â£96bn, but only half of that is thought to be new money. It comes as businesses reacted angrily to reports the East Midlands-Leeds HS2 high-speed line would not be built. However, campaigners against the HS2 have said they are ""elated"" by the reports. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will unveil the plans this morning. Speaking to the BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab denied that the government was rowing back on promises to ""level up"" the country with HS2. He called the new plan ""good for the whole country"", adding: ""We are entirely delivering on the aspiration and ambition of the levelling up agenda."" The Department for Transport (DfT) says its Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) will improve journey times and capacity ""from London and across the Pennines"" and ""strengthen connections between major cities in the North and Midlands"". What is HS2 and where will it go? Scaling back North rail plans is 'ludicrous' City has the UK's worst rail connections Scrapping HS2 extension 'undermines' levelling up HS2 was originally meant to connect London with the city centres of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. But sources have told the BBC that the eastern leg to Leeds is set to be scrapped. Writing in the Yorkshire Post,,externalMr Johnson appears to confirm reports that a shorter high-speed route will be created from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway, with the HS2 trains then running up as far as Sheffield on mainline tracks. A proposed HS2 train, which could be running from London to Birmingham by the end of the decade In his article Mr Johnson wrote: ""HS2 will come to Sheffield, meaning a trip to or from London will take just one hour 27 minutes - precisely the same as under the old HS2 plans. ""We'll look at how to get HS2 to Leeds too, with a new study on the best way to make it happen. ""But high-speed rail is grindingly slow to build. Under the original blueprint, first drawn up more than a decade ago, Yorkshire would have not have seen the benefits of our investment until at least the 2040s. Levelling up can't wait that long."" The government is also expected to put money aside to explore setting up a tram service for Leeds and spend Â£360m on contactless ticketing across commuter rail networks. The IRP was initiated after the 2020 Oakervee Review into major transport schemes including HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). But the prime minister has come under pressure recently over claims the government intends to ""water down"" planned rail upgrades. There has been outcry from some politicians and businesses in the north of England at reports that there will not be an entire new fast line between Leeds and Manchester, via Bradford. The improvements to the NPR east-west connections are likely to involve upgrades to existing infrastructure. Tracy Brabin, Labour Mayor for West Yorkshire, told the BBC: ""If what we're hearing is true, it's a betrayal of the North and a betrayal of the people I represent. ""It's going to affect our potential and investment and opportunity, and it's just not good enough."" Many towns and villages along the route, such as Crofton in Yorkshire, have opposed the line However, earlier this week, Sandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 campaign group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was ""absolutely elated"", saying the proposed route would have brought ""untold devastation"" and ""heartbreak"" to communities along the line. Nick Garthwaite, director of chemical manufacturer Christeyns Ltd in Bradford and vice chair of the West & North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, says he is disappointed by the reports that a new line between Manchester and Leeds may not be built. ""I feel the city and its people have been betrayed - we might not get the through railway station that Bradford so desperately needs and indeed was tacitly promised by government over a long period of time,"" he told the BBC. A key concern for businesses in Bradford is trying to attract more talent to come to work there, so not having good transport links is a problem.

"A rail improvement programme will help transform services in the Midlands and northern England, the government has said ahead of the expected scrapping of part of the HS2 scheme. Local service upgrades, bringing faster journeys, will happen up to 10 years earlier than planned, ministers say. The plan will cost Â£96bn, but only half of that is thought to be new money. It comes as businesses reacted angrily to reports the East Midlands-Leeds HS2 high-speed line would not be built. However, campaigners against the HS2 have said they are ""elated"" by the reports. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will unveil the plans this morning. Speaking to the BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab denied that the government was rowing back on promises to ""level up"" the country with HS2. He called the new plan ""good for the whole country"", adding: ""We are entirely delivering on the aspiration and ambition of the levelling up agenda."" The Department for Transport (DfT) says its Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) will improve journey times and capacity ""from London and across the Pennines"" and ""strengthen connections between major cities in the North and Midlands"". What is HS2 and where will it go? Scaling back North rail plans is 'ludicrous' City has the UK's worst rail connections Scrapping HS2 extension 'undermines' levelling up HS2 was originally meant to connect London with the city centres of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. But sources have told the BBC that the eastern leg to Leeds is set to be scrapped. Writing in the Yorkshire Post,,externalMr Johnson appears to confirm reports that a shorter high-speed route will be created from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway, with the HS2 trains then running up as far as Sheffield on mainline tracks. A proposed HS2 train, which could be running from London to Birmingham by the end of the decade In his article Mr Johnson wrote: ""HS2 will come to Sheffield, meaning a trip to or from London will take just one hour 27 minutes - precisely the same as under the old HS2 plans. ""We'll look at how to get HS2 to Leeds too, with a new study on the best way to make it happen. ""But high-speed rail is grindingly slow to build. Under the original blueprint, first drawn up more than a decade ago, Yorkshire would have not have seen the benefits of our investment until at least the 2040s. Levelling up can't wait that long."" The government is also expected to put money aside to explore setting up a tram service for Leeds and spend Â£360m on contactless ticketing across commuter rail networks. The IRP was initiated after the 2020 Oakervee Review into major transport schemes including HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). But the prime minister has come under pressure recently over claims the government intends to ""water down"" planned rail upgrades. There has been outcry from some politicians and businesses in the north of England at reports that there will not be an entire new fast line between Leeds and Manchester, via Bradford. The improvements to the NPR east-west connections are likely to involve upgrades to existing infrastructure. Tracy Brabin, Labour Mayor for West Yorkshire, told the BBC: ""If what we're hearing is true, it's a betrayal of the North and a betrayal of the people I represent. ""It's going to affect our potential and investment and opportunity, and it's just not good enough."" Many towns and villages along the route, such as Crofton in Yorkshire, have opposed the line However, earlier this week, Sandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 campaign group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was ""absolutely elated"", saying the proposed route would have brought ""untold devastation"" and ""heartbreak"" to communities along the line. Nick Garthwaite, director of chemical manufacturer Christeyns Ltd in Bradford and vice chair of the West & North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, says he is disappointed by the reports that a new line between Manchester and Leeds may not be built. ""I feel the city and its people have been betrayed - we might not get the through railway station that Bradford so desperately needs and indeed was tacitly promised by government over a long period of time,"" he told the BBC. A key concern for businesses in Bradford is trying to attract more talent to come to work there, so not having good transport links is a problem. ""What I'm worried about is that these young talented people in Bradford will be thinking twice about staying in the city,"" he said. Mr Garthwaite said it was likely that businesses would also consider locating new factories in other parts of England. His concerns seem to be shared by others.

"This video can not be played Watch: The cab pulled up outside Liverpool Women's Hospital and exploded into flames A man who was killed outside Liverpool Women's Hospital on Remembrance Sunday when his homemade bomb went off has been identified as 32-year-old Emad Al Swealmeen. He was an asylum seeker born in Iraq who is understood to have converted to Christianity in 2017. Al Swealmeen was the passenger of the taxi destroyed in the blast. The driver, David Perry, did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Four men were arrested under the Terrorism Act, but have since been released from police custody without charge. Merseyside Police were called at 10:59 GMT on 14 November to reports of a car explosion at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The taxi carrying Al Swealmeen had pulled up to the hospital and exploded shortly afterwards. Al Swealmeen, who had been picked up from the Rutland Avenue area and asked to be taken to the hospital about 10 minutes away, died at the scene. This video can not be played Watch: Police say passenger brought explosive device into taxi On Monday Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said the passenger appeared to have made an improvised device that caused the explosion. He said officers investigating the incident could not ""at this time draw any connection"" with Remembrance Sunday events taking place near the hospital but he confirmed this was ""a line of inquiry"". Taxi driver David Perry has been discharged from hospital and his wife Rachel said it had been ""an utter miracle"" that he had escaped from the vehicle. Mr Jackson said he could not confirm reports Mr Perry had locked the doors of the taxi before the explosion. He said it appeared to have been an ""unremarkable journey"" to the hospital. Taxi driver David Perry has been discharged from hospital Pictures of a burning car outside the hospital have been widely shared on social media About two hours after the blast, properties on Rutland Avenue near Sefton Park, in the south-east of the city, and in the Kensington area, east of the city centre, were raided by armed officers. Three arrests took place in Sutcliffe Street, in Kensington, where witnesses reported seeing armed officers approach a terraced house. The second raid around Sutcliffe Street and the adjacent Boaler Street - about a mile from the hospital -  took place an hour later, at about 14:00 GMT. There was a heavy police presence, including police negotiators, outside the house on Rutland Avenue overnight. Police confirmed a controlled explosion had been carried out as a precaution in the Sefton Park area at about 16:00 GMT as part of the investigation but there was no wider risk to the public. Mr Jackson said officers had made ""significant progress"" and had a ""much greater understanding of the component parts of the device, how they were obtained and how the parts are likely to have been assembled"". He said following interviews with the arrested men, police were ""satisfied with the accounts they have provided"" and they were released from custody. Specialist officers were seen on Rutland Avenue The wreckage of the taxi was removed on Wednesday and specialist officers were expected to continue searches at the hospital into Thursday, said Mr Jackson. A post mortem on Al Swealmeen found the cause of death to be ""injuries sustained from the fire and explosion"", he said. Police have traced his next of kin who told them he was born in Iraq. ""Our inquiries have found that Al Swealmeen has had episodes of mental illness, this will form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand,"" said Mr Jackson. He said they had not found any link to others in the Merseyside area but could not yet rule it out. Nick Aldworth, a former counter terror co-ordinator, said investigators would be focused on what happened inside the vehicle. ""I have to say from what I've seen there is very little blast damage - a lot of fire damage but very little blast damage. So whatever was in that vehicle was either a low yield or didn't work properly or was possibly an incendiary."" Emad Al Swealmeen during a service at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, alongside Bishop Cyril Ashton Al Swealmeenbegan making purchases for his attack in April, counter-terror police said. Mr Jackson said the bomber had lived at a property in Sutcliffe Street for some time. And he began renting a property in Rutland Avenue in April. Police recovered ""significant items"" from his latest address, where searches have been taking place since Sunday. Al Swealmeen is not believed to have been known to MI5, according to BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera. One of the members of his tribe in Jordan told the BBC that Al Swealmeen was Jordanian, but born in Iraq. His family settled in the United Arab Emirates in 1996. Al Swealmeen left for Syria 12 years ago, then headed to Turkey, eventually applying for asylum by claiming he was Syrian. The tribe member - who knows Al Swealmeen's father - said the attacker had a history of mental illness. Immigration records seen by the BBC show Al Swealmeen was first refused asylum in the UK in 2014. He challenged the decision, but in April 2015 a judge ruled the Home Office had been correct. In June 2015 he launched an attempt to overturn that decision, but that application was refused in August 2015 by the Upper Tier Tribunal - the court dedicated to immigration appeals. At that stage the case appears to have been closed - and by 2017 friends of Al Swealmeen in Liverpool understood his legal avenues had been exhausted. Whether the Home Office ordered him to leave the UK is not clear. During this period he turned to Christianity and became known locally as Enzo Almeni, a name he adopted as part of his conversion. Court records show that he then renewed his immigration appeal - under this alternative name - in January this year. His submissions were under review at the time of his death. A Christian couple,Elizabeth and Malcolm Hitchcott told ITV News that Al Swealmeen briefly lived with them,externalat their Liverpool home after his conversion to Christianity. Mr Hitchcott described him as a ""very quiet fellow"" who formally converted from Islam at a ceremony in Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral. Al Swealmeen is believed to have been baptised in 2015 and confirmed in 2017 - before the cathedral lost contact with him in 2018, according to the Diocese of Liverpool's communication's director, Stuart Haynes. The Reverend Mike Hindley said Al Swealmeen was involved in the Emmanuel Church in the Fazakerley area of Liverpool from 2017 to 2019, when they lost touch with him. A spokesman for the City of Liverpool College said Al Swealmeen was an adult cake decorating student at the college during the 2018-2019 academic year. In the years before the attack, Al Swealmeen was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for about six months because of his behaviour with a knife, Mr Hitchcott said. Al Swealmeen was described as a ""lovely guy"" by Mrs Hitchcott, who told the BBC ""we just loved him"", adding she was saddened and ""very shocked"" by Sunday's incident.

"A rail improvement programme will help transform services in the Midlands and northern England, the government has said ahead of the expected scrapping of part of the HS2 scheme. Local service upgrades, bringing faster journeys, will happen up to 10 years earlier than planned, ministers say. The plan will cost Â£96bn, but only half of that is thought to be new money. It comes as businesses reacted angrily to reports the East Midlands-Leeds HS2 high-speed line would not be built. However, campaigners against the HS2 have said they are ""elated"" by the reports. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will unveil the plans this morning. Speaking to the BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab denied that the government was rowing back on promises to ""level up"" the country with HS2. He called the new plan ""good for the whole country"", adding: ""We are entirely delivering on the aspiration and ambition of the levelling up agenda."" The Department for Transport (DfT) says its Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) will improve journey times and capacity ""from London and across the Pennines"" and ""strengthen connections between major cities in the North and Midlands"". What is HS2 and where will it go? Scaling back North rail plans is 'ludicrous' City has the UK's worst rail connections Scrapping HS2 extension 'undermines' levelling up HS2 was originally meant to connect London with the city centres of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. But sources have told the BBC that the eastern leg to Leeds is set to be scrapped. Writing in the Yorkshire Post,,externalMr Johnson appears to confirm reports that a shorter high-speed route will be created from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway, with the HS2 trains then running up as far as Sheffield on mainline tracks. A proposed HS2 train, which could be running from London to Birmingham by the end of the decade In his article Mr Johnson wrote: ""HS2 will come to Sheffield, meaning a trip to or from London will take just one hour 27 minutes - precisely the same as under the old HS2 plans. ""We'll look at how to get HS2 to Leeds too, with a new study on the best way to make it happen. ""But high-speed rail is grindingly slow to build. Under the original blueprint, first drawn up more than a decade ago, Yorkshire would have not have seen the benefits of our investment until at least the 2040s. Levelling up can't wait that long."" The government is also expected to put money aside to explore setting up a tram service for Leeds and spend Â£360m on contactless ticketing across commuter rail networks. The IRP was initiated after the 2020 Oakervee Review into major transport schemes including HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). But the prime minister has come under pressure recently over claims the government intends to ""water down"" planned rail upgrades. There has been outcry from some politicians and businesses in the north of England at reports that there will not be an entire new fast line between Leeds and Manchester, via Bradford. The improvements to the NPR east-west connections are likely to involve upgrades to existing infrastructure. Tracy Brabin, Labour Mayor for West Yorkshire, told the BBC: ""If what we're hearing is true, it's a betrayal of the North and a betrayal of the people I represent. ""It's going to affect our potential and investment and opportunity, and it's just not good enough."" Many towns and villages along the route, such as Crofton in Yorkshire, have opposed the line However, earlier this week, Sandra Haith, from an anti-HS2 campaign group in Bramley, Rotherham, said she was ""absolutely elated"", saying the proposed route would have brought ""untold devastation"" and ""heartbreak"" to communities along the line. Nick Garthwaite, director of chemical manufacturer Christeyns Ltd in Bradford and vice chair of the West & North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce, says he is disappointed by the reports that a new line between Manchester and Leeds may not be built. ""I feel the city and its people have been betrayed - we might not get the through railway station that Bradford so desperately needs and indeed was tacitly promised by government over a long period of time,"" he told the BBC. A key concern for businesses in Bradford is trying to attract more talent to come to work there, so not having good transport links is a problem. ""What I'm worried about is that these young talented people in Bradford will be thinking twice about staying in the city,"" he said. Mr Garthwaite said it was likely that businesses would also consider locating new factories in other parts of England. His concerns seem to be shared by others. A student told the BBC that many young people were now moving away from Bradford and Leeds to live in cities like Nottingham and Manchester, because the transport links were so poor. ""I'm definitely not going to be staying in Leeds or Bradford because it's not reliable enough,"" she said. Speaking to the PA news agency on Tuesday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""[People in the North] should definitely feel optimistic. ""Not only are we going to spend a huge amount of money doing this, we are going to deliver it decades before it would have otherwise happened."" Mr Shapps added that if he had been transport secretary 15 years ago with responsibility for HS2, then ""I would have started in the North and moved south, I think that would have made sense"". He went on: ""The Northern Powerhouse Rail, the Midlands Connect - all of those did not exist when HS2 was first mooted, but we are where we are and it's being built and we need to make sure we connect it all up and that's what the Integrated Rail Plan intends to achieve."" However, Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I think we've got a real risk of disappointment across the North. ""The budget that's been promised, Â£96bn, is about Â£30bn less than the previous plans and what we were being offered. That means real cuts on the eastern leg, real cuts to the new line across the Pennines through Bradford."" He said it was now vital to ensure better connectivity between Leeds and Sheffield, as the North was ""going to lose on that connectivity to the West Midlands and London"". Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, accused the government of using ""smoke and mirrors"" while breaking its promises. ""HS2 was meant to be a world-beater... instead, the Tories are letting us down,"" he said. ""This government is a government of broken promises. It has announced Northern Powerhouse Rail an incredible 60 times - and I know because we've counted - and now it puts the project in the bin."" Do you live or work in Nottingham, Bradford or Leeds?
