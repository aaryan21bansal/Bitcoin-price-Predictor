"Ministers are ""working on"" plans for quarantine-free travel from amber list countries for people who are fully vaccinated, Matt Hancock has said. He said the plans for England had not been ""clinically advised yet"". But the health secretary said the government was looking at plans to allow the vaccine to ""bring back"" some freedoms. Currently travellers arriving from countries on the red or amber travel lists have to isolate for 10 days. What are the rules for travel? Is it possible to visit France, Spain or other destinations? How can I prove I've had both my Covid jabs? Asked on Sky News if the measure could be in place as soon as August, Mr Hancock said: ""We'll get there when it's safe to do so."" International Trade Secretary Liz Truss told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine she would not speculate about what was going to happen in terms of travel, but said the government was looking at what it could do to ""ease up requirements where it makes sense"". She said: ""We're not ready to make an announcement yet, but fundamentally what we need to do is - while keeping people safe - making sure we're freeing up the rules as much as we can."" Responding to Mr Hancock's comments, Green MP Caroline Lucas, vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said scrapping quarantine measures would be ""reckless"" and called for the government to focus on upgrading systems at airports. ""The Delta variant first arrived here in the UK precisely because of inadequate pre-travel requirements and health checks at UK arrival halls, compounded by a lack of support and enforcement of mandatory quarantine,"" she said. Long queues were reported at the UK border at London's Heathrow airport on Tuesday evening Under the current rules for England, arrivals from red list destinations such as India and South Africa must isolate in a government approved hotel for 10 days. Those coming from amber countries must quarantine for 10 days, with tests to be taken on days two and eight after return, but they do not need to be in a hotel. It may be possible to end quarantine early in England by paying for an additional test under thetest-to-release,externalscheme. The vast majority of countries are on the amber list. Arrivals from the few green list countries - which includes a small number of countries including Israel and Iceland - do not have to quarantine but must book a test for day two of their return. Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalare following similar rules. This video can not be played Five ways to self-isolate successfully to prevent the spread of coronavirus Andrew Flintham, from travel firm Tui, said it had become an interested party in the legal action taken against the government by Manchester Airports Group, alongside Ryanair, British Airways' parent company IAG and Virgin Atlantic about how the government manages and publishes the green travel list. ""At the time of the last country review, many destinations such as Malta, the Greek islands and the Balearics had much lower rates than the UK,"" he told a conference organised by the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta). ""It was inexplicable as to why these were not added and instead Portugal was moved straight from green to amber, without the slightest sign of stopping at the much-vaunted green watchlist."" Mark Tanzer, of Abta, urged ministers to ""put aside any misguided prejudices against outbound travel"". He added that the amount of state support given to travel firms is ""way behind"" the situation in other countries. On Monday, the prime minister said the government was considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UKif they took daily tests. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""cautiously hopeful"" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme, with the next ""checkpoint"" taking place on 28 June. The health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that England remained ""on track"" for the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions on 19 July, with case rates ""slowing"" and hospitalisations ""not rising quickly"". He said the number of people dying from Covid in England remained ""very, very low"" and said this showed the ""vaccine was working"". Mr Hancock also warned that the coming winter could be ""challenging"", but said that he hoped the government would not have to bring back restrictions. More than 43.1 million people (81.9% of the population) have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and nearly 31.5 million (59.8%) have had a second, according tothe government's coronavirus dashboard.,external The UK has reported a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test on Tuesday, and another 11,625 cases. The Office for National Statistics said infections were continuing to increase in England but the ""trend is uncertain"" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The number of hospital admissions for Covid has jumped by a third in the last week with the latest data showing four consecutive days of more than 200 admissions. A month ago we had three days of under 100 admissions so the change is very clear. But that just tells you part of the story. Ministers have spoken about vaccinations breaking the link between cases and hospitalisations. That has not happened, but it has certainly been weakened. During the winter wave around 10% of infections being diagnosed ended up in hospital 10 days later. Currently it looks to be around 3%. That is a significant difference. But it still means if infection rates keep climbing as they are we could see in excess of 1,000 admissions a day later in the summer. That is what the NHS would expect to see in the depths of a bad winter for all types of respiratory illness. The hope is that the ""wall of immunity"" built up by the vaccination programme will kick in before we reach that point and help reduce infection levels and then admissions.

"Last year, the culture secretary said Netflix's The Crown should carry a fiction warning Services like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ could face tighter regulation in the UK under government proposals. Traditional broadcasters like the BBC and ITV have to comply with regulator Ofcom's code covering issues like harm, offence, accuracy and impartiality. But most streaming platforms do not. The government has announced a review into whether to strengthen the rules. Meanwhile, ministers have also confirmed a consultation into whether to privatise Channel 4. The broadcaster is currently funded by adverts but is publicly-owned. The only streaming platform that must currently adhere to Ofcom's broadcasting code is the BBC iPlayer. The regulator can issue fines and suspend licences if the rules are broken. Separate rules regulating incitement to hatred and other ""harmful material"" apply to streaming services with head and editorial offices in the UK - which include Amazon Prime and Disney+, but not Netflix. Currently,the Ofcom website contains a statement,externalexplaining that ""Netflix is based in the Netherlands and therefore not within Ofcom's jurisdiction"". However, some services have introduced their own voluntary procedures - such as Netflix's age ratings partnership with the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). In Wednesday's announcement, the government said there was currently an ""inconsistent, ad-hoc and potentially harmful gap in regulation"". Netflix shows don't come under the same rules as broadcasters like the BBC and ITV Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the proposed regulation would prevent traditional broadcasters like the BBC from having to ""compete with one hand behind their backs"". Writing in The Times,external, Mr Dowden said UK broadcasters were ""holding their own"", but added: ""Our broadcasters can't do it alone and they certainly can't compete in a digital world while operating under analogue rules. ""This summer we will consult on whether it's time to set the same basic rules for video-on-demand services as we do for traditional broadcasters."" He added that the government hoped to ""level the playing field"". Last year,Netflix faced criticism from Mr Dowdenover scenes in its hit drama series The Crown which contained historical inaccuracies. According to Ofcom's latest figures, viewers watched subscription streaming services for one hour 11 minutes per day in April 2020 - double the previous year. In 2019, two in five viewers of streaming services told the Ofcom they could imagine watching no broadcast TV at all in five years' time. Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ have not commented on the government review, but a Netflix source said the company supported the intentions behind it. Changes to streaming regulation and Channel 4's ownership could both be included in a new media law that is expected to be unveiled in a white paper this autumn. On Tuesday, Channel 4 executives warned that privatisation could make it less likely to make shows that are not commercially appealing, whereas the current priority for its programmes is ""not about the bottom line"". Channel 4 warns of privatisation risks Chief executive Alex Mahon told a committee of MPs: ""We are always, in all the decisions we make, able to put public service before profit. ""When you run commercial businesses, by necessity, your priorities change. They have to. And therefore you have to make decisions differently. You have to think about shareholder returns."" Sir David Attenborough is among those supporting the Big Broadcasting Challenge campaign Sir David Attenborough is among those backing a campaign calling for ""an open and transparent debate"" on the future of public service broadcasting. The 95-year-old is a supporter of the British Broadcasting Challenge campaign, which last month called on the government ""to stop short-sighted political and financial attacks"" on broadcasters. Culture minister John Whittingdale, who previously rejected privatisation in 1996, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government ""want to make sure Channel 4 had a long-term successful future"". ""For that reason we think it's appropriate to look at the ownership model and see whether or not it wouldn't thrive better if it was able to access the kinds of investment capital which the others are able to put into high quality TV content,"" he said. Mr Whittingdale compared the network with Channel 5, which he said had enjoyed a higher audience share after it was bought by Viacom in 2014, with more money invested in programming. ""That is one of the benefits of having a financially secure owner,"" he said. ""Now, I'm not saying that is necessarily the best way forward [for Channel 4], but it is certainly something which we think the time is right to consider, in order to make sure that Channel 4 does have a secure future."" In Wednesday's announcement, the government also confirmed it would go ahead with new laws to ensure UK public service broadcasters have a prominent spot on smart TVs and other platforms and devices.

"Keira Bell said the gender identity clinic should have challenged her more The Court of Appeal is considering whether under-16s can give informed consent to medical treatment that delays the onset of puberty. The appeal is brought by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust. It says puberty blockers give children distressed by their birth sex time to consider ""options"". But a representative for Keira Bell, who brought the original case, says children cannot understand all of the treatment's implications. Judgement is reserved for a later date. The two-day appeal also includes submissions from LGBT and other interested groups. In December 2020, the High Court ruled that under-16s wereunlikely to be able to give informed consent to what it described as ""experimental"" treatment, which is sometimes used to pause puberty in children experiencing gender dysphoria. Keira Bell, one of the claimants in the case, started taking puberty blockers at the age of 16 after being referred to the Tavistock and Portman Trust, which runs the UK's only Gender Identity Development Service (Gids). Now in her mid-20s, saysshe regrets her decision to transition to a male, and says the clinic should have challenged her more. Speaking outside the Appeal Court on Wednesday morning, she said: ""I'm always hopeful, but the result could go any way."" The Tavistock has argued throughout that it provides safe treatment and puts the best interests of young people and their families first. What are puberty blockers? On Wednesday, Fenella Moss QC, representing the Trust, argued that the High Court's original judgement was wrong to find the use of puberty blockers for gender dysphoria was ""experimental"". Ms Morris said that puberty blockers are deemed fully reversible in international guidelines, and that ""not providing treatment means that the child remains in a position of distress and difficulties in making choices about what to do next"". She argued that it is not inevitable that a young person would continue on to taking cross-sex hormones  -which the NHS advises cause some irreversible changes,external- after puberty blockers. Children and young people are told about effects on their fertility that may be caused by later stages of transition, she added. ""There is no suggestion anywhere that this is one pathway... there is no shying away from explaining to children and young people what the possibilities are."" The trust that runs the gender identity clinic is appealing the decision Jeremy Hyam QC, representing Ms Bell and Mrs A, the other claimant, argued that the appeal should fail as it did not find any ""material errors"" in the original ruling. In written arguments, he said: ""The need for a child to understand, retain and weigh up the salient facts is all the more important because, unlike life-saving cancer treatment, there is much uncertainty as to what the benefits of puberty blockers actually are."" In court on Wednesday, he added: ""Right at the heart of what the court was concerned about was how can it be said that children of 10, 11, 12 have any proper conception of what sexual function is?"" Nine organisations or individuals - including human rights group Liberty and The Endocrine Society - have given evidence in the appeal. In a separate case in March,external, the Family Division of the High Court ruled that parents could give consent for under-16s to access puberty blockers. But it said it may be that ""additional safeguards"" should be put in place, such as the requirement for an independent second opinion. Puberty blockers are drugs that suppress the release of hormones produced in much bigger quantities during puberty. They are sometimes used to treat gender dysphoria, which the NHS describes as ""a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity"". Gids says puberty blockers allow a young person ""time to consider their options and to continue to explore their developing gender identity before making decisions about irreversible forms of treatment"". It advises that while the effects are physically reversible if treatment is stopped, the full psychological effects - or whether it alters the course of adolescent brain development - aren't known. The NHS says ""little is known"" about the long term side effects,externalin young people with gender dysphoria, including whether the treatment affects the development of the teenage brain or children's bones. Puberty blockers are also used to treat conditions which cause premature puberty in much younger children. This is the most contentious of areas. Partly because opinions will vary hugely on the age at which a child can understand the impact of a decision made in their early teens on the life they will lead as an adult. And partly because at its heart lie the futures of young people struggling with their gender identity, who may already feel marginalised, misunderstood and harmed by delays in treatment. The Court of Appeal hearing has so far revolved around two key areas. Firstly, whether under-16's can truly consent to puberty blockers when their feelings about, for instance, their fertility may change substantially in the next decade. Secondly, whether that treatment is experimental. The High Court concluded it was. The Tavistock disagrees, throughout it has pointed to prescription of the drugs by doctors going back more than twenty years. It will be for the Appeal Court to settle these arguments, but the case has already underlined the importance of more research in this complex area. Puberty blockers review group to be set up by NHS What does transgender mean and what does the law say? In the December ruling,external, Dame Victoria Sharp, sitting with Lord Justice Lewis and Mrs Justice Lieven, said: ""It is doubtful that a child aged 14 or 15 could understand and weigh the long-term risks and consequences of the administration of puberty blockers."" The judges added it was ""highly unlikely"" that children aged 13 and under would have the capacity to give consent. Mermaids, which provides services for young people and their families who struggle with their gender identity, says that decision, ""put a further strain on the already marginalised transgender and non-binary community and their families"". ""We believe strongly that trans and non-binary children should have the same rights over their healthcare decisions as anyone else, in line with their evolving understanding,"" the charity said in a statement. Transgender Trend, an organisation made up of parents, professionals and academics who are ""concerned about the current trend to diagnose children as transgender,"" has submitted evidence to the hearing. Founder Stephanie Davies-Arai said: ""Children do not have the maturity or life experience to give informed consent to medical interventions with such devastating long-term consequences and we hope and expect that the Appeal Court will uphold the High Court's judgement"".

"The Foreign Office has shown too little ""transparency and openness"" over its cuts to international development funding, a watchdog has said. The aid budget has been reduced from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income - a difference of about Â£4bn. The Independent Commission on Aid Impact said some cuts in funding for research on development had been made ""without consultation"". But the government says the reductions are temporary and necessary. And the Foreign Office told the BBC it was committed to full transparency over spending on aid. Aid cuts could see lives lost, warns ex-minister Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7 Backlash over cut to UK overseas aid budget Foreign aid: What is it used for? Ministers decided last year to cut spending on overseas development, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak arguing that it was hard to justify at existing levels, as the UK economy piled up record peacetime borrowing as a result of the pandemic. But charities, Labour and many Tory MPs have spoken out against the move, which went against the pledge in the 2019 Conservative election manifesto to stick to the 0.7% figure. In its report, the commission said cuts tothe Newton Fund,external- which builds research partnerships with countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America - had been made ""without consultation"" and ""little openness"". It said the Foreign Office's responses to its own previous advice had been ""inadequate"", while there had been a ""reduction in transparency and openness"". The commission also criticised the government's handling of its requests for information, adding that strategy papers that had not been signed off by ministers ""were generally not shared"", unlike in previous years. The Foreign Office took on responsibility for aid after the Department for International Development (DfID) closed last year. It said it had been transparent throughout over the budget changes. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has previously said merging DfID into the Foreign Office will ""strengthen further transparency and accountability in the use of taxpayers' money and relentlessly focus our Global Britain strategy on policies and in areas that deliver the most value"".

"Mrs Merkel first received a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine in April and then a dose of Moderna a few days ago German Chancellor Angela Merkel has received a dose of Moderna as her second shot of coronavirus vaccine having had Oxford-AstraZeneca as her first, a government spokesman said. The 66-year-old leader was vaccinated a few days ago after getting a dose of AstraZeneca in April. Experts believe mixed dosing of Covid vaccines could be a good idea but it is too early to say for sure. Mrs Merkel will be stepping down as leaderthis year after 16 years. In March,Germany, along with other European countries, halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccineafter a number of blood clots cases were reported. Spike in Australians rejecting AstraZeneca vaccine Covid vaccines and rare clots - what do we know? Germany had previously restricted the use of the jab to over-60s,but is now set to offer it to all adults,external, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports. After a slow start, Germany's vaccination rollout accelerated in recent weeks. More than half of the country's population has now received their first dose of a vaccine. In April, Mrs Merkel's spokesman tweeted a photo of her vaccination certificate to show she had received the injection. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There have been some studies conducted on the mixing of different vaccines. One study in the UK found that adults were more likely to report mild and moderate side effectsafter mixing doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer Covid vaccines. Some countries have been looking at mixing vaccines,externalin the face of supply shortages and to improve protection, Reuters news agency reports. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared The Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec have both said they plan to mix vaccines in the near future, amid uncertainty over shipments of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and concerns about rare blood clots. Experts believe mixed dosing of Covid vaccines could be a very good idea. It might give broader, longer-lasting immunity against the pandemic virus and new variants of it, and offer more flexibility to vaccine rollout. Studies are under way, but some countries are already allowing it within their national immunisation programs. Germany initially restricted the use of the AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine to people under 60 because there wasn't much trial data available on efficacy in older people. It reversed that decision in April, offering it to all adults. Weeks later Mrs Merkel received her first dose. More recently, following reports of rare blood clots in a small number of younger people who had the AZ vaccine, Germany recommended that under-60s who had already received a first dose of should have a different coronavirus vaccine for their booster second jab for safety reasons, as a precaution. Merkel doesn't fit this age bracket, but, nonetheless, she's had Moderna rather than AZ for her second dose. It may prove to be a decision that gives her better protection, but until we have the evidence from large trials, it is really too early to say for sure.

"This video can not be played Leah Walker says she cannot heal knowing her abuser is in the community A victim of sexual abuse has said she cannot heal with her attacker now living back in her community. Despite being told she would not see the man when he left prison because he was housebound due to his poor health, Leah Walker was ""devastated"" when she bumped into him at a supermarket. ""I was reassured I wouldn't see my abuser - then I saw him in Sainsbury's and it shook me to my core,"" she said. The Probation Service has apologised and said it has taken immediate action. Leah, 32, was sexually abused from the age of seven through to adulthood. Her abuser was jailed in 2017 for 25 counts of indecent and sexual assault. She was finally starting to heal when he was released into the community having served half of his six-year sentence. ""They reassured me that he's of such ill health that he won't be out of his home. But he's still really close to me - I was absolutely devastated,"" said Leah, who has waived her right to anonymity. Within a few months, she bumped into him while food shopping. ""I feel like back when I was a child and I wasn't listened to, it was brushed under the carpet - this is how I'm feeling again. ""I've voiced my concerns and let them know that I'm really not happy and I'm not comfortable with him being there and they reassured me that I won't see him - but I did."" ""It shook me to my core when I saw him"", said Leah Walker Leah also said a relative saw her abuser at a nearby takeaway on the weekend and she has raised it again with probation. She explained the resultant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression could leave her with flashbacks. ""Whilst he was in prison you start to build yourself up. I told myself: 'I'm a stronger person. I went to court. I got justice,' and my life was on a better track. ""But then you get knocked back and everything just seemed to unravel. ""For me to be able to heal in the way that I should - and the way that I deserve to - he shouldn't be in an area that I am. I feel my needs should be listened to and heard."" 'One in 40' young women sexually assaulted per year Met PC admits raping and kidnapping Sarah Everard Monitoring dangerous prison leavers in a pandemic The victims' commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird QC, said victims should always be considered by the Probation Service when releasing offenders to avoid such ""shock or distress"". ""Victims who are in the government's Victim Contact Scheme are offered the opportunity to request licence conditions, such as exclusion zones or no contact, so as to provide them with the peace of mind they will not meet the offender by chance close to where they live or work,"" she said. ""Victims sometimes attach great importance to these conditions, not least as it gives them a sense of control - something they did not have when the crimes against them were committed."" The Probation Service said it has taken immediate action to reinforce the offender's conditions. ""Prisoners released under supervision face strict conditions and if they pose an increased risk we don't hesitate to return them to custody,"" a spokesperson said. Leah says she was not taken seriously when she first spoke up as a child For Leah, it took years - and a global movement - to have the courage to speak up again. Aged seven, she disclosed what was happening, but was not taken seriously. It was only years later that the #MeToo movement gave her the confidence to seek justice. ""I started to think 'OK, so I'm not on my own. This has happened to other women and they seem like they're coping, so maybe I can have the courage to speak out as well.' ""Seeing things in the media helped me come to my decision to take it to court and I think it's really, really important that other people going through the same thing see a face out there that's been through it.

"Scotland is aiming to remove all of its major legal Covid restrictions in early August, the country's first minister has announced. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed lockdown easing would be paused for three weeks to allow more time for people to be vaccinated. It means mainland areas will not move to the lowest level zero restrictions until 19 July. The hope is that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August. Ms Sturgeon said this would allow life in Scotland to return to ""almost complete normality"". But the government will not advise an immediate return to full office working on that date - and people will still be required to wear face masks in some settings. Live: Latest from Nicola Sturgeon's Holyrood statement What happens after Scotland's Covid 'pause'? What Covid rules are changing, and when? Scotland recorded 2,167 new cases on Monday - the highest daily total since the peak of the second wave in January - with the country said to have had the highest rate in Europe last week The percentage of Covid-19 tests coming back positive rose to 9.1%, up from 7.2% the previous day, and the deaths of a further four people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded. The UK as a whole recorded 11,625 new cases and 27 deaths in the past 24 hours. The new daily case rate in Scotland is seven times higher than it was in early May and 40% higher than last week, with Ms Sturgeon saying the faster-transmitting Delta variant is ""now dominant"". But the first minister said the vaccination programme was breaking the link between the number of positive cases and the number of people being hospitalised and dying. The government's original ""route map"" out of lockdown would have seen the whole of Scotland move to level zero - the lowest point in the five-tier system of restrictions - from next Monday. This has now been pushed back to 19 July - the same date as measures are planned to be lifted in England. Island communities such as Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero, with all mainland areas in level one or level two of the country's five-tier system of restrictions. Some ""minor"" changes will be phased in sooner - removing staff and suppliers of wedding services from the cap on numbers at services from Monday and allowing live entertainment at receptions, and allowing people from more than one household to help carry a coffin at a funeral. The move to level zero will increase the number of people who are allowed to meet up indoors, cut the requirement for physical distancing indoors from 2m (6.5ft) to 1m (3.2ft), and increase the number of people allowed to attend wedding and funerals to 200. Ms Sturgeon said this would be a ""significant step back to normality"", but said she wanted to move beyond level zero ""as quickly as it is prudent to do so"". She said the ""major remaining legal restrictions"" could be lifted from 9 August, signalling a ""return to almost complete normality in our day to day lives"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""We will consider and make a final assessment nearer the time of whether - as we hope - this could include the lifting of the legal requirement to physically distance indoors as well as outdoors."" However she warned that some measures, including the use of face coverings in shops and on public transport and ""rigorous and regular hand-washing"" would be needed ""at least for a period"". And the first minister said there should be ""appropriate phasing"" of the return of workers to offices after 9 August, saying the government would ""encourage continued support for home working where it is possible"". The first minister has always said that Covid restrictions would be driven by the data, not by dates. But Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland can expect to be in level zero from 19 July,  and that all major legal restrictions could be lifted from 9 August. Looking at the raw data, this might seem surprising.  There are 154 new coronavirus cases a day in Scotland per 100,000 people. That's almost twenty more than the daily rate on Boxing Day, when the country went into another lockdown. The difference is the vaccine, which has dramatically reduced the consequences of catching coronavirus. Fewer people are now dying from Covid, down from an average of 31 a day in December to less than 2 a day now. That's why the Scottish government can look forward to a date when it can relax restrictions instead of imposing them. The changes are dependent on case levels being suppressed and targets being hit in the vaccination programme. All adults in Scotland will have had at least one dose of a vaccine by 18 July, with everyone in the 40-49 age group due to have had both doses by a week later. By 20 August, all 30 to 39-year-olds will have had a second dose, with everyone over the age of 18 due to have had two doses by 12 September. More than 2.6 million people in Scotland have had both doses of a vaccine Ms Sturgeon faced questions on her statement from opposition leaders at Holyrood - where MSPs are due to debate an extension of emergency powers into 2022. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed progress with the vaccination programme and that ""we have more of an indication of when we will be free from restrictions"". He pressed Ms Sturgeon for more detail about what measures would continue after 9 August, including whether masks would still be required in offices and schools. Ms Sturgeon said the legal requirement for physical distancing could be removed at that point, but that in some settings - such as schools - masks may need to be worn for a bit longer. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said ""we must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown"", calling for clearer messaging and protocols around financial support.

"Rises in house prices were a big factor in people's wealth increases More than five million people became millionaires across the world in 2020 despite economic damage from the Covid-19 pandemic. While many poor people became poorer, the number of millionaires increased by 5.2 million to 56.1 million globally, Credit Suisse research found. In 2020, more than 1% of adults worldwide were millionaires for the first time. Recovering stock markets and soaring house prices helped boost their wealth. Wealth creation appeared to be ""completely detached"" from the economic woes of the pandemic, the researchers said. Lower interest rates and government support programmes had led to ""a huge transfer"" of wealth from the public sector to the household sector, they added. This had prompted a surge in household saving, which had ""inflated household financial assets and caused household debts to be lower than they would be otherwise"". The number of ultra-high net worth individuals, usually defined as those having investable assets of more than $30m, grew by 24% worldwide in 2020, the fastest rate of increase since 2003. Credit Suisse said its total of the number of millionaires might be higher than other organisations' estimates because it included both investable and non-investable assets, such as owner-occupied homes. Anthony Shorrocks, economist and author of theGlobal Wealth Report,external, said the pandemic had an ""acute short-term impact on global markets"", but added this was ""largely reversed by the end of June 2020"". ""Global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil, but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year,"" he said. Billionaires see fortunes rise by 27% during the pandemic 'Wealth increase of 10 men during pandemic could buy vaccines for all' However, wealth differences between adults widened in 2020, and Mr Shorrocks said if asset price increases, such as house price rises, were removed from the analysis, ""then global household wealth may well have fallen"". ""In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed,"" he said. ""Some of the underlying factors may self correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices."" Total global wealth grew by 7.4%, the report said. Since the start of the 21st Century, the number of people with wealth between $10,000 and $100,000 had more than tripled in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. They said the increase reflected the ""growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world"". Nannette Hechler-Fayd'herbe, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, said: ""There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organise massive income transfer programmes to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis."" She added: ""The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. ""It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth."" But she added that these interventions ""have come at a great cost"". ""Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. ""Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries."" Ms Hechler-Fayd'herbe said a ""major reason"" why share prices and house prices had ""flourished"" was due to the lowering of interest rates by banks, which, she added, translated ""directly into our valuations of household wealth"".

"The PM's former top aide told staff to ""immediately"" issue a Â£530,000 grant with ""no procurement"" Dominic Cummings tried to bypass the usual awarding process and fast-track a Â£530,000 government grant at the start of the pandemic, leaked emails suggest. In an email, the PM's ex-top aide told civil servants to ""immediately"" issue the cash with ""no procurement, no lawyers, no meetings, no delay"". Further emails show civil servants had concerns about the timeframe and whether it was in line with the rules. The government said due diligence was followed in awarding the grant. ""We take these checks extremely seriously to ensure our contracts deliver results and value for money,"" the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. The grant was eventually issued to the project Our World in Data, a research project run by a charitable organisation with academics at Oxford University, in four instalments from summer 2020. In response, Mr Cummings wrote on Wednesday on his blog: ""I sent that email because I wanted the problem solved instantly without distracting key people from other aspects of the emergency."" ""I do not regard it as 'damaging' that I tried to throw 'due process' out the window - sticking with 'due process' was killing people,"" he said. Mr Cummings left his role in Downing Street in November 2020. What is going on with government Covid contracts? Dominic Cummings: who is the PM's former adviser? A series of emails detailing discussions of the grant requested by Our World in Data were leaked tothe BBC's File on 4,the Guardian,externalandSource Material,external. They begin with an email sent by the founder of the project, Max Roser, to William Warr, the prime minister's health adviser, who had requested details on the funding it needed. The organisation said it had to retain key members of staff who were generating data on the pandemic. It also wanted to hire extra contractors and needed financial support for the rising costs of servers and technical infrastructure. The request was passed to Health Secretary Matt Hancock and a minute after he received the email he emailed Matthew Gould, the CEO of NHSX - the unit tasked with the NHS' digital transformation - saying he supported the grant. An email from Mr Cummings to Mr Gould followed a couple of hours later, saying: ""Someone please ensure that they have the 530k within 24 hours from now and report back to me it's been sent. ""No procurement, no lawyers, no meetings, no delay please - just send immediately."" Further emails suggested this caused disquiet among the civil servants because of the request to pay out the grant money much faster than was normal. The DHSC's internal guidance, seen by the BBC, says that directly awarding grants without any form of competition is discouraged. But ministers - such as Mr Hancock - have wide-ranging powers to do so. The guidance is also clear that all grants should be subject to a series of timely checks and criteria. It says in some instances grants of more than Â£100,000 should be referred to an advice panel in the Cabinet Office. These safeguards are in place to ensure value for money for taxpayers and to guard against corruption. Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave his support to the grant The following day, Mr Gould said his team could meet the request through the DHSC ""and have the money in place by tomorrow"", but it would mean ""waiving the normal grant-giving process"". ""I don't want to do anything untoward, but given the secretary of state's and Dom Cumming's strong steer I'd really welcome your help/advice/green light,"" he wrote to a colleague. A more junior civil servant responded saying the team needed to make the appropriate checks ""to avoid leaving the accounting officer overly exposed"". Then, more than 24 hours later, the same civil servant suggested possible solutions, setting out the minimum criteria that needed to be met if the grant was to be paid. But he wrote: ""Matthew [Gould], I need your help please to progress this to a point where there is enough air cover to justify a decision to proceed."" Peter Smith, a former government commercial director and former senior adviser to the National Audit Office, said the ""air cover"" reference ""means you're doing something that... is going to go down badly with the media or the public so you need to have some backup, some explanation"". The civil servant's final email said: ""I'm sorry I couldn't just 'make this happen', but I share your concern about doing anything untoward."" In fact, the organisation that had been looking for the money then put the brakes on the application. Our World in Data asked for more time to understand the implications of accepting government money and to consult its trustees. It went on to receive the grant in instalments and the project said it complied with its own procedures. Max Roser, the founder and director of the project, told the BBC a full grant application was submitted on 25 March 2020 and this was followed by an agreement dated 30 April 2020. ""I have no way to know the internal processes inside the government,"" he said. The project said its work had added value in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, with its testing and vaccination data web pages receiving about 65 million visitors. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? A Whitehall source told the BBC they had been instructed not to share information about the grant discussion. ""In my view that's because it is so damaging to the NHSX: Dominic Cummings, Matt Hancockâ¦ everyone is just being very blatant that due process, and procedures, are being thrown out the window,"" the source said. Speaking after being shown the leaked emails, Mr Smith said it was ""quite clear that processes weren't followed"", saying: ""The attempt was to do it so quickly, clearly there was no time to do a proper due diligence."" He said senior people had put colleagues in the DHSC ""into a very difficult position"". ""So I think it was unethical, immoral, really, and yes, it was an abuse of power."" Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project, said: ""The government guidance talks about extra safeguards for sums above Â£100,000. This was well above Â£100,000. ""There was no process that I can see before the decision was made to award this very substantial sum."" The DHSC said: ""Officials carried out due diligence and followed appropriate processes before this grant was awarded. ""Every contract agreed by the government with partners has proper due diligence carried out on it."" Mr Warr has been contacted for comment.

"Tinder's signature ""swipe left, swipe right"" approach to match-making is no longer enough to satisfy singles used to lockdown dating, its CEO has said. People used to match in order to meet in real life, Jim Lanzone told the BBC - but that changed when virtual dating became the norm in lockdowns. Now the dating app is shifting towards more ""holistic"" profiles so users can get to know each other better online. New changes reflect their desire to ""swipe possibly"", Mr Lanzone said. In his only UK interview ahead of changes to the app, the 50-year-old boss told the BBC the trend was especially evident among Gen Z users in their late teens and early 20s - who now make up more than half of the app's users. ""As we know from the past 15 to 18 months, people have really leaned in to getting to know people virtually,even having relationships virtually, before they take those relationships offline,"" Mr Lanzone said. ""The larger trend here is that people on Tinder coming out of Covid... they just want to slow things down and get to know people first a lot more before they decide to match, let alone before they decide to go meet someone offline. "" 'We started going out in the first week of lockdown' How lockdown helped this long-distance couple Tinder's data suggests the average number of messages sent per day is up 19% compared to before the pandemic - and conversations are 32% longer. Half of Gen Z users have had dates via video chat, and a third did more virtual activities together, the company says. Changes being rolled out this week will still give users the option to swipe right on someone else's profile if they like the look of them, and swipe left if they are not interested. However they will also have ""more tools to show a more multidimensional version of themselves,"" according to Mr Lanzone, who is based in San Francisco and became CEO of Tinder during the pandemic last year. They include the option to add videos to profiles and to search for modes in an ""explore hub"" to tailor the type of profiles shown. For example, users could say they want to find people who have pets or like adventures. Jim Lanzone was previously president and CEO of CBS Interactive For the first time, they will have the option to chat with someone before matching, using a feature that asks them to give their ""hot take"" or opinion on a topic. Other dating apps - such as Hinge, which is owned by the same company as Tinder,and Bumble- already ask users to respond to questions as well as posting pictures. Mr Lanzone said these apps served people looking for ""a serious relationship"" - which is a ""different stage in life"" to people in their 20s who are ""open to a wider range of possibilities"". Asked whether Tinder was more of a hook-up app while Hinge was for forming relationships, he said: ""I wouldn't be able to speak to that directly. Different apps, different companies."" Tinder's decision to focus more on video comes as TikTok's popularity continues to grow. ByteDance, the Chinese company behind the smash-hit video app,saw its earnings double last year. TikTok owner ByteDance sees earnings double The tech billionaire who is putting women first Mr Lanzone said members of Gen Z - often categorised as those born between 1997 and 2015 - ""live in video"" and he expected that Gen Z Tinder members would continually update their profiles, rather than sticking with the same set of videos and pictures. Tinder's data suggests younger users value ""authenticity"" and openness in a partner, with more mentions of mental health and values in their bios during the pandemic - including the words ""anxiety and ""normalize"". ""Part of being more authentic is trying to be less of a perfectionist about the thing you're sharing and keeping it updated about what's happening in your life,"" Mr Lanzone said. He insisted that Tinder was not going to become a social media platform, and - unlike rival app Bumble - would not go down the route of helping users form platonic friendships. However, he said the pandemic had thrown people off the linear dating trajectory which, in principle, involved swiping, matching, meeting for a date, having a relationship and getting married. ""First of all it started to lead to things like video chat because you couldn't meet somebody in real life. But then last summer as things started to open up a little bit before the next wave hit, the trend became very quickly not 'let's meet for a drink' but 'let's go hiking',"" he said. ""People were deciding to go for adventures together."" There is ""a lot more"" to getting to know someone ""than just matching and having a quick chat before you then meet offline,"" he added. ""I think it's time that we give people more tools to show a more multidimensional version of themselves."" Has your approach to dating changed during Covid?

"The Foreign Office has shown too little ""transparency and openness"" over its cuts to international development funding, a watchdog has said. The aid budget has been reduced from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income - a difference of about Â£4bn. The Independent Commission on Aid Impact said some cuts in funding for research on development had been made ""without consultation"". But the government says the reductions are temporary and necessary. And the Foreign Office told the BBC it was committed to full transparency over spending on aid. Aid cuts could see lives lost, warns ex-minister Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7 Backlash over cut to UK overseas aid budget Foreign aid: What is it used for? Ministers decided last year to cut spending on overseas development, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak arguing that it was hard to justify at existing levels, as the UK economy piled up record peacetime borrowing as a result of the pandemic. But charities, Labour and many Tory MPs have spoken out against the move, which went against the pledge in the 2019 Conservative election manifesto to stick to the 0.7% figure. In its report, the commission said cuts tothe Newton Fund,external- which builds research partnerships with countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America - had been made ""without consultation"" and ""little openness"". It said the Foreign Office's responses to its own previous advice had been ""inadequate"", while there had been a ""reduction in transparency and openness"". The commission also criticised the government's handling of its requests for information, adding that strategy papers that had not been signed off by ministers ""were generally not shared"", unlike in previous years. The Foreign Office took on responsibility for aid after the Department for International Development (DfID) closed last year. It said it had been transparent throughout over the budget changes. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has previously said merging DfID into the Foreign Office will ""strengthen further transparency and accountability in the use of taxpayers' money and relentlessly focus our Global Britain strategy on policies and in areas that deliver the most value"".

"Cardboard boxes being stored in people's garages is continuing to cause shortages of the material, the boss of a major packaging company has said. Miles Roberts, chief executive of DS Smith, said the firm was working with local councils to improve supplies of cardboard to recycle into new boxes. DS Smith, whose largest UK customer is Amazon, used to get bulk supplies from High Street shops and restaurants. But lockdown and a surge in online home delivery has changed the supply chain. Mr Roberts said: ""We've found that, frankly, all those old cardboard boxes that we need, all that old newspaper that we need to recycle, has actually been stored in people's garages and in their refuse bins."" He told the BBC's Today programme: ""We've really been working on a local authority by local authority basis to say 'How can we improve the return of that material?' so we can make it into new packaging, get it back out into the supply chain."" Cardboard has been inshort supply for retailers across the UK since January. Before lockdown, cardboard and other material used by shops could often been seen at the roadside and at storage facilities ready for collection by recycling firms. It meant, said Mr Roberts, that cardboard quickly returned to the supply chain. Supermarkets have also experienced shortages of cardboard packing with Asda, Lidl and the Co-op finding they had to switch to, for example, plastic boxes for their eggs. That sparked criticism on social media about their green credentials. Asda said there was a ""shortage of the pulp used to make the cardboard boxes"" that was ""affecting all retailers"". It added, though, that its plastic boxes were 100% recyclable. Popcorn Shed is using plain brown rather than branded boxes Wholesale popcorn business Popcorn Shed has had cardboard supply problems since January. Director Sam Feller said the company was not able to get brand-printed corrugated boxes from ""any of its UK suppliers"". Before Covid and Brexit, branded boxes would arrive three or four weeks after the initial order, but now ""delivery dates bear no resemblance to when the order turns up"" Mr Feller said. Often the delays have come with a price hike because cardboard box manufacturers say they cannot get the usual material. ""We've switched to plain brown stock boxes and are larger too which means more pollution and wastage as a result,"" Mr Feller said.

"Rises in house prices were a big factor in people's wealth increases More than five million people became millionaires across the world in 2020 despite economic damage from the Covid-19 pandemic. While many poor people became poorer, the number of millionaires increased by 5.2 million to 56.1 million globally, Credit Suisse research found. In 2020, more than 1% of adults worldwide were millionaires for the first time. Recovering stock markets and soaring house prices helped boost their wealth. Wealth creation appeared to be ""completely detached"" from the economic woes of the pandemic, the researchers said. Lower interest rates and government support programmes had led to ""a huge transfer"" of wealth from the public sector to the household sector, they added. This had prompted a surge in household saving, which had ""inflated household financial assets and caused household debts to be lower than they would be otherwise"". The number of ultra-high net worth individuals, usually defined as those having investable assets of more than $30m, grew by 24% worldwide in 2020, the fastest rate of increase since 2003. Credit Suisse said its total of the number of millionaires might be higher than other organisations' estimates because it included both investable and non-investable assets, such as owner-occupied homes. Anthony Shorrocks, economist and author of theGlobal Wealth Report,external, said the pandemic had an ""acute short-term impact on global markets"", but added this was ""largely reversed by the end of June 2020"". ""Global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil, but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year,"" he said. Billionaires see fortunes rise by 27% during the pandemic 'Wealth increase of 10 men during pandemic could buy vaccines for all' However, wealth differences between adults widened in 2020, and Mr Shorrocks said if asset price increases, such as house price rises, were removed from the analysis, ""then global household wealth may well have fallen"". ""In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed,"" he said. ""Some of the underlying factors may self correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices."" Total global wealth grew by 7.4%, the report said. Since the start of the 21st Century, the number of people with wealth between $10,000 and $100,000 had more than tripled in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. They said the increase reflected the ""growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world"". Nannette Hechler-Fayd'herbe, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, said: ""There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organise massive income transfer programmes to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis."" She added: ""The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. ""It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth."" But she added that these interventions ""have come at a great cost"". ""Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. ""Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries."" Ms Hechler-Fayd'herbe said a ""major reason"" why share prices and house prices had ""flourished"" was due to the lowering of interest rates by banks, which, she added, translated ""directly into our valuations of household wealth"".

"Tricia's son had jaundice as a newborn A charity has launched an inquiry into why women from ethnic minorities are at a higher risk of serious harm or death in pregnancy and childbirth. Birthrights says women from ethnic minorities are too often failed by maternity services. Its year-long inquiry will gather views from parents, midwives, obstetricians and anti-racism campaigners. NHS England says it is working on a new strategy to tackle inequality in maternity and neonatal care services. One of those giving evidence, Tricia Boahene, had concerns her baby might be jaundiced when she left hospital, but felt midwives failed to take her seriously. ""We could definitely tell that he was jaundiced and the healthcare professionals just couldn't see it and that is really scary,"" she says. Eventually, her baby had to return to hospital. ""The healthcare professionals really struggled to recognise the jaundice, because my son is darker skinned,"" Tricia says. ""I do feel perhaps if he was lighter, even lighter but still black, they may have noticed it a lot sooner. Why are black mothers at more risk of dying? Racial gap in US maternal mortality ""It definitely felt that they just couldn't see my son, possibly in the way they would their own child, and definitely his skin colour had something to play in that. ""I don't think it is necessarily unusual for healthcare professionals to do all that they can to put the mother at ease - you know, 'Don't worry, it's probably not that big a thing of a deal,' -  but it definitely felt that I was not being heard until I really, really had to push."" Sabia Kamali says she could have avoided an emergency Caesarean section if her pain had been taken more seriously. ""When I said that I needed extra painkillers because gas and air wasn't enough, they were like, 'Oh no, it's normal, we'll come back, it's nothing, women go through that all the time.' ""So it's like shunning the idea that you are in pain."" Often not ""very forceful"", Asian women can be overlooked by professionals, Sabia says. ""What they tend to do is that they categorise you in say the ethnic box, or the Bangladeshi, the Muslim,"" she says. ""They think because you look a certain way, you dress a certain way, they think you don't understand things."" Sabia says everyone should be seen as an individual While death in pregnancy or childbirth is rare, black women are four times more likely to die during or up to the first six weeks after pregnancy than white women, according to the UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths, published in 2019, which blamed racial discrimination, stereotypes and cultural barriers. And, according to the Office for National Statistics, about a quarter of women giving birth in England and Wales belong to ethnic minorities. Research suggests they have poorer pregnancy outcomes than white women and poorer experience of maternity care, the ONS says. They tended to access antenatal care later in pregnancy, have fewer antenatal checks and ultrasound scans, less screening and were less likely to receive pain relief in labour. Black African women in particular were more likely to deliver by emergency Caesarean section. NHS England chief midwifery officer Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent said: ""The NHS is one of the safest healthcare systems in the world to have a baby and all women who use our maternity services should receive the best care possible - which is why we acted immediately to boost support for pregnant women from ethnic minority backgrounds, when heightened risks first became clear. ""We are working on a new strategy to tackle inequality in maternity and neonatal care and have been fast-tracking our continuity of carer programme for women from ethnic-minority backgrounds, which is proven to significantly improve their overall experience of care."" Birthrights chief executive Amy Gibbs said: ""UK law demands everyone has equal access to safe, respectful maternity care but we are failing to safeguard black and brown people's basic rights - to survive childbirth, to be treated with dignity, to have their bodies and choices respected."" Shaheen Rahman QC, who will chair the inquiry, said: ""We want to understand the stories behind the statistics, to examine how people can be discriminated against due to their race and to identify ways that this inequity can be redressed."" The early findings from the Birthrights investigation - supported by law firm Leigh Day - are expected to be published in the autumn, ahead of the full report in February 2022.

"Turkmenistan's economy has struggled to recover from a long-running economic crisis The capital of Turkmenistan in Central Asia has been named as the world's most expensive city for foreign workers. Ashgabat, a city of about one million people, toppeda 2021 cost-of-living survey by consultancy firm Mercer,external. The ranking puts Ashgabat above last year's priciest city, Hong Kong, which was placed second, followed by Beirut in Lebanon and Tokyo in Japan. The annual report ranks 209 cities based on the cost of expenses such as housing, transport and food. Mercer said it evaluated more than 200 goods and services for the report, which is designed to help companies and governments around the world determine how much they should pay expatriate employees. Expatriates, or expats, are people who live or work outside their native countries. Most of the cities in Mercer's top 10 are business hubs where economic growth has led to a hike in the price of housing and other living costs. But Ashgabat owes its high ranking to economic woes rather than prosperity, making it an outlier. Jean-Philippe Sarra of Mercer told AFP news agency that ""high local inflation"" explained Ashgabat's rise to first from second in last year's survey. Inflation is the rate of increase in prices for goods and services over time. Known for its autocratic government and large gas reserves, Turkmenistan has been grappling with a long-running economic crisis that has plunged many citizens into poverty. This video can not be played Turkmenistan remains one of the most isolated and repressive states in the world Formerly part of the Soviet Union, the country is highly dependent on natural gas exports to Russia. Given this, Turkmenistan's economic turmoil has been driven, in part, by low gas prices. A global slump in energy prices in 2014 pushed up inflation and food prices. A country profile of Turkmenistan In September last year,a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW),externalsaid the Covid-19 pandemic had ""drastically exacerbated Turkmenistan's pre-existing food crisis"". ""Shortages of subsidised food, accelerating since 2016, have worsened, with people waiting hours in line to try to buy more affordable food products, often being turned away empty-handed,"" the report said. Despite this, Turkmenistan's government started a major expansion of Ashgabat in May. Long-time President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov pledged to turn the capital into ""one of the most prosperous cities in the world"". By Abdujalil Abdurasulov, BBC News The report is just another illustration of the stark inequalities in Turkmenistan. Many citizens in Ashgabat struggle to afford even basic things such as food. It is common for people to queue for hours outside of shops to get hold of bread or flour as food shortages still grip the country. But there is also another Ashgabat - a glitzy capital full of marble buildings. This is the image that state propaganda tries to project in order to convince everyone that Turkmenistan is one of the most prosperous nations in the world. Meanwhile, foreign companies have to boost this image if they want to enter the market. For energy giants, they are attracted by one of the largest gas reserves in the world. To access it, some are prepared to follow written and unwritten rules on how to do business in Turkmenistan. This means their staff pay high prices for almost everything - from renting a house to buying food. Lebanon's capital, Beirut, was a big riser, jumping from 45th a year earlier to 3rd in the 2021 survey. Mercer attributed this to a number of factors, including the ""political turmoil"" of recent years and the ""severe and extensive economic depression"". ""The Covid-19 pandemic and thePort of Beirut explosion[in 2020] have all amplified the economic effects, causing record-high inflation,"" Mercer said.

"Having a coil fitted should not be traumatic or very painful, say experts. Their comments came after BBC Radio 5 Live's Naga Munchetty shared her experience, prompting many to recount their own stories of painful coil fittings. Most people encounter no problems, and no-one should be put off considering this safe and effective contraceptive, medics say. But they say pain relief should be ""part of the discussion"". Options available include a fast-acting anaesthetic spray. Munchetty said she felt violated and angry about her fitting a few years ago, which caused her ""excruciating pain"". It resonated with other women who have contacted the BBC with similar stories. This video can not be played Naga Munchetty: ""The nurse had tears in her eyes... I fainted twice"" Naomi (not her real name) is 26 and from London. She went for a coil, or intrauterine device (IUD), fitting a couple of months ago but had to stop the procedure when it became too painful. ""I didn't have the coil fitted in the end. ""My doctor was very kind and understanding and told me at the beginning we could stop at any point so when the pain became so bad I did ask to stop. However, if she hadn't said that to me before I don't know if I would have felt comfortable asking her to stop. ""The clinic had explained the procedure to me and I had taken some paracetamol to help with any discomfort. But I feel like the pain was massively downplayed to me beforehand. ""For me, it was quite a big deal and quite traumatising."" She says it helps knowing that her experience isn't unique. ""I'm very glad to hear that other women have had similar experiences to this because I felt a bit pathetic and a failure afterwards since I couldn't go through with it."" Some women who got in touch described feeling ""shocked"" or ""in agony"" during their IUD fitting, but others said they had had a good experience. And there was concern that discussing the issue could put women off using what is a very effective, and for many, convenient contraceptive. An IUD can be put into the womb to prevent a pregnancy It immediately protects against pregnancy and is 99% effective It can remain in place for years Fertility can return to normal as soon as it is removed But Unlike condoms, it doesn't prevent sexually transmitted infections Periods may be heavier, more painful or last longer There is a small risk of infection or it might not stay in place correctly Contraception: Which is most effective? Which method of contraception suits me?,external Dr Louise Massey, of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, who also runs a clinic helping women for whom it can be difficult to fit a coil, said: ""There is, understandably going to be some discomfort with the procedure, but it should not be overwhelming. ""I ask people to rate their discomfort on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst pain they could ever have. ""Most give it a two or three on that scale."" An IUD fitting/removal takes about five minutes (although the appointment will be longer) A speculum (a smooth, tube-shaped tool) is inserted into the vagina so neck of the womb (cervix) can be seen The IUD is inserted through the small opening of the cervix, into the womb Some people will experience cramping similar or sometimes more intense than menstrual pain. Dr Massey says the procedure can always be stopped if there is too much pain, discomfort or distress. ""It is always an option to abandon it. ""It can even be done under general anaesthetic if necessary and appropriate."" Dr Hannat Akintomide is a specialty doctor in sexual reproductive health with the Newcastle Upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust. She says for the vast majority of women, getting a coil is not painful or traumatic. And while offering pain relief or analgesia used to be somewhat hit and miss, the situation has massively improved in recent years, she says. Sheconducted a study,externalnearly a decade ago with 129 healthcare professionals to raise awareness about the issue. At that time, one-quarter of the practitioners said they routinely used local anaesthetic for IUD insertion. Another quarter said they never, or rarely, offered it. The rest said they did sometimes. Dr Akintomide said: ""I felt it was appalling that we were not doing something so simple that could improve their experience."" She says women should discuss any fears and concerns about the procedure with their healthcare provider, who can provide appropriate pain relief or analgesia. ""The options available are expanding."" That includes: Local anaesthetic gel Fast-acting local anaesthetic spray An injection of local anaesthetic Painkillers, such as ibuprofen, taken an hour or two before the procedure Dr Akintomide says it should be down to personal choice: ""Injectable local anaesthetic, the sound of it for many women, you know, is repulsive. They wouldn't imaging having an injection down below. ""But now we also have the local anaesthetic spray and the advantage is it doesn't involve a needle, it's quick acting - for many people it's immediate and, at most, three to five minutes to take effect - so you do have those options."" The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health says what clinics offer can vary - some recommend anaesthetic for the procedure while others may not. Women are often advised to take painkillers beforehand. Facultyguidelines,externalsay medication may ease the process, although there is ""no evidence"" from clinical trials to support the use of topical anaesthetic gels. ""Local anaesthetic block administered by cervical injection is not routinely required,"" they say. It should be offered for difficult IUD insertions or removals, the guidelines say. Lou Brack, head of nursing at Brook, the sexual health and wellbeing service for young people, said: ""It's all about listening and responding to everyone's individual needs. Many people who have an IUD procedure find they don't require pain relief, but we make sure it is available for those who do, so that they can benefit from an IUD without any unnecessary pain and distress.""

She says for the vast majority of women, getting a coil is not painful or traumatic. And while offering pain relief or analgesia used to be somewhat hit and miss, the situation has massively improved in recent years, she says. Sheconducted a study,externalnearly a decade ago with 129 healthcare professionals to raise awareness about the issue. At that time, one-quarter of the practitioners said they routinely used local anaesthetic for IUD insertion. Another quarter said they never, or rarely, offered it. The rest said they did sometimes. Dr Akintomide said: ""I felt it was appalling that we were not doing something so simple that could improve their experience."" She says women should discuss any fears and concerns about the procedure with their healthcare provider, who can provide appropriate pain relief or analgesia. ""The options available are expanding."" That includes: Local anaesthetic gel Fast-acting local anaesthetic spray An injection of local anaesthetic Painkillers, such as ibuprofen, taken an hour or two before the procedure Dr Akintomide says it should be down to personal choice: ""Injectable local anaesthetic, the sound of it for many women, you know, is repulsive. They wouldn't imaging having an injection down below. ""But now we also have the local anaesthetic spray and the advantage is it doesn't involve a needle, it's quick acting - for many people it's immediate and, at most, three to five minutes to take effect - so you do have those options."" The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health says what clinics offer can vary - some recommend anaesthetic for the procedure while others may not. Women are often advised to take painkillers beforehand. Facultyguidelines,externalsay medication may ease the process, although there is ""no evidence"" from clinical trials to support the use of topical anaesthetic gels. ""Local anaesthetic block administered by cervical injection is not routinely required,"" they say. It should be offered for difficult IUD insertions or removals, the guidelines say. Lou Brack, head of nursing at Brook, the sexual health and wellbeing service for young people, said: ""It's all about listening and responding to everyone's individual needs. Many people who have an IUD procedure find they don't require pain relief, but we make sure it is available for those who do, so that they can benefit from an IUD without any unnecessary pain and distress.""

"This video can not be played Leah Walker says she cannot heal knowing her abuser is in the community A victim of sexual abuse has said she cannot heal with her attacker now living back in her community. Despite being told she would not see the man when he left prison because he was housebound due to his poor health, Leah Walker was ""devastated"" when she bumped into him at a supermarket. ""I was reassured I wouldn't see my abuser - then I saw him in Sainsbury's and it shook me to my core,"" she said. The Probation Service has apologised and said it has taken immediate action. Leah, 32, was sexually abused from the age of seven through to adulthood. Her abuser was jailed in 2017 for 25 counts of indecent and sexual assault. She was finally starting to heal when he was released into the community having served half of his six-year sentence. ""They reassured me that he's of such ill health that he won't be out of his home. But he's still really close to me - I was absolutely devastated,"" said Leah, who has waived her right to anonymity. Within a few months, she bumped into him while food shopping. ""I feel like back when I was a child and I wasn't listened to, it was brushed under the carpet - this is how I'm feeling again. ""I've voiced my concerns and let them know that I'm really not happy and I'm not comfortable with him being there and they reassured me that I won't see him - but I did."" ""It shook me to my core when I saw him"", said Leah Walker Leah also said a relative saw her abuser at a nearby takeaway on the weekend and she has raised it again with probation. She explained the resultant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression could leave her with flashbacks. ""Whilst he was in prison you start to build yourself up. I told myself: 'I'm a stronger person. I went to court. I got justice,' and my life was on a better track. ""But then you get knocked back and everything just seemed to unravel. ""For me to be able to heal in the way that I should - and the way that I deserve to - he shouldn't be in an area that I am. I feel my needs should be listened to and heard."" 'One in 40' young women sexually assaulted per year Met PC admits raping and kidnapping Sarah Everard Monitoring dangerous prison leavers in a pandemic The victims' commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird QC, said victims should always be considered by the Probation Service when releasing offenders to avoid such ""shock or distress"". ""Victims who are in the government's Victim Contact Scheme are offered the opportunity to request licence conditions, such as exclusion zones or no contact, so as to provide them with the peace of mind they will not meet the offender by chance close to where they live or work,"" she said. ""Victims sometimes attach great importance to these conditions, not least as it gives them a sense of control - something they did not have when the crimes against them were committed."" The Probation Service said it has taken immediate action to reinforce the offender's conditions. ""Prisoners released under supervision face strict conditions and if they pose an increased risk we don't hesitate to return them to custody,"" a spokesperson said. Leah says she was not taken seriously when she first spoke up as a child For Leah, it took years - and a global movement - to have the courage to speak up again. Aged seven, she disclosed what was happening, but was not taken seriously. It was only years later that the #MeToo movement gave her the confidence to seek justice. ""I started to think 'OK, so I'm not on my own. This has happened to other women and they seem like they're coping, so maybe I can have the courage to speak out as well.' ""Seeing things in the media helped me come to my decision to take it to court and I think it's really, really important that other people going through the same thing see a face out there that's been through it. ""And even though I'm still struggling - there is light at the end of the tunnel."" If you have been affected bysexual abuse or violence, help and support is available atBBC Action Line.

"Plans for a third Menai crossing are being put on hold All new road-building projects in Wales are being frozen while the Welsh government conducts a review. It means plans for theDeeside ""Red Route"", theLlandeilo bypass, and a third Anglesey crossing will be put on hold. Ministers say it is a necessary part of Wales' effort to reduce carbon emissions. But the Conservatives warned the decision was a ""significant blow"" for the economic recovery. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru said the review cannot mean communities ""are left behind"". Deputy Climate Change Minister Lee Waters announced the review in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday afternoon. Projects that already have diggers in the ground, such asthe Heads of the Valleys Road, will continue. Llandeilo bypass delayed until 2025 Shapps wants UK government to 'fix' M4 and A55 M4 relief road planning protection scrapped As part of the plans the Welsh government wants to shift money from new roads to maintaining existing routes and investing in public transport. Wales is aiming to reachnet-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But to get there, Mr Waters said Wales needs to increase emissions cuts in the next decade to double what has been cut in the last 30 years. He told BBC Wales: ""Transport generates something like 17% of all our emissions, so it has to play its part. ""If we can hit these climate change targets, that's got to change. That means redirecting investment. ""If we carry on going as we're going, we're not going to hit net zero until 2090. At the very latest scientists tell us we have until 2050 to stop this running out of control."" The Llandeilo bypass had already been delayed to 2025 There was concern about the announcement from business people in Llandeilo, where the bypass hadhad already been delayed to 2025. It was promised by Welsh Labour ministers as part of a deal with Plaid Cymru to get the 2017-18 budget passed, and would have directed traffic away from the busy main road through the Carmarthenshire town. Ellen Plowman, who runs Maryellens coffee shop in the town, said: ""The volume of traffic that's coming through Llandeilo at the moment is far too much for the town, it's having an impact on people feeling safe walking through the town. ""If the bypass doesn't happen then I think they really should look at changing the weight of the lorries and the size of the noise coming through."" Jeweller Mari Thomas said she understood the need for the review ""but I think Llandeilo specifically has a problem with traffic and congestion, and... pollution"". She said it was dangerous for pedestrians. ""Public transport will help a lot but I don't think it will solve my problems here,"" she said, saying large lorries should be prevented ""from coming through such a small town when you've got narrow streets"". The ""red route"" would run from Northop through to the border with England The Welsh government picked a preferred route for a new Menai crossing in 2018, although a government minister later said the scrapping of the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power plant schemehad weakened its case. Plans for the red route dual carriageway in Deeside - which would see the A548 upgraded and a new link built with the A55 to tackle congestion - have sparked opposition forcutting through ancient woodland. The review will be conducted by a yet-to-be-announced external panel. Business lobby group the CBI warned that commuters were currently preferring private transport over alternatives. ""Public transport use in Flintshire is down 47% and down 33% in Carmarthenshire,"" said the CBI's Ian Price. ""This could spell trouble for the local communities of Deeside and Llandeilo if there is no plan to respond to these trends. ""The government review should consider what viable alternatives exist for Deeside and Llandeilo that can meet short and long-term pressures."" The announcement was criticised by Natasha Asghar, transport spokesperson for the Welsh Conservatives: ""At such a delicate economic time, this decision could prove a significant blow for our recovery. ""Many roads across Wales are not fit for purpose and have had a damaging impact on our economic fortunes, environment and public safety. Regular traffic jams deter investment and have contributed to Wales having some of the worst air quality in the UK. ""Welsh workers and businesses urgently require more information about the scope of the review and the Welsh Labour Government's long-term intentions for our transport infrastructure."" There was a mixed response from Plaid Cymru's climate change spokesperson Delyth Jewell. She added: ""This move from the Welsh government, whilst a welcome indication that they are serious about tackling carbon emissions, cannot mean that communities that are long overdue infrastructure investment are left behind. ""Communities like Llandeilo, who are understandably angry that this has been announced without consultation, have seen air pollution levels in their town centre rise to higher than the national standards and would benefit from the kind of infrastructure investment that has been promised but continuously delayed for the last six years."" Transport is Wales' third-largest source of the gases driving climate change, according to advisersat the independent Climate Change Committee,external. In a December 2020 report, the committee said transport emissions fell by 2% between 2016 and 2018 but overall emissions ""have remained virtually flat since 1990"". The Welsh government's new transport strategy -Llwybr Newydd,external- said Wales' transport emissions ""must be roughly halved between 2020 and 2030 from six to three million tonnes"" of carbon dioxide. It adds: ""Whilst electric vehicles may provide the biggest emissions savings, this is unlikely to be the main source of savings until the late 2020s and possibly later."" New cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and dieselwill not be sold in the UK from 2030. Work on the A465 Heads of the Valleys road will continue Seperately the deputy climate change minister said it would be ""inevitable at some point we're going to have some level of road charging. ""As people move to electric cars, they won't be paying tax on fuel,"" Lee Waters said. ""So the whole model of how we fund, transport and general taxation is changing and it'll have to be changes to reflect that you pay per mile, rather than just a flat rate as we currently do."" The Welsh government's strategy says other measures will also be needed, including a target of30% of the workforce working remotelyand an increase in people using public transport, walking and cycling. Around 32% of all journeys are currently made by public transport, walking and cycling - the government's target is to increase that share to 45% by 2040. Wales has seen a huge drop in public transport journeys as a result of the pandemic. In the year to March 2021, 24 million bus journeys were made in Wales -a 73% drop compared to the previous year,external. Transport for Wales also saw an84% drop in rail passenger journeys,externalin the past financial year - down from 31.8 million in 2019/20 to 5 million in 2020/21. Friends of the Earth Cymru has called fora ban on new roads in Wales. Asked on theBBC Politics Wales programmerecently whether there should be a ban,Climate Change Minister Julie James said: ""It's tempting, isn't it, to say, 'of course we won't build new roads'. ""But there are really complex issues here around air quality, what traffic routes people take, how many cars on the road and so on.""

"Ministers are ""working on"" plans for quarantine-free travel from amber list countries for people who are fully vaccinated, Matt Hancock has said. He said the plans for England had not been ""clinically advised yet"". But the health secretary said the government was looking at plans to allow the vaccine to ""bring back"" some freedoms. Currently travellers arriving from countries on the red or amber travel lists have to isolate for 10 days. What are the rules for travel? Is it possible to visit France, Spain or other destinations? How can I prove I've had both my Covid jabs? Asked on Sky News if the measure could be in place as soon as August, Mr Hancock said: ""We'll get there when it's safe to do so."" International Trade Secretary Liz Truss told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine she would not speculate about what was going to happen in terms of travel, but said the government was looking at what it could do to ""ease up requirements where it makes sense"". She said: ""We're not ready to make an announcement yet, but fundamentally what we need to do is - while keeping people safe - making sure we're freeing up the rules as much as we can."" Responding to Mr Hancock's comments, Green MP Caroline Lucas, vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said scrapping quarantine measures would be ""reckless"" and called for the government to focus on upgrading systems at airports. ""The Delta variant first arrived here in the UK precisely because of inadequate pre-travel requirements and health checks at UK arrival halls, compounded by a lack of support and enforcement of mandatory quarantine,"" she said. Long queues were reported at the UK border at London's Heathrow airport on Tuesday evening Under the current rules for England, arrivals from red list destinations such as India and South Africa must isolate in a government approved hotel for 10 days. Those coming from amber countries must quarantine for 10 days, with tests to be taken on days two and eight after return, but they do not need to be in a hotel. It may be possible to end quarantine early in England by paying for an additional test under thetest-to-release,externalscheme. The vast majority of countries are on the amber list. Arrivals from the few green list countries - which includes a small number of countries including Israel and Iceland - do not have to quarantine but must book a test for day two of their return. Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalare following similar rules. This video can not be played Five ways to self-isolate successfully to prevent the spread of coronavirus Andrew Flintham, from travel firm Tui, said it had become an interested party in the legal action taken against the government by Manchester Airports Group, alongside Ryanair, British Airways' parent company IAG and Virgin Atlantic about how the government manages and publishes the green travel list. ""At the time of the last country review, many destinations such as Malta, the Greek islands and the Balearics had much lower rates than the UK,"" he told a conference organised by the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta). ""It was inexplicable as to why these were not added and instead Portugal was moved straight from green to amber, without the slightest sign of stopping at the much-vaunted green watchlist."" Mark Tanzer, of Abta, urged ministers to ""put aside any misguided prejudices against outbound travel"". He added that the amount of state support given to travel firms is ""way behind"" the situation in other countries. On Monday, the prime minister said the government was considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UKif they took daily tests. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""cautiously hopeful"" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme, with the next ""checkpoint"" taking place on 28 June. The health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that England remained ""on track"" for the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions on 19 July, with case rates ""slowing"" and hospitalisations ""not rising quickly"". He said the number of people dying from Covid in England remained ""very, very low"" and said this showed the ""vaccine was working"". Mr Hancock also warned that the coming winter could be ""challenging"", but said that he hoped the government would not have to bring back restrictions. More than 43.1 million people (81.9% of the population) have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and nearly 31.5 million (59.8%) have had a second, according tothe government's coronavirus dashboard.,external The UK has reported a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test on Tuesday, and another 11,625 cases. The Office for National Statistics said infections were continuing to increase in England but the ""trend is uncertain"" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The number of hospital admissions for Covid has jumped by a third in the last week with the latest data showing four consecutive days of more than 200 admissions. A month ago we had three days of under 100 admissions so the change is very clear. But that just tells you part of the story. Ministers have spoken about vaccinations breaking the link between cases and hospitalisations. That has not happened, but it has certainly been weakened. During the winter wave around 10% of infections being diagnosed ended up in hospital 10 days later. Currently it looks to be around 3%. That is a significant difference. But it still means if infection rates keep climbing as they are we could see in excess of 1,000 admissions a day later in the summer. That is what the NHS would expect to see in the depths of a bad winter for all types of respiratory illness. The hope is that the ""wall of immunity"" built up by the vaccination programme will kick in before we reach that point and help reduce infection levels and then admissions.

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is the only candidate for the DUP leadership after nominations closed at midday on Tuesday Sir Jeffrey Donaldson isthe only candidate to succeed Edwin Pootsas Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader. Edwin Poots announced his resignation last week after an internal party revolt, leaving the DUP looking for a third leader in a matter of weeks. The crisis has raised questions about the stability of the Stormont assembly and devolution in Northern Ireland. Sir Jeffrey's name will go forward to the party's electoral college, which is expected to meet on Saturday. Following that meeting of the party's eight MPs and 27 members of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLAs), the Lagan Valley MP's leadership will have to be ratified at a meeting of the DUP executive, which is set to take place next week. He would become the party's fifth leader in its 50-year history, and its third in 50 days. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks back at the six weeks that led to Edwin Poots being elected and then resigning as leader of the DUP Sir Jeffrey said he had the vision ""to unite Northern Ireland and heal the divisions of the past"". He accepted the task was great, but added: ""The overwhelming majority of people who live here want Northern Ireland to keep moving forward."" He had previously said he would leave his Westminster seat to run for the Stormont assembly so he could be Northern Ireland's first minister as well as his party's leader. Such a move would mean a by-election in his Lagan Valley constituency. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson will need to get his political ducks in a row to find a path from Westminster to Belfast. The clearest way is through the co-option process, which allows a party to replace an assembly member without a by-election, although it remains to be seen which constituency he would target. There is no sign that the two DUP MLAs in his political power-base of Lagan Valley - Paul Givan and Edwin Poots - will be stepping down any time soon. The only obvious vacancy coming up in the near future is in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the political home of Arlene Foster. DUP chairman Lord Morrow said mistakes had been made in a difficult few weeks for the party, and called on its members to ""move forward in a spirit of humility and mindful that our focus must be on serving the people"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he looked forward to working with Sir Jeffrey and the Stormont executive to ""deliver on the shared interests of all the people of Northern Ireland"". Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin congratulated the soon-to-be DUP leader on Twitter, writing that he had ""worked with Jeffrey over many years in various roles and look forward to working constructively with him in the very important time ahead"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald tweeted that she would meet Sir Jeffrey ""early next week"" after they both spoke on Tuesday evening. Allow Twitter content?

Sir Jeffrey has said his first priority was dealing with the post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland, known as the protocol. The mechanism, which was part of the UK-EU Brexit deal, keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, ensuring free trade across the Irish border. However, it has placed additional restrictions on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, prompting unionists to complain of there being an Irish Sea border. Likely plotlines if Donaldson writes DUP script Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? On Tuesday, Sir Jeffrey said he wanted to speak to the prime minister about the protocol as soon as possible, and that he would tell Boris Johnson it was not realistic to expect stability ""when every unionist representative in the devolved institutions opposes the Northern Ireland Protocol"". ""The government and those who claim to be protectors of peace and stability must step up and deal with the protocol in a manner which respects the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom,"" he added. Edwin Poots says a section of the DUP struggled to accept his leadership The leadership vacancy arose when Mr Poots resigned after just 21 days in the position he took over from Arlene Foster. He had defeated Sir Jeffrey in the party's first leadership election on 14 Mayby 19 votes to 17. He quit having lost the support of party colleagues as he pursued a deal with Sinn FÃ©in and the UK government over provisions for Irish language legislation. Sinn FÃ©in had made clear it would only re-nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister if the party secured a guarantee that language legislation agreed in theNew Decade New Approach Dealin 2020, which restored power-sharing, would be implemented. Due to the power-sharing nature of the Stormont assembly, a refusal by Sinn FÃ©in to nominate would have crashed the Northern Ireland Executive and prompted a snap election. Paul Givan looks set to be the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland A continued impasse could have led to a suspension of devolution. Having not received the backing of DUP MPs and MLAs over a deal to resolve the issue brokered by Mr Lewis, a majority of them opposed his plans to nominate Paul Givan as first ministerin an internal revolt at a party meetinglast Thursday. Mr Poots announced his resignation later that day. ""There was a section in the party that struggled to accept that I won the election,""he told Sky News on Monday. ""In terms of the support I received, it didn't come from people that it should have and that's just a reality that everybody knows."" Sir Jeffrey, born in Kilkeel, County Down, became politically active as a constituency agent for the South Down MP Enoch Powell (above, left) in the mid-1980s before working as a personal assistant to the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader James Molyneaux. After James Molyneaux retired as an MP in 1997, Sir Jeffrey was voted as his successor as MP for Lagan Valley, retaining the seat through six subsequent elections. He is a member of the Orange Order and also served as a corporal in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during the Troubles. In 2003, following long-standing opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and the leadership of David Trimble, he announced he would leave the UUP, later joining the DUP, along with Arlene Foster and Norah Beare. He was appointed to the Privy Council, a body which advises the monarchy, in 2007 and stood down as an MLA for Lagan Valley in 2010. He was awarded a knighthood in 2016 for political service. Sir Jeffrey was defeated by 19 votes to 17 in the DUP leadership election to succeed Arlene Foster in May. Read more:Who is the man set to be the DUP's new leader?

Edwin Poots announced his resignation last week after an internal party revolt, leaving the DUP looking for a third leader in a matter of weeks. The crisis has raised questions about the stability of the Stormont assembly and devolution in Northern Ireland. Sir Jeffrey's name will go forward to the party's electoral college, which is expected to meet on Saturday. Following that meeting of the party's eight MPs and 27 members of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLAs), the Lagan Valley MP's leadership will have to be ratified at a meeting of the DUP executive, which is set to take place next week. He would become the party's fifth leader in its 50-year history, and its third in 50 days. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks back at the six weeks that led to Edwin Poots being elected and then resigning as leader of the DUP Sir Jeffrey said he had the vision ""to unite Northern Ireland and heal the divisions of the past"". He accepted the task was great, but added: ""The overwhelming majority of people who live here want Northern Ireland to keep moving forward."" He had previously said he would leave his Westminster seat to run for the Stormont assembly so he could be Northern Ireland's first minister as well as his party's leader. Such a move would mean a by-election in his Lagan Valley constituency. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson will need to get his political ducks in a row to find a path from Westminster to Belfast. The clearest way is through the co-option process, which allows a party to replace an assembly member without a by-election, although it remains to be seen which constituency he would target. There is no sign that the two DUP MLAs in his political power-base of Lagan Valley - Paul Givan and Edwin Poots - will be stepping down any time soon. The only obvious vacancy coming up in the near future is in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the political home of Arlene Foster. DUP chairman Lord Morrow said mistakes had been made in a difficult few weeks for the party, and called on its members to ""move forward in a spirit of humility and mindful that our focus must be on serving the people"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he looked forward to working with Sir Jeffrey and the Stormont executive to ""deliver on the shared interests of all the people of Northern Ireland"". Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin congratulated the soon-to-be DUP leader on Twitter, writing that he had ""worked with Jeffrey over many years in various roles and look forward to working constructively with him in the very important time ahead"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald tweeted that she would meet Sir Jeffrey ""early next week"" after they both spoke on Tuesday evening. Allow Twitter content?

Sir Jeffrey has said his first priority was dealing with the post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland, known as the protocol. The mechanism, which was part of the UK-EU Brexit deal, keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, ensuring free trade across the Irish border. However, it has placed additional restrictions on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, prompting unionists to complain of there being an Irish Sea border. Likely plotlines if Donaldson writes DUP script Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? On Tuesday, Sir Jeffrey said he wanted to speak to the prime minister about the protocol as soon as possible, and that he would tell Boris Johnson it was not realistic to expect stability ""when every unionist representative in the devolved institutions opposes the Northern Ireland Protocol"". ""The government and those who claim to be protectors of peace and stability must step up and deal with the protocol in a manner which respects the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom,"" he added. Edwin Poots says a section of the DUP struggled to accept his leadership The leadership vacancy arose when Mr Poots resigned after just 21 days in the position he took over from Arlene Foster. He had defeated Sir Jeffrey in the party's first leadership election on 14 Mayby 19 votes to 17. He quit having lost the support of party colleagues as he pursued a deal with Sinn FÃ©in and the UK government over provisions for Irish language legislation. Sinn FÃ©in had made clear it would only re-nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister if the party secured a guarantee that language legislation agreed in theNew Decade New Approach Dealin 2020, which restored power-sharing, would be implemented. Due to the power-sharing nature of the Stormont assembly, a refusal by Sinn FÃ©in to nominate would have crashed the Northern Ireland Executive and prompted a snap election. Paul Givan looks set to be the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland A continued impasse could have led to a suspension of devolution. Having not received the backing of DUP MPs and MLAs over a deal to resolve the issue brokered by Mr Lewis, a majority of them opposed his plans to nominate Paul Givan as first ministerin an internal revolt at a party meetinglast Thursday. Mr Poots announced his resignation later that day. ""There was a section in the party that struggled to accept that I won the election,""he told Sky News on Monday. ""In terms of the support I received, it didn't come from people that it should have and that's just a reality that everybody knows."" Sir Jeffrey, born in Kilkeel, County Down, became politically active as a constituency agent for the South Down MP Enoch Powell (above, left) in the mid-1980s before working as a personal assistant to the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader James Molyneaux. After James Molyneaux retired as an MP in 1997, Sir Jeffrey was voted as his successor as MP for Lagan Valley, retaining the seat through six subsequent elections. He is a member of the Orange Order and also served as a corporal in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during the Troubles. In 2003, following long-standing opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and the leadership of David Trimble, he announced he would leave the UUP, later joining the DUP, along with Arlene Foster and Norah Beare. He was appointed to the Privy Council, a body which advises the monarchy, in 2007 and stood down as an MLA for Lagan Valley in 2010. He was awarded a knighthood in 2016 for political service. Sir Jeffrey was defeated by 19 votes to 17 in the DUP leadership election to succeed Arlene Foster in May. Read more:Who is the man set to be the DUP's new leader?

"Scotland is aiming to remove all of its major legal Covid restrictions in early August, the country's first minister has announced. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed lockdown easing would be paused for three weeks to allow more time for people to be vaccinated. It means mainland areas will not move to the lowest level zero restrictions until 19 July. The hope is that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August. Ms Sturgeon said this would allow life in Scotland to return to ""almost complete normality"". But the government will not advise an immediate return to full office working on that date - and people will still be required to wear face masks in some settings. Live: Latest from Nicola Sturgeon's Holyrood statement What happens after Scotland's Covid 'pause'? What Covid rules are changing, and when? Scotland recorded 2,167 new cases on Monday - the highest daily total since the peak of the second wave in January - with the country said to have had the highest rate in Europe last week The percentage of Covid-19 tests coming back positive rose to 9.1%, up from 7.2% the previous day, and the deaths of a further four people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded. The UK as a whole recorded 11,625 new cases and 27 deaths in the past 24 hours. The new daily case rate in Scotland is seven times higher than it was in early May and 40% higher than last week, with Ms Sturgeon saying the faster-transmitting Delta variant is ""now dominant"". But the first minister said the vaccination programme was breaking the link between the number of positive cases and the number of people being hospitalised and dying. The government's original ""route map"" out of lockdown would have seen the whole of Scotland move to level zero - the lowest point in the five-tier system of restrictions - from next Monday. This has now been pushed back to 19 July - the same date as measures are planned to be lifted in England. Island communities such as Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero, with all mainland areas in level one or level two of the country's five-tier system of restrictions. Some ""minor"" changes will be phased in sooner - removing staff and suppliers of wedding services from the cap on numbers at services from Monday and allowing live entertainment at receptions, and allowing people from more than one household to help carry a coffin at a funeral. The move to level zero will increase the number of people who are allowed to meet up indoors, cut the requirement for physical distancing indoors from 2m (6.5ft) to 1m (3.2ft), and increase the number of people allowed to attend wedding and funerals to 200. Ms Sturgeon said this would be a ""significant step back to normality"", but said she wanted to move beyond level zero ""as quickly as it is prudent to do so"". She said the ""major remaining legal restrictions"" could be lifted from 9 August, signalling a ""return to almost complete normality in our day to day lives"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""We will consider and make a final assessment nearer the time of whether - as we hope - this could include the lifting of the legal requirement to physically distance indoors as well as outdoors."" However she warned that some measures, including the use of face coverings in shops and on public transport and ""rigorous and regular hand-washing"" would be needed ""at least for a period"". And the first minister said there should be ""appropriate phasing"" of the return of workers to offices after 9 August, saying the government would ""encourage continued support for home working where it is possible"". The first minister has always said that Covid restrictions would be driven by the data, not by dates. But Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland can expect to be in level zero from 19 July,  and that all major legal restrictions could be lifted from 9 August. Looking at the raw data, this might seem surprising.  There are 154 new coronavirus cases a day in Scotland per 100,000 people. That's almost twenty more than the daily rate on Boxing Day, when the country went into another lockdown. The difference is the vaccine, which has dramatically reduced the consequences of catching coronavirus. Fewer people are now dying from Covid, down from an average of 31 a day in December to less than 2 a day now. That's why the Scottish government can look forward to a date when it can relax restrictions instead of imposing them. The changes are dependent on case levels being suppressed and targets being hit in the vaccination programme. All adults in Scotland will have had at least one dose of a vaccine by 18 July, with everyone in the 40-49 age group due to have had both doses by a week later. By 20 August, all 30 to 39-year-olds will have had a second dose, with everyone over the age of 18 due to have had two doses by 12 September. More than 2.6 million people in Scotland have had both doses of a vaccine Ms Sturgeon faced questions on her statement from opposition leaders at Holyrood - where MSPs are due to debate an extension of emergency powers into 2022. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed progress with the vaccination programme and that ""we have more of an indication of when we will be free from restrictions"". He pressed Ms Sturgeon for more detail about what measures would continue after 9 August, including whether masks would still be required in offices and schools. Ms Sturgeon said the legal requirement for physical distancing could be removed at that point, but that in some settings - such as schools - masks may need to be worn for a bit longer. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said ""we must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown"", calling for clearer messaging and protocols around financial support.

"Cardboard boxes being stored in people's garages is continuing to cause shortages of the material, the boss of a major packaging company has said. Miles Roberts, chief executive of DS Smith, said the firm was working with local councils to improve supplies of cardboard to recycle into new boxes. DS Smith, whose largest UK customer is Amazon, used to get bulk supplies from High Street shops and restaurants. But lockdown and a surge in online home delivery has changed the supply chain. Mr Roberts said: ""We've found that, frankly, all those old cardboard boxes that we need, all that old newspaper that we need to recycle, has actually been stored in people's garages and in their refuse bins."" He told the BBC's Today programme: ""We've really been working on a local authority by local authority basis to say 'How can we improve the return of that material?' so we can make it into new packaging, get it back out into the supply chain."" Cardboard has been inshort supply for retailers across the UK since January. Before lockdown, cardboard and other material used by shops could often been seen at the roadside and at storage facilities ready for collection by recycling firms. It meant, said Mr Roberts, that cardboard quickly returned to the supply chain. Supermarkets have also experienced shortages of cardboard packing with Asda, Lidl and the Co-op finding they had to switch to, for example, plastic boxes for their eggs. That sparked criticism on social media about their green credentials. Asda said there was a ""shortage of the pulp used to make the cardboard boxes"" that was ""affecting all retailers"". It added, though, that its plastic boxes were 100% recyclable. Popcorn Shed is using plain brown rather than branded boxes Wholesale popcorn business Popcorn Shed has had cardboard supply problems since January. Director Sam Feller said the company was not able to get brand-printed corrugated boxes from ""any of its UK suppliers"". Before Covid and Brexit, branded boxes would arrive three or four weeks after the initial order, but now ""delivery dates bear no resemblance to when the order turns up"" Mr Feller said. Often the delays have come with a price hike because cardboard box manufacturers say they cannot get the usual material. ""We've switched to plain brown stock boxes and are larger too which means more pollution and wastage as a result,"" Mr Feller said.

"Turkmenistan's economy has struggled to recover from a long-running economic crisis The capital of Turkmenistan in Central Asia has been named as the world's most expensive city for foreign workers. Ashgabat, a city of about one million people, toppeda 2021 cost-of-living survey by consultancy firm Mercer,external. The ranking puts Ashgabat above last year's priciest city, Hong Kong, which was placed second, followed by Beirut in Lebanon and Tokyo in Japan. The annual report ranks 209 cities based on the cost of expenses such as housing, transport and food. Mercer said it evaluated more than 200 goods and services for the report, which is designed to help companies and governments around the world determine how much they should pay expatriate employees. Expatriates, or expats, are people who live or work outside their native countries. Most of the cities in Mercer's top 10 are business hubs where economic growth has led to a hike in the price of housing and other living costs. But Ashgabat owes its high ranking to economic woes rather than prosperity, making it an outlier. Jean-Philippe Sarra of Mercer told AFP news agency that ""high local inflation"" explained Ashgabat's rise to first from second in last year's survey. Inflation is the rate of increase in prices for goods and services over time. Known for its autocratic government and large gas reserves, Turkmenistan has been grappling with a long-running economic crisis that has plunged many citizens into poverty. This video can not be played Turkmenistan remains one of the most isolated and repressive states in the world Formerly part of the Soviet Union, the country is highly dependent on natural gas exports to Russia. Given this, Turkmenistan's economic turmoil has been driven, in part, by low gas prices. A global slump in energy prices in 2014 pushed up inflation and food prices. A country profile of Turkmenistan In September last year,a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW),externalsaid the Covid-19 pandemic had ""drastically exacerbated Turkmenistan's pre-existing food crisis"". ""Shortages of subsidised food, accelerating since 2016, have worsened, with people waiting hours in line to try to buy more affordable food products, often being turned away empty-handed,"" the report said. Despite this, Turkmenistan's government started a major expansion of Ashgabat in May. Long-time President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov pledged to turn the capital into ""one of the most prosperous cities in the world"". By Abdujalil Abdurasulov, BBC News The report is just another illustration of the stark inequalities in Turkmenistan. Many citizens in Ashgabat struggle to afford even basic things such as food. It is common for people to queue for hours outside of shops to get hold of bread or flour as food shortages still grip the country. But there is also another Ashgabat - a glitzy capital full of marble buildings. This is the image that state propaganda tries to project in order to convince everyone that Turkmenistan is one of the most prosperous nations in the world. Meanwhile, foreign companies have to boost this image if they want to enter the market. For energy giants, they are attracted by one of the largest gas reserves in the world. To access it, some are prepared to follow written and unwritten rules on how to do business in Turkmenistan. This means their staff pay high prices for almost everything - from renting a house to buying food. Lebanon's capital, Beirut, was a big riser, jumping from 45th a year earlier to 3rd in the 2021 survey. Mercer attributed this to a number of factors, including the ""political turmoil"" of recent years and the ""severe and extensive economic depression"". ""The Covid-19 pandemic and thePort of Beirut explosion[in 2020] have all amplified the economic effects, causing record-high inflation,"" Mercer said. Zurich is a global centre for banking and finance Three Swiss cities were in the top 10, including Zurich, which dropped to fifth. Of the priciest Chinese cities included, Shanghai climbed one spot to number six while the capital, Beijing, rose to ninth. Singapore, an island city-state known for its flourishing financial sector, took seventh place. Shanghai's landscape is dotted with skyscrapers In the UK, London was placed 18th, edging up by one place from number 19 last year, while Birmingham was ranked at 121, moving up by eight places from 129 in 2020. At the bottom of the list, Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek was ranked as the least expensive city for foreign employees by the survey.

"This video can not be played Edwin Poots says the EU has ""behaved despicably"" towards Northern Ireland The UK government has ""promised that there will be a significant win"" on the Northern Ireland Protocol, outgoing Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Edwin Poots has said. He told BBC News NI he had ""received assurances"" from Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and that they could emerge in early July. Mr Poots said ""we haven't got detail"" of the changes but was told they would be ""very significant"". He will quit as DUP leader within days. The protocol is part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned to the EU single market to ensure the free movement of goods across the Irish border. It has been criticised by unionists because it has led to additional checks and delays on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Some aspects of the protocol,such as restrictions on the movement of fresh sausages and chilled meats, have been mitigated by so-called grace periods which could end in July. The EU is considering a UK request for the ban to be postponed until October. The BBC understands that Tesco and two other major supermarkets are now sourcing almost all their sausages locally for sale in Northern Ireland. Brandon Lewis says the government is taking ""nothing off the table"" in talks about the protocol Speaking after Mr Poots made his comment about the promised ""significant"" changes, Mr Lewis repeated his view that the government ""will do what we need to do"" in managing the protocol. But he did not specifically address Mr Poots' suggestion. He was asked about the remarks during a debate in the Commons on Tuesday afternoon. He said he was conscious of challenges for consumers and businesses posed by the protocol and that the government would ""not allow that to continue"". ""We want to get this corrected so that consumers and businesses can continue to function as a full and integral part of the UK,"" he added. ""We take nothing off the table in that regard... but we want to work this through with the EU."" UK and EU officials have been engaged in months of technical talks aimed at simplifying the operation of the protocol. But the UK's Brexit Minster Lord Frost has said those negotiations have made little progress. So short of an unexpected breakthrough there what ""significant win"" could the Northern Ireland secretary have promised? It is possible that the UK could take further unilateral action. The government has not ruled out using Article 16, which allows parts of the protocol to be temporarily suspended. But using that mechanism would mean a fresh crisis in the broader UK-EU relationship. Last week Mr Poots announced he wouldresign from the top job after just 21 days. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who stood against Mr Poots in the party's first leadership contest last month, has confirmedhis second bid for the leadership. Nominations closed at midday on Tuesday andSir Jeffrey is the only candidate to succeed Mr Poots. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks back at the six weeks that led to Edwin Poots being elected and then resigning as leader of the DUP Sir Jeffrey has warned that Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive could be at risk if the UK government fails to take ""decisive action"" over the protocol. On Tuesday Mr Poots said such threats would not work and have ""demonstrated failure in the past"". Mr Poots explained how, as a ""young loyalist"", he attended street protests about the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the 1980s but cautioned that it ""didn't make any difference whatsoever"". He said he hoped that when he hands over to a new leader at the end of June most of the work on the protocol ""will already be achieved"". ""I can see we are making actual progress on making those arguments,"" he said. Mr Poots, who succeeded Arlene Foster in May after an internal DUP revolt, said he did not choose to stand for the leadership until others approached him. After his own ""bruising"" ousting from the position, he said his ""focus isn't on engaging on infighting"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson confirms DUP leadership bid What went wrong for DUP's shortest-serving leader? Poots' short legacy will 'help his successor' ""I would like to think that I am a better man than to continue some sort of infighting because I think there is a bigger prize out there for the people of Northern Ireland,"" he told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme. The decision by Mr Poots to stand down followed a row about his decision to nominate Paul Givan as first minister. Mr Poots had agreed a deal that both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in would nominate first and deputy first ministers after Sinn FÃ©in received commitments on legislation for Irish language provisions. Paul Givan became Northern Ireland first minister last week but his future in the role is already in doubt A majority of DUP MPs and MLAs - 24 to 4 - wanted to delay the nomination process. Reflecting on the move, Mr Poots said most of his decisions would be shown to be ""good ones"" with the ""benefit of history"". ""People will say that I had made the right choices in actually ensuring that we could continue to fight the protocol issue, the big constitutional issue of the day as opposed to closing the assembly down over a much narrower issue,"" he explained. The outgoing DUP leader, who is the Stormont agriculture minister and has been a Lagan Valley MLA since 1998, told Sky News that he regretted the brevity of his leadership. ""Essentially, there was a section in the party that struggled to accept that I won the election, that I won democratically, I won it fairly, and that's how things are now, that I've been forced into a resignation,"" he said.

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was beaten 19 votes to 17 in the leadership contest with Edwin Poots For the second time in two months, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson had put his name forward for the DUP leadership but this time he was unopposed. The process has been fast-tracked and, before the end of the month, Sir Jeffrey will become the DUPs fifth leader. That is if all goes according to plan, and nothing about the DUP has been predictable or planned in the past seven weeks. With that in mind, let's explore some potential plotlines safe in the knowledge they may never make it into the final script. Fast forward to when Sir Jeffrey takes charge of the DUP. Expect lots of talk of healing and bridge-building, but also some party reshuffling. DUP looking for new leader as Edwin Poots quits Q&A: What went wrong for the DUP's shortest-serving leader? Sir Jeffrey has made it clear he wants to lead the party from Stormont as first minister. But without a planned election before May next year, how might he make that move from Westminster? Co-option is the only option - he just needs a vacancy. Could that gap open up in Fermanagh if, as expected, Arlene Foster calls time on her Stormont career? Or could we see another departure elsewhere to allow the new leader in? Whatever the route, we know the final destination - the first minister's office. That means Paul Givan is now effectively working out his notice in the dream job he only landed last week. That is if he followsthe order to resign. Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill were confirmed as first and deputy first ministers on Thursday If he does, he will go down in history as Northern Ireland's youngest and shortest-serving first minister so far. Sitting on the same page as the shortest-serving political leader is his good friend Edwin Poots. As for the other ministerial Poots appointees, expect some change but also some reaching out. There are lots of questions to be answered. Will Mr Poots be part of that bridge-building and keep his job as agriculture minister? Will Paul Frew, as economy minister, be asked to step aside for a Sir Jeffrey loyalist? Could we see a return to the executive for ex-Junior Minister Gordon Lyons? As the only declared Sir Jeffrey supporter in the Poots executive team, Junior Minister Gary Middleton could survive the cull. This video can not be played The seven questions Edwin Poots faced in 11 seconds Michelle McIlveen may also have strengthened her grip as education minister, having lined up against Mr Poots in Thursday's vote. But the reshuffling won't just be confined to the front bench at Stormont. There will be a space to fill on the green benches at Westminster after the Donaldson departure. A by-election in Lagan Valley throws up lots of interesting questions. Who will stand for the DUP? Mr Poots or Mr Givan now that their Stormont careers appear to have peaked? Could Mrs Foster abandon her plan to quit the party and seek a seat in the House of Commons? Could Edwin Poots swap Stormont for a Westminster election contest She has already declared an interest in a move to Westminster and her popularity is on the rise. A plotline too far, maybe. But a by-election in the most divided DUP constituency in Northern Ireland will bring some challenges. Lagan Valley is home to Team Poots and Team Donaldson. The key players all share the same office building in Lisburn. Defending a seat with such deep divisions will not be easy but it will put the respective calls for unity from both camps to the test. The growing challenge from the Alliance Party in Lagan Valley andUlster Unionists under new managementmay help to focus DUP minds. That is likely to be Sir Jeffrey's first big electoral test as leader but a more pressing challenge will be unitinga deeply fractured party. He firstly needs to convince the 19 MLAs and MPs who rejected him in the leadership contest that he can heal the wounds and steer the party out of this crisis. No doubt he has his script ready and will be hoping this plot has no more twists and turns. But who really knows how this saga will end? We may have to wait for the box set.

"Chilled meats from GB are to be banned from Northern Ireland under the terms of the NI Protocol Tesco has said it will still be able to service its business in Northern Ireland if chilled meat products from Great Britain are banned from sale. Chief executive Ken Murphy said the supermarket had already been able to switch to local sources for ""challenging"" products. Fresh sausages and other chilled meats from GB are to be banned under the terms of the NI Protocol in July. The UK has asked for the ban to be postponed until October. The EU is considering that request. ""We'll be able to supply the vast majority of what we supply today at competitive prices,"" Mr Murphy said. The BBC understands that two other major supermarkets are now sourcing almost all their sausages locally for sale in Northern Ireland. Why is there a UK-EU row over sausages? GB-NI grace period extension 'problematic' - Irish PM Mr Murphy said that even if the UK and the EU fail to find a solution, Tesco would still be able to service its business in Northern Ireland. ""We're clearly very keen for the government to find a sustainable solution for the Northern Irish protocol with the EU and we're waiting with interest - we're looking forward to a resolution,"" Mr Murphy said. ""Where we have had challenges in terms of bringing product into the north we have been able to switch to local supply."" He said product availability at Tesco's 50 stores in Northern Ireland was currently ""really good"". The Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal whichkeeps NI in the EU single market for goods. The EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states. Since January, producers in Great Britain have not been able to sell these products in the EU. However, in December 2020, the EU agreed to a six-month grace period to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain. The UK has asked the EU to extend a grace period for chilled meats until the end of September. In recent weeks the issue has seen growing tension between the EU and UK with the UKrefusing to rule out a unilateral extension of the grace period. The EU has warned it could respond with legal action which could ultimately lead to the introduction of tariffs on British goods. Can sea border âteething problemsâ be solved?

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was ratified on 30 June as the DUP's fifth leader in 50 years - and its third in 50 days The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has appointed its second new leader in just two months. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was ratified as party leader on 30 June. It comes after Edwin Poots wasforced to resign following an internal revoltafter just 21 days in the job. That followed theousting of former First Minister Arlene Fosterfollowing an internal revolt. BBC News NI explains what the recent developments with the DUP could mean for the future of power-sharing at Stormont. There are several key reasons behind his political downfall. Mr Poots waselected to lead the party following a contest on 14 May, after he narrowly beat the DUP's Westminster leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson by two votes. He was criticised for not mentioning Sir Jeffrey in his acceptance speech and for his role in helping to oust Mrs Foster just weeks earlier. At the ratification of his leadership on 27 May, divisions within the party were publicly and painfully exposed. Claims of bullying and intimidation saw some members, opposed to Mr Poots' brand of leadership, resign. Edwin Poots announced his resignation after 21 days as party leader But it was not until 17 June that Mr Poots lost his short-lived grip on the party. Having backed an agreement that same day with the government and the DUP's power-sharing partner Sinn FÃ©in to allow Westminster to pass Irish language legislation in October if Stormont has failed to do so by then, Mr Poots wanted to nominate Paul Givan as the new first minister. However, most of his assembly team and MPs were hesitant to do so and urged Mr Poots to delay the process. After a tense meeting of MLAs and MPs, the DUP leader nominated Mr Givan anyway, but he overwhelmingly lost a subsequent vote that would prove the fatal blow to his authority after only 21 days in office. A meeting of party officers later that evening confirmed Mr Poots would resign but remain in post until his successor was found. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is the DUP's fifth leader in its 50-year history. Sir Jeffrey was ratified as party leader at a meeting of the DUP's central executive committee on 30 June after he was endorsed ata meeting of the electoral college on Saturday 26 June. Only MPs and MLAs form the college and the 130-strong executive is made up of MPs, MLAs, peers and representatives from the party's 17 constituency associations and university groups. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson became the DUP's third leader within the space of 50 days Sir Jeffrey was the only person to submit a nomination paper this time round. Just a month since the DUP's first-ever leadership election took place, second time around it was a coronation rather than a contest. The Lagan Valley MP, who shares a constituency office with Mr Poots, had also thrown his hat into the ring during the first leadership campaign. Party officers were trying fast-track the process in a bid to bring stability to the DUP. Sir Jeffrey faced his first challenge just hours after his ratification when North Down DUP MLA Alex Eastonannounced he was quitting the partyafter 21 years as a member. He said he was at the ""end of his tether"" and saw no ""respect, discipline or decency"" in the recent behaviour within the DUP. Instead of all the attention being focused on his first major speech as DUP leader Sir Jeffrey fielded questions about the one who got away. He has pledged to heal division, for whichhe accepts some responsibilitybut there is some distance to go. For now, Paul Givan remains in post. However, he has been informed by party officers that he will have to resign oncea new party leader is in place. It is not clear precisely when that will happen. Edwin Poots - pictured with ally Paul Givan - was in post for three weeks having taken the party leadership on 28 May A close friend of Mr Poots, Mr Givan is Northern Ireland's youngest first minister and could become the shortest-serving leader to hold the post. In the first election contest, Sir Jeffrey said that if he became leader he would want to become first minister as well. However, only MLAs can be first minister and therefore that presents a challenge for Sir Jeffrey, who is an MP. Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? Not only would he need a way to return to Stormont through a co-option process, which allows a party to replace an MLA without a by-election, but stepping down from Westminster would trigger a by-election in the Lagan Valley constituency. He has held that seat since 1997 but in 2019's general election the Alliance Party's Sorcha Eastwood narrowed the DUP's majority and some in the party are concerned that it could be difficult to retain this time. Then there is the added complication that when Mr Givan resigns it would lead to Michelle O'Neill's removal as deputy first minister and the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in would then have seven days to fill the roles. The posts are a joint office which must have the support of both parties. If they don't nominate within seven days, the Northern Ireland secretary is legally bound to set a date for a fresh assembly election. Nothing is predictable in Northern Ireland politics right now. Ahead of Mr Givan being installed as first minister, there was concern that the institutions risked collapse. That led to negotiations between the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in and the government over Irish language laws, as Sinn FÃ©in said it would not support Mr Givan's nomination without progress on that. Sinn FÃ©in was given assurances by NI Secretary Brandon Lewis on Irish language provisions Sinn Fein's Chris Hazzard previously said his party would not make any new demands during the process to nominatea first and deputy first minister. However, before Sir Jeffrey's appointment, the Sunday Life reported that he would not nominate a first minister unless there was ""significant change in the plans to bring in Irish language laws"". The new DUP leader will face pressure not to be viewed as having gone into government without making any gains for the party. That could lead to another potential standoff, which would also affect day-to-day governance at Stormont. For example, the power-sharing executive can only meet to take decisions on coronavirus restrictions when a first and deputy first minister are in place. Faced with the prospect of fresh instability during a pandemic, events are expected to move at pace. If the past two months are anything to go by, trying to determine how they will play out remains an impossible guessing game.

"This video can not be played Edwin Poots says the EU has ""behaved despicably"" towards Northern Ireland The UK government has ""promised that there will be a significant win"" on the Northern Ireland Protocol, outgoing Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Edwin Poots has said. He told BBC News NI he had ""received assurances"" from Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and that they could emerge in early July. Mr Poots said ""we haven't got detail"" of the changes but was told they would be ""very significant"". He will quit as DUP leader within days. The protocol is part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned to the EU single market to ensure the free movement of goods across the Irish border. It has been criticised by unionists because it has led to additional checks and delays on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Some aspects of the protocol,such as restrictions on the movement of fresh sausages and chilled meats, have been mitigated by so-called grace periods which could end in July. The EU is considering a UK request for the ban to be postponed until October. The BBC understands that Tesco and two other major supermarkets are now sourcing almost all their sausages locally for sale in Northern Ireland. Brandon Lewis says the government is taking ""nothing off the table"" in talks about the protocol Speaking after Mr Poots made his comment about the promised ""significant"" changes, Mr Lewis repeated his view that the government ""will do what we need to do"" in managing the protocol. But he did not specifically address Mr Poots' suggestion. He was asked about the remarks during a debate in the Commons on Tuesday afternoon. He said he was conscious of challenges for consumers and businesses posed by the protocol and that the government would ""not allow that to continue"". ""We want to get this corrected so that consumers and businesses can continue to function as a full and integral part of the UK,"" he added. ""We take nothing off the table in that regard... but we want to work this through with the EU."" UK and EU officials have been engaged in months of technical talks aimed at simplifying the operation of the protocol. But the UK's Brexit Minster Lord Frost has said those negotiations have made little progress. So short of an unexpected breakthrough there what ""significant win"" could the Northern Ireland secretary have promised? It is possible that the UK could take further unilateral action. The government has not ruled out using Article 16, which allows parts of the protocol to be temporarily suspended. But using that mechanism would mean a fresh crisis in the broader UK-EU relationship. Last week Mr Poots announced he wouldresign from the top job after just 21 days. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who stood against Mr Poots in the party's first leadership contest last month, has confirmedhis second bid for the leadership. Nominations closed at midday on Tuesday andSir Jeffrey is the only candidate to succeed Mr Poots. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks back at the six weeks that led to Edwin Poots being elected and then resigning as leader of the DUP Sir Jeffrey has warned that Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive could be at risk if the UK government fails to take ""decisive action"" over the protocol. On Tuesday Mr Poots said such threats would not work and have ""demonstrated failure in the past"". Mr Poots explained how, as a ""young loyalist"", he attended street protests about the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the 1980s but cautioned that it ""didn't make any difference whatsoever"". He said he hoped that when he hands over to a new leader at the end of June most of the work on the protocol ""will already be achieved"". ""I can see we are making actual progress on making those arguments,"" he said. Mr Poots, who succeeded Arlene Foster in May after an internal DUP revolt, said he did not choose to stand for the leadership until others approached him. After his own ""bruising"" ousting from the position, he said his ""focus isn't on engaging on infighting"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson confirms DUP leadership bid What went wrong for DUP's shortest-serving leader? Poots' short legacy will 'help his successor' ""I would like to think that I am a better man than to continue some sort of infighting because I think there is a bigger prize out there for the people of Northern Ireland,"" he told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme. The decision by Mr Poots to stand down followed a row about his decision to nominate Paul Givan as first minister. Mr Poots had agreed a deal that both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in would nominate first and deputy first ministers after Sinn FÃ©in received commitments on legislation for Irish language provisions. Paul Givan became Northern Ireland first minister last week but his future in the role is already in doubt A majority of DUP MPs and MLAs - 24 to 4 - wanted to delay the nomination process. Reflecting on the move, Mr Poots said most of his decisions would be shown to be ""good ones"" with the ""benefit of history"". ""People will say that I had made the right choices in actually ensuring that we could continue to fight the protocol issue, the big constitutional issue of the day as opposed to closing the assembly down over a much narrower issue,"" he explained. The outgoing DUP leader, who is the Stormont agriculture minister and has been a Lagan Valley MLA since 1998, told Sky News that he regretted the brevity of his leadership. ""Essentially, there was a section in the party that struggled to accept that I won the election, that I won democratically, I won it fairly, and that's how things are now, that I've been forced into a resignation,"" he said. ""But that's life."" Poots' short legacy will 'help his successor' What went wrong for DUP's shortest-serving leader?

"Cars could be heard using the car park through the town council's meeting A town council has held a meeting in a car park after legislation which allowed it to meet virtually expired. The governmentannounced in Marchthat it could not fit in legislation to allow online meetings to continue beyond May. As a result, Middlewich Town Council met outside its usual venue, Victoria Hall, on Monday, due to the building being used as a vaccination centre. Council clerk Lisa Benskin said it was ""extremely frustrating"". In avideo shared on social media,external, cars could be heard using the car park throughout the Cheshire authority's meeting. The hall would have been big enough to accommodate a socially distanced meeting of all those who normally attend if it had been available. The council's alternative plans to meet indoors on Monday at the smaller Middlewich Methodist Church were scuppered after Covid-19 rules on meetings were extended beyond 21 June and a postponement was not possible due to there being a time-sensitive item on the agenda. Ms Benskin said it was exasperating, as the council had been meeting using video conferencing app Zoom and would have loved to have been ""able to continue online meetings"", but no longer could legally. Jackie Weaver, who took charge of anow-infamous council Zoom meeting during lockdown, said it was ""ridiculous"" councils were ""in this position"". ""One might argue the government has more pressing issues on its mind, but local democracy is something that all of us have an interest in,"" she said, adding that it would ""only be a teeny-weeny bit of legislation"". Sue Baxter, chair of the National Association of Local Councils, said councils were being ""forced to find creative ways to meet in person"". ""You simply wouldn't see MPs and peers forced to meet in a car park or a field,"" she added.

There have been some studies conducted on the mixing of different vaccines. One study in the UK found that adults were more likely to report mild and moderate side effectsafter mixing doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer Covid vaccines. Some countries have been looking at mixing vaccines,externalin the face of supply shortages and to improve protection, Reuters news agency reports. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared The Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec have both said they plan to mix vaccines in the near future, amid uncertainty over shipments of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and concerns about rare blood clots. Experts believe mixed dosing of Covid vaccines could be a very good idea. It might give broader, longer-lasting immunity against the pandemic virus and new variants of it, and offer more flexibility to vaccine rollout. Studies are under way, but some countries are already allowing it within their national immunisation programs. Germany initially restricted the use of the AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine to people under 60 because there wasn't much trial data available on efficacy in older people. It reversed that decision in April, offering it to all adults. Weeks later Mrs Merkel received her first dose. More recently, following reports of rare blood clots in a small number of younger people who had the AZ vaccine, Germany recommended that under-60s who had already received a first dose of should have a different coronavirus vaccine for their booster second jab for safety reasons, as a precaution. Merkel doesn't fit this age bracket, but, nonetheless, she's had Moderna rather than AZ for her second dose. It may prove to be a decision that gives her better protection, but until we have the evidence from large trials, it is really too early to say for sure.

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is the only candidate for the DUP leadership after nominations closed at midday on Tuesday Sir Jeffrey Donaldson isthe only candidate to succeed Edwin Pootsas Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader. Edwin Poots announced his resignation last week after an internal party revolt, leaving the DUP looking for a third leader in a matter of weeks. The crisis has raised questions about the stability of the Stormont assembly and devolution in Northern Ireland. Sir Jeffrey's name will go forward to the party's electoral college, which is expected to meet on Saturday. Following that meeting of the party's eight MPs and 27 members of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLAs), the Lagan Valley MP's leadership will have to be ratified at a meeting of the DUP executive, which is set to take place next week. He would become the party's fifth leader in its 50-year history, and its third in 50 days. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks back at the six weeks that led to Edwin Poots being elected and then resigning as leader of the DUP Sir Jeffrey said he had the vision ""to unite Northern Ireland and heal the divisions of the past"". He accepted the task was great, but added: ""The overwhelming majority of people who live here want Northern Ireland to keep moving forward."" He had previously said he would leave his Westminster seat to run for the Stormont assembly so he could be Northern Ireland's first minister as well as his party's leader. Such a move would mean a by-election in his Lagan Valley constituency. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson will need to get his political ducks in a row to find a path from Westminster to Belfast. The clearest way is through the co-option process, which allows a party to replace an assembly member without a by-election, although it remains to be seen which constituency he would target. There is no sign that the two DUP MLAs in his political power-base of Lagan Valley - Paul Givan and Edwin Poots - will be stepping down any time soon. The only obvious vacancy coming up in the near future is in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the political home of Arlene Foster. DUP chairman Lord Morrow said mistakes had been made in a difficult few weeks for the party, and called on its members to ""move forward in a spirit of humility and mindful that our focus must be on serving the people"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he looked forward to working with Sir Jeffrey and the Stormont executive to ""deliver on the shared interests of all the people of Northern Ireland"". Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin congratulated the soon-to-be DUP leader on Twitter, writing that he had ""worked with Jeffrey over many years in various roles and look forward to working constructively with him in the very important time ahead"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald tweeted that she would meet Sir Jeffrey ""early next week"" after they both spoke on Tuesday evening. Allow Twitter content?

Sir Jeffrey has said his first priority was dealing with the post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland, known as the protocol. The mechanism, which was part of the UK-EU Brexit deal, keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, ensuring free trade across the Irish border. However, it has placed additional restrictions on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, prompting unionists to complain of there being an Irish Sea border. Likely plotlines if Donaldson writes DUP script Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? On Tuesday, Sir Jeffrey said he wanted to speak to the prime minister about the protocol as soon as possible, and that he would tell Boris Johnson it was not realistic to expect stability ""when every unionist representative in the devolved institutions opposes the Northern Ireland Protocol"". ""The government and those who claim to be protectors of peace and stability must step up and deal with the protocol in a manner which respects the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom,"" he added.

He had defeated Sir Jeffrey in the party's first leadership election on 14 Mayby 19 votes to 17. He quit having lost the support of party colleagues as he pursued a deal with Sinn FÃ©in and the UK government over provisions for Irish language legislation. Sinn FÃ©in had made clear it would only re-nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister if the party secured a guarantee that language legislation agreed in theNew Decade New Approach Dealin 2020, which restored power-sharing, would be implemented. Due to the power-sharing nature of the Stormont assembly, a refusal by Sinn FÃ©in to nominate would have crashed the Northern Ireland Executive and prompted a snap election. Paul Givan looks set to be the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland A continued impasse could have led to a suspension of devolution. Having not received the backing of DUP MPs and MLAs over a deal to resolve the issue brokered by Mr Lewis, a majority of them opposed his plans to nominate Paul Givan as first ministerin an internal revolt at a party meetinglast Thursday. Mr Poots announced his resignation later that day. ""There was a section in the party that struggled to accept that I won the election,""he told Sky News on Monday. ""In terms of the support I received, it didn't come from people that it should have and that's just a reality that everybody knows."" Sir Jeffrey, born in Kilkeel, County Down, became politically active as a constituency agent for the South Down MP Enoch Powell (above, left) in the mid-1980s before working as a personal assistant to the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader James Molyneaux. After James Molyneaux retired as an MP in 1997, Sir Jeffrey was voted as his successor as MP for Lagan Valley, retaining the seat through six subsequent elections. He is a member of the Orange Order and also served as a corporal in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during the Troubles. In 2003, following long-standing opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and the leadership of David Trimble, he announced he would leave the UUP, later joining the DUP, along with Arlene Foster and Norah Beare. He was appointed to the Privy Council, a body which advises the monarchy, in 2007 and stood down as an MLA for Lagan Valley in 2010. He was awarded a knighthood in 2016 for political service. Sir Jeffrey was defeated by 19 votes to 17 in the DUP leadership election to succeed Arlene Foster in May. Read more:Who is the man set to be the DUP's new leader?

"Tinder's signature ""swipe left, swipe right"" approach to match-making is no longer enough to satisfy singles used to lockdown dating, its CEO has said. People used to match in order to meet in real life, Jim Lanzone told the BBC - but that changed when virtual dating became the norm in lockdowns. Now the dating app is shifting towards more ""holistic"" profiles so users can get to know each other better online. New changes reflect their desire to ""swipe possibly"", Mr Lanzone said. In his only UK interview ahead of changes to the app, the 50-year-old boss told the BBC the trend was especially evident among Gen Z users in their late teens and early 20s - who now make up more than half of the app's users. ""As we know from the past 15 to 18 months, people have really leaned in to getting to know people virtually,even having relationships virtually, before they take those relationships offline,"" Mr Lanzone said. ""The larger trend here is that people on Tinder coming out of Covid... they just want to slow things down and get to know people first a lot more before they decide to match, let alone before they decide to go meet someone offline. "" 'We started going out in the first week of lockdown' How lockdown helped this long-distance couple Tinder's data suggests the average number of messages sent per day is up 19% compared to before the pandemic - and conversations are 32% longer. Half of Gen Z users have had dates via video chat, and a third did more virtual activities together, the company says. Changes being rolled out this week will still give users the option to swipe right on someone else's profile if they like the look of them, and swipe left if they are not interested. However they will also have ""more tools to show a more multidimensional version of themselves,"" according to Mr Lanzone, who is based in San Francisco and became CEO of Tinder during the pandemic last year. They include the option to add videos to profiles and to search for modes in an ""explore hub"" to tailor the type of profiles shown. For example, users could say they want to find people who have pets or like adventures. Jim Lanzone was previously president and CEO of CBS Interactive For the first time, they will have the option to chat with someone before matching, using a feature that asks them to give their ""hot take"" or opinion on a topic. Other dating apps - such as Hinge, which is owned by the same company as Tinder,and Bumble- already ask users to respond to questions as well as posting pictures. Mr Lanzone said these apps served people looking for ""a serious relationship"" - which is a ""different stage in life"" to people in their 20s who are ""open to a wider range of possibilities"". Asked whether Tinder was more of a hook-up app while Hinge was for forming relationships, he said: ""I wouldn't be able to speak to that directly. Different apps, different companies."" Tinder's decision to focus more on video comes as TikTok's popularity continues to grow. ByteDance, the Chinese company behind the smash-hit video app,saw its earnings double last year. TikTok owner ByteDance sees earnings double The tech billionaire who is putting women first Mr Lanzone said members of Gen Z - often categorised as those born between 1997 and 2015 - ""live in video"" and he expected that Gen Z Tinder members would continually update their profiles, rather than sticking with the same set of videos and pictures. Tinder's data suggests younger users value ""authenticity"" and openness in a partner, with more mentions of mental health and values in their bios during the pandemic - including the words ""anxiety and ""normalize"". ""Part of being more authentic is trying to be less of a perfectionist about the thing you're sharing and keeping it updated about what's happening in your life,"" Mr Lanzone said. He insisted that Tinder was not going to become a social media platform, and - unlike rival app Bumble - would not go down the route of helping users form platonic friendships. However, he said the pandemic had thrown people off the linear dating trajectory which, in principle, involved swiping, matching, meeting for a date, having a relationship and getting married. ""First of all it started to lead to things like video chat because you couldn't meet somebody in real life. But then last summer as things started to open up a little bit before the next wave hit, the trend became very quickly not 'let's meet for a drink' but 'let's go hiking',"" he said. ""People were deciding to go for adventures together."" There is ""a lot more"" to getting to know someone ""than just matching and having a quick chat before you then meet offline,"" he added. ""I think it's time that we give people more tools to show a more multidimensional version of themselves."" Has your approach to dating changed during Covid?

"Billie Eilish says she didn't know the word was a derogatory term Billie Eilish has apologised after a video surfaced which appeared to show her mouthing a racist slur. In a statement on her Instagram story, the Grammy-winning singer said she was ""appalled and embarrassed"" by the clip. An edited compilation video was posted to TikTok earlier this month in which she appeared to mouth an anti-Asian slur which appeared in Tyler The Creator's 2011 song Fish. The singer, who's now 19, was also filmed speaking in different accents. In her apology, the Billie said she was ""13 or 14"" in the videos and did not know at the time the slur was a derogatory term. ""I am appalled and embarrassed and want to barf that I ever mouthed along to that word,"" she wrote. ""This song was the only time I'd ever heard that word as it was never used around me by anyone in my family. ""Regardless of my ignorance and age at the time, nothing excuses the fact is that it was hurtful. And for that I am sorry."" Billie Eilish posted an apology on her Instagram Story After the clip spread on social media, many of her fans asked for a response. ""I love you guys, and many of you have been asking me to address this. And this is something I want to address because I'm being labelled something that I am not,"" she said. She also said footage of her imitating accents was her speaking in a ""silly gibberish made up voice"", something she's done since she was a child. ""It is absolute gibberish and just me goofing around, and is in no way an imitation of anyone or any language, accent, or culture in the slightest,"" she added.

"The PM's former top aide told staff to ""immediately"" issue a Â£530,000 grant with ""no procurement"" Dominic Cummings tried to bypass the usual awarding process and fast-track a Â£530,000 government grant at the start of the pandemic, leaked emails suggest. In an email, the PM's ex-top aide told civil servants to ""immediately"" issue the cash with ""no procurement, no lawyers, no meetings, no delay"". Further emails show civil servants had concerns about the timeframe and whether it was in line with the rules. The government said due diligence was followed in awarding the grant. ""We take these checks extremely seriously to ensure our contracts deliver results and value for money,"" the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. The grant was eventually issued to the project Our World in Data, a research project run by a charitable organisation with academics at Oxford University, in four instalments from summer 2020. In response, Mr Cummings wrote on Wednesday on his blog: ""I sent that email because I wanted the problem solved instantly without distracting key people from other aspects of the emergency."" ""I do not regard it as 'damaging' that I tried to throw 'due process' out the window - sticking with 'due process' was killing people,"" he said. Mr Cummings left his role in Downing Street in November 2020. What is going on with government Covid contracts? Dominic Cummings: who is the PM's former adviser? A series of emails detailing discussions of the grant requested by Our World in Data were leaked tothe BBC's File on 4,the Guardian,externalandSource Material,external. They begin with an email sent by the founder of the project, Max Roser, to William Warr, the prime minister's health adviser, who had requested details on the funding it needed. The organisation said it had to retain key members of staff who were generating data on the pandemic. It also wanted to hire extra contractors and needed financial support for the rising costs of servers and technical infrastructure. The request was passed to Health Secretary Matt Hancock and a minute after he received the email he emailed Matthew Gould, the CEO of NHSX - the unit tasked with the NHS' digital transformation - saying he supported the grant. An email from Mr Cummings to Mr Gould followed a couple of hours later, saying: ""Someone please ensure that they have the 530k within 24 hours from now and report back to me it's been sent. ""No procurement, no lawyers, no meetings, no delay please - just send immediately."" Further emails suggested this caused disquiet among the civil servants because of the request to pay out the grant money much faster than was normal. The DHSC's internal guidance, seen by the BBC, says that directly awarding grants without any form of competition is discouraged. But ministers - such as Mr Hancock - have wide-ranging powers to do so. The guidance is also clear that all grants should be subject to a series of timely checks and criteria. It says in some instances grants of more than Â£100,000 should be referred to an advice panel in the Cabinet Office. These safeguards are in place to ensure value for money for taxpayers and to guard against corruption. Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave his support to the grant The following day, Mr Gould said his team could meet the request through the DHSC ""and have the money in place by tomorrow"", but it would mean ""waiving the normal grant-giving process"". ""I don't want to do anything untoward, but given the secretary of state's and Dom Cumming's strong steer I'd really welcome your help/advice/green light,"" he wrote to a colleague. A more junior civil servant responded saying the team needed to make the appropriate checks ""to avoid leaving the accounting officer overly exposed"". Then, more than 24 hours later, the same civil servant suggested possible solutions, setting out the minimum criteria that needed to be met if the grant was to be paid. But he wrote: ""Matthew [Gould], I need your help please to progress this to a point where there is enough air cover to justify a decision to proceed."" Peter Smith, a former government commercial director and former senior adviser to the National Audit Office, said the ""air cover"" reference ""means you're doing something that... is going to go down badly with the media or the public so you need to have some backup, some explanation"". The civil servant's final email said: ""I'm sorry I couldn't just 'make this happen', but I share your concern about doing anything untoward."" In fact, the organisation that had been looking for the money then put the brakes on the application. Our World in Data asked for more time to understand the implications of accepting government money and to consult its trustees. It went on to receive the grant in instalments and the project said it complied with its own procedures. Max Roser, the founder and director of the project, told the BBC a full grant application was submitted on 25 March 2020 and this was followed by an agreement dated 30 April 2020. ""I have no way to know the internal processes inside the government,"" he said. The project said its work had added value in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, with its testing and vaccination data web pages receiving about 65 million visitors. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? A Whitehall source told the BBC they had been instructed not to share information about the grant discussion. ""In my view that's because it is so damaging to the NHSX: Dominic Cummings, Matt Hancockâ¦ everyone is just being very blatant that due process, and procedures, are being thrown out the window,"" the source said. Speaking after being shown the leaked emails, Mr Smith said it was ""quite clear that processes weren't followed"", saying: ""The attempt was to do it so quickly, clearly there was no time to do a proper due diligence."" He said senior people had put colleagues in the DHSC ""into a very difficult position"". ""So I think it was unethical, immoral, really, and yes, it was an abuse of power."" Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project, said: ""The government guidance talks about extra safeguards for sums above Â£100,000. This was well above Â£100,000. ""There was no process that I can see before the decision was made to award this very substantial sum."" The DHSC said: ""Officials carried out due diligence and followed appropriate processes before this grant was awarded. ""Every contract agreed by the government with partners has proper due diligence carried out on it."" Mr Warr has been contacted for comment.

"Andy Berry chose to meet colleagues three miles away from the Manchester Arena A senior firefighter got lost on a ""nightmare journey"" to a meeting point he had suggested after the Manchester Arena attack, an inquiry has heard. About 10 minutes after the bombing, Andy Berry chose to meet colleagues at Philips Park Fire Station, three miles away from the arena. His decision meant crews based in the city centre moved away from the arena. Firefighters eventually took more than two hours to attend the bombing in May 2017, the public inquiry heard. The drive from Mr Berry's home in the Wigan area to Philips Park would normally take 35 minutes with blue lights on but he was ""significantly hampered"" by a number of roadworks and the trip instead lasted 56 minutes. He arrived at the same time as the final living casualty was being evacuated from the City Room foyer, where Salman Abedi detonated his bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds. Arena bomb response hit by communication breakdown Bomb victims were failed on all levels, family says Stewards used makeshift items to help bomb victims Mr Berry agreed when counsel to the inquiry Paul Greaney QC asked him: ""The satnav took you along a number of winding country roads?"" Mr Greaney also asked: ""You didn't really have the faintest idea where you were?"" The witness said: ""I didn't."" The barrister went on: ""And you just had to trust in your satnav?"" Mr Berry said: ""I did."" The firefighter agreed the circumstances were not ""likely to aid dynamic decision-making"". Twenty-two people were killed in the May 2017 bombing Mr Berry was performing the tactical role of duty national inter-agency liaison officer on the night, with responsibilities including giving advice to his commanders and other agencies. The inquiry heard during his journey, he repeatedly tried without success to contact Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) force duty officer, the initial commander of the incident, and also took calls from colleagues as he told them about his ""nightmare journey"". Mr Greaney said North West Fire Control rang Mr Berry at 22:57 BST, by which time it had been informed that GMP officers were on the scene, along with an ambulance service commander, and that the injuries looked like shrapnel wounds rather than from gunshots, but the information was not passed on to him. Asked what he would done then if he had that information, Mr Berry said: ""Well, we would have quite clearly deployed probably straight to the arena, proceeding with caution."" Mr Berry also agreed that had he remained at home, where he had access to work logs on his computer, he would have gained earlier situational awareness and again deployed to the scene earlier. The inquiry was told that updates from the scene at about 23:00 from the British Transport Police and the first paramedic to enter the City Room also did not reach Mr Berry. Mr Greaney put it to Mr Berry that an ""extraordinary feature"" of what went wrong on the night was that he and senior colleagues lacked situational awareness but firefighters waiting on the ground at Philips Park knew what was happening. He said: ""Is it fair to say this is an extraordinary state of affairs that the troops on the ground have situational awareness, that's why they are so desperate to get there, and the bosses don't?"" Mr Berry replied: ""We were all desperate to get there and all frustrated on the night. That information was never shared with me."" The inquiry continues.

"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is the only candidate for the DUP leadership after nominations closed at midday on Tuesday Sir Jeffrey Donaldson isthe only candidate to succeed Edwin Pootsas Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader. Edwin Poots announced his resignation last week after an internal party revolt, leaving the DUP looking for a third leader in a matter of weeks. The crisis has raised questions about the stability of the Stormont assembly and devolution in Northern Ireland. Sir Jeffrey's name will go forward to the party's electoral college, which is expected to meet on Saturday. Following that meeting of the party's eight MPs and 27 members of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLAs), the Lagan Valley MP's leadership will have to be ratified at a meeting of the DUP executive, which is set to take place next week. He would become the party's fifth leader in its 50-year history, and its third in 50 days. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks back at the six weeks that led to Edwin Poots being elected and then resigning as leader of the DUP Sir Jeffrey said he had the vision ""to unite Northern Ireland and heal the divisions of the past"". He accepted the task was great, but added: ""The overwhelming majority of people who live here want Northern Ireland to keep moving forward."" He had previously said he would leave his Westminster seat to run for the Stormont assembly so he could be Northern Ireland's first minister as well as his party's leader. Such a move would mean a by-election in his Lagan Valley constituency. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson will need to get his political ducks in a row to find a path from Westminster to Belfast. The clearest way is through the co-option process, which allows a party to replace an assembly member without a by-election, although it remains to be seen which constituency he would target. There is no sign that the two DUP MLAs in his political power-base of Lagan Valley - Paul Givan and Edwin Poots - will be stepping down any time soon. The only obvious vacancy coming up in the near future is in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the political home of Arlene Foster. DUP chairman Lord Morrow said mistakes had been made in a difficult few weeks for the party, and called on its members to ""move forward in a spirit of humility and mindful that our focus must be on serving the people"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he looked forward to working with Sir Jeffrey and the Stormont executive to ""deliver on the shared interests of all the people of Northern Ireland"". Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin congratulated the soon-to-be DUP leader on Twitter, writing that he had ""worked with Jeffrey over many years in various roles and look forward to working constructively with him in the very important time ahead"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald tweeted that she would meet Sir Jeffrey ""early next week"" after they both spoke on Tuesday evening. Allow Twitter content?

Sir Jeffrey has said his first priority was dealing with the post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland, known as the protocol. The mechanism, which was part of the UK-EU Brexit deal, keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, ensuring free trade across the Irish border. However, it has placed additional restrictions on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, prompting unionists to complain of there being an Irish Sea border. Likely plotlines if Donaldson writes DUP script Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? On Tuesday, Sir Jeffrey said he wanted to speak to the prime minister about the protocol as soon as possible, and that he would tell Boris Johnson it was not realistic to expect stability ""when every unionist representative in the devolved institutions opposes the Northern Ireland Protocol"". ""The government and those who claim to be protectors of peace and stability must step up and deal with the protocol in a manner which respects the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom,"" he added. Edwin Poots says a section of the DUP struggled to accept his leadership The leadership vacancy arose when Mr Poots resigned after just 21 days in the position he took over from Arlene Foster. He had defeated Sir Jeffrey in the party's first leadership election on 14 Mayby 19 votes to 17. He quit having lost the support of party colleagues as he pursued a deal with Sinn FÃ©in and the UK government over provisions for Irish language legislation. Sinn FÃ©in had made clear it would only re-nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister if the party secured a guarantee that language legislation agreed in theNew Decade New Approach Dealin 2020, which restored power-sharing, would be implemented. Due to the power-sharing nature of the Stormont assembly, a refusal by Sinn FÃ©in to nominate would have crashed the Northern Ireland Executive and prompted a snap election. Paul Givan looks set to be the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland A continued impasse could have led to a suspension of devolution. Having not received the backing of DUP MPs and MLAs over a deal to resolve the issue brokered by Mr Lewis, a majority of them opposed his plans to nominate Paul Givan as first ministerin an internal revolt at a party meetinglast Thursday. Mr Poots announced his resignation later that day. ""There was a section in the party that struggled to accept that I won the election,""he told Sky News on Monday. ""In terms of the support I received, it didn't come from people that it should have and that's just a reality that everybody knows."" Sir Jeffrey, born in Kilkeel, County Down, became politically active as a constituency agent for the South Down MP Enoch Powell (above, left) in the mid-1980s before working as a personal assistant to the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader James Molyneaux. After James Molyneaux retired as an MP in 1997, Sir Jeffrey was voted as his successor as MP for Lagan Valley, retaining the seat through six subsequent elections. He is a member of the Orange Order and also served as a corporal in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during the Troubles. In 2003, following long-standing opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and the leadership of David Trimble, he announced he would leave the UUP, later joining the DUP, along with Arlene Foster and Norah Beare. He was appointed to the Privy Council, a body which advises the monarchy, in 2007 and stood down as an MLA for Lagan Valley in 2010. He was awarded a knighthood in 2016 for political service. Sir Jeffrey was defeated by 19 votes to 17 in the DUP leadership election to succeed Arlene Foster in May. Read more:Who is the man set to be the DUP's new leader?

Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent It was well trailed and no surprise to see
the first minister retain the same restriction levels in Scotland.  We are on an upward curve of infections, a 40% increase on last week,
with cases at their highest point since late January. This wave, driven by the Delta variant
started in early May, but the positive news is that seven weeks on it has not
caused a big surge in the number of Covid patients in hospital.  They are
going up, but not nearly as fast as they were earlier in the year.  Experts
want this time to push forward with the vaccination programme and to gather
more data on just how well they are working. Vaccines look set to get us through this

Scotland's National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch highlights the two publications alluded to by the first minister in her statement. Question from Mike in Germany Mike has been in touch from Germany to ask if he can visit his holiday home in the Highlands. At the moment it is possible but he should be prepared for a longer and more expensive stay than normal. Germany is currently on the Scottish government'samber list,external. As a result visitors must complete apassenger locator form,externaland take aCovid test,externalbefore flying. Mike would also be required to book and pay Â£170 for a day two and day eighttravel test,external. Free NHS or private kits cannot be used. Once he arrives in Scotland he must isolate at his home for 10 days, during which time he must take the tests. Although Mike has been fully vaccinated the rules on managed quarantine and self-isolation still apply as it is not yet known if vaccines prevent people from spreading the virus. Willie Rennie raises the challenges faced by families with adults with special needs. The Scottish Lib Dem leader asks when the day services for adults with special needs will be reinstated. He then points out that thousands of fans went to London to see the Scotland v England game and received few words of criticism from the first minister. The first minister replies she could not have been clearer that she advised against travelling to London without a ticket and for people to follow the rules. Ms Sturgeon adds that services for adults with learning disabilities can reopen and councils must consider how they can safely reopen. Question from John in Glasgow John in Glasgow has asked BBC Scotland when staff will return to the office. By 9 August the vast majority of over 40s will have a significant level of protection. Despite this the first minister confirms she will not advise an
immediate return to full office working on that date. Instead the Scottish government will continue to work
with business to agree an appropriate phasing of this. This process will get under way when the country enters level zero next month. The pandemic has changed the way almost everyone does their job and Ms Sturgeon says she hopes home-working will be more possible post-Covid
than it was before. She adds: ""This wonât just assist with control
of the virus, it will also help promote well-being more generally."" Ms Sturgeon says vaccinations have changed the balance of the pandemic. She says the Scottish government wants to see testing and vaccines progressively reduce restrictions domestically and on travel in and out of the country, in response to Patrick Harvie's question. We have to be satisfied there is a degree of effectiveness. We will consider if testing in future, coupled with vaccination, can lead to a different approach to self isolation, particularly for contacts of positive cases. We need to look at all these things carefully before coming to final decisions but all of these things are under active consideration. Nicola Sturgeon, FM Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie asks if the Scottish government is open to what UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock is proposing - to end the requirement for international travel quarantine for vaccinated people or to end self isolation and replace it with lateral flow testing. However, the move has been criticised by public health experts. He asks if Ms Sturgeon agrees this would ""almost guarantee"" that new variants were imported and would then spread. Question from Calum in Golspie Calum from Golspie has been in touch to ask when Scotland will move into level zero. The first minister had previously indicated this would happen on 28 June. But in recent weeks rising case numbers, driven by the new faster transmitting Delta variant, has forced a rethink. Nicola Sturgeon has now confirmed the current levels will remain in place until 19 July - the day after all adults will have had their first
dose. From that date it is hoped all parts of the country will move to level zero. Ms Sturgeon cautioned that this milestone will depend on the data and Scotland meeting its vaccination targets. Anas Sarwar says: ""We must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown."" The Scottish Labour leader tells the chamber there must be effective communication and effective decision-making, adding ""that has frayed in recent weeks"". He calls for a commitment that if vaccine supplies allow, the speed of delivery can be ramped up. The Scottish Labour leader asks if there are still Covid hot spots and calls for the publication of hot spot protocols. He also calls for clearer protocols around financial support. The first minister replies intensive work on these issues is continuing. She says if supplies allow, the vaccination programme will be accelerated and that the finance secretary will continue to work with businesses to ensure financial support is accessed. In response to Douglas Ross' question, the first minister says most changes to weddings will hopefully come after 19 July when the limit is expected to be increased to 200. Nicola Sturgeon says she hopes that as we go to level 0 physical distancing will go from 2m to 1m - it is already 1m in hospitality. She says she hopes to remove the legal physical distancing constraints outdoors completely at that point and that from 9 August the legal requirement can be removed indoors, as long as we have gone beyond level 0. But some people may be advised to continue to keep to a safe distance. She says it may be that in some settings, such as schools, masks may still need to be worn for a bit longer. Question from Heather in Perth and Kinross Many people will be planning garden parties this weekend but restrictions on outdoor numbers remain in place. Perth and Kinross is currently in level one which means only a maximum of 12 people from 12 households are allowed to meet in a garden or public place. Under 12s do not count towards the total for outdoor meetings so unless Heather's party includes a dozen children then it would be a breach of the rules. Level zero would have seen the limit increase to 15 people from 15 households. But on Tuesday the first minister confirmed social gatherings of any size will now be allowed under level zero due to the ""reduced risk of outdoor transmission"". Leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, expresses his condolences for everyone that has lost a loved one to Covid-19. He says it is a shame the changes to weddings and funerals are only being made now - too late for many people. He asks the first minister if mitigations after 9 August include social distancing, particularly at hospitality venues, if limits will remain on indoor social gatherings and if the mitigations will include the wearing of masks in offices and schools? Question from David in Largs David from Largs emailed to ask why the first minister is proposing a move to level zero from 19 July when daily case numbers are soaring. Nicola Sturgeon said the timetable is based on evidence that the link between new
cases and serious health harm is weakening. The number of people being admitted to hospital with
Covid has fallen from around 10% of reported positive cases at the start of the
year, to around 5% now. Covid patients are also, on average, spending less time
in hospital. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs: ""Overall, the evidence that
vaccination is helping protect people from serious health harms is allowing us
to change how we respond to the virus."" Some changes to the rules on weddings and funerals will take effect from Monday 28 June. The changes will mean that suppliers of wedding
services, and other people employed by the couple getting married, will no
longer count towards the cap on numbers at a wedding. And those accompanying the wedding
couple down the aisle will no longer need to wear face coverings. Live entertainment at receptions
will be possible - although people will still need to be seated at tables. The guidance for
funerals will change from next week so that people from more than one household can help carry a coffin,
and take a cord when lowering it. Further changes should come on 19 July if Scotland goes to level 0. That would mean up to
200 people will be able to attend weddings and funerals. The first minister begins by confirming ""no part of
the country will change level next week"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999989

"White working class pupils have been failed by decades of neglect in England's education system, a report by MPs says. The Education Select Committee accused the government of a lack of targeted support for disadvantaged white pupils. It says use of the term ""white privilege"", suggesting white pupils are at an advantage, is the ""opposite"" of the reality for poor white pupils. The government says it is committed to making sure no child is left behind. The report warns that white pupils on free school meals underachieve from early years in school through to GCSE, A-levels and university entry, compared with pupils on free meals from other ethnic groups. Committee chairman Robert Halfon said it was a ""major social injustice"" that so little had been done to address this gap in attainment - and accused the government of ""muddled thinking"" in suggesting it could be explained by poverty. ""If you think it's about poverty, then it doesn't explain why most other ethnic groups do much better,"" he said. Poorer white pupils are falling behind ""every step of the way"", he warned, and with almost a million young people being affected, it could not be ""swept under the carpet"". At GCSE, in 2019, 18% of white British pupils on free meals achieved grade 5 in English and maths, compared with 23% for the average for pupils on free meals For university entry, 16% of white British pupils on free meals get places, compared with 59% of black African pupils on free meals, 59% of Bangladeshi pupils on free meals and 32% of black Caribbean pupils on free meals. The places where people live and their local challenges were part of the bigger picture of achievement, MPs reported Mr Halfon warned against using the term ""white privilege"" in education, saying it was divisive and likely to ""promote disharmony"" and ""pits one group against another"". The committee described white privilege, which has been used in a wider social context, as the idea of ""societal privilege that benefits white people over other ethnic groups"". The committee said that in education ""privilege is the very opposite to what disadvantaged white children"" experience - and questioned whether under equality legislation schools should use that terminology. But a Labour MP on the committee, Kim Johnson, rejected the reference to white privilege as a red herring which was trying to ""stoke the culture war"" and avoid scrutiny of the ""lack of investment"" in schools and local communities. The report highlighted a mix of challenges about the local areas where many poor white pupils lived - and also ""cultural factors"" that could limit how much support they got from their families. These underlying social problems included: Poor local jobs market and lack of opportunity Lack of community assets and social organisations, poor local services and transport Families with ""multi-generational poverty"" Disengaged parents with a poor experience of education In response, the committee proposed more targeted funding and making the education system feel more relevant for these communities. Using pupil premium funding to provide more support ""Family hubs"" to get parents involved with children's learning Attract teachers to areas that can struggle to retain staff Ensure that work-related, vocational education is available ""Find a better way to talk about racial disparities"" Oliver is planning to go to university - and warns about stereotypes being created about white working class teenagers ""There's this nagging feeling that it's not for me,"" says 18-year-old Oliver Jones-Lyons, describing the ""suspicions"" about the value of education that he thinks hold back some white working class communities. He has been a pupil on free meals at a school near Newcastle and says there is still a concern about the education system harbouring snobbery and class prejudice, even down to stereotypes about regional accents which ""mark you out as different"". There's an inclination to turn away from exams and instead say ""my dad can get us a job"". ""There's a lack of explanation of how education is helping you,"" Oliver says. But he argues ""the biggest barriers to education are outside education"" - in places with limited job opportunities, bad housing, poor public transport and families not able to support their children in school. And he says that while he describes himself as a ""white working class boy"" he doesn't like the way that the label is being used to ""create more stereotypes"". ""It shouldn't be about putting people against each other"" or about ""culture wars"", he says, and rejects the white working class identity being caricatured as being bigoted or narrow minded. A better description would be people ""more likely to undersell ourselves"" and to dislike showing off, says Oliver. But his own ambition has been supported by working with the Social Mobility Foundation charity - and he is waiting to see if he gets the A-levels grades needed to get into Oxford University next year. The underachievement is down to a ""poisonous mix of place, family and local culture"", said Chris Zarraga, director of Schools North East, a regional network of head teachers in one of the areas with the biggest concentrations of disadvantaged white pupils. He said it meant tackling the consequences of ""long-term deprivation"", where there might be fifth and sixth generations of workless families. What is 'white privilege'? White working class boys least likely to go to university The left-behind towns with lowest university take-up Half of universities have fewer than 5% disadvantaged white students ""Schools can't do it alone,"" he said, warning that already the pandemic had seen schools having to cope with feeding and clothing pupils. ""We need a cross-party sense of urgency about solving these problems,"" he said. Mr Zarraga backed the targeted use of pupil premium funding and called for better ways of retaining teaching staff in the most challenging areas. Kerry would like her sons to be able to go to college and get an apprenticeship The report argues that vocational routes in education need to be clearly available - showing the connection between qualifications and work. This chimes with the concerns of Kerry, a mother in Mansfield who is thinking about what jobs will be available for her sons, Bailey and Finley, in the years ahead. Her own parents stepped from school into factory work, which she says offered secure jobs. The current world of employment seems more precarious, she says. ""I don't see good jobs arising, I don't think there's much opportunity out there,"" says Kerry. ""I want them to go to college, then get apprenticeships."" The aim is ""guaranteed work"" and she is worried about the cost of university. ""As a parent, I wouldn't be able to fund them to go,"" Kerry adds. Without tackling the underachievement of white working class pupils the wider aim of narrowing the attainment gap between rich and poor will fail, warned former Ofsted chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw ""Two thirds of children on free school meals live in these communities. We will never reduce educational inequality unless we urgently address this longstanding issue,"" he said. Labour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the MPs' report showed the Conservative Party has ""turned its back on these pupils who need most support, from knowingly underfunded free childcare places in early years to cutting the pupil premium"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""This government is focused on levelling up opportunity so that no young person is left behind. ""That's why we are providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade,"" added the DfE spokesman, with Â£3bn in recovery funding and existing plans to increase school budgets. ""The pupil premium is expected to increase to more than Â£2.5bn this year, through which schools can support pupils with extra teaching, academic support or activities like breakfast clubs or educational trips.""

"Having a coil fitted should not be traumatic or very painful, say experts. Their comments came after BBC Radio 5 Live's Naga Munchetty shared her experience, prompting many to recount their own stories of painful coil fittings. Most people encounter no problems, and no-one should be put off considering this safe and effective contraceptive, medics say. But they say pain relief should be ""part of the discussion"". Options available include a fast-acting anaesthetic spray. Munchetty said she felt violated and angry about her fitting a few years ago, which caused her ""excruciating pain"". It resonated with other women who have contacted the BBC with similar stories. This video can not be played Naga Munchetty: ""The nurse had tears in her eyes... I fainted twice"" Naomi (not her real name) is 26 and from London. She went for a coil, or intrauterine device (IUD), fitting a couple of months ago but had to stop the procedure when it became too painful. ""I didn't have the coil fitted in the end. ""My doctor was very kind and understanding and told me at the beginning we could stop at any point so when the pain became so bad I did ask to stop. However, if she hadn't said that to me before I don't know if I would have felt comfortable asking her to stop. ""The clinic had explained the procedure to me and I had taken some paracetamol to help with any discomfort. But I feel like the pain was massively downplayed to me beforehand. ""For me, it was quite a big deal and quite traumatising."" She says it helps knowing that her experience isn't unique. ""I'm very glad to hear that other women have had similar experiences to this because I felt a bit pathetic and a failure afterwards since I couldn't go through with it."" Some women who got in touch described feeling ""shocked"" or ""in agony"" during their IUD fitting, but others said they had had a good experience. And there was concern that discussing the issue could put women off using what is a very effective, and for many, convenient contraceptive. An IUD can be put into the womb to prevent a pregnancy It immediately protects against pregnancy and is 99% effective It can remain in place for years Fertility can return to normal as soon as it is removed But Unlike condoms, it doesn't prevent sexually transmitted infections Periods may be heavier, more painful or last longer There is a small risk of infection or it might not stay in place correctly Contraception: Which is most effective? Which method of contraception suits me?,external Dr Louise Massey, of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, who also runs a clinic helping women for whom it can be difficult to fit a coil, said: ""There is, understandably going to be some discomfort with the procedure, but it should not be overwhelming. ""I ask people to rate their discomfort on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst pain they could ever have. ""Most give it a two or three on that scale."" An IUD fitting/removal takes about five minutes (although the appointment will be longer) A speculum (a smooth, tube-shaped tool) is inserted into the vagina so neck of the womb (cervix) can be seen The IUD is inserted through the small opening of the cervix, into the womb Some people will experience cramping similar or sometimes more intense than menstrual pain. Dr Massey says the procedure can always be stopped if there is too much pain, discomfort or distress. ""It is always an option to abandon it. ""It can even be done under general anaesthetic if necessary and appropriate."" Dr Hannat Akintomide is a specialty doctor in sexual reproductive health with the Newcastle Upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust. She says for the vast majority of women, getting a coil is not painful or traumatic. And while offering pain relief or analgesia used to be somewhat hit and miss, the situation has massively improved in recent years, she says. Sheconducted a study,externalnearly a decade ago with 129 healthcare professionals to raise awareness about the issue. At that time, one-quarter of the practitioners said they routinely used local anaesthetic for IUD insertion. Another quarter said they never, or rarely, offered it. The rest said they did sometimes. Dr Akintomide said: ""I felt it was appalling that we were not doing something so simple that could improve their experience."" She says women should discuss any fears and concerns about the procedure with their healthcare provider, who can provide appropriate pain relief or analgesia. ""The options available are expanding."" That includes: Local anaesthetic gel Fast-acting local anaesthetic spray An injection of local anaesthetic Painkillers, such as ibuprofen, taken an hour or two before the procedure Dr Akintomide says it should be down to personal choice: ""Injectable local anaesthetic, the sound of it for many women, you know, is repulsive. They wouldn't imaging having an injection down below. ""But now we also have the local anaesthetic spray and the advantage is it doesn't involve a needle, it's quick acting - for many people it's immediate and, at most, three to five minutes to take effect - so you do have those options."" The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health says what clinics offer can vary - some recommend anaesthetic for the procedure while others may not. Women are often advised to take painkillers beforehand. Facultyguidelines,externalsay medication may ease the process, although there is ""no evidence"" from clinical trials to support the use of topical anaesthetic gels. ""Local anaesthetic block administered by cervical injection is not routinely required,"" they say. It should be offered for difficult IUD insertions or removals, the guidelines say. Lou Brack, head of nursing at Brook, the sexual health and wellbeing service for young people, said: ""It's all about listening and responding to everyone's individual needs. Many people who have an IUD procedure find they don't require pain relief, but we make sure it is available for those who do, so that they can benefit from an IUD without any unnecessary pain and distress.""

"Scotland is aiming to remove all of its major legal Covid restrictions in early August, the country's first minister has announced. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed lockdown easing would be paused for three weeks to allow more time for people to be vaccinated. It means mainland areas will not move to the lowest level zero restrictions until 19 July. The hope is that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August. Ms Sturgeon said this would allow life in Scotland to return to ""almost complete normality"". But the government will not advise an immediate return to full office working on that date - and people will still be required to wear face masks in some settings. Live: Latest from Nicola Sturgeon's Holyrood statement What happens after Scotland's Covid 'pause'? What Covid rules are changing, and when? Scotland recorded 2,167 new cases on Monday - the highest daily total since the peak of the second wave in January - with the country said to have had the highest rate in Europe last week The percentage of Covid-19 tests coming back positive rose to 9.1%, up from 7.2% the previous day, and the deaths of a further four people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded. The UK as a whole recorded 11,625 new cases and 27 deaths in the past 24 hours. The new daily case rate in Scotland is seven times higher than it was in early May and 40% higher than last week, with Ms Sturgeon saying the faster-transmitting Delta variant is ""now dominant"". But the first minister said the vaccination programme was breaking the link between the number of positive cases and the number of people being hospitalised and dying. The government's original ""route map"" out of lockdown would have seen the whole of Scotland move to level zero - the lowest point in the five-tier system of restrictions - from next Monday. This has now been pushed back to 19 July - the same date as measures are planned to be lifted in England. Island communities such as Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero, with all mainland areas in level one or level two of the country's five-tier system of restrictions. Some ""minor"" changes will be phased in sooner - removing staff and suppliers of wedding services from the cap on numbers at services from Monday and allowing live entertainment at receptions, and allowing people from more than one household to help carry a coffin at a funeral. The move to level zero will increase the number of people who are allowed to meet up indoors, cut the requirement for physical distancing indoors from 2m (6.5ft) to 1m (3.2ft), and increase the number of people allowed to attend wedding and funerals to 200. Ms Sturgeon said this would be a ""significant step back to normality"", but said she wanted to move beyond level zero ""as quickly as it is prudent to do so"". She said the ""major remaining legal restrictions"" could be lifted from 9 August, signalling a ""return to almost complete normality in our day to day lives"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""We will consider and make a final assessment nearer the time of whether - as we hope - this could include the lifting of the legal requirement to physically distance indoors as well as outdoors."" However she warned that some measures, including the use of face coverings in shops and on public transport and ""rigorous and regular hand-washing"" would be needed ""at least for a period"". And the first minister said there should be ""appropriate phasing"" of the return of workers to offices after 9 August, saying the government would ""encourage continued support for home working where it is possible"". The first minister has always said that Covid restrictions would be driven by the data, not by dates. But Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland can expect to be in level zero from 19 July,  and that all major legal restrictions could be lifted from 9 August. Looking at the raw data, this might seem surprising.  There are 154 new coronavirus cases a day in Scotland per 100,000 people. That's almost twenty more than the daily rate on Boxing Day, when the country went into another lockdown. The difference is the vaccine, which has dramatically reduced the consequences of catching coronavirus. Fewer people are now dying from Covid, down from an average of 31 a day in December to less than 2 a day now. That's why the Scottish government can look forward to a date when it can relax restrictions instead of imposing them. The changes are dependent on case levels being suppressed and targets being hit in the vaccination programme. All adults in Scotland will have had at least one dose of a vaccine by 18 July, with everyone in the 40-49 age group due to have had both doses by a week later. By 20 August, all 30 to 39-year-olds will have had a second dose, with everyone over the age of 18 due to have had two doses by 12 September. More than 2.6 million people in Scotland have had both doses of a vaccine Ms Sturgeon faced questions on her statement from opposition leaders at Holyrood - where MSPs are due to debate an extension of emergency powers into 2022. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed progress with the vaccination programme and that ""we have more of an indication of when we will be free from restrictions"". He pressed Ms Sturgeon for more detail about what measures would continue after 9 August, including whether masks would still be required in offices and schools. Ms Sturgeon said the legal requirement for physical distancing could be removed at that point, but that in some settings - such as schools - masks may need to be worn for a bit longer. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said ""we must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown"", calling for clearer messaging and protocols around financial support.

No more talk of eliminating the virus, the aim now is supress it enough so it
will ""alleviate its harms"". This is a recognition that vaccines are
working well to prevent serious illness and while coronavirus is likely to put
additional strain on the NHS, it is not likely to result in it being
overwhelmed. It does mean difficult decisions will have
to be made on what is an acceptable level of Covid to live with.  Schools
for example, may be about to break up for the summer, but will they no longer
face interruptions if there are outbreaks when they return in the autumn? There is still plenty of uncertainty,
particularly around what the emergence of other variants might bring, and the first minister has left some room to pull back if required Allow Twitter content?

Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent It was well trailed and no surprise to see
the first minister retain the same restriction levels in Scotland.  We are on an upward curve of infections, a 40% increase on last week,
with cases at their highest point since late January. This wave, driven by the Delta variant
started in early May, but the positive news is that seven weeks on it has not
caused a big surge in the number of Covid patients in hospital.  They are
going up, but not nearly as fast as they were earlier in the year.  Experts
want this time to push forward with the vaccination programme and to gather
more data on just how well they are working. Vaccines look set to get us through this
wave without stretching the NHS and scientists are already working on
boosters.  But their success also poses a more difficult question for the
future around what are acceptable levels of Covid to live with? C'mon Scotland. During her statement the first minister wished Steve Clarke and the Scottish team all the best this evening. ""Tonightâs game is massive - we will all be cheering
Scotland on. But please do it safely,"" urged the first minister. You can followthe build up to tonight's crucial game against Croatia here. The crowd capacity at Wembley will be increased to more than 60,000 for the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020, says the UK government. It means the stadium will be at 75% capacity for the games.

Scotland's National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch highlights the two publications alluded to by the first minister in her statement. Question from Mike in Germany Mike has been in touch from Germany to ask if he can visit his holiday home in the Highlands. At the moment it is possible but he should be prepared for a longer and more expensive stay than normal. Germany is currently on the Scottish government'samber list,external. As a result visitors must complete apassenger locator form,externaland take aCovid test,externalbefore flying. Mike would also be required to book and pay Â£170 for a day two and day eighttravel test,external. Free NHS or private kits cannot be used. Once he arrives in Scotland he must isolate at his home for 10 days, during which time he must take the tests. Although Mike has been fully vaccinated the rules on managed quarantine and self-isolation still apply as it is not yet known if vaccines prevent people from spreading the virus. Willie Rennie raises the challenges faced by families with adults with special needs. The Scottish Lib Dem leader asks when the day services for adults with special needs will be reinstated. He then points out that thousands of fans went to London to see the Scotland v England game and received few words of criticism from the first minister. The first minister replies she could not have been clearer that she advised against travelling to London without a ticket and for people to follow the rules. Ms Sturgeon adds that services for adults with learning disabilities can reopen and councils must consider how they can safely reopen. Question from John in Glasgow John in Glasgow has asked BBC Scotland when staff will return to the office. By 9 August the vast majority of over 40s will have a significant level of protection. Despite this the first minister confirms she will not advise an
immediate return to full office working on that date. Instead the Scottish government will continue to work
with business to agree an appropriate phasing of this. This process will get under way when the country enters level zero next month. The pandemic has changed the way almost everyone does their job and Ms Sturgeon says she hopes home-working will be more possible post-Covid
than it was before. She adds: ""This wonât just assist with control
of the virus, it will also help promote well-being more generally."" Ms Sturgeon says vaccinations have changed the balance of the pandemic. She says the Scottish government wants to see testing and vaccines progressively reduce restrictions domestically and on travel in and out of the country, in response to Patrick Harvie's question. We have to be satisfied there is a degree of effectiveness. We will consider if testing in future, coupled with vaccination, can lead to a different approach to self isolation, particularly for contacts of positive cases. We need to look at all these things carefully before coming to final decisions but all of these things are under active consideration. Nicola Sturgeon, FM Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie asks if the Scottish government is open to what UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock is proposing - to end the requirement for international travel quarantine for vaccinated people or to end self isolation and replace it with lateral flow testing. However, the move has been criticised by public health experts. He asks if Ms Sturgeon agrees this would ""almost guarantee"" that new variants were imported and would then spread. Question from Calum in Golspie Calum from Golspie has been in touch to ask when Scotland will move into level zero. The first minister had previously indicated this would happen on 28 June. But in recent weeks rising case numbers, driven by the new faster transmitting Delta variant, has forced a rethink. Nicola Sturgeon has now confirmed the current levels will remain in place until 19 July - the day after all adults will have had their first
dose. From that date it is hoped all parts of the country will move to level zero. Ms Sturgeon cautioned that this milestone will depend on the data and Scotland meeting its vaccination targets. Anas Sarwar says: ""We must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown."" The Scottish Labour leader tells the chamber there must be effective communication and effective decision-making, adding ""that has frayed in recent weeks"". He calls for a commitment that if vaccine supplies allow, the speed of delivery can be ramped up. The Scottish Labour leader asks if there are still Covid hot spots and calls for the publication of hot spot protocols. He also calls for clearer protocols around financial support. The first minister replies intensive work on these issues is continuing. She says if supplies allow, the vaccination programme will be accelerated and that the finance secretary will continue to work with businesses to ensure financial support is accessed. In response to Douglas Ross' question, the first minister says most changes to weddings will hopefully come after 19 July when the limit is expected to be increased to 200. Nicola Sturgeon says she hopes that as we go to level 0 physical distancing will go from 2m to 1m - it is already 1m in hospitality. She says she hopes to remove the legal physical distancing constraints outdoors completely at that point and that from 9 August the legal requirement can be removed indoors, as long as we have gone beyond level 0. But some people may be advised to continue to keep to a safe distance. She says it may be that in some settings, such as schools, masks may still need to be worn for a bit longer. Question from Heather in Perth and Kinross Many people will be planning garden parties this weekend but restrictions on outdoor numbers remain in place. Perth and Kinross is currently in level one which means only a maximum of 12 people from 12 households are allowed to meet in a garden or public place. Under 12s do not count towards the total for outdoor meetings so unless Heather's party includes a dozen children then it would be a breach of the rules. Level zero would have seen the limit increase to 15 people from 15 households. But on Tuesday the first minister confirmed social gatherings of any size will now be allowed under level zero due to the ""reduced risk of outdoor transmission"". Leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, expresses his condolences for everyone that has lost a loved one to Covid-19. He says it is a shame the changes to weddings and funerals are only being made now - too late for many people. He asks the first minister if mitigations after 9 August include social distancing, particularly at hospitality venues, if limits will remain on indoor social gatherings and if the mitigations will include the wearing of masks in offices and schools? Question from David in Largs David from Largs emailed to ask why the first minister is proposing a move to level zero from 19 July when daily case numbers are soaring. Nicola Sturgeon said the timetable is based on evidence that the link between new
cases and serious health harm is weakening. The number of people being admitted to hospital with
Covid has fallen from around 10% of reported positive cases at the start of the
year, to around 5% now. Covid patients are also, on average, spending less time
in hospital. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs: ""Overall, the evidence that
vaccination is helping protect people from serious health harms is allowing us
to change how we respond to the virus."" Some changes to the rules on weddings and funerals will take effect from Monday 28 June. The changes will mean that suppliers of wedding
services, and other people employed by the couple getting married, will no
longer count towards the cap on numbers at a wedding. And those accompanying the wedding
couple down the aisle will no longer need to wear face coverings. Live entertainment at receptions
will be possible - although people will still need to be seated at tables. The guidance for
funerals will change from next week so that people from more than one household can help carry a coffin,
and take a cord when lowering it. Further changes should come on 19 July if Scotland goes to level 0. That would mean up to
200 people will be able to attend weddings and funerals. The first minister begins by confirming ""no part of
the country will change level next week"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,9.5352974e-05

going up, but not nearly as fast as they were earlier in the year.  Experts
want this time to push forward with the vaccination programme and to gather
more data on just how well they are working. Vaccines look set to get us through this
wave without stretching the NHS and scientists are already working on
boosters.  But their success also poses a more difficult question for the
future around what are acceptable levels of Covid to live with? C'mon Scotland. During her statement the first minister wished Steve Clarke and the Scottish team all the best this evening. ""Tonightâs game is massive - we will all be cheering
Scotland on. But please do it safely,"" urged the first minister. You can followthe build up to tonight's crucial game against Croatia here. The crowd capacity at Wembley will be increased to more than 60,000 for the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020, says the UK government. It means the stadium will be at 75% capacity for the games.

Scotland's National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch highlights the two publications alluded to by the first minister in her statement. Question from Mike in Germany Mike has been in touch from Germany to ask if he can visit his holiday home in the Highlands. At the moment it is possible but he should be prepared for a longer and more expensive stay than normal. Germany is currently on the Scottish government'samber list,external. As a result visitors must complete apassenger locator form,externaland take aCovid test,externalbefore flying. Mike would also be required to book and pay Â£170 for a day two and day eighttravel test,external. Free NHS or private kits cannot be used. Once he arrives in Scotland he must isolate at his home for 10 days, during which time he must take the tests. Although Mike has been fully vaccinated the rules on managed quarantine and self-isolation still apply as it is not yet known if vaccines prevent people from spreading the virus. Willie Rennie raises the challenges faced by families with adults with special needs. The Scottish Lib Dem leader asks when the day services for adults with special needs will be reinstated. He then points out that thousands of fans went to London to see the Scotland v England game and received few words of criticism from the first minister. The first minister replies she could not have been clearer that she advised against travelling to London without a ticket and for people to follow the rules. Ms Sturgeon adds that services for adults with learning disabilities can reopen and councils must consider how they can safely reopen. Question from John in Glasgow John in Glasgow has asked BBC Scotland when staff will return to the office. By 9 August the vast majority of over 40s will have a significant level of protection. Despite this the first minister confirms she will not advise an
immediate return to full office working on that date. Instead the Scottish government will continue to work
with business to agree an appropriate phasing of this. This process will get under way when the country enters level zero next month. The pandemic has changed the way almost everyone does their job and Ms Sturgeon says she hopes home-working will be more possible post-Covid
than it was before. She adds: ""This wonât just assist with control
of the virus, it will also help promote well-being more generally."" Ms Sturgeon says vaccinations have changed the balance of the pandemic. She says the Scottish government wants to see testing and vaccines progressively reduce restrictions domestically and on travel in and out of the country, in response to Patrick Harvie's question. We have to be satisfied there is a degree of effectiveness. We will consider if testing in future, coupled with vaccination, can lead to a different approach to self isolation, particularly for contacts of positive cases. We need to look at all these things carefully before coming to final decisions but all of these things are under active consideration. Nicola Sturgeon, FM Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie asks if the Scottish government is open to what UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock is proposing - to end the requirement for international travel quarantine for vaccinated people or to end self isolation and replace it with lateral flow testing. However, the move has been criticised by public health experts. He asks if Ms Sturgeon agrees this would ""almost guarantee"" that new variants were imported and would then spread. Question from Calum in Golspie Calum from Golspie has been in touch to ask when Scotland will move into level zero. The first minister had previously indicated this would happen on 28 June. But in recent weeks rising case numbers, driven by the new faster transmitting Delta variant, has forced a rethink. Nicola Sturgeon has now confirmed the current levels will remain in place until 19 July - the day after all adults will have had their first
dose. From that date it is hoped all parts of the country will move to level zero. Ms Sturgeon cautioned that this milestone will depend on the data and Scotland meeting its vaccination targets. Anas Sarwar says: ""We must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown."" The Scottish Labour leader tells the chamber there must be effective communication and effective decision-making, adding ""that has frayed in recent weeks"". He calls for a commitment that if vaccine supplies allow, the speed of delivery can be ramped up. The Scottish Labour leader asks if there are still Covid hot spots and calls for the publication of hot spot protocols. He also calls for clearer protocols around financial support. The first minister replies intensive work on these issues is continuing. She says if supplies allow, the vaccination programme will be accelerated and that the finance secretary will continue to work with businesses to ensure financial support is accessed. In response to Douglas Ross' question, the first minister says most changes to weddings will hopefully come after 19 July when the limit is expected to be increased to 200. Nicola Sturgeon says she hopes that as we go to level 0 physical distancing will go from 2m to 1m - it is already 1m in hospitality. She says she hopes to remove the legal physical distancing constraints outdoors completely at that point and that from 9 August the legal requirement can be removed indoors, as long as we have gone beyond level 0. But some people may be advised to continue to keep to a safe distance. She says it may be that in some settings, such as schools, masks may still need to be worn for a bit longer. Question from Heather in Perth and Kinross Many people will be planning garden parties this weekend but restrictions on outdoor numbers remain in place. Perth and Kinross is currently in level one which means only a maximum of 12 people from 12 households are allowed to meet in a garden or public place. Under 12s do not count towards the total for outdoor meetings so unless Heather's party includes a dozen children then it would be a breach of the rules. Level zero would have seen the limit increase to 15 people from 15 households. But on Tuesday the first minister confirmed social gatherings of any size will now be allowed under level zero due to the ""reduced risk of outdoor transmission"". Leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, expresses his condolences for everyone that has lost a loved one to Covid-19. He says it is a shame the changes to weddings and funerals are only being made now - too late for many people. He asks the first minister if mitigations after 9 August include social distancing, particularly at hospitality venues, if limits will remain on indoor social gatherings and if the mitigations will include the wearing of masks in offices and schools? Question from David in Largs David from Largs emailed to ask why the first minister is proposing a move to level zero from 19 July when daily case numbers are soaring. Nicola Sturgeon said the timetable is based on evidence that the link between new
cases and serious health harm is weakening. The number of people being admitted to hospital with
Covid has fallen from around 10% of reported positive cases at the start of the
year, to around 5% now. Covid patients are also, on average, spending less time
in hospital. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs: ""Overall, the evidence that
vaccination is helping protect people from serious health harms is allowing us
to change how we respond to the virus."" Some changes to the rules on weddings and funerals will take effect from Monday 28 June. The changes will mean that suppliers of wedding
services, and other people employed by the couple getting married, will no
longer count towards the cap on numbers at a wedding. And those accompanying the wedding
couple down the aisle will no longer need to wear face coverings. Live entertainment at receptions
will be possible - although people will still need to be seated at tables. The guidance for
funerals will change from next week so that people from more than one household can help carry a coffin,
and take a cord when lowering it. Further changes should come on 19 July if Scotland goes to level 0. That would mean up to
200 people will be able to attend weddings and funerals. The first minister begins by confirming ""no part of
the country will change level next week"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9953687
"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirms a delay to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland Originally set for the 28 June, it will be put back to 19 July so more people can be vaccinated Ms Sturgeon said: ""From 19 July, and then more substantially from 9 August, life should feel much less restricted for all of us."" Despite delays to the road-map, there will be some minor changes to weddings and funerals from 28 June, including allowing members from more than one household to carry a coffin The number of new coronavirus cases reported stands at 2,167 which is 9.1% of all tests carried out Earlier, John Swinney said it was not appropriate to pay compensation to businesses or individuals who might have lost out because of the Scottish government's Manchester travel ban Ahead of Ms Sturgeon's Holyrood update on lockdown rules an argument erupted over the passing of emergency powers linked to the pandemic BBC Scotland News The currentCovid restriction levelswill remain in place until 19 July.

No more talk of eliminating the virus, the aim now is supress it enough so it
will ""alleviate its harms"". This is a recognition that vaccines are
working well to prevent serious illness and while coronavirus is likely to put
additional strain on the NHS, it is not likely to result in it being
overwhelmed. It does mean difficult decisions will have
to be made on what is an acceptable level of Covid to live with.  Schools
for example, may be about to break up for the summer, but will they no longer
face interruptions if there are outbreaks when they return in the autumn? There is still plenty of uncertainty,
particularly around what the emergence of other variants might bring, and the first minister has left some room to pull back if required Allow Twitter content?

"The M4 around Newport is historically Wales' busiest stretch of road A UK government project will examine the case for the M4 relief road and upgrades along the A55, according to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Major road projects in Wales have been the responsibility of Welsh ministers in Cardiff since devolution in 1999. But a Westminster review says there is a strong case for a pan-UK network. The Welsh government said there were ""important"" parts of the review but warned UK ministers not to ""trample over devolution"". Mr Shapps said he wanted to work with the Welsh government to get both roads - which have suffered from congestion over the years - ""fixed"". He said a Â£20m scheme off the back of the review - which is looking at a number of transport projects - would look at Wales' two busiest and most congested roads. Four trains an hour pledge for 'Cinderella' line UK ministers 'could bypass Welsh Government' on M4 'Better public transport' needed for M4 congestion The Welsh government has previously saidthe relief road was a matter for Wales. The report looks at rail, road, air and maritime transport, with the review also looking at a ferry link between Holyhead and Northern Ireland. Mr Shapps denied the UK government wanted to take control of building trunk roads from the Welsh government adding: ""This isn't about powers."" ""There's lots of areas we already work closely together, rail infrastructure for example, which we already work on together,"" he told BBC Wales. The now-scrapped relief road was proposed as a solution to tackling congestion on the M4 around Newport The Â£1.6bn M4 relief road was axed by the Welsh government in 2019over cost and its impact on the environmentfollowing ministers inWales declaring a climate emergency. To build roads in Wales, the UK government would need to change the laws that govern the country unless it worked with Welsh ministers. It is not clear in the review how a pan-UK network would be implemented and the study is being led by Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy. An interim report says that following conversations with stakeholders ""the review believes that there is a strong strategic case for a new pan-UK transport network"". Both the A55 and the M4 in south-east Wales are identified by the report as being of interest to the review. It says that UK government funding would, like former EU funding for the TransEuropean Network for Transport, ""be used to add to existing funding streams, to enable higher capacity, faster, and more reliable connectivity"". This video can not be played This video reveals the possible route of the M4 relief road Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for a UK-wide transport strategy in the Telegraph on Tuesday, saying the Welsh Labour government has ""mystifyingly junked"" the M4 relief road after spending Â£144m. Now, speaking to BBC Wales, Mr Shapps said: ""The A55, people know, gets very choca-bloca if you're trying to get through to Manchester and Liverpool and north Wales. The review will also look at the A55 dual carriageway which runs across the north Wales coast The minister said: ""We've already been speaking to the Welsh government throughout, for example with Ken Skates in Welsh government who broadly welcomes this, and I think everyone's keen to make that connection between England and Wales work a lot more smoothly. ""And we know the M4 - there's been a lot of talk about an M4 relief road - or indeed the Welsh government through the Burns review has looked at different solutions to that. ""This is really just to say, 'brilliant, let's work together to get them fixed'."" Is there One Direction for new M4 stretch? Tunnels' jams 'cost Â£31m in lost time' 'Unique' tunnels celebrate 50th birthday Mr Shapps said the review ""says we will primarily look to work with devolved administrations - the Welsh government in this case - to help to build, construct, with assistance where appropriate, and maintain these things"". The transport minister added ""the M4 relief road was the most obvious way"" to deal with congestion. The UK government said it would fund a Â£20m project to look at a wide-range of projects across the UK that were identified by the review. It will look at rail improvements in south-east Wales, building on ideas from the Welsh government's Burns Commission which proposed spendingÂ£800m on public transportto deal with the bottlenecks on the M4 around Newport, as well as the wider motorway. Grant Shapps said he was investing Â£20m to kickstart work on projects identified in the review Mr Shapps said: ""I'm putting in Â£20m to kickstart work on some of these projects so we can get to the appropriate answers like what happens to the A55 in north Wales connecting England? ""What happens with the M4 - whether the relief road is the right approach or whether some other sort of Burns report type approach - is a question we can answer in the process."" During the interview, Mr Shapps said: ""I think I'm right in saying something like a quarter of Welsh people actually work in England."" Figures from Stats Wales showed that in 2019, 98,500 of 1.4m working Welsh residents commute outside of Wales - 6.8%. A spokesman for the Welsh government said: ""As a Welsh government we are clear. There are some important areas coming out of this Union Connectivity Review where governments across the UK can and should work collaboratively, respecting each other's powers, to create a stronger transport network. ""Today's review recognises the success of transport devolution and highlights the important role the recent Burns recommendations are to addressing issues like congestion on the M4. ""But if the UK government simply want to ignore all of that, including the content of their own report, and use this as yet another attempt to trample over the devolution settlement - just as it is with the Levelling Up Fund - then we will get nowhere."" Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts accused the UK government of seeking to split Wales into north and south, with an obsession that ""all roads lead to London"". ""Proper cross-border links are of course needed. But any ambition to improve cross-border transport must prioritise improving transport links within Wales first as an essential foundation for improved cross-border connections."" The interim report says the review will also look at faster and higher capacity connections for passengers from HS2 to Scotland and north Wales. Rail upgrades in south-east Wales to Bristol are also being discussed, as well as whether there should be a new ferry route from Holyhead to Warrenpoint in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile it is is assessing the feasibility of abridge or tunnel between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Part of the UK government's strategy to ""boost the union"" at the moment is to invest in projects - particularly infrastructure - around the UK, which can then be branded as ""UK government funded"". This review looking at transport links between the four nations appears to be their latest tool to do this. At times some Conservative MPs and figures in UK government have expressed frustration that they hadn't, until a new law passed last year, kept hold of powers as a central UK government to invest in devolved areas like road infrastructure in the nations. But the strategy hasn't always made them popular with the Welsh government who have accused them of trying to ride roughshod over devolved responsibilities. So what's not clear is: what happens if the UK government decide a project like the M4 relief road, which Welsh ministers scrapped, is a solution they want to invest in?

"The road would have replaced the Newport section of the M4 A legal notice dating back to the 1990s that obliged councils to protect the route of the shelved M4 relief road has been scrapped. It follows the Welsh government's decision in 2019 not to build the M4 relief road because of its environmental and financial cost. A deputy minister said it showed the government's commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of Wales' roads. But the Welsh Conservatives said it was a ""dark day for businesses"". The Welsh government move means the 14-mile (22.5km) route no longer has protection from development through the planning process. Mark Drakeford'sdecision to axe the motorway schemecame despite a planning inspector concluding the case for the road was ""compelling"". It had been supported by former first minister Carwyn Jones as a solution to relieve congestion on the Newport stretch of the M4. Dating back to the 1990s and before the Senedd was formed, the road project had been opposed by environmentalists because of the route along the Gwent Levels. Its Â£1.6bn cost and potential impact on the Welsh government's budget added to the political controversy. UK government ministers have suggested they could build the M4 relief road themselves, despite trunk roads being controlled by officials in Cardiff, not London. M4 relief road axed by Welsh Government M4 50mph limit recommended to tackle congestion Â£114m spent on axed M4 road project On Friday afternoon Deputy Climate Change Minister Lee Waters said he had removed the TR111 notice for the relief road - first put in place in 1995. ""The removal of this TR111 protection potentially provides further opportunities for ongoing work to safeguard the future of the Gwent Levels,"" Mr Waters said, ""and demonstrates our ongoing commitment to protect biodiversity and reduce the carbon footprint of our transport network."" A commission set up to examine alternatives to the road proposed Â£800m should be invested in public transport. It suggested making walking or cycling the ""natural choice"" for the first and last mile of public transport journeys and recommended establishing ""a major cycleway"" linking Cardiff and Newport. It also recommended a now implemented50mph speed limit. The M4 relief road would have been built through the Gwent Levels Tory shadow transport minister Natasha Asghar, said:  ""Whilst unsurprising given Labour's misguided belief they can solve the problems on the M4 with a few cycle lanes and some extra traffic officers, this is a dark day for businesses across south Wales."" A Welsh government spokesman said: ""These deeply unhelpful comments deliberately misrepresent the work to tackle congestion in the area. ""The South East Wales Transport Commission has made a series of recommendations to tackle congestion, including improved rail services and it's work has led to measures to improve traffic flow on the M4.""

"Scotland is aiming to remove all of its major legal Covid restrictions in early August, the country's first minister has announced. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed lockdown easing would be paused for three weeks to allow more time for people to be vaccinated. It means mainland areas will not move to the lowest level zero restrictions until 19 July. The hope is that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August. Ms Sturgeon said this would allow life in Scotland to return to ""almost complete normality"". But the government will not advise an immediate return to full office working on that date - and people will still be required to wear face masks in some settings. Live: Latest from Nicola Sturgeon's Holyrood statement What happens after Scotland's Covid 'pause'? What Covid rules are changing, and when? Scotland recorded 2,167 new cases on Monday - the highest daily total since the peak of the second wave in January - with the country said to have had the highest rate in Europe last week The percentage of Covid-19 tests coming back positive rose to 9.1%, up from 7.2% the previous day, and the deaths of a further four people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded. The UK as a whole recorded 11,625 new cases and 27 deaths in the past 24 hours. The new daily case rate in Scotland is seven times higher than it was in early May and 40% higher than last week, with Ms Sturgeon saying the faster-transmitting Delta variant is ""now dominant"". But the first minister said the vaccination programme was breaking the link between the number of positive cases and the number of people being hospitalised and dying. The government's original ""route map"" out of lockdown would have seen the whole of Scotland move to level zero - the lowest point in the five-tier system of restrictions - from next Monday. This has now been pushed back to 19 July - the same date as measures are planned to be lifted in England. Island communities such as Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero, with all mainland areas in level one or level two of the country's five-tier system of restrictions. Some ""minor"" changes will be phased in sooner - removing staff and suppliers of wedding services from the cap on numbers at services from Monday and allowing live entertainment at receptions, and allowing people from more than one household to help carry a coffin at a funeral. The move to level zero will increase the number of people who are allowed to meet up indoors, cut the requirement for physical distancing indoors from 2m (6.5ft) to 1m (3.2ft), and increase the number of people allowed to attend wedding and funerals to 200. Ms Sturgeon said this would be a ""significant step back to normality"", but said she wanted to move beyond level zero ""as quickly as it is prudent to do so"". She said the ""major remaining legal restrictions"" could be lifted from 9 August, signalling a ""return to almost complete normality in our day to day lives"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""We will consider and make a final assessment nearer the time of whether - as we hope - this could include the lifting of the legal requirement to physically distance indoors as well as outdoors."" However she warned that some measures, including the use of face coverings in shops and on public transport and ""rigorous and regular hand-washing"" would be needed ""at least for a period"". And the first minister said there should be ""appropriate phasing"" of the return of workers to offices after 9 August, saying the government would ""encourage continued support for home working where it is possible"". The first minister has always said that Covid restrictions would be driven by the data, not by dates. But Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland can expect to be in level zero from 19 July,  and that all major legal restrictions could be lifted from 9 August. Looking at the raw data, this might seem surprising.  There are 154 new coronavirus cases a day in Scotland per 100,000 people. That's almost twenty more than the daily rate on Boxing Day, when the country went into another lockdown. The difference is the vaccine, which has dramatically reduced the consequences of catching coronavirus. Fewer people are now dying from Covid, down from an average of 31 a day in December to less than 2 a day now. That's why the Scottish government can look forward to a date when it can relax restrictions instead of imposing them. The changes are dependent on case levels being suppressed and targets being hit in the vaccination programme. All adults in Scotland will have had at least one dose of a vaccine by 18 July, with everyone in the 40-49 age group due to have had both doses by a week later. By 20 August, all 30 to 39-year-olds will have had a second dose, with everyone over the age of 18 due to have had two doses by 12 September. More than 2.6 million people in Scotland have had both doses of a vaccine Ms Sturgeon faced questions on her statement from opposition leaders at Holyrood - where MSPs are due to debate an extension of emergency powers into 2022. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed progress with the vaccination programme and that ""we have more of an indication of when we will be free from restrictions"". He pressed Ms Sturgeon for more detail about what measures would continue after 9 August, including whether masks would still be required in offices and schools. Ms Sturgeon said the legal requirement for physical distancing could be removed at that point, but that in some settings - such as schools - masks may need to be worn for a bit longer. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said ""we must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown"", calling for clearer messaging and protocols around financial support.

"Plans for a third Menai crossing are being put on hold All new road-building projects in Wales are being frozen while the Welsh government conducts a review. It means plans for theDeeside ""Red Route"", theLlandeilo bypass, and a third Anglesey crossing will be put on hold. Ministers say it is a necessary part of Wales' effort to reduce carbon emissions. But the Conservatives warned the decision was a ""significant blow"" for the economic recovery. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru said the review cannot mean communities ""are left behind"". Deputy Climate Change Minister Lee Waters announced the review in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday afternoon. Projects that already have diggers in the ground, such asthe Heads of the Valleys Road, will continue. Llandeilo bypass delayed until 2025 Shapps wants UK government to 'fix' M4 and A55 M4 relief road planning protection scrapped As part of the plans the Welsh government wants to shift money from new roads to maintaining existing routes and investing in public transport. Wales is aiming to reachnet-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But to get there, Mr Waters said Wales needs to increase emissions cuts in the next decade to double what has been cut in the last 30 years. He told BBC Wales: ""Transport generates something like 17% of all our emissions, so it has to play its part. ""If we can hit these climate change targets, that's got to change. That means redirecting investment. ""If we carry on going as we're going, we're not going to hit net zero until 2090. At the very latest scientists tell us we have until 2050 to stop this running out of control."" The Llandeilo bypass had already been delayed to 2025 There was concern about the announcement from business people in Llandeilo, where the bypass hadhad already been delayed to 2025. It was promised by Welsh Labour ministers as part of a deal with Plaid Cymru to get the 2017-18 budget passed, and would have directed traffic away from the busy main road through the Carmarthenshire town. Ellen Plowman, who runs Maryellens coffee shop in the town, said: ""The volume of traffic that's coming through Llandeilo at the moment is far too much for the town, it's having an impact on people feeling safe walking through the town. ""If the bypass doesn't happen then I think they really should look at changing the weight of the lorries and the size of the noise coming through."" Jeweller Mari Thomas said she understood the need for the review ""but I think Llandeilo specifically has a problem with traffic and congestion, and... pollution"". She said it was dangerous for pedestrians. ""Public transport will help a lot but I don't think it will solve my problems here,"" she said, saying large lorries should be prevented ""from coming through such a small town when you've got narrow streets"". The ""red route"" would run from Northop through to the border with England The Welsh government picked a preferred route for a new Menai crossing in 2018, although a government minister later said the scrapping of the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power plant schemehad weakened its case. Plans for the red route dual carriageway in Deeside - which would see the A548 upgraded and a new link built with the A55 to tackle congestion - have sparked opposition forcutting through ancient woodland. The review will be conducted by a yet-to-be-announced external panel. Business lobby group the CBI warned that commuters were currently preferring private transport over alternatives. ""Public transport use in Flintshire is down 47% and down 33% in Carmarthenshire,"" said the CBI's Ian Price. ""This could spell trouble for the local communities of Deeside and Llandeilo if there is no plan to respond to these trends. ""The government review should consider what viable alternatives exist for Deeside and Llandeilo that can meet short and long-term pressures."" The announcement was criticised by Natasha Asghar, transport spokesperson for the Welsh Conservatives: ""At such a delicate economic time, this decision could prove a significant blow for our recovery. ""Many roads across Wales are not fit for purpose and have had a damaging impact on our economic fortunes, environment and public safety. Regular traffic jams deter investment and have contributed to Wales having some of the worst air quality in the UK. ""Welsh workers and businesses urgently require more information about the scope of the review and the Welsh Labour Government's long-term intentions for our transport infrastructure."" There was a mixed response from Plaid Cymru's climate change spokesperson Delyth Jewell. She added: ""This move from the Welsh government, whilst a welcome indication that they are serious about tackling carbon emissions, cannot mean that communities that are long overdue infrastructure investment are left behind. ""Communities like Llandeilo, who are understandably angry that this has been announced without consultation, have seen air pollution levels in their town centre rise to higher than the national standards and would benefit from the kind of infrastructure investment that has been promised but continuously delayed for the last six years."" Transport is Wales' third-largest source of the gases driving climate change, according to advisersat the independent Climate Change Committee,external. In a December 2020 report, the committee said transport emissions fell by 2% between 2016 and 2018 but overall emissions ""have remained virtually flat since 1990"". The Welsh government's new transport strategy -Llwybr Newydd,external- said Wales' transport emissions ""must be roughly halved between 2020 and 2030 from six to three million tonnes"" of carbon dioxide. It adds: ""Whilst electric vehicles may provide the biggest emissions savings, this is unlikely to be the main source of savings until the late 2020s and possibly later."" New cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and dieselwill not be sold in the UK from 2030. Work on the A465 Heads of the Valleys road will continue Seperately the deputy climate change minister said it would be ""inevitable at some point we're going to have some level of road charging. ""As people move to electric cars, they won't be paying tax on fuel,"" Lee Waters said. ""So the whole model of how we fund, transport and general taxation is changing and it'll have to be changes to reflect that you pay per mile, rather than just a flat rate as we currently do."" The Welsh government's strategy says other measures will also be needed, including a target of30% of the workforce working remotelyand an increase in people using public transport, walking and cycling. Around 32% of all journeys are currently made by public transport, walking and cycling - the government's target is to increase that share to 45% by 2040. Wales has seen a huge drop in public transport journeys as a result of the pandemic. In the year to March 2021, 24 million bus journeys were made in Wales -a 73% drop compared to the previous year,external. Transport for Wales also saw an84% drop in rail passenger journeys,externalin the past financial year - down from 31.8 million in 2019/20 to 5 million in 2020/21. Friends of the Earth Cymru has called fora ban on new roads in Wales. Asked on theBBC Politics Wales programmerecently whether there should be a ban,Climate Change Minister Julie James said: ""It's tempting, isn't it, to say, 'of course we won't build new roads'. ""But there are really complex issues here around air quality, what traffic routes people take, how many cars on the road and so on.""

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirms a delay to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland Originally set for the 28 June, it will be put back to 19 July so more people can be vaccinated Ms Sturgeon said: ""From 19 July, and then more substantially from 9 August, life should feel much less restricted for all of us."" Despite delays to the road-map, there will be some minor changes to weddings and funerals from 28 June, including allowing members from more than one household to carry a coffin The number of new coronavirus cases reported stands at 2,167 which is 9.1% of all tests carried out Earlier, John Swinney said it was not appropriate to pay compensation to businesses or individuals who might have lost out because of the Scottish government's Manchester travel ban Ahead of Ms Sturgeon's Holyrood update on lockdown rules an argument erupted over the passing of emergency powers linked to the pandemic BBC Scotland News The currentCovid restriction levelswill remain in place until 19 July.

No more talk of eliminating the virus, the aim now is supress it enough so it
will ""alleviate its harms"". This is a recognition that vaccines are
working well to prevent serious illness and while coronavirus is likely to put
additional strain on the NHS, it is not likely to result in it being
overwhelmed. It does mean difficult decisions will have
to be made on what is an acceptable level of Covid to live with.  Schools
for example, may be about to break up for the summer, but will they no longer
face interruptions if there are outbreaks when they return in the autumn? There is still plenty of uncertainty,
particularly around what the emergence of other variants might bring, and the first minister has left some room to pull back if required Allow Twitter content?

Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent It was well trailed and no surprise to see
the first minister retain the same restriction levels in Scotland.  We are on an upward curve of infections, a 40% increase on last week,
with cases at their highest point since late January. This wave, driven by the Delta variant
started in early May, but the positive news is that seven weeks on it has not
caused a big surge in the number of Covid patients in hospital.  They are
going up, but not nearly as fast as they were earlier in the year.  Experts
want this time to push forward with the vaccination programme and to gather
more data on just how well they are working. Vaccines look set to get us through this
wave without stretching the NHS and scientists are already working on
boosters.  But their success also poses a more difficult question for the
future around what are acceptable levels of Covid to live with? C'mon Scotland. During her statement the first minister wished Steve Clarke and the Scottish team all the best this evening. ""Tonightâs game is massive - we will all be cheering
Scotland on. But please do it safely,"" urged the first minister. You can followthe build up to tonight's crucial game against Croatia here. The crowd capacity at Wembley will be increased to more than 60,000 for the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020, says the UK government. It means the stadium will be at 75% capacity for the games.

Scotland's National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch highlights the two publications alluded to by the first minister in her statement. Question from Mike in Germany Mike has been in touch from Germany to ask if he can visit his holiday home in the Highlands. At the moment it is possible but he should be prepared for a longer and more expensive stay than normal. Germany is currently on the Scottish government'samber list,external. As a result visitors must complete apassenger locator form,externaland take aCovid test,externalbefore flying. Mike would also be required to book and pay Â£170 for a day two and day eighttravel test,external. Free NHS or private kits cannot be used. Once he arrives in Scotland he must isolate at his home for 10 days, during which time he must take the tests. Although Mike has been fully vaccinated the rules on managed quarantine and self-isolation still apply as it is not yet known if vaccines prevent people from spreading the virus. Willie Rennie raises the challenges faced by families with adults with special needs. The Scottish Lib Dem leader asks when the day services for adults with special needs will be reinstated. He then points out that thousands of fans went to London to see the Scotland v England game and received few words of criticism from the first minister. The first minister replies she could not have been clearer that she advised against travelling to London without a ticket and for people to follow the rules. Ms Sturgeon adds that services for adults with learning disabilities can reopen and councils must consider how they can safely reopen. Question from John in Glasgow John in Glasgow has asked BBC Scotland when staff will return to the office. By 9 August the vast majority of over 40s will have a significant level of protection. Despite this the first minister confirms she will not advise an
immediate return to full office working on that date. Instead the Scottish government will continue to work
with business to agree an appropriate phasing of this. This process will get under way when the country enters level zero next month. The pandemic has changed the way almost everyone does their job and Ms Sturgeon says she hopes home-working will be more possible post-Covid
than it was before. She adds: ""This wonât just assist with control
of the virus, it will also help promote well-being more generally."" Ms Sturgeon says vaccinations have changed the balance of the pandemic. She says the Scottish government wants to see testing and vaccines progressively reduce restrictions domestically and on travel in and out of the country, in response to Patrick Harvie's question. We have to be satisfied there is a degree of effectiveness. We will consider if testing in future, coupled with vaccination, can lead to a different approach to self isolation, particularly for contacts of positive cases. We need to look at all these things carefully before coming to final decisions but all of these things are under active consideration. Nicola Sturgeon, FM Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie asks if the Scottish government is open to what UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock is proposing - to end the requirement for international travel quarantine for vaccinated people or to end self isolation and replace it with lateral flow testing. However, the move has been criticised by public health experts. He asks if Ms Sturgeon agrees this would ""almost guarantee"" that new variants were imported and would then spread. Question from Calum in Golspie Calum from Golspie has been in touch to ask when Scotland will move into level zero. The first minister had previously indicated this would happen on 28 June. But in recent weeks rising case numbers, driven by the new faster transmitting Delta variant, has forced a rethink. Nicola Sturgeon has now confirmed the current levels will remain in place until 19 July - the day after all adults will have had their first
dose. From that date it is hoped all parts of the country will move to level zero. Ms Sturgeon cautioned that this milestone will depend on the data and Scotland meeting its vaccination targets. Anas Sarwar says: ""We must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown."" The Scottish Labour leader tells the chamber there must be effective communication and effective decision-making, adding ""that has frayed in recent weeks"". He calls for a commitment that if vaccine supplies allow, the speed of delivery can be ramped up. The Scottish Labour leader asks if there are still Covid hot spots and calls for the publication of hot spot protocols. He also calls for clearer protocols around financial support. The first minister replies intensive work on these issues is continuing. She says if supplies allow, the vaccination programme will be accelerated and that the finance secretary will continue to work with businesses to ensure financial support is accessed. In response to Douglas Ross' question, the first minister says most changes to weddings will hopefully come after 19 July when the limit is expected to be increased to 200. Nicola Sturgeon says she hopes that as we go to level 0 physical distancing will go from 2m to 1m - it is already 1m in hospitality. She says she hopes to remove the legal physical distancing constraints outdoors completely at that point and that from 9 August the legal requirement can be removed indoors, as long as we have gone beyond level 0. But some people may be advised to continue to keep to a safe distance. She says it may be that in some settings, such as schools, masks may still need to be worn for a bit longer. Question from Heather in Perth and Kinross Many people will be planning garden parties this weekend but restrictions on outdoor numbers remain in place. Perth and Kinross is currently in level one which means only a maximum of 12 people from 12 households are allowed to meet in a garden or public place. Under 12s do not count towards the total for outdoor meetings so unless Heather's party includes a dozen children then it would be a breach of the rules. Level zero would have seen the limit increase to 15 people from 15 households. But on Tuesday the first minister confirmed social gatherings of any size will now be allowed under level zero due to the ""reduced risk of outdoor transmission"". Leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, expresses his condolences for everyone that has lost a loved one to Covid-19. He says it is a shame the changes to weddings and funerals are only being made now - too late for many people. He asks the first minister if mitigations after 9 August include social distancing, particularly at hospitality venues, if limits will remain on indoor social gatherings and if the mitigations will include the wearing of masks in offices and schools? Question from David in Largs David from Largs emailed to ask why the first minister is proposing a move to level zero from 19 July when daily case numbers are soaring. Nicola Sturgeon said the timetable is based on evidence that the link between new
cases and serious health harm is weakening. The number of people being admitted to hospital with
Covid has fallen from around 10% of reported positive cases at the start of the
year, to around 5% now. Covid patients are also, on average, spending less time
in hospital. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs: ""Overall, the evidence that
vaccination is helping protect people from serious health harms is allowing us
to change how we respond to the virus."" Some changes to the rules on weddings and funerals will take effect from Monday 28 June. The changes will mean that suppliers of wedding
services, and other people employed by the couple getting married, will no
longer count towards the cap on numbers at a wedding. And those accompanying the wedding
couple down the aisle will no longer need to wear face coverings. Live entertainment at receptions
will be possible - although people will still need to be seated at tables. The guidance for
funerals will change from next week so that people from more than one household can help carry a coffin,
and take a cord when lowering it. Further changes should come on 19 July if Scotland goes to level 0. That would mean up to
200 people will be able to attend weddings and funerals. The first minister begins by confirming ""no part of
the country will change level next week"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9997297
"Having a coil fitted should not be traumatic or very painful, say experts. Their comments came after BBC Radio 5 Live's Naga Munchetty shared her experience, prompting many to recount their own stories of painful coil fittings. Most people encounter no problems, and no-one should be put off considering this safe and effective contraceptive, medics say. But they say pain relief should be ""part of the discussion"". Options available include a fast-acting anaesthetic spray. Munchetty said she felt violated and angry about her fitting a few years ago, which caused her ""excruciating pain"". It resonated with other women who have contacted the BBC with similar stories. This video can not be played Naga Munchetty: ""The nurse had tears in her eyes... I fainted twice"" Naomi (not her real name) is 26 and from London. She went for a coil, or intrauterine device (IUD), fitting a couple of months ago but had to stop the procedure when it became too painful. ""I didn't have the coil fitted in the end. ""My doctor was very kind and understanding and told me at the beginning we could stop at any point so when the pain became so bad I did ask to stop. However, if she hadn't said that to me before I don't know if I would have felt comfortable asking her to stop. ""The clinic had explained the procedure to me and I had taken some paracetamol to help with any discomfort. But I feel like the pain was massively downplayed to me beforehand. ""For me, it was quite a big deal and quite traumatising."" She says it helps knowing that her experience isn't unique. ""I'm very glad to hear that other women have had similar experiences to this because I felt a bit pathetic and a failure afterwards since I couldn't go through with it."" Some women who got in touch described feeling ""shocked"" or ""in agony"" during their IUD fitting, but others said they had had a good experience. And there was concern that discussing the issue could put women off using what is a very effective, and for many, convenient contraceptive. An IUD can be put into the womb to prevent a pregnancy It immediately protects against pregnancy and is 99% effective It can remain in place for years Fertility can return to normal as soon as it is removed But Unlike condoms, it doesn't prevent sexually transmitted infections Periods may be heavier, more painful or last longer There is a small risk of infection or it might not stay in place correctly Contraception: Which is most effective? Which method of contraception suits me?,external Dr Louise Massey, of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, who also runs a clinic helping women for whom it can be difficult to fit a coil, said: ""There is, understandably going to be some discomfort with the procedure, but it should not be overwhelming. ""I ask people to rate their discomfort on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst pain they could ever have. ""Most give it a two or three on that scale."" An IUD fitting/removal takes about five minutes (although the appointment will be longer) A speculum (a smooth, tube-shaped tool) is inserted into the vagina so neck of the womb (cervix) can be seen The IUD is inserted through the small opening of the cervix, into the womb Some people will experience cramping similar or sometimes more intense than menstrual pain. Dr Massey says the procedure can always be stopped if there is too much pain, discomfort or distress. ""It is always an option to abandon it. ""It can even be done under general anaesthetic if necessary and appropriate."" Dr Hannat Akintomide is a specialty doctor in sexual reproductive health with the Newcastle Upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust. She says for the vast majority of women, getting a coil is not painful or traumatic. And while offering pain relief or analgesia used to be somewhat hit and miss, the situation has massively improved in recent years, she says. Sheconducted a study,externalnearly a decade ago with 129 healthcare professionals to raise awareness about the issue. At that time, one-quarter of the practitioners said they routinely used local anaesthetic for IUD insertion. Another quarter said they never, or rarely, offered it. The rest said they did sometimes. Dr Akintomide said: ""I felt it was appalling that we were not doing something so simple that could improve their experience."" She says women should discuss any fears and concerns about the procedure with their healthcare provider, who can provide appropriate pain relief or analgesia. ""The options available are expanding.""

They wouldn't imaging having an injection down below. ""But now we also have the local anaesthetic spray and the advantage is it doesn't involve a needle, it's quick acting - for many people it's immediate and, at most, three to five minutes to take effect - so you do have those options.""

"Ministers are ""working on"" plans for quarantine-free travel from amber list countries for people who are fully vaccinated, Matt Hancock has said. He said the plans for England had not been ""clinically advised yet"". But the health secretary said the government was looking at plans to allow the vaccine to ""bring back"" some freedoms. Currently travellers arriving from countries on the red or amber travel lists have to isolate for 10 days. What are the rules for travel? Is it possible to visit France, Spain or other destinations? How can I prove I've had both my Covid jabs? Asked on Sky News if the measure could be in place as soon as August, Mr Hancock said: ""We'll get there when it's safe to do so."" International Trade Secretary Liz Truss told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine she would not speculate about what was going to happen in terms of travel, but said the government was looking at what it could do to ""ease up requirements where it makes sense"". She said: ""We're not ready to make an announcement yet, but fundamentally what we need to do is - while keeping people safe - making sure we're freeing up the rules as much as we can."" Responding to Mr Hancock's comments, Green MP Caroline Lucas, vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said scrapping quarantine measures would be ""reckless"" and called for the government to focus on upgrading systems at airports. ""The Delta variant first arrived here in the UK precisely because of inadequate pre-travel requirements and health checks at UK arrival halls, compounded by a lack of support and enforcement of mandatory quarantine,"" she said. Long queues were reported at the UK border at London's Heathrow airport on Tuesday evening Under the current rules for England, arrivals from red list destinations such as India and South Africa must isolate in a government approved hotel for 10 days. Those coming from amber countries must quarantine for 10 days, with tests to be taken on days two and eight after return, but they do not need to be in a hotel. It may be possible to end quarantine early in England by paying for an additional test under thetest-to-release,externalscheme. The vast majority of countries are on the amber list. Arrivals from the few green list countries - which includes a small number of countries including Israel and Iceland - do not have to quarantine but must book a test for day two of their return. Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalare following similar rules. This video can not be played Five ways to self-isolate successfully to prevent the spread of coronavirus Andrew Flintham, from travel firm Tui, said it had become an interested party in the legal action taken against the government by Manchester Airports Group, alongside Ryanair, British Airways' parent company IAG and Virgin Atlantic about how the government manages and publishes the green travel list. ""At the time of the last country review, many destinations such as Malta, the Greek islands and the Balearics had much lower rates than the UK,"" he told a conference organised by the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta). ""It was inexplicable as to why these were not added and instead Portugal was moved straight from green to amber, without the slightest sign of stopping at the much-vaunted green watchlist."" Mark Tanzer, of Abta, urged ministers to ""put aside any misguided prejudices against outbound travel"". He added that the amount of state support given to travel firms is ""way behind"" the situation in other countries. On Monday, the prime minister said the government was considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UKif they took daily tests. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""cautiously hopeful"" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme, with the next ""checkpoint"" taking place on 28 June. The health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that England remained ""on track"" for the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions on 19 July, with case rates ""slowing"" and hospitalisations ""not rising quickly"". He said the number of people dying from Covid in England remained ""very, very low"" and said this showed the ""vaccine was working"". Mr Hancock also warned that the coming winter could be ""challenging"", but said that he hoped the government would not have to bring back restrictions. More than 43.1 million people (81.9% of the population) have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and nearly 31.5 million (59.8%) have had a second, according tothe government's coronavirus dashboard.,external The UK has reported a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test on Tuesday, and another 11,625 cases. The Office for National Statistics said infections were continuing to increase in England but the ""trend is uncertain"" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The number of hospital admissions for Covid has jumped by a third in the last week with the latest data showing four consecutive days of more than 200 admissions. A month ago we had three days of under 100 admissions so the change is very clear. But that just tells you part of the story. Ministers have spoken about vaccinations breaking the link between cases and hospitalisations. That has not happened, but it has certainly been weakened. During the winter wave around 10% of infections being diagnosed ended up in hospital 10 days later. Currently it looks to be around 3%. That is a significant difference. But it still means if infection rates keep climbing as they are we could see in excess of 1,000 admissions a day later in the summer. That is what the NHS would expect to see in the depths of a bad winter for all types of respiratory illness. The hope is that the ""wall of immunity"" built up by the vaccination programme will kick in before we reach that point and help reduce infection levels and then admissions.

"NHS patients in England will get greater control over their health and social care data under plans set out by the government, Matt Hancock says. It means people will be able to access their medical records from different parts of the NHS through various apps. However critics are worried that data could be misused and the system has not been properly explained to patients. In defending the plan, the health secretary said more effective use of data would deliver better patient care. New NHS patient data store delayed to September Doctors urge delay to England GP data scrape The new strategy, calledData Saves Lives,external, will give patients confidence that health and care staff have up-to-date information enabling them to make quicker, more informed decisions, the government said. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that improving data collection would mean staff spent less time looking for information and more time treating patients. Patients will be able to manage appointments, refill medications and speak with health staff when needed via apps, it said. More than two million people use the NHS app, which includes a person's Covid vaccination status and gives access to some services. ""The pandemic has taught us we must be bold and the great strides we have made on vaccines and treatments during this time have been made possible by the way we use data,"" Matt Hancock said. Mr Hancock said theuse of dexamethasone to treat Covidhad been discovered thanks to the use of data within the NHS and had gone on to save ""over a million lives"" around the world. ""The goal here and what I am determined to do, is to have trusted research environments which protect people's privacy whilst also allowing for us to get insights out of the data which saves lives,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. By Chris Vallance, BBC technology reporter The first three words of the new draft data strategy are ""Data Saves Lives"" - three words we are likely to hear repeated as ministers promote these plans. Data, we are told, was a vital resource in tackling the pandemic, and now there is an opportunity to build on that momentum. From the use of algorithms to predict who might be at greater risk from coronavirus, to the use of artificial intelligence to help analyse the brain scans of acute stroke patients, the document lists plenty of examples of what we might gain. The data resources of the NHS are potentially of huge value to research. But they also paint a rich and comprehensive picture of our lives. And privacy campaigners are already concerned about what may be buried in the small print. As part of the strategy the DHSC says it will introduce legislation to ""enable the proportionate sharing of data"". But Cori Crider, co-founder of Foxglove, which campaigns to stop abuse of digital technology, said the government took a ""collect it all first and ask questions later"" approach when it came to GP data and said the strategy included potential commercial uses of information. She told the Today programme that GP data was ""possibly the most valuable"" set of health information in the world and called for the DHSC to send a consent form to individuals offering them the chance to opt out. Ms Crider said that, while there were some positives in the strategy, people should be offered the option to opt out of specific uses of their data while allowing others. Mr Hancock said he thought consent should be at the heart of the strategy and believed the vast majority of people would be willing to share their data if there was a ""strong mission and purpose"" behind the use of data. Phil Booth, of advocacy group MedConfidential, said the draft strategy had not ""changed much"" and many of the ideas were similar to the scrappedCare.data planfrom 2014. He said: ""The biggest single issue is trust and unless the government gets this right they are going to collapse trust again."" Mr Booth said the doctor-patient relationship was vital and confidentiality was an important part of that. He said if people thought their data was being sold to commercial entities they may not want to tell their doctor some things. He said the government had become ""drunk on data"" during the pandemic - with people more willing to allow their information to be used for medical research. But he suggested two factors which made people less keen to share their data were if it was taken without their permission or if a commercial entity was involved. Earlier this month,the creation of a central digital databaseusing GP records in England was pushed back, amid concerns that patients needed more time to understand the system. Matthew Gould, chief executive of NHSX - the unit responsible for setting policy for the use of data and technology in the NHS - said patients needed to ""own their data"", have access to it and have confidence on how the NHS was handling it on their behalf. The proposals also include using data to analyse trends in the health of the nation, which the DHSC said could help improve commissioning and planning of services. The DHSC said that the NHS was committed to using data lawfully and holding it securely. The strategy has been published in draft form ahead of engagement with the sector over the summer, the DHSC said.

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirms a delay to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland Originally set for the 28 June, it will be put back to 19 July so more people can be vaccinated Ms Sturgeon said: ""From 19 July, and then more substantially from 9 August, life should feel much less restricted for all of us.""

No more talk of eliminating the virus, the aim now is supress it enough so it
will ""alleviate its harms"". This is a recognition that vaccines are
working well to prevent serious illness and while coronavirus is likely to put
additional strain on the NHS, it is not likely to result in it being
overwhelmed. It does mean difficult decisions will have
to be made on what is an acceptable level of Covid to live with.  Schools
for example, may be about to break up for the summer, but will they no longer
face interruptions if there are outbreaks when they return in the autumn? There is still plenty of uncertainty,
particularly around what the emergence of other variants might bring, and the first minister has left some room to pull back if required Allow Twitter content?

Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent It was well trailed and no surprise to see
the first minister retain the same restriction levels in Scotland.  We are on an upward curve of infections, a 40% increase on last week,
with cases at their highest point since late January. This wave, driven by the Delta variant
started in early May, but the positive news is that seven weeks on it has not
caused a big surge in the number of Covid patients in hospital.  They are
going up, but not nearly as fast as they were earlier in the year.  Experts
want this time to push forward with the vaccination programme and to gather
more data on just how well they are working. Vaccines look set to get us through this
wave without stretching the NHS and scientists are already working on
boosters.  But their success also poses a more difficult question for the
future around what are acceptable levels of Covid to live with? C'mon Scotland. During her statement the first minister wished Steve Clarke and the Scottish team all the best this evening. ""Tonightâs game is massive - we will all be cheering
Scotland on. But please do it safely,"" urged the first minister. You can followthe build up to tonight's crucial game against Croatia here. The crowd capacity at Wembley will be increased to more than 60,000 for the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020, says the UK government. It means the stadium will be at 75% capacity for the games.

Scotland's National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch highlights the two publications alluded to by the first minister in her statement. Question from Mike in Germany Mike has been in touch from Germany to ask if he can visit his holiday home in the Highlands. At the moment it is possible but he should be prepared for a longer and more expensive stay than normal. Germany is currently on the Scottish government'samber list,external. As a result visitors must complete apassenger locator form,externaland take aCovid test,externalbefore flying. Mike would also be required to book and pay Â£170 for a day two and day eighttravel test,external. Free NHS or private kits cannot be used. Once he arrives in Scotland he must isolate at his home for 10 days, during which time he must take the tests. Although Mike has been fully vaccinated the rules on managed quarantine and self-isolation still apply as it is not yet known if vaccines prevent people from spreading the virus. Willie Rennie raises the challenges faced by families with adults with special needs. The Scottish Lib Dem leader asks when the day services for adults with special needs will be reinstated. He then points out that thousands of fans went to London to see the Scotland v England game and received few words of criticism from the first minister. The first minister replies she could not have been clearer that she advised against travelling to London without a ticket and for people to follow the rules. Ms Sturgeon adds that services for adults with learning disabilities can reopen and councils must consider how they can safely reopen. Question from John in Glasgow John in Glasgow has asked BBC Scotland when staff will return to the office. By 9 August the vast majority of over 40s will have a significant level of protection. Despite this the first minister confirms she will not advise an
immediate return to full office working on that date. Instead the Scottish government will continue to work
with business to agree an appropriate phasing of this. This process will get under way when the country enters level zero next month. The pandemic has changed the way almost everyone does their job and Ms Sturgeon says she hopes home-working will be more possible post-Covid
than it was before. She adds: ""This wonât just assist with control
of the virus, it will also help promote well-being more generally."" Ms Sturgeon says vaccinations have changed the balance of the pandemic. She says the Scottish government wants to see testing and vaccines progressively reduce restrictions domestically and on travel in and out of the country, in response to Patrick Harvie's question. We have to be satisfied there is a degree of effectiveness. We will consider if testing in future, coupled with vaccination, can lead to a different approach to self isolation, particularly for contacts of positive cases. We need to look at all these things carefully before coming to final decisions but all of these things are under active consideration. Nicola Sturgeon, FM Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie asks if the Scottish government is open to what UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock is proposing - to end the requirement for international travel quarantine for vaccinated people or to end self isolation and replace it with lateral flow testing. However, the move has been criticised by public health experts. He asks if Ms Sturgeon agrees this would ""almost guarantee"" that new variants were imported and would then spread. Question from Calum in Golspie Calum from Golspie has been in touch to ask when Scotland will move into level zero. The first minister had previously indicated this would happen on 28 June. But in recent weeks rising case numbers, driven by the new faster transmitting Delta variant, has forced a rethink. Nicola Sturgeon has now confirmed the current levels will remain in place until 19 July - the day after all adults will have had their first
dose. From that date it is hoped all parts of the country will move to level zero. Ms Sturgeon cautioned that this milestone will depend on the data and Scotland meeting its vaccination targets. Anas Sarwar says: ""We must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown."" The Scottish Labour leader tells the chamber there must be effective communication and effective decision-making, adding ""that has frayed in recent weeks"". He calls for a commitment that if vaccine supplies allow, the speed of delivery can be ramped up. The Scottish Labour leader asks if there are still Covid hot spots and calls for the publication of hot spot protocols. He also calls for clearer protocols around financial support. The first minister replies intensive work on these issues is continuing. She says if supplies allow, the vaccination programme will be accelerated and that the finance secretary will continue to work with businesses to ensure financial support is accessed. In response to Douglas Ross' question, the first minister says most changes to weddings will hopefully come after 19 July when the limit is expected to be increased to 200. Nicola Sturgeon says she hopes that as we go to level 0 physical distancing will go from 2m to 1m - it is already 1m in hospitality. She says she hopes to remove the legal physical distancing constraints outdoors completely at that point and that from 9 August the legal requirement can be removed indoors, as long as we have gone beyond level 0. But some people may be advised to continue to keep to a safe distance. She says it may be that in some settings, such as schools, masks may still need to be worn for a bit longer. Question from Heather in Perth and Kinross Many people will be planning garden parties this weekend but restrictions on outdoor numbers remain in place. Perth and Kinross is currently in level one which means only a maximum of 12 people from 12 households are allowed to meet in a garden or public place. Under 12s do not count towards the total for outdoor meetings so unless Heather's party includes a dozen children then it would be a breach of the rules. Level zero would have seen the limit increase to 15 people from 15 households. But on Tuesday the first minister confirmed social gatherings of any size will now be allowed under level zero due to the ""reduced risk of outdoor transmission"". Leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, expresses his condolences for everyone that has lost a loved one to Covid-19. He says it is a shame the changes to weddings and funerals are only being made now - too late for many people. He asks the first minister if mitigations after 9 August include social distancing, particularly at hospitality venues, if limits will remain on indoor social gatherings and if the mitigations will include the wearing of masks in offices and schools? Question from David in Largs David from Largs emailed to ask why the first minister is proposing a move to level zero from 19 July when daily case numbers are soaring. Nicola Sturgeon said the timetable is based on evidence that the link between new
cases and serious health harm is weakening. The number of people being admitted to hospital with
Covid has fallen from around 10% of reported positive cases at the start of the
year, to around 5% now. Covid patients are also, on average, spending less time
in hospital. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs: ""Overall, the evidence that
vaccination is helping protect people from serious health harms is allowing us
to change how we respond to the virus."" Some changes to the rules on weddings and funerals will take effect from Monday 28 June. The changes will mean that suppliers of wedding
services, and other people employed by the couple getting married, will no
longer count towards the cap on numbers at a wedding. And those accompanying the wedding
couple down the aisle will no longer need to wear face coverings. Live entertainment at receptions
will be possible - although people will still need to be seated at tables. The guidance for
funerals will change from next week so that people from more than one household can help carry a coffin,
and take a cord when lowering it. Further changes should come on 19 July if Scotland goes to level 0. That would mean up to
200 people will be able to attend weddings and funerals. The first minister begins by confirming ""no part of
the country will change level next week"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9794739
"Cars could be heard using the car park through the town council's meeting A town council has held a meeting in a car park after legislation which allowed it to meet virtually expired. The governmentannounced in Marchthat it could not fit in legislation to allow online meetings to continue beyond May. As a result, Middlewich Town Council met outside its usual venue, Victoria Hall, on Monday, due to the building being used as a vaccination centre. Council clerk Lisa Benskin said it was ""extremely frustrating"". In avideo shared on social media,external, cars could be heard using the car park throughout the Cheshire authority's meeting. The hall would have been big enough to accommodate a socially distanced meeting of all those who normally attend if it had been available. The council's alternative plans to meet indoors on Monday at the smaller Middlewich Methodist Church were scuppered after Covid-19 rules on meetings were extended beyond 21 June and a postponement was not possible due to there being a time-sensitive item on the agenda. Ms Benskin said it was exasperating, as the council had been meeting using video conferencing app Zoom and would have loved to have been ""able to continue online meetings"", but no longer could legally. Jackie Weaver, who took charge of anow-infamous council Zoom meeting during lockdown, said it was ""ridiculous"" councils were ""in this position"". ""One might argue the government has more pressing issues on its mind, but local democracy is something that all of us have an interest in,"" she said, adding that it would ""only be a teeny-weeny bit of legislation"". Sue Baxter, chair of the National Association of Local Councils, said councils were being ""forced to find creative ways to meet in person"". ""You simply wouldn't see MPs and peers forced to meet in a car park or a field,"" she added.

No more talk of eliminating the virus, the aim now is supress it enough so it
will ""alleviate its harms"". This is a recognition that vaccines are
working well to prevent serious illness and while coronavirus is likely to put
additional strain on the NHS, it is not likely to result in it being
overwhelmed. It does mean difficult decisions will have
to be made on what is an acceptable level of Covid to live with.  Schools
for example, may be about to break up for the summer, but will they no longer
face interruptions if there are outbreaks when they return in the autumn? There is still plenty of uncertainty,
particularly around what the emergence of other variants might bring, and the first minister has left some room to pull back if required Allow Twitter content?

Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent It was well trailed and no surprise to see
the first minister retain the same restriction levels in Scotland.  We are on an upward curve of infections, a 40% increase on last week,
with cases at their highest point since late January. This wave, driven by the Delta variant
started in early May, but the positive news is that seven weeks on it has not
caused a big surge in the number of Covid patients in hospital.  They are
going up, but not nearly as fast as they were earlier in the year.  Experts
want this time to push forward with the vaccination programme and to gather
more data on just how well they are working. Vaccines look set to get us through this
wave without stretching the NHS and scientists are already working on
boosters.  But their success also poses a more difficult question for the
future around what are acceptable levels of Covid to live with? C'mon Scotland. During her statement the first minister wished Steve Clarke and the Scottish team all the best this evening. ""Tonightâs game is massive - we will all be cheering
Scotland on. But please do it safely,"" urged the first minister. You can followthe build up to tonight's crucial game against Croatia here. The crowd capacity at Wembley will be increased to more than 60,000 for the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020, says the UK government. It means the stadium will be at 75% capacity for the games.

Scotland's National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch highlights the two publications alluded to by the first minister in her statement. Question from Mike in Germany Mike has been in touch from Germany to ask if he can visit his holiday home in the Highlands. At the moment it is possible but he should be prepared for a longer and more expensive stay than normal. Germany is currently on the Scottish government'samber list,external. As a result visitors must complete apassenger locator form,externaland take aCovid test,externalbefore flying. Mike would also be required to book and pay Â£170 for a day two and day eighttravel test,external. Free NHS or private kits cannot be used. Once he arrives in Scotland he must isolate at his home for 10 days, during which time he must take the tests. Although Mike has been fully vaccinated the rules on managed quarantine and self-isolation still apply as it is not yet known if vaccines prevent people from spreading the virus. Willie Rennie raises the challenges faced by families with adults with special needs. The Scottish Lib Dem leader asks when the day services for adults with special needs will be reinstated. He then points out that thousands of fans went to London to see the Scotland v England game and received few words of criticism from the first minister. The first minister replies she could not have been clearer that she advised against travelling to London without a ticket and for people to follow the rules. Ms Sturgeon adds that services for adults with learning disabilities can reopen and councils must consider how they can safely reopen. Question from John in Glasgow John in Glasgow has asked BBC Scotland when staff will return to the office. By 9 August the vast majority of over 40s will have a significant level of protection. Despite this the first minister confirms she will not advise an
immediate return to full office working on that date. Instead the Scottish government will continue to work
with business to agree an appropriate phasing of this. This process will get under way when the country enters level zero next month. The pandemic has changed the way almost everyone does their job and Ms Sturgeon says she hopes home-working will be more possible post-Covid
than it was before. She adds: ""This wonât just assist with control
of the virus, it will also help promote well-being more generally."" Ms Sturgeon says vaccinations have changed the balance of the pandemic. She says the Scottish government wants to see testing and vaccines progressively reduce restrictions domestically and on travel in and out of the country, in response to Patrick Harvie's question. We have to be satisfied there is a degree of effectiveness. We will consider if testing in future, coupled with vaccination, can lead to a different approach to self isolation, particularly for contacts of positive cases. We need to look at all these things carefully before coming to final decisions but all of these things are under active consideration. Nicola Sturgeon, FM Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie asks if the Scottish government is open to what UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock is proposing - to end the requirement for international travel quarantine for vaccinated people or to end self isolation and replace it with lateral flow testing. However, the move has been criticised by public health experts. He asks if Ms Sturgeon agrees this would ""almost guarantee"" that new variants were imported and would then spread. Question from Calum in Golspie Calum from Golspie has been in touch to ask when Scotland will move into level zero. The first minister had previously indicated this would happen on 28 June. But in recent weeks rising case numbers, driven by the new faster transmitting Delta variant, has forced a rethink. Nicola Sturgeon has now confirmed the current levels will remain in place until 19 July - the day after all adults will have had their first
dose. From that date it is hoped all parts of the country will move to level zero. Ms Sturgeon cautioned that this milestone will depend on the data and Scotland meeting its vaccination targets. Anas Sarwar says: ""We must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown."" The Scottish Labour leader tells the chamber there must be effective communication and effective decision-making, adding ""that has frayed in recent weeks"". He calls for a commitment that if vaccine supplies allow, the speed of delivery can be ramped up. The Scottish Labour leader asks if there are still Covid hot spots and calls for the publication of hot spot protocols. He also calls for clearer protocols around financial support. The first minister replies intensive work on these issues is continuing. She says if supplies allow, the vaccination programme will be accelerated and that the finance secretary will continue to work with businesses to ensure financial support is accessed. In response to Douglas Ross' question, the first minister says most changes to weddings will hopefully come after 19 July when the limit is expected to be increased to 200. Nicola Sturgeon says she hopes that as we go to level 0 physical distancing will go from 2m to 1m - it is already 1m in hospitality. She says she hopes to remove the legal physical distancing constraints outdoors completely at that point and that from 9 August the legal requirement can be removed indoors, as long as we have gone beyond level 0. But some people may be advised to continue to keep to a safe distance. She says it may be that in some settings, such as schools, masks may still need to be worn for a bit longer. Question from Heather in Perth and Kinross Many people will be planning garden parties this weekend but restrictions on outdoor numbers remain in place. Perth and Kinross is currently in level one which means only a maximum of 12 people from 12 households are allowed to meet in a garden or public place. Under 12s do not count towards the total for outdoor meetings so unless Heather's party includes a dozen children then it would be a breach of the rules. Level zero would have seen the limit increase to 15 people from 15 households. But on Tuesday the first minister confirmed social gatherings of any size will now be allowed under level zero due to the ""reduced risk of outdoor transmission"". Leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, expresses his condolences for everyone that has lost a loved one to Covid-19. He says it is a shame the changes to weddings and funerals are only being made now - too late for many people. He asks the first minister if mitigations after 9 August include social distancing, particularly at hospitality venues, if limits will remain on indoor social gatherings and if the mitigations will include the wearing of masks in offices and schools? Question from David in Largs David from Largs emailed to ask why the first minister is proposing a move to level zero from 19 July when daily case numbers are soaring. Nicola Sturgeon said the timetable is based on evidence that the link between new
cases and serious health harm is weakening. The number of people being admitted to hospital with
Covid has fallen from around 10% of reported positive cases at the start of the
year, to around 5% now. Covid patients are also, on average, spending less time
in hospital. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs: ""Overall, the evidence that
vaccination is helping protect people from serious health harms is allowing us
to change how we respond to the virus."" Some changes to the rules on weddings and funerals will take effect from Monday 28 June. The changes will mean that suppliers of wedding
services, and other people employed by the couple getting married, will no
longer count towards the cap on numbers at a wedding. And those accompanying the wedding
couple down the aisle will no longer need to wear face coverings. Live entertainment at receptions
will be possible - although people will still need to be seated at tables. The guidance for
funerals will change from next week so that people from more than one household can help carry a coffin,
and take a cord when lowering it. Further changes should come on 19 July if Scotland goes to level 0. That would mean up to
200 people will be able to attend weddings and funerals. The first minister begins by confirming ""no part of
the country will change level next week"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.8975211
"White working class pupils have been failed by decades of neglect in England's education system, a report by MPs says. The Education Select Committee accused the government of a lack of targeted support for disadvantaged white pupils. It says use of the term ""white privilege"", suggesting white pupils are at an advantage, is the ""opposite"" of the reality for poor white pupils. The government says it is committed to making sure no child is left behind. The report warns that white pupils on free school meals underachieve from early years in school through to GCSE, A-levels and university entry, compared with pupils on free meals from other ethnic groups. Committee chairman Robert Halfon said it was a ""major social injustice"" that so little had been done to address this gap in attainment - and accused the government of ""muddled thinking"" in suggesting it could be explained by poverty. ""If you think it's about poverty, then it doesn't explain why most other ethnic groups do much better,"" he said. Poorer white pupils are falling behind ""every step of the way"", he warned, and with almost a million young people being affected, it could not be ""swept under the carpet"". At GCSE, in 2019, 18% of white British pupils on free meals achieved grade 5 in English and maths, compared with 23% for the average for pupils on free meals For university entry, 16% of white British pupils on free meals get places, compared with 59% of black African pupils on free meals, 59% of Bangladeshi pupils on free meals and 32% of black Caribbean pupils on free meals. The places where people live and their local challenges were part of the bigger picture of achievement, MPs reported Mr Halfon warned against using the term ""white privilege"" in education, saying it was divisive and likely to ""promote disharmony"" and ""pits one group against another"". The committee described white privilege, which has been used in a wider social context, as the idea of ""societal privilege that benefits white people over other ethnic groups"". The committee said that in education ""privilege is the very opposite to what disadvantaged white children"" experience - and questioned whether under equality legislation schools should use that terminology. But a Labour MP on the committee, Kim Johnson, rejected the reference to white privilege as a red herring which was trying to ""stoke the culture war"" and avoid scrutiny of the ""lack of investment"" in schools and local communities. The report highlighted a mix of challenges about the local areas where many poor white pupils lived - and also ""cultural factors"" that could limit how much support they got from their families. These underlying social problems included: Poor local jobs market and lack of opportunity Lack of community assets and social organisations, poor local services and transport Families with ""multi-generational poverty"" Disengaged parents with a poor experience of education In response, the committee proposed more targeted funding and making the education system feel more relevant for these communities. Using pupil premium funding to provide more support ""Family hubs"" to get parents involved with children's learning Attract teachers to areas that can struggle to retain staff Ensure that work-related, vocational education is available ""Find a better way to talk about racial disparities"" Oliver is planning to go to university - and warns about stereotypes being created about white working class teenagers ""There's this nagging feeling that it's not for me,"" says 18-year-old Oliver Jones-Lyons, describing the ""suspicions"" about the value of education that he thinks hold back some white working class communities. He has been a pupil on free meals at a school near Newcastle and says there is still a concern about the education system harbouring snobbery and class prejudice, even down to stereotypes about regional accents which ""mark you out as different"". There's an inclination to turn away from exams and instead say ""my dad can get us a job"". ""There's a lack of explanation of how education is helping you,"" Oliver says. But he argues ""the biggest barriers to education are outside education"" - in places with limited job opportunities, bad housing, poor public transport and families not able to support their children in school. And he says that while he describes himself as a ""white working class boy"" he doesn't like the way that the label is being used to ""create more stereotypes"". ""It shouldn't be about putting people against each other"" or about ""culture wars"", he says, and rejects the white working class identity being caricatured as being bigoted or narrow minded. A better description would be people ""more likely to undersell ourselves"" and to dislike showing off, says Oliver. But his own ambition has been supported by working with the Social Mobility Foundation charity - and he is waiting to see if he gets the A-levels grades needed to get into Oxford University next year. The underachievement is down to a ""poisonous mix of place, family and local culture"", said Chris Zarraga, director of Schools North East, a regional network of head teachers in one of the areas with the biggest concentrations of disadvantaged white pupils. He said it meant tackling the consequences of ""long-term deprivation"", where there might be fifth and sixth generations of workless families. What is 'white privilege'? White working class boys least likely to go to university The left-behind towns with lowest university take-up Half of universities have fewer than 5% disadvantaged white students ""Schools can't do it alone,"" he said, warning that already the pandemic had seen schools having to cope with feeding and clothing pupils. ""We need a cross-party sense of urgency about solving these problems,"" he said. Mr Zarraga backed the targeted use of pupil premium funding and called for better ways of retaining teaching staff in the most challenging areas. Kerry would like her sons to be able to go to college and get an apprenticeship The report argues that vocational routes in education need to be clearly available - showing the connection between qualifications and work. This chimes with the concerns of Kerry, a mother in Mansfield who is thinking about what jobs will be available for her sons, Bailey and Finley, in the years ahead. Her own parents stepped from school into factory work, which she says offered secure jobs. The current world of employment seems more precarious, she says. ""I don't see good jobs arising, I don't think there's much opportunity out there,"" says Kerry. ""I want them to go to college, then get apprenticeships."" The aim is ""guaranteed work"" and she is worried about the cost of university. ""As a parent, I wouldn't be able to fund them to go,"" Kerry adds. Without tackling the underachievement of white working class pupils the wider aim of narrowing the attainment gap between rich and poor will fail, warned former Ofsted chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw ""Two thirds of children on free school meals live in these communities. We will never reduce educational inequality unless we urgently address this longstanding issue,"" he said. Labour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the MPs' report showed the Conservative Party has ""turned its back on these pupils who need most support, from knowingly underfunded free childcare places in early years to cutting the pupil premium"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""This government is focused on levelling up opportunity so that no young person is left behind. ""That's why we are providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade,"" added the DfE spokesman, with Â£3bn in recovery funding and existing plans to increase school budgets. ""The pupil premium is expected to increase to more than Â£2.5bn this year, through which schools can support pupils with extra teaching, academic support or activities like breakfast clubs or educational trips.""

This chimes with the concerns of Kerry, a mother in Mansfield who is thinking about what jobs will be available for her sons, Bailey and Finley, in the years ahead. Her own parents stepped from school into factory work, which she says offered secure jobs. The current world of employment seems more precarious, she says. ""I don't see good jobs arising, I don't think there's much opportunity out there,"" says Kerry. ""I want them to go to college, then get apprenticeships."" The aim is ""guaranteed work"" and she is worried about the cost of university. ""As a parent, I wouldn't be able to fund them to go,"" Kerry adds. Without tackling the underachievement of white working class pupils the wider aim of narrowing the attainment gap between rich and poor will fail, warned former Ofsted chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw ""Two thirds of children on free school meals live in these communities. We will never reduce educational inequality unless we urgently address this longstanding issue,"" he said. Labour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the MPs' report showed the Conservative Party has ""turned its back on these pupils who need most support, from knowingly underfunded free childcare places in early years to cutting the pupil premium"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""This government is focused on levelling up opportunity so that no young person is left behind. ""That's why we are providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade,"" added the DfE spokesman, with Â£3bn in recovery funding and existing plans to increase school budgets. ""The pupil premium is expected to increase to more than Â£2.5bn this year, through which schools can support pupils with extra teaching, academic support or activities like breakfast clubs or educational trips.""

"This video can not be played Jonathan Rees says he had no influence over the investigations into Daniel Morgan's murder A private detective who was a prime suspect during inquiries into the murder of Daniel Morgan has denied corruption hampered the police. An independent panel found evidence Jonathan Rees drank in pubs with police officers close to the investigation, even after he became a suspect. Mr Rees told the BBC he did not consider exchanging information with police officers as being corrupt. He was acquitted of murder in 2011 after the case against him collapsed. Daniel Morgan was found dead in a pub car park in South London in 1987. He had been attacked with an axe. Mr Rees - who in 2000 was convicted in a separate case on charges of conspiring to pervert the course of justice, along with a corrupt police officer - told the BBC he denied involvement in the murder. He said: ""Danny was my friend"", adding that his former business partner's death had caused him ""financial and business grief"". Despite four police investigations, there have been no convictions. In its report last week, the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel concludedforms of police corruption had hampered both the murder inquiry, and its own workto investigate the reasons why the case was never solved. I don't accept Met's apology - Daniel Morgan's son Daniel Morgan: Five investigations, not one conviction Daniel Morgan: Met accused of 'form of corruption' Jonathan Rees and Daniel Morgan ran a small private investigation agency, Southern Investigations, in the 1980s. Mr Rees concentrated on investigations for defence lawyers, while Daniel Morgan specialised as a bailiff and debt collector. According to the report of the independent panel, police became suspicious after seeing Jonathan Rees's ""extremely nervous"" behaviour on the night of the murder. Later an inquest witness claimed he had been told that Mr Rees had paid to have Mr Morgan murdered because the partners had fallen out over the running of the business. Police also considered a series of other possible motives for whoever carried out the murder, including that Mr Morgan might blow the whistle on corrupt police officers, financial pressures, a reprisal from someone he'd collected a debt from, or something in his private life. Daniel Morgan, Jonathan Rees's business partner, was found killed with an axe wound in a pub car park in 1987 Asked by the BBC if he had killed Daniel Morgan, Mr Rees said: ""No. For what motive?"" ""Danny was my friend... he taught me a lot and earned the firm a lot of money. It was a partnership. And so the more he brings in, the more I bring in, the more profits we get to share at the end of the year. And it worked well. ""So him dying caused me a massive amount of grief, financially and business-wise, because the partnership ceased to exist."" The independent panel found ""extensive evidence"" of links between Jonathan Rees, a police officer friend - Metropolitan Police detective sergeant Sid Fillery - and other officers, even after Mr Rees had become a suspect in the murder. Mr Rees accepts that at the time he regularly drank with serving police officers. But he said: ""Relationships between a journalist or private investigator with officers in the case, and lawyers and barristers exchanging information, I don't see that as corrupt. ""It's up to the individual officers and people involved to make sure that they don't break the law, they don't get involved in serious illegal activities."" Asked whether he personally knew any police officers who he regarded as corrupt, he said: ""I've never worked with them."" ""There were some people that I wouldn't cross the road to talk to them,"" he added. ""There were some wrong'uns, that they got themselves involved in things that were totally illegal and wrong."" So what information was considered by the panel about Mr Rees's relationships with police officers? It found there was past intelligence suggesting that of 19 former police officers associated with Mr Rees, his firm and Mr Fillery, 10 had been convicted of criminal offences and sent to prison. According to the panel, the offences included: false imprisonment perverting the course of justice drugs offences accepting a bribe obtaining property by deception accepting bribes for confidential information theft of files fraud related to computer misuse One officer had resigned while under investigation and another had been dismissed for failing to meet standards of honesty and integrity. Nigel Shepherd, a lawyer representing Mr Rees and Mr Fillery, said the intelligence report was an attempt by police to cover their ""shambolic investigation"" and its claims could not be verified. Mr Rees said he had employed some police officers who had been suspended for disciplinary reasons, though ""some we couldn't take on because of what they were accused of."" He insisted they were valuable to his firm as ""experienced investigators"" but ""it doesn't mean we condone anything they did"". However in 2000, Mr Rees was himself convicted of conspiring to pervert the course of justice with another corrupt officer, Det Con Austin Warnes. They arranged to plant drugs in the car of a young mother and have them discovered by the police. Jonathan Rees was working for her husband during a custody battle. Mr Rees told the BBC he was innocent of that offence and the conviction was being considered by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The CCRC told us it had rejected his application for an appeal in December. The panel found evidence that of 19 police officers associated with Mr Rees and his firm, 10 were later convicted of offences The panel also revealed a Metropolitan Police analysis from 2000 detailing 273 cases where ""journalists were provided with confidential information"" by Mr Rees's company. Mr Rees told the BBC he had never paid police officers cash, but that he did pay their expenses and bought them drinks and meals. Mr Rees also dismissed suggestions that his decision to give Mr Fillery a job at Southern Investigations after Morgan's death was part of a plan to fill a ""dead man's shoes"". Mr Fillery worked on the Met Police's initial investigation into Mr Morgan's murder, and at one point took a witness statement from his friend, Jonathan Rees. He then went on to join Southern Investigations. Mr Rees said this was ""nearly two years"" after Daniel Morgan's murder. Yet the panel report refers to evidence that Mr Fillery, while he was a detective, told other officers seven months after the murder that he might go and work for Mr Rees, and before taking the job, he worked without pay at the firm. The panel concluded there was evidence indicating Mr Rees had a ""very close and unprofessional relationship with Det Sgt Fillery"". At one point the officer had left a police file in his car. The panel report contains dozens of allegations about or criticisms of Mr Rees. He was sent a long list before it was published. But the panel did not accuse him or anyone else of involvement in Mr Morgan's murder. It is not a court, and that was not its remit. Mr Rees said the reason the case against him and other defendants had collapsed was not because of police corruption, but because ""there was no evidence against us"". Allegations against him came in ""anonymous phone calls, letters, gossip, and vicious rumours"". Jonathan Rees and his lawyer, Nigel Shepherd, also believe police incompetence is the main reason why Mr Morgan's killer was never found. Mr Shepherd points to the panel's revelation that 30 years after the murder, a Parker pen - likely to be MrMorgan's - was found in a police store where it had been kept after being recovered from his car. Mr Rees's statement in 1987 included a suggestion that his business partner had been writing with it as they sat together in a pub, shortly before he was attacked and killed. The pen was not found, casting doubt on this account. Mr Rees believes police were ""blinkered"", pursuing one line of inquiry, that he was part of a murder conspiracy. He continues to work as a private investigator.

"Under-18s who want nude pictures or videos of themselves removed from the internet can now report the images throughan online tool.,external The service - from the Internet Watch Foundation and Childline - aims to help children who have been groomed, or whose partners have posted photos of them online. The IWF will examine the images and try and remove them if they break the law. It says the tool is a ""world first"" and could help many worried children. The IWF works to remove child abuse material from the internet. The charity says there are a number of reasons a young person might send nude images or videos without knowing they will be posted online, including grooming and coercion. Some may have also sent images for fun, or to a boyfriend or girlfriend who has since shared them without their consent. In recent years, the IWF says it has noticed more and more of these types of images online that have been created by children themselves. In the first three months of this year, 38,000 self-generated images were reported - double the amount in comparison to the same time last year. But now for the first time, people under the age of 18 who are concerned that a nude photo of them is online - or could potentially end up there - can now flag up the content using the Report Remove tool on the NSPCC's Childline service's website. 'My sister found me in revenge porn online' 'Revenge porn' helpline sees lockdown cases surge If a picture or video has already appeared online, they can share the URL and the charity will examine the images. If the pictures break the law, the IWF will work to have them removed. And if the content has not yet appeared online but a person is worried it might, the charity can create a digital fingerprint for the picture - known as a hash - which will be shared with tech companies and law enforcement around the world to help prevent it from being uploaded and shared. Young people can report the images anonymously, as long as they verify their age, or they can leave their details and get support from Childline. Anyone who makes a report should expect to receive feedback on the outcome in one working day. The head of the IWF, Susie Hargreaves, said the tool was a ""world first"" and the new tool ""will give young people the power, and the confidence, to reclaim these images and make sure they do not fall into the wrong hands online"". ""Once those images are out there, it can be an incredibly lonely place for victims, and it can seem hopeless,"" she said. ""It can also be frightening, not knowing who may have access to these images."" This video can not be played Should websites be responsible for 'revenge pornography' posts? Childline also said many children in that situation could be feeling extremely worried and unsure on what to do or who to turn to for support. It gave the example of one 14-year-old girl who contacted Childline and said: ""I don't know what to do because this Instagram account keeps posting pictures of me and they keep saying they're going to follow my friends so they can see them too. ""It all started after I shared naked pics with someone who I thought was a friend but it turned out to be a fake account. I just feel so hopeless and I don't know how to make it stop.""

"Government borrowing fell in May compared with the same month last year, with the economy in recovery mode after lockdown measures eased. Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was Â£24.3bn, official figures show, which was Â£19.4bn lower than May last year. However, the figure was the second-highest for May since records began. Borrowing has been hitting record levels, with billions being spent on measures such as furlough payments. The huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed government debt up to nearly Â£2.2 trillion, or about 99.2% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s. Where does the government borrow billions from? The Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) now estimates that the government borrowed a total of Â£299.2bn in the financial year to March. While that was down by Â£1.1bn from its previous estimate, it remains the highest level since the end of World War Two. The ONS said the cost of measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic meant that day-to-day spending by the government rose by Â£204.2bn to Â£942.6bn last year. These figures show how rapidly borrowing can fall, even as the government spends more, not less - and keeps taxes down to help boost the recovery. Because restrictions in May were lighter than the same month a year before, the amount of tax coming in jumped by 15% and central government spending dropped by 12%. So far this financial year, the government is estimated to have spent Â£53bn more than its income from taxes. While that has meant the second-highest borrowing on record, it's Â£38bn less than in the same period last year and less than most economists expected. The latest revisions for the year to March 2021 confirm what we already knew - that the government spent more than it has before in peacetime. It is now estimated to have had to borrow Â£299bn to plug the gap between its income and its spending in the pandemic's worst year. But it's also worth noting that this is Â£28bn less than was officially forecast in the Budget. While debt is high at Â£2.2 trillion, that's slightly less than the size of the economy (compared to more than twice the size of the economy in World War Two). And the cost of interest on central government debt - Â£4.3bn in May - is comfortably manageable. As the pandemic restrictions have eased, so too has the pressure on the public finances. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check looks at what countries can do about their pandemic debt Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said public borrowing was continuing to decline more rapidly than had been expected by the spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). ""The stronger-than-expected economy meant that central government receipts came in at Â£56.9bn in May, above the OBR's Â£55.2bn forecast,"" he pointed out. ""Public borrowing will continue to undershoot the OBR's Budget forecast, given that GDP in 2021 likely will be about 3% higher than it expected this year,"" he added. ""That windfall will be offset only partially by higher-than-expected interest payments, due to rising RPI inflation, and the likelihood that the government will extend Covid-19 related health spending into next winter."" Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, agreed that a strong economic recovery was starting to feed through into lower government borrowing. ""The trend in tax receipts should continue to improve over the rest of the year, as stronger GDP growth than anticipated by the OBR boosts the public coffers,"" he said. ""That means the Chancellor [Rishi Sunak] may be spared having to implement his proposed tax hikes/spending cuts before the 2024 general election."" In a statement, Mr Sunak said the government was ""continuing to support people and businesses to get back on their feet"" as the country emerged from the pandemic. However, he added that it was ""also important over the medium term to get the public finances on a sustainable footing"". How does the government borrow money? Can countries pay back pandemic debt?

"One farmer says his phone mast rent income dropped from Â£5,500 to Â£3.50 per year Rent reductions will make landowners reluctant to let phone masts be put on their property, an MP has warned. Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts is calling on the UK government to ensure landowners get a fair return to protect mobile connectivity. The 2017 Electronic Communications Code (ECC) allowed telecoms companies to vastly reduce many rents they paid. The UK government said it would legislate to encourage ""collaborative negotiations"". Why does Wales need more mobile phone masts than England? Planning rules relaxed for masts of up to 25m Ed Bailey, a farmer and chartered surveyor from Llanbedr, near Harlech in Gwynedd, originally agreed a rent of Â£5,500 a year in 2017 to have a telecoms mast on his land. But after telecoms companies were given more powers in a review of key legislation, the rent offer was reduced to Â£3.50 a year. Ed Bailey - a farmer and chartered surveyor from Llanbedr near Harlech - has been affected by the rent reduction ""We've been taken advantage of as a family, and obviously it puts doubts into wanting to work with a company again,"" said Mr Bailey. ""I think it's created a situation which has actually slowed down digital connectivity."" The changes to the ECC, the legislation which governs the relationship between mast operators and landowners, were meant to speed up the roll-out of new masts and improve connectivity across the UK, especially the 5G network. But campaign group Protect and Connect say the changes to the code in 2017 have had the opposite effect. Major mobile operators outshone by smaller rivals 'My reception was so bad even O2 couldn't call me' The group has called for further changes to the ECC, especially to the method for calculating rent introduced by the 2017 revision which is based on the minimal value of the land. In rural areas this means agricultural land prices, which does not take into account the value of the telecoms equipment that will be located on the land. Campaigners say the ""power balance has swung too far"" in favour of the telecoms companies. Chair of Protect and Connect Anna Turley is campaigning for a better deal for landowners Protect and Connect chairwoman Anna Turley said: ""These changes are having a significant effect on thousands of people who have committed to support better connectivity in this country by having phone masts on their land. ""The power balance has swung too far and many ordinary people are finding themselves on the end of aggressive behaviour by these companies as well as losing out financially. ""Many are now asking if it's worth hosting the sites at all or are getting bogged down in court. ""The worry is that this imbalance of power through the code is hampering better access at the time we need it the most."" Ms Turley added that the revised code means landowners' only option is to take the companies to court. ""The power is completely in the hands of these companies - who can afford to take on these huge giants with their big legal budgets?"" she asked. Liz Saville Roberts, MP for Dwyfor Meirionydd, warned the UK government will struggle to meet network improvement targets. ""In a rural area like Dwyfor Meirionydd this really rings alarm bells as to whether we're going to be able to continue to roll out the improvement with mobile connectivity which we so desperately need,"" she said. ""If we don't have that in our rural areas, we will be left behind."" Mobile firms sign up to Â£1bn rural coverage plan Is it the end of the line for landline phones? The UK government's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has been consulting on the impact of the revised ECC and is considering further changes. A DCMS spokesperson said: ""Our priority is levelling up the country with better mobile coverage and to do so quickly we need fair prices to be agreed for the right to access land and install new equipment. ""We are aware of concerns raised about the code and have confirmed we will legislate to encourage fairer, faster and more collaborative negotiations with network operators.""

"This video can not be played Students discussing studying for their GCSEs while simultaneously battling Covid Pupils across Wales are getting A-levels, GCSE and AS grades, with concern that some may be ""in limbo"" for weeks before results are confirmed. Provisional results are being shared by schools and colleges throughout June after teachers set the grades for their students. University places will not be confirmed until after the official A-level results day on 10 August. Pupils can appeal if they are unhappy with their results. Arrangements for sharing results are different depending on the school and college - some pupils are receiving emails at home, while others are getting grades face-to-face. Schools want 75% rebate on this year's exam fees Welsh review to be held into harassment in schools Exams to resume in the next school year There is some concern A-level pupils, especially those who are disappointed with grades, will not get certainty about the next steps until August. Pupils who have taken vocational qualification will also have to wait for their full set of results. Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland has called on pupils to be given ""guidance, support and information"" The children's commissioner for Wales has written to Universities UK urging universities to offer ""guidance, support and information"" to pupils who may not have got the grades they need. In the letter, Sally Holland said she fears the two months until results day could feel like ""an uncertain period of limbo"". ""I am particularly concerned about the potential effect of this on the wellbeing of some young people, who may already have fragile wellbeing following this very difficult period"", she said. Lois is 17 and studied her A-levels at Ysgol Gyfun Gwynllyw in Pontypool, Torfaen. The teenager has already had her interim A-Level results and plans to appeal one of her grades. ""I feel like it's new for everybody. Even though everything's a bit on the rocks, it's new for everyone,"" she said. ""I'm in a good position really. I don't mind waiting because my teachers have helped me through it and I know they're going to make sure I come out with the best grade I can."" Mali has the grades she needs to study chemistry at university Mali is 18 and an A-Level student in Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy in Llanrwst. She has the grades she needs to study chemistry in university, but still has to wait for confirmation in August. ""A few of my friends are a little bit disappointed with one or two of their grades so they're going to go through the appeals process,"" she explained. ""It's quite difficult to know whether to celebrate or not at the moment because these are only provisional grades and it's difficult to know whether they'll change or not for my friends who are waiting for the appeals process."" Universities UK said it recognised the challenges for students this year and ""stand ready to support students in Wales over the summer in the lead up to results day in August and beyond."" ""Universities UK is working with other higher education bodies to ensure that students and parents understand what provisional results will mean for them and will tailor their support for students accordingly."" College Merthyr Tydfil has been holding a ""future pathways"" event to support students with the next steps, after Centre Determined Grades (CDGs) were shared via email. It includes workshops involving employers and universities and key information about university admissions and the clearing process. Chris Ford, director of learning at Merthyr College, says provisional grades leave students ""in a state of limbo"" Chris Ford, director of learning at the college, said ""learner wellbeing"" had to be at the heart of everything. ""The Centre Determined Grades are provisional and that places our learners in a state of limbo if you like until they receive confirmation from the awarding body on 10 August,"" Mr Ford said. ""So what we've tried to do is to keep learners engaged and focused on the next steps of their educational journey by providing a transitional programme. ""What we're trying to do is to reduce some of those anxiety levels for learners and provide them with some reassurance."" A-level students Niamh Broad and Joseph Hopkins say they are relieved to have an idea of how they have done Seventeen-year-old Niamh, from Merthyr Tydfil, has received her provisional AS grades. ""Obviously this year has been weird but it's nice to have an idea of what you've got even though they still are provisional and they're not definite."" She said it was still ""the same sort of adrenaline"" opening the email with her grades. She has a year to go but, she says there is ""a lot of stress and anxiety"" for those waiting for confirmation of university places. Joseph, 17, is also at the end of the first year of A-levels and is pleased to get some ""clarity on the standard of working"" through provisional results. ""It's a different way to get them, obviously - on the email, not a letter and coming in and they are still provisional. But I'm confident that what I've got, I've earnt it and deserved it.""

"This video can not be played Eighteen-year-old Frankie Morris went missing on 2 May after going to a rave in Gwynedd A charity which supports young artists is being set up in memory of a teenager who was found dead after being missing for almost a month. Frantisek ""Frankie"" Morris, from Llandegfan, Anglesey, disappeared on 2 May after going to a rave in Gwynedd. Despite an intensive search, the 18-year-old's body was not found until 3 June in dense woodland near Bangor. His mother Alice Morris has spoken of how she ""feared the worst"" from the moment her son disappeared. She now wants to set up a charitable foundation to support young people like Frankie, who was a keen graffiti artist. Alice Morris spoke about the pain of losing her teenage son Ms Morris, who now lives in the Czech Republic, travelled to Wales when she heard Frankie was missing. She said even before she set off, the support from Frankie's friends and the wider community helped her to stay strong at a ""horrendous"" time. ""The response was overwhelming. There were so many people messaging me and other members of the family,"" she said. ""I just would like to express my sincere and heartfelt thanks because it was just really nice to have such a big response and many people really trying hard to find him. ""I feared the worst from the very beginning. Knowing Frankie, this was totally out of character that he would just disappear and wouldn't tell anybody where he was going. Frankie disappeared after going to a rave in Waunfawr ""I was glad that his body was found because there are cases when bodies have never been found and it's big trauma for the relatives. ""So in this way I was glad that Frankie's body was found, but obviously it wasn't good news."" Frankie was well known in the community around Bangor and Caernarfon for his graffiti tags, often based on the word ""crazy"". Inquest opens into teenager Frankie Morris' death Police confirm body in woods is missing teenager Missing teen's graffiti 'should be preserved' A petition has been set upto keep one of these on the old post office in Bangor as a permanent memorial to him. Ms Morris said: ""The main thing about him was that he was very authentic. There were never any pretentions about him. ""He was always very much into things that were outdoors, so he loved being in the countryside. ""He loved things like things like snowboarding and skateboarding, anything to do with physical activity. ""He was interested in drawing, the arts, he loved to draw, he did graffiti. ""His graffiti brings back very happy memories because it's like seeing Frankie himself. ""The graffiti he did that is sprayed on the post office in Bangor - it would be really nice if it's going to be preserved. ""There is a petition that many people have signed, and I guess - for me and for many people as well - it would be nice if it just stayed there."" Flowers were left in tribute under some of Frankie's graffiti artwork North Wales Police says there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding Frankie Morris's death. A post mortem examination found he died as a result of hanging, andan inquest is due to take place in September. Ms Morris says she hopes the inquest will give her some answers as to the circumstances surrounding why her son died. For now, she is focusing on setting up a long-term memorial to him. ""Frankie wanted to travel the world in a van, and had some money saved for this dream,"" she said. ""I thought that a good way of using this money would be to start a foundation which I am going to call the Frankie Morris Foundation. ""We are just thinking about what is going to be its exact purpose. ""But so far, I can say that it's going to be a charity, it is going to be based on Anglesey and the purpose of it will be to support young artists who want to be creative and do art. ""It would be nice if there was a place on Anglesey where artists could meet, do their art and share inspiration with each other. ""My favourite Welsh painter, Kyffin Williams, comes from Anglesey and there is a big legacy left by his work and his connection to the island. ""It would be nice if Frankie could be remembered by something positive and creative - something that would inspire people.""

"Founder Whitney Wolfe Herd recently oversaw Bumble's debut on the stock market Bumble, the dating app where women are in charge of making the first move, has temporarily closed all of its offices this week to combat workplace stress. Its 700 staff worldwide have been told to switch off and focus on themselves. One senior executive revealed on Twitter that founder Whitney Wolfe Herd had made the move ""having correctly intuited our collective burnout"". Bumble has had a busier year than most firms, with a stock market debut, and rapid growth in user numbers. The company announced in April ""that all Bumble employees will have a paid, fully offline one-week vacation in June"". A spokeswoman for Bumble said a few customer support staff will be working in case any of the app's users experience issues. These employees will then be given time off to make sure they take a whole week of leave. The spokeswoman confirmed that the majority of Bumble's staff are taking the week off. Bumble has grown in popularity during lockdown as boredom set in and swiping to find a match picked up. The number of paid users across Bumble and Badoo, which Bumble also owns, spiked by 30% in the three months to 31 March, compared with the same period last year,according to its most recent set of results.,external Ms Wolfe Herd also became the youngest woman, at 31, to take a company public in the US when she oversaw Bumble's stock market debut in February. Is Big Tech going off remote working? The tech billionaire who is putting women first She rang the Nasdaq bell with her 18-month-old baby son on her hip and in her speech she said she wanted to make the internet ""a kinder, more accountable place"". By Dearbail Jordan In your face: Bumble's head office is all about positivity Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd's quest to make the internet a ""kinder"" place extends to the company's head office. And then some. Back in 2017, the firm unveiled its new headquarters in Texas. Saturated in Bumble's signature yellow, wall mirrors are emblazoned with messages such as ""you look bee-autiful honey"". Even the light switches have slogans, telling people to ""shine bright like a diamond"". It also boasts a ""Mommy Bar"" - described as a ""private lactation space"" by Ms Wolfe Herd - as well as fortnightly manicures, hair trims and ""blowouts"" which the founder said showed ""appreciation for our busy bees"". Working hours? Not nine to five apparently. Employees can choose the hours they want, just as long as the work gets done. Could the UK see the same sort of office environment here? With many people spending so much time at home recently, perhaps companies will follow through on making changes to working life. Just don't hold out for free manicures though. Workers in other industries have complained about working long hours and the effect on their well-being. Earlier this year, a group of younger bankers at Goldman Sachs warned they would be forced to quit unless conditions improved. They said they were working an average of 95 hours a week and slept five hours a night. A spokeswoman for the investment bank said at the time: ""A year into Covid, people are understandably quite stretched, and that's why we are listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them."" Prior to Covid, one of the most high-profile examples of overwork emerged in when Antonio Horta-Osorio, then the relatively new chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, was forced to take a leave of absence. After joining the bank in January 2011, Mr Horta-Osorio took eight weeks off from November afterprolonged insomnia led to exhaustion. Former Lloyds' Banking boss Antonio Horta-Osorio was forced to take time off due to exhaustion Following his return, Mr Horta-Osorio - now chairman of Credit Suisse - led a re-evaluation at the bank on the importance of mental health. Bumble made its announcement after several tech companies have unveiled their plans for remote working as the economy reopens. Twitter has said that it expects a majority of its staff to spend some time working remotely and some time in the office.That's despite its boss Jack Dorsey initially saying that,externalemployees could work from home ""forever"". And Google rejigged its timetablefor bringing people back to the workplace. As of 1 September, employees wishing to work from home for more than 14 days a year would have to apply to do so. But Apple employees have launched a campaign pushing back against boss Tim Cook's plans for a widespread return to the office, according to media reports earlier in June. It followed an all-staff memo in which the Apple chief executive said workers should be in the office at least three days a week by September. The key to coping with burnout is control, according to experts. ""Not everyone has the option of leaving their job but it's about doing what you can with the things you can control,"" says Siobhan Murray, author of 'The Burnout Solution'. Cary Cooper, president of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester, says it is ""important that individuals take control of their environment to manage the hours they work and ensure that they're socially connected."" He advises: Take control Don't work consistently long hours, engage in activities unrelated to work Connect socially with friends and people you like Have some 'me time' Avoid unhealthy behaviours and negative coping mechanisms Help other people Be positive But companies must play their part too, says Trades Union Congress health and safety officer, Shelly Asquith. Stress is an ""occupational hazard"" she says and it ""requires risk assessment and management to protect the wellbeing of staff"". Other companies, such as accountancy firm KPMG, have introduced new measures to combat the fatigue some workers might feel after more than a year of working in a less-than-ideal home set-up. Voice-only meetings, for example, are now required on Fridays to reduce the need for video calls. It is in stark contrast to comments made by KPMG's UK chairman, Bill Michael, in February when he told colleagues to ""stop moaning"" during a virtual meeting discussing the pandemic and possible cuts to their pay, bonuses and pensions. According to the Financial Times,external, Mr Michael also told employees to stop ""playing the victim card"". Mr Michael has since apologised and resigned.

"Government borrowing fell in May compared with the same month last year, with the economy in recovery mode after lockdown measures eased. Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was Â£24.3bn, official figures show, which was Â£19.4bn lower than May last year. However, the figure was the second-highest for May since records began. Borrowing has been hitting record levels, with billions being spent on measures such as furlough payments. The huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed government debt up to nearly Â£2.2 trillion, or about 99.2% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s. Where does the government borrow billions from? The Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) now estimates that the government borrowed a total of Â£299.2bn in the financial year to March. While that was down by Â£1.1bn from its previous estimate, it remains the highest level since the end of World War Two. The ONS said the cost of measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic meant that day-to-day spending by the government rose by Â£204.2bn to Â£942.6bn last year. These figures show how rapidly borrowing can fall, even as the government spends more, not less - and keeps taxes down to help boost the recovery. Because restrictions in May were lighter than the same month a year before, the amount of tax coming in jumped by 15% and central government spending dropped by 12%. So far this financial year, the government is estimated to have spent Â£53bn more than its income from taxes. While that has meant the second-highest borrowing on record, it's Â£38bn less than in the same period last year and less than most economists expected. The latest revisions for the year to March 2021 confirm what we already knew - that the government spent more than it has before in peacetime. It is now estimated to have had to borrow Â£299bn to plug the gap between its income and its spending in the pandemic's worst year. But it's also worth noting that this is Â£28bn less than was officially forecast in the Budget. While debt is high at Â£2.2 trillion, that's slightly less than the size of the economy (compared to more than twice the size of the economy in World War Two). And the cost of interest on central government debt - Â£4.3bn in May - is comfortably manageable. As the pandemic restrictions have eased, so too has the pressure on the public finances. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check looks at what countries can do about their pandemic debt Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said public borrowing was continuing to decline more rapidly than had been expected by the spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). ""The stronger-than-expected economy meant that central government receipts came in at Â£56.9bn in May, above the OBR's Â£55.2bn forecast,"" he pointed out. ""Public borrowing will continue to undershoot the OBR's Budget forecast, given that GDP in 2021 likely will be about 3% higher than it expected this year,"" he added. ""That windfall will be offset only partially by higher-than-expected interest payments, due to rising RPI inflation, and the likelihood that the government will extend Covid-19 related health spending into next winter."" Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, agreed that a strong economic recovery was starting to feed through into lower government borrowing. ""The trend in tax receipts should continue to improve over the rest of the year, as stronger GDP growth than anticipated by the OBR boosts the public coffers,"" he said. ""That means the Chancellor [Rishi Sunak] may be spared having to implement his proposed tax hikes/spending cuts before the 2024 general election."" In a statement, Mr Sunak said the government was ""continuing to support people and businesses to get back on their feet"" as the country emerged from the pandemic. However, he added that it was ""also important over the medium term to get the public finances on a sustainable footing"". How does the government borrow money? Can countries pay back pandemic debt?

"NHS patients in England will get greater control over their health and social care data under plans set out by the government, Matt Hancock says. It means people will be able to access their medical records from different parts of the NHS through various apps. However critics are worried that data could be misused and the system has not been properly explained to patients. In defending the plan, the health secretary said more effective use of data would deliver better patient care. New NHS patient data store delayed to September Doctors urge delay to England GP data scrape The new strategy, calledData Saves Lives,external, will give patients confidence that health and care staff have up-to-date information enabling them to make quicker, more informed decisions, the government said. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that improving data collection would mean staff spent less time looking for information and more time treating patients. Patients will be able to manage appointments, refill medications and speak with health staff when needed via apps, it said. More than two million people use the NHS app, which includes a person's Covid vaccination status and gives access to some services. ""The pandemic has taught us we must be bold and the great strides we have made on vaccines and treatments during this time have been made possible by the way we use data,"" Matt Hancock said. Mr Hancock said theuse of dexamethasone to treat Covidhad been discovered thanks to the use of data within the NHS and had gone on to save ""over a million lives"" around the world. ""The goal here and what I am determined to do, is to have trusted research environments which protect people's privacy whilst also allowing for us to get insights out of the data which saves lives,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. By Chris Vallance, BBC technology reporter The first three words of the new draft data strategy are ""Data Saves Lives"" - three words we are likely to hear repeated as ministers promote these plans. Data, we are told, was a vital resource in tackling the pandemic, and now there is an opportunity to build on that momentum. From the use of algorithms to predict who might be at greater risk from coronavirus, to the use of artificial intelligence to help analyse the brain scans of acute stroke patients, the document lists plenty of examples of what we might gain. The data resources of the NHS are potentially of huge value to research. But they also paint a rich and comprehensive picture of our lives. And privacy campaigners are already concerned about what may be buried in the small print. As part of the strategy the DHSC says it will introduce legislation to ""enable the proportionate sharing of data"". But Cori Crider, co-founder of Foxglove, which campaigns to stop abuse of digital technology, said the government took a ""collect it all first and ask questions later"" approach when it came to GP data and said the strategy included potential commercial uses of information. She told the Today programme that GP data was ""possibly the most valuable"" set of health information in the world and called for the DHSC to send a consent form to individuals offering them the chance to opt out. Ms Crider said that, while there were some positives in the strategy, people should be offered the option to opt out of specific uses of their data while allowing others. Mr Hancock said he thought consent should be at the heart of the strategy and believed the vast majority of people would be willing to share their data if there was a ""strong mission and purpose"" behind the use of data. Phil Booth, of advocacy group MedConfidential, said the draft strategy had not ""changed much"" and many of the ideas were similar to the scrappedCare.data planfrom 2014. He said: ""The biggest single issue is trust and unless the government gets this right they are going to collapse trust again."" Mr Booth said the doctor-patient relationship was vital and confidentiality was an important part of that. He said if people thought their data was being sold to commercial entities they may not want to tell their doctor some things. He said the government had become ""drunk on data"" during the pandemic - with people more willing to allow their information to be used for medical research. But he suggested two factors which made people less keen to share their data were if it was taken without their permission or if a commercial entity was involved. Earlier this month,the creation of a central digital databaseusing GP records in England was pushed back, amid concerns that patients needed more time to understand the system. Matthew Gould, chief executive of NHSX - the unit responsible for setting policy for the use of data and technology in the NHS - said patients needed to ""own their data"", have access to it and have confidence on how the NHS was handling it on their behalf. The proposals also include using data to analyse trends in the health of the nation, which the DHSC said could help improve commissioning and planning of services. The DHSC said that the NHS was committed to using data lawfully and holding it securely. The strategy has been published in draft form ahead of engagement with the sector over the summer, the DHSC said.

"David Moore said Brexit was a major factor in staff shortages A Michelin-star restaurant has said it will no longer open at lunchtimes due to a shortage of staff. David Moore, the founder of Pied Ã  Terre in London, said he decided to halt the restaurant's lunchtime menu to ""preserve"" his depleted workforce. ""If I slog them to death, in two weeks' time, I won't have a restaurant,"" he told the BBC. Mr Moore is the latest of several hospitality business owners to raise concerns over staff shortages. ""You struggle through everything that we have had to struggle through with Covid, and then you come back and you get another kick in the teeth,"" said Mr Moore. Waiters and waitresses are said to be short supply As the UK economy emerges from the effects of the pandemic, several industries have reported shortages of staff, with UK job vacancies hitting their highest level since March 2020. The hospitality sector has been hit harder than most, having to cease trading during lockdowns and operating under tight restrictions. It has led to many staff being placed on furlough, which has prompted some to leave the profession. Industry body UK Hospitality has said waiting staff and chefs are in particular demand. Where have all the UK workers gone? Hospitality 'struggling to fill thousands of jobs' Restaurateur Mr Moore said 800 people applied for a receptionist role in November 2020, but he received just seven responses when he re-advertised for the role three weeks ago, and no-one showed up to an interview. He said higher wages were ""still not getting the eyeballs"" on advertisements. ""I don't know anybody who is not looking for a kitchen porter,"" he added. Staff in the hospitality industry often work long hours Mr Moore said Brexit was ""definitely the biggest"" factor behind staff shortages, and he said the ""heartbeat"" of the hospitality industry was ""young kids"" coming from abroad to work in restaurants and bars to gain life experience and new skills. ""[The government] don't realise the huge commodity we have that they have excluded us from, that keeps this industry moving more than anything else,"" he said. He said before the pandemic, just three out of his 30-strong workforce were British. His restaurant currently has 12 staff. He said some workers who were furloughed during lockdown had moved back to their home nations and decided not to come back to the UK. ""Anecdotally, I have a lot of pals saying they are opening up restaurants and they are expecting their 18 employees to come back and only 12 turn up,"" The Pied Ã  Terre founder said. ""They don't say anything because they don't want to lose their furlough, so they don't mention anything until the last minute."" Mark Agnew manages Gylly Beach CafÃ© Mark Agnew, manager of Gylly Beach Cafe in Falmouth, Cornwall, said he will close every Monday and Tuesday due to staffing shortages. ""The main reason is a severe lack of trained professional chefs, [and] trained front of house,"" he said. ""There seems to be a national crisis that we are now feeling the effects of. Brexit I'm sure is a factor within this. Undoubtedly Covid and the continual lockdown, too."" Before Brexit a lot of the UK's hospitality workforce was made up of workers from overseas, including from the EU,but hundreds of thousands of foreign workers have left the UK in 2020and it is unclear whether they will return. According to UK Hospitality, 1.3m foreign workers left the UK during the pandemic. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said labour shortages appeared to be a ""perennial problem"" which had been ""aggravated further by many foreign workers not returning to the UK, either because of travel restrictions or their ability to resume work in the UK"". Itsu boss Julian Metcalfe said the food chain's ""young European chefs"" had ""now sadly all disappeared"" because ""they are not allowed in"". Mr Metcalfe said there were many reasons for staff shortages, but that Brexit posed a ""long term"" issue. Mr Moore echoed calls by Mr Metcalfe for the government to grant 18-month or two-year work visas to people wanting to work in hospitality in the UK. A government spokesman said it had ""implemented an unprecedented package of measures to support businesses"" during the pandemic and added it was working with UK Hospitality to ""better promote jobs in the sector"". ""We want employers to focus on training and investing in our domestic work force, rather than relying on labour from abroad. Employers should focus on getting people in the sector who are benefitting from the furlough scheme back to their roles when restrictions end,"" a statement added. Where have all the UK workers gone?

"This video can not be played Students discussing studying for their GCSEs while simultaneously battling Covid Pupils across Wales are getting A-levels, GCSE and AS grades, with concern that some may be ""in limbo"" for weeks before results are confirmed. Provisional results are being shared by schools and colleges throughout June after teachers set the grades for their students. University places will not be confirmed until after the official A-level results day on 10 August. Pupils can appeal if they are unhappy with their results. Arrangements for sharing results are different depending on the school and college - some pupils are receiving emails at home, while others are getting grades face-to-face. Schools want 75% rebate on this year's exam fees Welsh review to be held into harassment in schools Exams to resume in the next school year There is some concern A-level pupils, especially those who are disappointed with grades, will not get certainty about the next steps until August. Pupils who have taken vocational qualification will also have to wait for their full set of results. Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland has called on pupils to be given ""guidance, support and information"" The children's commissioner for Wales has written to Universities UK urging universities to offer ""guidance, support and information"" to pupils who may not have got the grades they need. In the letter, Sally Holland said she fears the two months until results day could feel like ""an uncertain period of limbo"". ""I am particularly concerned about the potential effect of this on the wellbeing of some young people, who may already have fragile wellbeing following this very difficult period"", she said. Lois is 17 and studied her A-levels at Ysgol Gyfun Gwynllyw in Pontypool, Torfaen. The teenager has already had her interim A-Level results and plans to appeal one of her grades. ""I feel like it's new for everybody. Even though everything's a bit on the rocks, it's new for everyone,"" she said. ""I'm in a good position really. I don't mind waiting because my teachers have helped me through it and I know they're going to make sure I come out with the best grade I can."" Mali has the grades she needs to study chemistry at university Mali is 18 and an A-Level student in Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy in Llanrwst. She has the grades she needs to study chemistry in university, but still has to wait for confirmation in August. ""A few of my friends are a little bit disappointed with one or two of their grades so they're going to go through the appeals process,"" she explained. ""It's quite difficult to know whether to celebrate or not at the moment because these are only provisional grades and it's difficult to know whether they'll change or not for my friends who are waiting for the appeals process."" Universities UK said it recognised the challenges for students this year and ""stand ready to support students in Wales over the summer in the lead up to results day in August and beyond."" ""Universities UK is working with other higher education bodies to ensure that students and parents understand what provisional results will mean for them and will tailor their support for students accordingly."" College Merthyr Tydfil has been holding a ""future pathways"" event to support students with the next steps, after Centre Determined Grades (CDGs) were shared via email. It includes workshops involving employers and universities and key information about university admissions and the clearing process. Chris Ford, director of learning at Merthyr College, says provisional grades leave students ""in a state of limbo"" Chris Ford, director of learning at the college, said ""learner wellbeing"" had to be at the heart of everything. ""The Centre Determined Grades are provisional and that places our learners in a state of limbo if you like until they receive confirmation from the awarding body on 10 August,"" Mr Ford said. ""So what we've tried to do is to keep learners engaged and focused on the next steps of their educational journey by providing a transitional programme. ""What we're trying to do is to reduce some of those anxiety levels for learners and provide them with some reassurance."" A-level students Niamh Broad and Joseph Hopkins say they are relieved to have an idea of how they have done Seventeen-year-old Niamh, from Merthyr Tydfil, has received her provisional AS grades. ""Obviously this year has been weird but it's nice to have an idea of what you've got even though they still are provisional and they're not definite."" She said it was still ""the same sort of adrenaline"" opening the email with her grades. She has a year to go but, she says there is ""a lot of stress and anxiety"" for those waiting for confirmation of university places. Joseph, 17, is also at the end of the first year of A-levels and is pleased to get some ""clarity on the standard of working"" through provisional results. ""It's a different way to get them, obviously - on the email, not a letter and coming in and they are still provisional. But I'm confident that what I've got, I've earnt it and deserved it."" ""Because it's not set in stone, it's hard to really celebrate until I've got them on paper... it's not 100% yet.""

"One farmer says his phone mast rent income dropped from Â£5,500 to Â£3.50 per year Rent reductions will make landowners reluctant to let phone masts be put on their property, an MP has warned. Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts is calling on the UK government to ensure landowners get a fair return to protect mobile connectivity. The 2017 Electronic Communications Code (ECC) allowed telecoms companies to vastly reduce many rents they paid. The UK government said it would legislate to encourage ""collaborative negotiations"". Why does Wales need more mobile phone masts than England? Planning rules relaxed for masts of up to 25m Ed Bailey, a farmer and chartered surveyor from Llanbedr, near Harlech in Gwynedd, originally agreed a rent of Â£5,500 a year in 2017 to have a telecoms mast on his land. But after telecoms companies were given more powers in a review of key legislation, the rent offer was reduced to Â£3.50 a year. Ed Bailey - a farmer and chartered surveyor from Llanbedr near Harlech - has been affected by the rent reduction ""We've been taken advantage of as a family, and obviously it puts doubts into wanting to work with a company again,"" said Mr Bailey. ""I think it's created a situation which has actually slowed down digital connectivity."" The changes to the ECC, the legislation which governs the relationship between mast operators and landowners, were meant to speed up the roll-out of new masts and improve connectivity across the UK, especially the 5G network. But campaign group Protect and Connect say the changes to the code in 2017 have had the opposite effect. Major mobile operators outshone by smaller rivals 'My reception was so bad even O2 couldn't call me' The group has called for further changes to the ECC, especially to the method for calculating rent introduced by the 2017 revision which is based on the minimal value of the land. In rural areas this means agricultural land prices, which does not take into account the value of the telecoms equipment that will be located on the land. Campaigners say the ""power balance has swung too far"" in favour of the telecoms companies. Chair of Protect and Connect Anna Turley is campaigning for a better deal for landowners Protect and Connect chairwoman Anna Turley said: ""These changes are having a significant effect on thousands of people who have committed to support better connectivity in this country by having phone masts on their land. ""The power balance has swung too far and many ordinary people are finding themselves on the end of aggressive behaviour by these companies as well as losing out financially. ""Many are now asking if it's worth hosting the sites at all or are getting bogged down in court. ""The worry is that this imbalance of power through the code is hampering better access at the time we need it the most."" Ms Turley added that the revised code means landowners' only option is to take the companies to court. ""The power is completely in the hands of these companies - who can afford to take on these huge giants with their big legal budgets?"" she asked. Liz Saville Roberts, MP for Dwyfor Meirionydd, warned the UK government will struggle to meet network improvement targets. ""In a rural area like Dwyfor Meirionydd this really rings alarm bells as to whether we're going to be able to continue to roll out the improvement with mobile connectivity which we so desperately need,"" she said. ""If we don't have that in our rural areas, we will be left behind."" Mobile firms sign up to Â£1bn rural coverage plan Is it the end of the line for landline phones? The UK government's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has been consulting on the impact of the revised ECC and is considering further changes. A DCMS spokesperson said: ""Our priority is levelling up the country with better mobile coverage and to do so quickly we need fair prices to be agreed for the right to access land and install new equipment. ""We are aware of concerns raised about the code and have confirmed we will legislate to encourage fairer, faster and more collaborative negotiations with network operators.""

"This video can not be played Jonathan Rees says he had no influence over the investigations into Daniel Morgan's murder A private detective who was a prime suspect during inquiries into the murder of Daniel Morgan has denied corruption hampered the police. An independent panel found evidence Jonathan Rees drank in pubs with police officers close to the investigation, even after he became a suspect. Mr Rees told the BBC he did not consider exchanging information with police officers as being corrupt. He was acquitted of murder in 2011 after the case against him collapsed. Daniel Morgan was found dead in a pub car park in South London in 1987. He had been attacked with an axe. Mr Rees - who in 2000 was convicted in a separate case on charges of conspiring to pervert the course of justice, along with a corrupt police officer - told the BBC he denied involvement in the murder. He said: ""Danny was my friend"", adding that his former business partner's death had caused him ""financial and business grief"". Despite four police investigations, there have been no convictions. In its report last week, the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel concludedforms of police corruption had hampered both the murder inquiry, and its own workto investigate the reasons why the case was never solved. I don't accept Met's apology - Daniel Morgan's son Daniel Morgan: Five investigations, not one conviction Daniel Morgan: Met accused of 'form of corruption' Jonathan Rees and Daniel Morgan ran a small private investigation agency, Southern Investigations, in the 1980s. Mr Rees concentrated on investigations for defence lawyers, while Daniel Morgan specialised as a bailiff and debt collector. According to the report of the independent panel, police became suspicious after seeing Jonathan Rees's ""extremely nervous"" behaviour on the night of the murder. Later an inquest witness claimed he had been told that Mr Rees had paid to have Mr Morgan murdered because the partners had fallen out over the running of the business. Police also considered a series of other possible motives for whoever carried out the murder, including that Mr Morgan might blow the whistle on corrupt police officers, financial pressures, a reprisal from someone he'd collected a debt from, or something in his private life. Daniel Morgan, Jonathan Rees's business partner, was found killed with an axe wound in a pub car park in 1987 Asked by the BBC if he had killed Daniel Morgan, Mr Rees said: ""No. For what motive?"" ""Danny was my friend... he taught me a lot and earned the firm a lot of money. It was a partnership. And so the more he brings in, the more I bring in, the more profits we get to share at the end of the year. And it worked well. ""So him dying caused me a massive amount of grief, financially and business-wise, because the partnership ceased to exist."" The independent panel found ""extensive evidence"" of links between Jonathan Rees, a police officer friend - Metropolitan Police detective sergeant Sid Fillery - and other officers, even after Mr Rees had become a suspect in the murder. Mr Rees accepts that at the time he regularly drank with serving police officers. But he said: ""Relationships between a journalist or private investigator with officers in the case, and lawyers and barristers exchanging information, I don't see that as corrupt. ""It's up to the individual officers and people involved to make sure that they don't break the law, they don't get involved in serious illegal activities."" Asked whether he personally knew any police officers who he regarded as corrupt, he said: ""I've never worked with them."" ""There were some people that I wouldn't cross the road to talk to them,"" he added. ""There were some wrong'uns, that they got themselves involved in things that were totally illegal and wrong."" So what information was considered by the panel about Mr Rees's relationships with police officers? It found there was past intelligence suggesting that of 19 former police officers associated with Mr Rees, his firm and Mr Fillery, 10 had been convicted of criminal offences and sent to prison. According to the panel, the offences included: false imprisonment perverting the course of justice drugs offences accepting a bribe obtaining property by deception accepting bribes for confidential information theft of files fraud related to computer misuse One officer had resigned while under investigation and another had been dismissed for failing to meet standards of honesty and integrity. Nigel Shepherd, a lawyer representing Mr Rees and Mr Fillery, said the intelligence report was an attempt by police to cover their ""shambolic investigation"" and its claims could not be verified. Mr Rees said he had employed some police officers who had been suspended for disciplinary reasons, though ""some we couldn't take on because of what they were accused of."" He insisted they were valuable to his firm as ""experienced investigators"" but ""it doesn't mean we condone anything they did"". However in 2000, Mr Rees was himself convicted of conspiring to pervert the course of justice with another corrupt officer, Det Con Austin Warnes. They arranged to plant drugs in the car of a young mother and have them discovered by the police. Jonathan Rees was working for her husband during a custody battle. Mr Rees told the BBC he was innocent of that offence and the conviction was being considered by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The CCRC told us it had rejected his application for an appeal in December. The panel found evidence that of 19 police officers associated with Mr Rees and his firm, 10 were later convicted of offences The panel also revealed a Metropolitan Police analysis from 2000 detailing 273 cases where ""journalists were provided with confidential information"" by Mr Rees's company. Mr Rees told the BBC he had never paid police officers cash, but that he did pay their expenses and bought them drinks and meals. Mr Rees also dismissed suggestions that his decision to give Mr Fillery a job at Southern Investigations after Morgan's death was part of a plan to fill a ""dead man's shoes"". Mr Fillery worked on the Met Police's initial investigation into Mr Morgan's murder, and at one point took a witness statement from his friend, Jonathan Rees. He then went on to join Southern Investigations. Mr Rees said this was ""nearly two years"" after Daniel Morgan's murder. Yet the panel report refers to evidence that Mr Fillery, while he was a detective, told other officers seven months after the murder that he might go and work for Mr Rees, and before taking the job, he worked without pay at the firm. The panel concluded there was evidence indicating Mr Rees had a ""very close and unprofessional relationship with Det Sgt Fillery"". At one point the officer had left a police file in his car. The panel report contains dozens of allegations about or criticisms of Mr Rees. He was sent a long list before it was published. But the panel did not accuse him or anyone else of involvement in Mr Morgan's murder. It is not a court, and that was not its remit. Mr Rees said the reason the case against him and other defendants had collapsed was not because of police corruption, but because ""there was no evidence against us"". Allegations against him came in ""anonymous phone calls, letters, gossip, and vicious rumours"". Jonathan Rees and his lawyer, Nigel Shepherd, also believe police incompetence is the main reason why Mr Morgan's killer was never found. Mr Shepherd points to the panel's revelation that 30 years after the murder, a Parker pen - likely to be MrMorgan's - was found in a police store where it had been kept after being recovered from his car. Mr Rees's statement in 1987 included a suggestion that his business partner had been writing with it as they sat together in a pub, shortly before he was attacked and killed. The pen was not found, casting doubt on this account. Mr Rees believes police were ""blinkered"", pursuing one line of inquiry, that he was part of a murder conspiracy. He continues to work as a private investigator.

"NHS patients in England will get greater control over their health and social care data under plans set out by the government, Matt Hancock says. It means people will be able to access their medical records from different parts of the NHS through various apps. However critics are worried that data could be misused and the system has not been properly explained to patients. In defending the plan, the health secretary said more effective use of data would deliver better patient care. New NHS patient data store delayed to September Doctors urge delay to England GP data scrape The new strategy, calledData Saves Lives,external, will give patients confidence that health and care staff have up-to-date information enabling them to make quicker, more informed decisions, the government said. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that improving data collection would mean staff spent less time looking for information and more time treating patients. Patients will be able to manage appointments, refill medications and speak with health staff when needed via apps, it said. More than two million people use the NHS app, which includes a person's Covid vaccination status and gives access to some services. ""The pandemic has taught us we must be bold and the great strides we have made on vaccines and treatments during this time have been made possible by the way we use data,"" Matt Hancock said. Mr Hancock said theuse of dexamethasone to treat Covidhad been discovered thanks to the use of data within the NHS and had gone on to save ""over a million lives"" around the world. ""The goal here and what I am determined to do, is to have trusted research environments which protect people's privacy whilst also allowing for us to get insights out of the data which saves lives,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. By Chris Vallance, BBC technology reporter The first three words of the new draft data strategy are ""Data Saves Lives"" - three words we are likely to hear repeated as ministers promote these plans. Data, we are told, was a vital resource in tackling the pandemic, and now there is an opportunity to build on that momentum. From the use of algorithms to predict who might be at greater risk from coronavirus, to the use of artificial intelligence to help analyse the brain scans of acute stroke patients, the document lists plenty of examples of what we might gain. The data resources of the NHS are potentially of huge value to research. But they also paint a rich and comprehensive picture of our lives. And privacy campaigners are already concerned about what may be buried in the small print. As part of the strategy the DHSC says it will introduce legislation to ""enable the proportionate sharing of data"". But Cori Crider, co-founder of Foxglove, which campaigns to stop abuse of digital technology, said the government took a ""collect it all first and ask questions later"" approach when it came to GP data and said the strategy included potential commercial uses of information. She told the Today programme that GP data was ""possibly the most valuable"" set of health information in the world and called for the DHSC to send a consent form to individuals offering them the chance to opt out. Ms Crider said that, while there were some positives in the strategy, people should be offered the option to opt out of specific uses of their data while allowing others. Mr Hancock said he thought consent should be at the heart of the strategy and believed the vast majority of people would be willing to share their data if there was a ""strong mission and purpose"" behind the use of data. Phil Booth, of advocacy group MedConfidential, said the draft strategy had not ""changed much"" and many of the ideas were similar to the scrappedCare.data planfrom 2014. He said: ""The biggest single issue is trust and unless the government gets this right they are going to collapse trust again."" Mr Booth said the doctor-patient relationship was vital and confidentiality was an important part of that. He said if people thought their data was being sold to commercial entities they may not want to tell their doctor some things. He said the government had become ""drunk on data"" during the pandemic - with people more willing to allow their information to be used for medical research. But he suggested two factors which made people less keen to share their data were if it was taken without their permission or if a commercial entity was involved. Earlier this month,the creation of a central digital databaseusing GP records in England was pushed back, amid concerns that patients needed more time to understand the system. Matthew Gould, chief executive of NHSX - the unit responsible for setting policy for the use of data and technology in the NHS - said patients needed to ""own their data"", have access to it and have confidence on how the NHS was handling it on their behalf. The proposals also include using data to analyse trends in the health of the nation, which the DHSC said could help improve commissioning and planning of services. The DHSC said that the NHS was committed to using data lawfully and holding it securely. The strategy has been published in draft form ahead of engagement with the sector over the summer, the DHSC said.

"The government should drop its ""disproportionate"" plan to ban noisy protests in England and Wales, a parliamentary committee has warned. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill would also introduce powers to deal with demonstrations involving only one person. The Joint Committee on Human Rights said the legislation could undermine freedom of expression. But the Home Office said it would not ""impinge"" on the right to protest. Existing laws are out of date and ""disruptive and dangerous tactics"" have to be dealt with, a spokeswoman added. The committee's chairwoman, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, said the plans were ""oppressive and wrong"". Government defends protests noise limit plan The bill,externalsays group protests should not be loud enough to cause ""serious unease, alarm or distress"" to people ""in the vicinity"". A noise limit would also apply to a single person if they caused ""serious disruption"" or if they ""may have a relevant impact on"" people nearby. In a report highly critical of the bill, the committee, which advises MPs and peers on the compatibility of all government bills with human rights laws, called for ""statutory protection"" for the right to hold protests to be introduced. It added that councils should be told to ""refrain from interfering unlawfully"" with them and be given ""the duty to facilitate protest"". The report also said the language used in the bill left an ""excessive degree of judgement in the hands of a police officer"". And it described the proposed limits on single-person protests as ""unprecedented"". This legislation comes after repeated city centre occupations by the Extinction Rebellion movement - and last year's toppling of the statue of a Bristol slave trader and municipal benefactor. The committee said allowing police to set noise limits could silence lawful and peaceful chants - and the most popular demonstrations could face restrictions on duration and location, interfering with the right to assembly. It also urges the government not to create powers to interfere with public demonstrations held by a single person and warns that a new crime of causing a public nuisance is too vague to be understood. MPs and peers don't need to act on the report, but the legislation has already triggered its own protests. And there are predictions it could lead to years of legal battles all the way to the Supreme Court. Commenting on the plans, committee chairwoman Ms Harman said: ""One of our most fundamental rights is to protest. It is the essence of our democracy. ""To do that, we need to make ourselves heard. The government proposals to allow police to restrict 'noisy' protests are oppressive and wrong."" Harriet Harman said the right to protest was the essence of democracy MPs have already backed the bill in principle and it is currentlyundergoing detailed scrutiny.,external It also outlines stronger police powers to break up ""unauthorised encampments"" and longer sentences for people convicted of serious crimes. The government said existing public order laws needed updating because ""the use of disruptive and dangerous tactics - including obstructing emergency vehicles or blocking the free press - costs millions to the taxpayer and causes misery to businesses and local communities"". ""The right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy,"" a Home Office spokeswoman said. ""Our proposed measures are in line with human rights legislation and in no way impinge on the right to protest."" The bill would allow police to ""better manage demonstrations so that legitimate protest groups can make their voices heard without disrupting the lives and livelihoods of others"", she added.

"This video can not be played During the King's speech at Belfast City Hall he made a call for reconciliation on the island of Ireland A special event has been held at Belfast City Hall to mark the 100th anniversary of the official opening of Northern Ireland's first parliament. It was opened by King George V, whose speech calling for reconciliation on the island was read once more. The royal visit on 22 June 1921 confirmed NI's creation. Some historians believe the speech helped end the War of Independence. The existence of the border remains a subject of political debate. Two former party leaders have made different predictions about the constitutional future of Northern Ireland. The new parliament was officially opened by King George V on 22 June 1921 Former Ulster Unionist leader Lord Empey has said he was convinced it will still exist in another century, while retired Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams said he there could be a united Ireland within the next 20 years. In a BBC News NI interview, Mr Adams, 72, was asked whether, if he lived to 90, he would see a united Ireland. ""I would imagine so, I would like to think so,"" he replied. ""I certainly think our children and our grandchildren will grow old in a united Ireland."" Actors Stephen Beggs and Mary Lindsay re-enacted the reading of King George V's speech at Belfast City Hall on Tuesday evening Events are being held throughout 2021 to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland including an inter-denominational church service and an investment conference. The visit to Belfast of King George V, the grandfather of the current Queen, was one of the landmark political events in 1921. He arrived by boat with his wife Queen Mary and went straight to Belfast City Hall by horse-drawn carriage to carry out the state opening of the newly-created parliament. It was set up two weeks previously, in line with the Westminster model of a lower and upper house. Huge crowds gathered at Belfast City Hall for the state opening of parliament in 1921 The Northern Ireland House of Commons contained 52 members but only the 40 unionists took their seats. The King addressed them in what is now the council chamber at Belfast City Hall. To mark the centenary of that event, Belfast City Council arranged an event on Tuesday evening at which the King's speech was read out again. At 22:30 BST, a lighting animation, featuring images of King George V's visit, will be projected on the facade of City Hall. The chairs used by the royal couple 100 years ago were retained and recently underwent conservation work - they featured in Tuesday's centenary event. King George V and Queen Mary sat on the chairs in Belfast City Hall 100 years ago Belfast Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that when that work took place deep-blue silk lining the chairs was discovered. Experts were able to trace the silk back to Portugal, where the chairs had belonged to King Manuel II, and when it became a republic, the deposed king moved to Twickenham in England. ""For some reason these chairs ended up in the ownership of Sir Crawford McCullagh who lent [them] to City Hall for the event and the council later bought them,"" said Ms Nicholl. Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl says the anniversary marks the ""shared complex history"" of Northern Ireland The 100th anniversary of the official opening of the Northern Ireland Parliament would mean different things to different people, said the lord mayor. ""Every political party signed up this programme of events,"" she said. ""I feel conscious of the magnitude of this day historically but also proud that we have been able to mark key events in the decade in such an inclusive way. ""I think you can be distracted by the dysfunction of Stormont sometimes but if you look at local leadership it can be heartening as there is collaboration and cross-community work. ""The majority of people are able to be good neighbours and work well together."" The BBC News NI website has a dedicated section marking the 100th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland and partition of the island.

"The government should drop its ""disproportionate"" plan to ban noisy protests in England and Wales, a parliamentary committee has warned. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill would also introduce powers to deal with demonstrations involving only one person. The Joint Committee on Human Rights said the legislation could undermine freedom of expression. But the Home Office said it would not ""impinge"" on the right to protest. Existing laws are out of date and ""disruptive and dangerous tactics"" have to be dealt with, a spokeswoman added. The committee's chairwoman, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, said the plans were ""oppressive and wrong"". Government defends protests noise limit plan The bill,externalsays group protests should not be loud enough to cause ""serious unease, alarm or distress"" to people ""in the vicinity"". A noise limit would also apply to a single person if they caused ""serious disruption"" or if they ""may have a relevant impact on"" people nearby. In a report highly critical of the bill, the committee, which advises MPs and peers on the compatibility of all government bills with human rights laws, called for ""statutory protection"" for the right to hold protests to be introduced. It added that councils should be told to ""refrain from interfering unlawfully"" with them and be given ""the duty to facilitate protest"". The report also said the language used in the bill left an ""excessive degree of judgement in the hands of a police officer"". And it described the proposed limits on single-person protests as ""unprecedented"". This legislation comes after repeated city centre occupations by the Extinction Rebellion movement - and last year's toppling of the statue of a Bristol slave trader and municipal benefactor. The committee said allowing police to set noise limits could silence lawful and peaceful chants - and the most popular demonstrations could face restrictions on duration and location, interfering with the right to assembly. It also urges the government not to create powers to interfere with public demonstrations held by a single person and warns that a new crime of causing a public nuisance is too vague to be understood. MPs and peers don't need to act on the report, but the legislation has already triggered its own protests. And there are predictions it could lead to years of legal battles all the way to the Supreme Court. Commenting on the plans, committee chairwoman Ms Harman said: ""One of our most fundamental rights is to protest. It is the essence of our democracy. ""To do that, we need to make ourselves heard. The government proposals to allow police to restrict 'noisy' protests are oppressive and wrong."" Harriet Harman said the right to protest was the essence of democracy MPs have already backed the bill in principle and it is currentlyundergoing detailed scrutiny.,external It also outlines stronger police powers to break up ""unauthorised encampments"" and longer sentences for people convicted of serious crimes. The government said existing public order laws needed updating because ""the use of disruptive and dangerous tactics - including obstructing emergency vehicles or blocking the free press - costs millions to the taxpayer and causes misery to businesses and local communities"". ""The right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy,"" a Home Office spokeswoman said. ""Our proposed measures are in line with human rights legislation and in no way impinge on the right to protest."" The bill would allow police to ""better manage demonstrations so that legitimate protest groups can make their voices heard without disrupting the lives and livelihoods of others"", she added.

"Founder Whitney Wolfe Herd recently oversaw Bumble's debut on the stock market Bumble, the dating app where women are in charge of making the first move, has temporarily closed all of its offices this week to combat workplace stress. Its 700 staff worldwide have been told to switch off and focus on themselves. One senior executive revealed on Twitter that founder Whitney Wolfe Herd had made the move ""having correctly intuited our collective burnout"". Bumble has had a busier year than most firms, with a stock market debut, and rapid growth in user numbers. The company announced in April ""that all Bumble employees will have a paid, fully offline one-week vacation in June"". A spokeswoman for Bumble said a few customer support staff will be working in case any of the app's users experience issues. These employees will then be given time off to make sure they take a whole week of leave. The spokeswoman confirmed that the majority of Bumble's staff are taking the week off. Bumble has grown in popularity during lockdown as boredom set in and swiping to find a match picked up. The number of paid users across Bumble and Badoo, which Bumble also owns, spiked by 30% in the three months to 31 March, compared with the same period last year,according to its most recent set of results.,external Ms Wolfe Herd also became the youngest woman, at 31, to take a company public in the US when she oversaw Bumble's stock market debut in February. Is Big Tech going off remote working? The tech billionaire who is putting women first She rang the Nasdaq bell with her 18-month-old baby son on her hip and in her speech she said she wanted to make the internet ""a kinder, more accountable place"". By Dearbail Jordan In your face: Bumble's head office is all about positivity Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd's quest to make the internet a ""kinder"" place extends to the company's head office. And then some. Back in 2017, the firm unveiled its new headquarters in Texas. Saturated in Bumble's signature yellow, wall mirrors are emblazoned with messages such as ""you look bee-autiful honey"". Even the light switches have slogans, telling people to ""shine bright like a diamond"". It also boasts a ""Mommy Bar"" - described as a ""private lactation space"" by Ms Wolfe Herd - as well as fortnightly manicures, hair trims and ""blowouts"" which the founder said showed ""appreciation for our busy bees"". Working hours? Not nine to five apparently. Employees can choose the hours they want, just as long as the work gets done. Could the UK see the same sort of office environment here? With many people spending so much time at home recently, perhaps companies will follow through on making changes to working life. Just don't hold out for free manicures though. Workers in other industries have complained about working long hours and the effect on their well-being. Earlier this year, a group of younger bankers at Goldman Sachs warned they would be forced to quit unless conditions improved. They said they were working an average of 95 hours a week and slept five hours a night. A spokeswoman for the investment bank said at the time: ""A year into Covid, people are understandably quite stretched, and that's why we are listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them."" Prior to Covid, one of the most high-profile examples of overwork emerged in when Antonio Horta-Osorio, then the relatively new chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, was forced to take a leave of absence. After joining the bank in January 2011, Mr Horta-Osorio took eight weeks off from November afterprolonged insomnia led to exhaustion. Former Lloyds' Banking boss Antonio Horta-Osorio was forced to take time off due to exhaustion Following his return, Mr Horta-Osorio - now chairman of Credit Suisse - led a re-evaluation at the bank on the importance of mental health. Bumble made its announcement after several tech companies have unveiled their plans for remote working as the economy reopens. Twitter has said that it expects a majority of its staff to spend some time working remotely and some time in the office.That's despite its boss Jack Dorsey initially saying that,externalemployees could work from home ""forever"". And Google rejigged its timetablefor bringing people back to the workplace. As of 1 September, employees wishing to work from home for more than 14 days a year would have to apply to do so. But Apple employees have launched a campaign pushing back against boss Tim Cook's plans for a widespread return to the office, according to media reports earlier in June. It followed an all-staff memo in which the Apple chief executive said workers should be in the office at least three days a week by September. The key to coping with burnout is control, according to experts. ""Not everyone has the option of leaving their job but it's about doing what you can with the things you can control,"" says Siobhan Murray, author of 'The Burnout Solution'. Cary Cooper, president of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester, says it is ""important that individuals take control of their environment to manage the hours they work and ensure that they're socially connected."" He advises: Take control Don't work consistently long hours, engage in activities unrelated to work Connect socially with friends and people you like Have some 'me time' Avoid unhealthy behaviours and negative coping mechanisms Help other people Be positive But companies must play their part too, says Trades Union Congress health and safety officer, Shelly Asquith. Stress is an ""occupational hazard"" she says and it ""requires risk assessment and management to protect the wellbeing of staff"". Other companies, such as accountancy firm KPMG, have introduced new measures to combat the fatigue some workers might feel after more than a year of working in a less-than-ideal home set-up. Voice-only meetings, for example, are now required on Fridays to reduce the need for video calls. It is in stark contrast to comments made by KPMG's UK chairman, Bill Michael, in February when he told colleagues to ""stop moaning"" during a virtual meeting discussing the pandemic and possible cuts to their pay, bonuses and pensions. According to the Financial Times,external, Mr Michael also told employees to stop ""playing the victim card"". Mr Michael has since apologised and resigned.

"This video can not be played Watch: Raiders' Carl Nassib in action Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Carl Nassib has become the first active NFL player to come out as gay. Nassib, 28, made the announcement in a video posted on hisInstagram,externalaccount. ""Just wanted to take a quick moment to say that I'm gay. I've been meaning to do this for a while now but I finally feel comfortable enough to get it off my chest,"" he said. ""I really have the best life, the best family, friends and job a guy could ask for."" Nassib added: ""I'm a pretty private person so I hope that you guys know that I'm really not doing this for attention. I just think that representation and visibility are so important. ""I actually hope that one day videos like this and the whole coming out process are just not necessary, but until then I'm going to do my best to cultivate a culture that's accepting and compassionate."" Nassib also said he was donating Â£100,000 to the Trevor Project, a suicide prevention service for LGBTQ youth in America. Raiders owner Mark Davis told the Las Vegas Review-Journal: ""These are personal decisions. It's 2021, and he's a Raider. If he's happy, I'm happy. It takes courage. ""I thought we got to the point where this wasn't [a prominent news story]. It doesn't change my opinion of him as a man or as a Raider."" In a statement, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell added: ""The NFL family is proud of Carl for courageously sharing his truth today. Representation matters. ""We share his hope that someday soon statements like his will no longer be newsworthy as we march toward full equality for the LGBTQ+ community."" No openly gay player has played a regular-season game in the NFL. Defensive end Michael Sam came out as gay before he was drafted by the St Louis Rams in 2014 and played for them in the pre-season, but did not make their final roster. Former LA Galaxy and USA footballer Robbie Rogers became the first openly gay man to play in one of the USA's big five sports leagues when he came out in February 2013. Nassib is about to enter his sixth season in the NFL, having been a third-round draft pick by the Cleveland Browns in 2016. He then had a two-year spell with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before signing a three-year deal with the Raiders in March 2020.

"The three Cambodian activists face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty A court in Cambodia has charged three environmental activists with plotting against the government and insulting the king. The members of the group Mother Nature were arrested after they documented waste run-off into Phnom Penh's Tonle Sap river. Cambodia's law against insulting the king is relatively new and it is not clear how the activists have done so. The three face between five and 10 years in prison. The prosecution told the Reuters news agency that ""the evidence collected by the police was an insult to the king"" although they did not explain exactly how the law had been violated. Critics have warned that the law - introduced in 2018 - is being used as a tool to silence dissent. The activists are Sun Ratha, 26, Ly Chandaravuth, 22, and Yim Leanghy, 32, all members of activist group Mother Nature. They were detained on 16 June while documenting waste discharge into the Tonle Sap river near the royal palace,according to the Cambodian Center for Human Rights,external. ""The Cambodian government has relentlessly targeted Mother Nature Cambodia,"" Naly Pilorge, director of the rights group Licadho, told Reuters. ""This marks an escalation with the outrageous charges of 'plotting'."" Mother Nature founder Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, who was deported in 2015 after he criticised plans for a controversial dam, was charged in absentia. Last month, three other campaigners linked to the group were sentenced to between 18 and 20 months in jail for organising a march against a lake in the capital being filled with sand. The satirist who vanished in broad daylight Cambodia translator jailed over RT sex trade film The embassies of Sweden and the United States have both criticised the charges. Allow Twitter content?

""Very troubled to hear of the arrests of more environmental youth activists,"" US ambassador Patrick Murpy said. ""Documenting pollution is a public service, not terrorism.

""The Cambodian government has stepped up its campaign to silence activists peacefully advocating to protect the environment,"" Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. ""Foreign governments, the United Nations country team, and international donors should call on the Cambodian authorities to drop their absurd charges against the environmental activists and publicly condemn any further clampdown on peaceful activism."" ""Cambodia's highly politicised courts mean that the environmental activists charged have no chance of getting a fair trial,"" he added. It's not clear how the activists ""insulted"" Cambodia's King Norodom Sihamoni Government spokesman Phay Siphan dismissed criticism of the charges, saying the government was simply applying the law.

"The introduction of flexible rail tickets - aimed at a growing number of commuters who only travel to the office two or three days a week - has had a muted response. The Campaign for Better Transport said commuters will be ""disappointed"", while rail expert Tony Miles, of Modern Railways magazine, also had reservations. But Transport Secretary Grant Shappssaid the new ticketswould offer ""greater freedom and choice about how we travel, simpler ticketing and a fairer fare"". We asked regular train travellers for their first impressions. Steve Allibone commutes from Worthing to London, where he works in financial services. An annual season ticket from West Worthing to London Bridge costs him Â£5,168. The flexible season ticket is Â£397 for 28 days, or Â£5,161 annually - meaning he would save Â£7 annually. ""In principle, it was quite a neat solution, but the cost and the pricing is a bit of a joke,"" he says. Pre-Covid he was commuting five days a week and is currently going in one day a week, which will increase to two days a week after the restrictions ease. ""I could in theory save Â£400 if I only buy 12 of them, but that would require considerable planning when my weeks off are,"" he explains. When I saw the numbers I was disappointed."" He is also unimpressed with current service standards, noticing other passengers often having to stand for over an hour. Also, due to the frequency of train delays Mr Allibone was refunded Â£100 over the course of a year. ""The cost of the tickets has gone up and the quality of the service has gone down,"" he says. For Philippa, a project manager who moved to Bath from close to Stansted, Essex, during the pandemic, the new tickets fail to offer a sufficiently attractive saving. Philippa, who did not want her surname used, works from home and misses the office. She does, though, have a ""lovely work life balance"". ""Before all this I was getting out of bed at 5.30 in the morning, coming back after work and going to bed and doing the same five days a week,"" she adds. At the moment, her company is looking into a hybrid way of working, which would mean a couple of days a week in the office. ""I was hoping that I might be able to move to a couple of days a week in the office, enjoy London life and going out and things,"" Philippa explains. To travel only two days out of seven would save Philippa only Â£17.60 a year, so she is still weighing up other options for reducing costs such as moving back closer to London. ""I was secretly hoping for a much better deal,"" she says. Digital flexi-tickets can be used on any eight days in a 28-day period England without being required to select the days of travel in advance They can be bought on rail websites and apps, as well as at some ticket offices Tickets are paperless, so travellers will have to use a smartphone or smartcard An online calculator will help passengers identify the cheapest option Until the end of this year, passengers who book in advance will be able to change their bookings with no extra charge The tickets are for standard class travel only Kate Morgan, a management consultant in financial services, says her commute from Brighton to London, would be about 11% cheaper - Â£30 a month - with a new flexible ticket. However, this reduction would be less than the cost of one day ticket, so any additional days required in the office would negate those savings. ""Far from it being good news for commuters, it's pretty appalling,"" she says. ""People's point of reference is their annual season ticket, so it's not right for rail companies to compare savings with daily tickets,"" she adds. For Ms Morgan, returning to the office for two days a week is going to cost about the same as it would for five days a week. ""The bit that I'm really disappointed in, is people have been working from home for 18 months and employers are in a difficult position - this really isn't helping that,"" she explains. ""It creates a real barrier in the way of that flexible working becoming a reality."" Niall McGregor, from Norwich, commutes to Canary Wharf to work in a bank. Before Covid he commuted twice a week and worked from home on the other days. ""When you look at the price per journey, the numbers don't make it sufficiently attractive,"" he explains. His annual season ticket costs Â£8,884 for unlimited travel, whereas the Greater Anglia flexi ticket from Norwich to London would cost Â£682.30 - Â£8,187 a year - for only eight tickets a month. ""It doesn't feel like a massive saving for what you're giving up in terms of travel days,"" he says, because it means he would swap 20 days a month travel for eight days a month travel to save Â£697 a year. ""The maths of the new flexible season ticket just don't make much sense,"" he adds. The government estimates commuters could save between Â£60 and Â£350 a year on selected journeys. Ministers say it might not be suitable for every commuter, but is tailored to the growing demand for more flexible working patterns. The Department for Transport said: ""Flexible season tickets will offer most 2 and 3 day per week commuters savings against buying daily tickets or traditional seasons."" ""We have always been clear that passengers should consider which product best suits their journey and travel pattern."" And with the government planning a complete shake-up of the rail network, with the creation of Great British Railways, these changes could be just the start. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators said the rail companies would certainly like to go further in reforming the fares system to help commuters secure the best deal. And the independent watchdog Transport Focus said the changes would help persuade people to choose rail travel again. ""Our research with passengers showed us there was strong demand for a new ticket that suited people who expected to commute less frequently in future,"" the group said.
