"David Andrew Jeffers admitted possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life A woman was shot in the vagina and left with ""life changing injuries"" in a sex game gone wrong, a court has heard. The 46-year-old had been engaged in sexual activity with David Andrew Jeffers, 47, at a Stockport hotel in January when she was shot. Jeffers admitted possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and was jailed for 10 years. The two had been engaged in a ""sex fantasy"" when the weapon fired, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Greater Manchester Police branded the scene ""shocking"" and ""horrifying"". Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard the shooting happenedat the Britannia Hotelin Dialstone Lane in the early hours of 31 January. When officers arrived at the scene they found the victim in a pool of blood and suffering from serious abdominal injuries. She was taken to hospital and required extensive surgery, police said. The woman, who was too unwell to be fully interviewed at the time, told officers from her hospital bed that Jeffers was a ""bad man"". Police said Jeffers, of Berkley Terrace, Leeds, claimed to have found the gun in a pub toilet in Leeds. He said he took the gun to Manchester to dispose of it. Jeffers was spotted on CCTV leaving the hotel and going to Piccadilly Station to catch a train back to Leeds. Armed officers raided a property on Amberton Grove, Leeds, two days later and arrested Jeffers. A search of the house found a partially scrawled note denying knowledge of the shooting, the court heard. Det Insp Roger Edwards said: ""This was a horrifying incident that has left a woman with life changing injuries that will affect her for the rest of her life."" He said the crime was ""one of the most shocking"" he had encountered, adding: ""Jeffers left the victim badly bleeding in a hotel room, showing no regard for her life.

"Volunteers at Felbrigg Hall in Norfolk have been asked to wear rainbow-coloured badges and lanyards in support of an LGBTQ campaign A group of National Trust volunteers have been offered duties away from the public after ""feeling uncomfortable"" wearing sexual equality symbols. As first reported in theEastern Daily Press,,externalvolunteers at Felbrigg Hall in Norfolk have been asked to wear rainbow-coloured badges and lanyards in support of an LGBTQ campaign. But 10 of the 350 volunteers at Felbrigg have chosen not to wear them. A new film said Felbrigg's last lord, Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer, was gay. Annabel Smith, head of volunteering and participation development at the National Trust, said: ""All of our staff and volunteers sign up to our founding principles when they join us - we are an organisation that is for ever, for everyone. ""We are committed to developing and promoting equality of opportunity and inclusion in all that we do."" Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer left his ancestral home to the nation upon his death in 1969 As part of the National Trust's Prejudice and Pride campaign, and in conjunction with research done by the University of Leicester, a new film revealed Mr Wyndham Ketton-Cremer's sexuality, which was known by close friends. The campaign is being run to mark 50 years since homosexuality was decriminalised in 1967, two years before Mr Wyndham Ketton-Cremer's death. A new film said Felbrigg's last lord, Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer, was gay One long-term volunteer, who asked not to be named, said: ""It's very upsetting. We are like a family and this feels like a break up. I don't think Felbrigg will be the same again."" She said she did not think the film should have been made because Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer was ""a private man"". The volunteer said she had not seen the film but had heard ""it was distasteful"". Some volunteers at the 17th Century country house have chosen to take a break from all duties during the Trust's summer programme, while others have taken up the option to move into backroom roles. Ms Smith said: ""Whilst volunteering for the National Trust we do request and expect individuals to uphold the values of the organisation.

"""Don't take vacations"", Mr Trump once advised Like many denizens of Washington DC, President Donald Trump is escaping the heat that smothers the nation's capital in August. But his respite is anything but brief. The president will spend 17 days at his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for what the White House bills as a ""working vacation"". For someone who brands himself as an indefatigable worker, the two-and-a-half week holiday has raised a few eyebrows. In his 2004 book, Think Like a Billionaire, Mr Trump offered the advice: ""Don't take vacations. What's the point? If you're not enjoying your work, you're in the wrong job."" Allow Twitter content?

However, the president's departure is also part of a planned renovation. The entire West Wing staff is required to vacate the premises in August while the building's 27-year-old heating, air conditioning and ventilation system is replaced, according to White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. This video can not be played The BBC asked people in Washington DC how many days they took off last year and watched them write that number down on a board. Other maintenance includes repairing steps on the side of the executive mansion facing the National Mall as well as painting, replacing carpets and curtains, and fixing, ahem, water leaks in the press office. Whyis Trump being criticised? Mr Trump often carped about President Barack Obama'spenchant for golf,external. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But as critics point out, Mr Trump's 17-day holiday is nearly twice as long as the one Mr Obama took in August during his first year. If weekends are included, that means he's taking off 13 days, compared with Mr Obama's eight. ""I'm going to be working for you, I'm not going to have time to go play golf,"" Mr Trump told a Virginia crowd during the campaign, in a jibe at Mr Obama. Before Mr Obama's August 2009 holiday in Martha's Vineyard, he took two other vacations that were said to entail work, including a weekend trip to Arizona and Colorado and a four-day trip to the family home in Chicago for Valentine's Day. Donald Trump's golf hobby under scrutiny with Clinton tweet By comparison, Mr Trump has taken 11 such ""working"" vacations before this month to his properties in Palm Beach, Florida, and New Jersey. He also spent a weekend in June at the government-owned presidential retreat, Camp David, Maryland. Mr Obama was labelled a hypocrite, too, after writing in his 2008 book The Audacity of Hope that no president should take vacations. Mr Trumptold 60 Minutes in November,external: ""There's just so much to be done, so I don't think we'll be very big on vacations, no."" Last month, he told Republican senators to cancel their holidays until lawmakers could pass a plan to overturn the health law known as Obamacare. The bill failed to pass the Senate, and Congress has adjourned for summer recess until 5 September. Newsweek's cover on Thursday depicted the president lounging in a reclining chair calling him a ""Lazy Boy"". ""Imagine how bad he'd feel if he did any work,"" the magazine sniped. Some Bedminster residents are also irked by Mr Trump's extended stay at his central New Jersey property. Protecting the president often means increased security inconveniences members of the public. The local airport has been shut down until 20 August, grounding 110 private planes and 60 flight school students. The Secret Service also said it woulduse an unmanned droneduring Mr Trump's stay, with optical and infrared cameras. Roads may be closed to clear the way for the commander-in-chief's motorcade. The tradition of presidential vacations extends as far back as George Washington, who much preferred spending time at his Mount Vernon plantation on the Potomac River. But the custom of controversy over presidential absences from the White House is nearly as old. America's national vacation problem Why Americans don't take sick days When the capital was still Philadelphia in 1797, President John Adams was criticised for spending several months at his home in Massachusetts, where his sick wife Abigail stayed, as tensions escalated with France. President Harry Truman preferred the palm trees of Key West, Florida, while Ronald Reagan travelled to his California ranch to ride horses, build fences and cut brush,according to Lawrence Knutson,external, a historian for the White House Historical Association. The Bush family outside their Kennebunkport, Maine, home in August 1986 Famous images show a tanned John F Kennedy at his holiday home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and George HW Bush recharged at his Walker Point residence in Kennebunkport, Maine. President Richard Nixon split his time between his estates in Key Biscayne, Florida, and San Clemente, California. He later came under scrutiny for funnelling millions in public funds towards security and improvements at both residences, including a floating helicopter pad in Biscayne Bay. The US is the only advanced nation that does not mandate paid leave, which is why the American work ethic seems a bit strange to the rest of the world. According to theCenter for Economic and Policy Research,external, workers in most European countries are legally entitled to 20 days of holiday or more each year. Australia and New Zealand also require employers to allow at least 20 vacation days annually, French employees get as many as 30 days off and Swedes enjoy five whole weeks of holiday. In contrast, most Americans get only two weeks off, but some workers let that time off lapse out of fear of losing their jobs. In 2016, 54% of employees ended the year with unused time off, surrendering 662 million vacation days, according to the US Travel Association's Project Time Off study. This video can not be played Many Americans do not use their holiday time In fact, nearly a third of workers are not granted paid sick leave and more than a quarter do not have any personal time off at all, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. States such as California and New York have remedied that by requiring employers to offer paid sick leave. Two in three US employees (66%) say they continue to work while on holiday last year, according to areport by jobs site Glassdoor.,external It remains to be seen how much of Mr Trump's working vacation will be spent running the country instead of a golf cart.

"The current Apple Watch range requires an iPhone to be paired via Bluetooth Apple is working on an Apple Watch that does not need to be paired to an iPhone, according to reports. Bloomberg reports,externalthat the new Watch will connect directly to LTE mobile networks. The claim was later corroboratedby the Wall Street Journal,external. The company has begun talks with providers in the US and Europe about offering the device later this year, the reports say. Apple launched the Watch in 2015 but is yet to share any sales figures. In a recent call to investors, Apple boss Tim Cook said his firm's watch was the best-selling smartwatch in the world. But in the wider wearables market, Apple lags behind Chinese firm Xiaomi and San Francisco-based Fitbit, according to Strategy Analytics. While originally positioned as a luxury device, Apple has more recently focused on the fitness credentials of the Watch. Untethering it from the iPhone would open up a range of new functionality - such as allowing users to download songs on the move, even if they do not have their smartphone with them. ""Apple clearly has big plans for Watch both in the health segment and as a gateway to the connected home,â said Carolina Milanesi, consumer tech analyst at Creative Strategies. ""Direct network connection helps in both making sharing data more reliable and faster."" However, there will be concern about the battery life of the device. Most of the computational heavy-lifting on the current Apple Watch is done via the paired iPhone. According to Bloombergâs report, the new deviceâs modem will be manufactured by Intel. The device would come on to the market several years after Apple rivals Samsung and LG launched their own cellular-enabled smart watches. However such devices have tended to be too large to gain any kind of mainstream popularity. Apple did not respond to the BBCâs request for comment on Friday. Apple Watch unveiled in California.

"Simon Pearson was on holiday with his wife Emma and their family A father drowned trying to save his 10-year-old daughter when they were caught in a strong current while on holiday in Italy, an inquest has heard. Simon Pearson, 47, from Churchstoke, Powys, died at the Lido Bosco Verde beach in Ostuni on 18 July. He had been swimming with his daughter and father-in-law when they drifted from the shore and shouted for help, a coroner in Shrewsbury was told. Italian beach worker, Martino Maggi, who went to their aid, also drowned. The inquest heard how experienced swimmer Mr Pearson, the managing director of Shropshire building materials firm Jesmonite, had gone to the beach in southern Italy with his wife, two children, his mother and his father-in-law. In a statement read at the inquest his wife, Emma Pearson, said there had been warnings the day before not to go into the sea after a storm, but there was no warning on that day and the water appeared calm. Mrs Pearson said she saw a red flag on the beach but after discussing it with her father Anthony McGregor a decision was made to enter the sea but not go out too far. She remained on the beach with her mother-in-law and son, six. She said she realised something was wrong when she saw her father swimming then stop swimming over again. ""He told me much later that he had tried to signal to me that he was caught in a strong undercurrent and was trying to warn me not to let anyone enter the water,"" she explained in her statement. ""He was essentially trying to get back to shore, but the current was preventing him. I was unaware of this at that moment. ""I then turned my attention back to Simon and [our daughter], who in that instant had gone from 10 metres out to much further. ""Simon was now up to his chin. I was shocked at how quickly they had gone out, it was unbelievably quick. Simon was waving at me and I had that fleeting thought 'Is he waving or drowning?' ""Suddenly Simon's hand shot up very quickly and I heard him shout 'Emma, Help me'."" She explained how she raised the alarm and two or three men ran into the sea to help while she tried to get a boat out to help them. ""I was still calling for help and all this time I could see Simon holding our daughter above the water,"" she said in her statement. ""The three men who had entered the water were also in trouble, and were all calling for help. ""They had tried to get to Simon and our daughter, but could not reach them."" There were strong currents in the sea when the incident happened As she continued trying to get help, she noticed the first man who had entered the sea was back at shore. ""He had tried hard to reach Simon and our daughter, but couldn't get to them,"" she said. ""By this time, my father was right out at sea, but had managed to hold on to a buoy. ""I looked at Simon and our daughter and saw there were three men around them. ""One was holding Simon under his chin in the 'rescue' position and our daughter was being supported. ""I realised that Simon was in grave danger and needed help. I believed that he was at this time, unconscious."" Two of the men who tried to help the family were Martino Maggi who died during the rescue attempt and another called Ibrahim. ""Ibrahim made his way towards Simon and our daughter,"" said Mrs Pearson in her written statement. ""Ibrahim is a young, fit, strong swimmer and he managed to reach our daughter and get her back to shore. ""He told me later that he had to make a choice between Simon and our daughter, as he would not have been able to bring both of them back. He chose our daughter. ""By this time, there were men forming a human chain to try to reach Simon, and Ibrahim went back out into the sea again to help. ""I looked and could see my father still holding on to the buoy. My daughter was on the beach. ""I looked across at Simon. I was shocked to see him face down, alone and being taken further out to sea. The men that were around him were now trying to get back to shore. ""I realised Simon was dead,"" she said. She recalled how she had watched her husband hold their daughter above the water and said: ""I will never forget how hard Simon fought to save his daughter's life."" Coroner John Ellery said Mr Pearson died of drowning and it was ""clearly an accident"". He added: ""This was a double tragedy and our condolences to both the Pearson family and Martino's family in Italy.""

"A father from Texas realised there were no theme parks where his disabled daughter could play. So he decided to build one. Gordon Hartman had just got out of the swimming pool on a family holiday, when his 12-year-old daughter Morgan went up to some children playing in the water. She tried to make friends with them but they quickly left the pool. Hartman thinks they shied away from her because they didn't know how to react to someone with a disability - Morgan has the cognitive understanding of a five-year-old as well as a form of autism. The incident played on his mind. ""Morgan is just a wonderful young lady. When you meet her you will always get a smile and she will always want to offer a hug. But there were so many times we couldn't take her places,"" he says. Morgan and her parents enjoying the Ferris wheel at Morgan's Wonderland Hartman and his wife Maggie asked other parents where they could take their daughter - somewhere she would feel comfortable, and others would feel comfortable interacting with her. ""We realised such an inclusive place didn't exist,"" says Hartman. So in 2007 he decided to build it himself. A former property developer, he sold his homebuilding businesses in 2005 to set up The Gordon Hartman Family Foundation, a non-profit organisation that seeks to help people with disabilities. Then he set about creating the ""world's first ultra-accessible theme park"". ""We wanted a theme park where everyone could do everything, where people with and without special needs could play,"" Hartman says. He brought together doctors, therapists, parents and other people with and without disabilities to consult on the facilities. These were built on the 25-acre site of a disused quarry in San Antonio, Texas. A specially designed carousel allows all visitors to go up and down The park, called Morgan's Wonderland, cost $34m (Â£26m) and opened in 2010. Attractions include a fully-accessible Ferris wheel, adventure playground and miniature train. Visitors regularly tell Hartman it is the first time they've been able to experience such attractions. There is also a carousel with specially designed chariots for wheelchairs that go up and down alongside the animals. However, Hartman reveals Morgan was at first wary of the ride. ""When we opened she was too scared to go on it. She didn't understand why it was going around and the animals were going up and down,"" Hartman says. It was three years before Morgan would go on the carousel. ""First she would stand near it, then she'd get on an animal but we wouldn't start it. It was a slow process but now she loves going on it. Overcoming something she was scared of meant a lot to her. Little things achieved in play can make a big difference."" This video can not be played Gordon Hartman told Outlook how his daughter Morgan, who has special  needs, inspired him to create a water park that everyone could enjoy Since it opened Morgan's Wonderland has received over a million visitors from 67 countries and from all 50 American states. A third of staff have disabilities and entrance is free to any guest with a condition. ""I realised Morgan was one of the lucky ones because she had many of the things she needed. I didn't want cost to be a barrier for others with special needs,"" Hartman says. ""We open every year knowing we're going to lose over $1m (Â£750,000) and we need to recover that through fundraising and partners."" A guest tries out a wheel chair swing This year, the theme park was expanded with the opening of Morgan's Inspiration Island, a fully-accessible water park. ""Fewer people were visiting in July because the wheelchairs got too hot. So we decided to create a water park next door,"" Hartman says. Parts of the island use warm water, which helps visitors with muscular problems. Waterproof motorised wheelchairs are provided, which run on compressed air rather than batteries. There is also an accessible river boat ride. Altogether, the water park cost $17m (Â£13m). A splash park was added to the complex this year ""Yesterday a man came up to me at Inspiration Island and just held my hand,"" Hartman says. ""He pointed to his son, who has acute special needs and started crying. He said he hadn't been able to play in water before."" Hartman says three out of four visitors to the park are not disabled, and that the park is having precisely the effect he hoped for. ""It helps people realise that though we are different in some ways, actually we are all the same,"" he says. ""I saw one girl in a wheelchair go up to another girl without special needs, and they began playing together. That was really cool."" Both visitors with and without disabilities can go on the rides at Morgan's Inspiration Island Hartman isn't planning to open any more parks, despite receiving hundreds of letters and emails from people who want one in their own area. Instead he is focusing on providing educational facilities to teenagers with special needs in San Antonio. ""I know there are a lot of different organisations trying to build something like Morgan's Wonderland elsewhere and we'll continue to work with them,"" he adds. He continues to take Morgan along to play at the theme park, where she is now something of a celebrity. ""When she comes here she's a rock star! Lots of people want to talk to her and take her picture, she's very good with it,"" Hartman says. Water used in some areas is warm to help those with muscular issues Now 23, Morgan continues to go from strength to strength. ""She talks more now and most of her physical issues have been taken care of through numerous surgeries. We're so proud of how far she has come."" When Morgan visits she's happiest playing on the swings and in the sand zone, unaware of just how much she has helped others. ""Morgan knows the park is named after her, but I don't think she understands the magnitude of what it represents and how it's changed lives,"" Hartman says. ""She doesn't realise how she has dealt with things in life has made her a true inspiration.""

"Police arrested Michael Kellar and Gail Burnworth after a plane passenger spotted text messages A nursery school teacher has been called a ""hero"" after she spotted a plane passenger allegedly sending text messages discussing child sexual abuse. The woman, who has not been named, was able to read the messages of the man in front of her on the Seattle-San Jose flight because they were in a large font on a large smart phone. She took pictures of the screen and informed airline staff, police say. It led to the arrests of Michael Kellar, and later Gail Burnworth. Two children, aged five and seven, have been identified as the alleged victims. Southwest Airlines employees alerted police to the texts. After landing at Mineta San Jose International Airport, in California, Mr Kellar was detained on the spot. But Detective Sergeant Brian Spears of San Jose Police stressed that, without the teacher's decision to act, ""he would have been lost"". ""I let her know, right off the bat, that she is my hero,"" he told reporters. Mr Kellar was travelling from Seattle to San Jose He toldNBC Bay Area,external: ""If it wasn't for that young lady's actions, another sexual assault would have occurred."" Det Sgt Spears added it was worrying Mr Kellar had ""seemed so nonchalant"" about the messages he was sending that he had not even noticed the woman taking photographs. ""It was close to advertising the conversation,"" he said. According toMercuryNews.com,external, Mr Kellar reportedly said the messages were just fantasy, but further investigation led police to Ms Burnworth, who is understood to have been dating him for about a year. They also identified two alleged victims. Mr Kellar, 56, of Tacoma, Washington State, was arrested on suspicion of two counts of attempted child molestation and two counts of solicitation of a sex crime,San Jose Police said,external.

"President Trump's decision brought international condemnation The Trump administration has issued its first written notification that the US intends to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. But in the notice to the United Nations the US state department said Washington would remain in the talks process. President Donald Trump drew international condemnation in June when he first announced the US intention to withdraw. He said the deal ""punished"" the US and would cost millions of American jobs. Friday's announcement is seen as largely symbolic as no nation seeking to leave the pact can officially announce an intention to withdraw until 4 November 2019. What is climate change? What is in the Paris climate deal? Five effects of US pullout The process of leaving then takes another year, meaning it would not be complete until just weeks after the US presidential election in 2020. Any new US president could then decide to rejoin the agreement. This video can not be played Trump: The world won't laugh any more at the US ""Today, the United States submitted a communication to the United Nations in its capacity as depositary for the Paris Agreement regarding the US intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as it is eligible to do so,"" the US statement read. ""The United States will continue to participate in international climate change negotiations and meetings... to protect US interests and ensure all future policy options remain open to the administration."" The Paris accord is seen as vital in the fight against global warming In June, Mr Trump indicated he was open to another climate deal ""on terms that are fair to the United States"". However, key signatories to the accord quickly ruled that out. The Paris Agreement took decades to finalise. The US stance on climate change also caused divisions at the G20 summit in Germany last month. Hawking: Trump's climate stance could damage Earth How has the world reacted? Tech leaders defy Trump A joint summit statement said it ""took note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris Agreement"". However, leaders of the other G20 members agreed the accord was ""irreversible"". Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect of gases, or emissions, released from industry, transportation, agriculture and other areas into the atmosphere. The Paris accord aims to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions. Only Syria and Nicaragua did not sign up. Countries agreed to: Keep global temperatures ""well below"" the level of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C Limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100 Review each country's contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge Enable rich countries to help poorer nations by providing ""climate finance"" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies says the world's average temperature has risen by about 0.8C since 1880, two-thirds of that since 1975. US think tank Climate Interactive predicts that if all nations fully achieve their Paris pledges, the average global surface temperature rise by 2100 will be 3.3C, or 3.6C without the US.

"This video can not be played Intelligence chief to leakers: ""We will find you"" The US attorney general has said four people have been charged over leaks as the Trump administration launched a crackdown on embarrassing disclosures. Jeff Sessions said the suspects were accused of divulging classified material or concealed contacts with foreign intelligence officers. America's top prosecutor said the administration has tripled the number of active leak probes since January. President Donald Trump has criticised Mr Sessions as ""very weak"" on leaks. At Friday's news conference, the attorney general said no government could be effective when its leaders could not talk freely in confidence with foreign leaders. ""I strongly agree with the president and condemn in the strongest terms the staggering number of leaks undermining the ability of our government to protect this country,"" he told reporters. Trump calls US state 'drug-infested den' Trump 'pressed Mexico to stop wall talk' What Trump really meant in those phone calls He said there had been a ""dramatic"" increase in recent months of unauthorised disclosures to the media and even foreign adversaries. The attorney general also said he wanted to review policies on media subpoenas - compelling journalists to reveal sources - to balance the role of the press with protecting national security. The move is likely to send a chill through US newsrooms that have been breaking almost daily scoops, which have embarrassed the White House. Jeff Sessions spoke about the Justice Department's efforts to crack down on national security leaks before television cameras and reporters, but his intended audience was almost certainly the man in the Oval Office. Last week the president lambasted his attorney general for not doing enough to stifle a torrent of leaks over the past six months. On Friday morning Mr Sessions essentially replied: ""See? I am doing something!"" What's more, the attorney general served his anti-leak entree with a generous helping of media-bashing, warning that while he respected freedom of the press, he was reviewing when prosecutors could force journalists to reveal their sources - or face criminal sanction. That's a dish specially crafted for the president's tastes. Earlier this week, newly minted chief of staff John Kelly reportedly called Mr Sessions and told him that, despite the president's recent swipes, his job was safe. Perhaps Friday's event is part of a larger effort at fence-mending between the commander-in-chief and his former political confidant. The attorney general will have to deliver results, however. If he can't stop the leaks, it is doubtful the president will be satisfied. And if there's one truth in Washington, it's that the leaks never really stop. Follow@awzurcher,externalâ Mr Sessions was joined by Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, who issued a stark warning to leakers. ""Anyone who engages in these criminal acts is betraying the intelligence community and the American people,"" he said. ""We feel the pain of those betrayals intensely and I can assure you that I will do everything in my power as director of national intelligence to hold those people accountable. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been branded ""very weak"" on leaks by President Trump ""Understand this, if you improperly disclose classified information, we will find you, we will investigate you, and we will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law, and you will not be happy with the result."" Only this week transcripts of rancorous calls between President Trump and foreign leaderssurfaced in the Washington Post.. The US leader told Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that the US state of New Hampshire was ""a drug-infested den"". On the line to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Mr Trump referred to himself as ""the world's greatest person that does not want to let people into the country"". He also complained it was ""the most unpleasant call all day"". Mr Sessions did not share details of the four leak arrests. But in June a 25-year-old National Security Agency contractor,Reality Winner, was arrestedfor removing classified material from a federal site in the state of Georgia. The American Civil Liberties Union said ""a crackdown on leaks is a crackdown on the free press and on democracy as a whole"". Spokesman Ben Wizner said: ""Our founders understood that democracy depends on an informed citizenry, and leaders can't be trusted to disclose vital information that reflects poorly on themselves.

"The cleared men clockwise from top left: Matthew Lucas, Lee Walls, Malcolm Reeves and Matthew Loosemore Four members of a police helicopter crew accused of filming naked sunbathers and a couple having sex have been cleared of misconduct charges. South Yorkshire Police officers Matthew Lucas, 42 and Lee Walls, 47, and pilots Matthew Loosemore, 45 and Malcolm Reeves, 64, were charged after another officer shot the footage. They were acquitted following a three week trial at Sheffield Crown Court. PC Adrian Pogmore, 50, had admitted misconduct in a public office. Helicopter film policeman 'sex-obsessed' During the trial, the court heard a couple sitting naked by a caravan were filmed in July 2008, while the aircraft also filmed a garden where a woman was sunbathing naked with her daughters in 2007. The footage also showed a couple having sex on their patio in July 2008 and at one point, the naked woman waved at the aircraft. Adrian Pogmore had admitted four charges of misconduct The defendants had blamed Pogmore, from Whiston in Rotherham, for the filming. They insisted they were not aware what he was filming and he was the only person who was present on each of the four occasions the recordings were made. Pogmore was described by the prosecution as ""a swinging and sex-obsessed air observer"" who knew the couple he filmed having sex. All of the people filmed by Pogmore, with the exception of the couple having sex, gave statements saying they felt their privacy had been invaded. Mr Reeves, from Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, had denied two counts of misconduct in a public office and Mr Loosemore, of Auckley, Doncaster, denied one count. Mr Walls, from Aston, Sheffield, denied one count while Mr Lucas, from Chapeltown, Sheffield, also denied three counts. Pogmore, who was sacked by the force in 2015 following an internal misconduct investigation, will be sentenced on Tuesday. Following the case, a spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said: ""Notwithstanding today's verdicts concerning the four defendants who were acquitted, we will now continue with misconduct proceedings internally against the other South Yorkshire Police officers.""

"Why can't all hospitals carry out hip replacements the same way to benefit patients? With the NHS strapped for cash, there are frequent demands for more money. But could hospitals make better use of resources? That's the question which NHS chiefs in England are pondering at a time when funding increases are not keeping up with patient demand. One leading surgeon even says the NHS doesn't need more money - and can find what it needs simply by becoming more efficient. At the heart of the latest attempts to make the money go further is another typical piece of NHS jargon - ""Getting It Right First Time"" or Girft.  It may sound obscure, but it is now a buzzword around Whitehall and at public policy think tanks. Ministers and health service leaders are setting great store by this project and hoping it can free up more money for the front line at a time of mounting pressure.A new report from the Girft team,externalhas come up with annual potential savings for NHS in England of Â£268m. Getting It Right First Time is the brainchild of the leading orthopaedic surgeon Prof Tim Briggs.  A former rugby player and forceful character, Prof Briggs has been on a personal mission to knock aside bureaucratic barriers and tackle major variations in surgical standards and techniques at different hospitals. In 2012, he coined the Getting It Right First Time title for his own report on orthopaedic surgery. He discovered a wide range of different outcomes for patients after hip and knee replacements at selected hospitals. The infection rates for patients recovering from these operations, for example, varied from 0.2% to 4.5% and at one hospital, for a short time, it was as high as 15%. Treating these infections and having, where necessary, to re-do a replacement operation can be very costly for the NHS.  If those infection rates could all be reduced to the 0.2% achieved by the best-performing hospitals, argued Briggs, up to Â£300m a year could be saved and patients would be better served. The report indicates there are savings to be made in the way surgery is organised Backed by NHS England, Prof Briggs produced a report on orthopaedic services at a wider range of hospitals in 2015.  Last year, his analysis was extended to cover a range of specialist medical areas, including cardiology, paediatrics and urology, with the aim of eliminating variations in procedures and outcomes. By this time, encouraged by ministers, Briggs was working at the top of the NHS hierarchy and heading his own team with a brief to standardise practices and identify savings. The latest report covers general surgery in England. The most eye-catching finding is the number of emergency admissions for surgery at hospitals which result in a decision that no operation is actually required. If consultants are involved in the triage process, argues the report, more patients can be treated without needing a hospital bed and there can be a 30% reduction in admissions for emergency surgery.  That could result in a total annual saving of Â£108m. The report's other recommendations include reducing the length of stay for patients recovering from appendix surgery from the three-and-a-half-day average to the two days experienced at some hospitals. This would free up more beds for patients and cut costs by Â£8.5m annually. The total cost-savings identified this way in general surgery come to Â£268m. Prof Briggs, who doesn't mince his words, came up with a strong conclusion in an interview with the Times: ""I do not think at the moment we deserve more money until we put our house in order and we actually make the changes that will improve the quality of care."" He went on to say there was ""significant waste"" at hospitals he had visited in all parts of the UK and that the NHS could do a ""lot more work"" with the money it already had. Eyebrows were no doubt raised at NHS England when Prof Briggs's comments were published. His message is rather different from the standard NHS view that even after efficiency savings, more money will be needed from central government. The general direction of travel for Girft, however, is wholeheartedly supported by Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, as it is by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. NHS Providers, representing hospital trusts in England, sounded a note of caution.  It argues that the NHS is already working on reducing variations in care costs.  The organisation believes that the total Girft savings might be no more than Â£2bn annually by 2020 when the funding gap is arguably 10 times that. Hopes are high in government that Getting It Right First Time will unlock more cash for the NHS when it is badly needed. But talking about possible savings is one thing. Delivering them is another. One thing is certain - we will hear a lot more about Girft and Tim Briggs in the year ahead. Did NHS stats become a political football?

"Our savings habit has never been so weak since data was first collected in 1963. Notes and coins have been overtaken by card and digital payments. Interest rates are still at a record low. The current situation has prompted one financial expert to declare that ""cash is trash"". So pity Jonny Greves, a buyer at Lesser and Pavey, whose job it is to import money boxes and piggy banks. Actually, he says, save your sympathy. ""Last year we noticed a rise in sales of money boxes which has continued into this year. It seems that no matter what the current market is like, a nice, themed money box always makes a good gift,"" he says. ""No matter how old someone is, they could be saving for something so a money box with the right design makes it easy."" While we might be turning to our digital devices and cards to pay for things, he says the jam jar savings habit remains healthy. ""As much as we are getting towards a cashless society, and I'm the worst for it, people are always going to have a few pounds in their pocket and when times are hard sometimes this is all people can afford to save, so there is no other place than a money box,"" he says. Yet, when the money box fills up, or bigger sums need to be set aside, data suggests the UK is less keen to put money into a bank account. The saving ratio - which measures the outgoings and incomings that affect households and shows the percentage of disposable income that is saved - has been falling sharply for more than a year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the ratio stood at 1.7% from January to March, down from 3.3% in the previous quarter, and the lowest since records began. While the Bank of England suggests that it could pick up again, it also warned this week that households with large savings may start to save less or run down their savings as household purchasing power falls. A survey for the Bank showed that 60% of those who plan to keep spending the same in real terms had more than Â£15,000 of savings. Those with higher debts, and less in savings, may need to reduce spending more quickly in order to continue to meet their debt repayments. That is because prices are rising faster than wages which means, in real terms, that many people are worse off. Wage squeeze to get tighter Savers face 'never ending battle' Carney: Households have cut back since Brexit vote Household income is being squeezed, and borrowing is cheap. Interest rates on a Â£10,000 personal loan are close to record lows and the average interest-free period on credit card balance transfers has doubled since 2011, the Bank says. Meanwhile, the rate of return on easy access savings accounts are as low as 0.01% a year - creating little incentive to save. Analysts were particularly gloomy about the plight of savers after the eight members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted 6-2 to keep interest rates on hold at 0.25%. They have been at that level since August last year. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says: ""At the risk of sounding like a cracked record, cash remains trash in today's environment. With this in mind, anyone with savings still sitting in cash will continue to struggle to generate a real return."" Ross Andrews, director of fixed rate bond provider Minerva Lending, is equally pessimistic. ""The struggle for people to keep their savings real has no obvious end in sight,"" he says. ""In this negative climate, more needs to be done to raise awareness of the savings risk, which is eroding people's savings pots in real terms."" So why bother to save money, when the rising cost of living and lower rates of return mean it will actually be worth less than it is now? Andrew Johnson, of the government-backed Money Advice Service, says that, whatever the rates, saving for a rainy day - such as when the boiler breaks down - still makes sense. He has three reasons to save: Having a healthy savings buffer in an instant access account will give you peace of mind and can act as a cushion against unexpected financial shocks Taking out a loan or other forms of  credit can be expensive if used to pay for special purchases. Saving a little and often can make them more affordable when the time comes and helps reach long-term goals such as owning a home Saving in a pension has a number of tax advantages as well as helping you achieve your income goals in retirement There is another glimmer of hope for savers. Things are not as bad as they were, says Anna Bowes, director at independent savings advice website savingschampion.co.uk. ""The good news for savers is that competition - primarily between some key challenger banks - has been rife so far in 2017. Since the end of last year, the best easy access rate available has risen by 25% and fixed rate bonds have risen even more,"" she says. ""If you are sitting in a poor paying high street bank account, you don't need to wait for a base rate rise to see a marked improvement in the interest you can earn."" Interest rates on easy access savings accounts can be as low as 0.01% or as ""high"" as 1.2%. For anyone with savings or inheritance of Â£50,000 that means earning either Â£5 gross per year, or Â£600. So, shopping around may pay. Some current accounts are paying rates of up to 5%, although only on smaller balances and with lots of terms and conditions to adhere too, she says. Longer term fixed rate bonds are paying up to 2.5% - but locking your money away for up to five years might not be the best option for many.

"Agha Ahmed Raza, Amar Kapur and Rishad Haider grew up in Lahore, Pakistan Seventy years ago, in August 1947, British colonial rule in India came to an end. The country was divided into two independent states - Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Using letters and diaries sourced from the world's first Partition Museum which opens in Amritsar on 17 August, Soutik Biswas pieces together the extraordinary story of four friends who were separated by the traumatic event and reunited 30 years later. ""Our country has been broken; the great, sound pulsating heart of India has been broken,"" a young man in Lahore, Pakistan, wrote to his best friend in Delhi, the capital of India, in the summer of 1949. Writing in elegant cursive and turquoise blue ink, Asaf Khwaja had poured his heart out to Amar Kapur. Barely two years had passed since they had been separated by the bloody partition which split the subcontinent into the new independent nations of India and Pakistan. ""We in Lahore, your friends and former playmates, those who were in school with you and in college and whose first 25 years of life, are inseparably linked with those of yours assure you with the utmost sincerity that distance has not made the slightest difference in our love and affection for you; that we remember you, and remembered you often, with the same brotherly feeling that for so long characterised our relations,"" wrote Asaf, who had just joined the Pakistan Times newspaper as a journalist. ""We have spent good times, Amar, grand times, together."" Amar Kapur, Asaf Khwaja, Agha Raza and Rishad Haider were like a brotherhood of friends. They lived within a three-mile radius, visited each other's homes, shared street snacks on the way home from convent school, studied in the same college and played soft ball cricket with twigs for stumps. From innocent boyhood to callow youth, they had shared the good times. Then, in the tumultuous summer of 1947, hard times arrived with a vengeance. Amar's separation had hurt the most. He was the only Hindu in the group, and his friends called him Punditji, which means a Hindu priest. Three weeks after the partition in August 1947, Amar and his family abandoned their sprawling family home and 57-year-old printing business in Lahore, and joined the millions of refugees that crossed the border in what was one of the greatest migrations in human history. Two years later, in Delhi, they were still trying to salvage their lives from the detritus of partition. Asaf Khwaja worked as a journalist with Pakistan Times ..and kept in touch with Amar Kapur through letters Back in their severed homeland, Asaf, Agha and Rishad had entered adulthood and were starting to earn a living. Asaf's mordant wit was on magnificent display as he shared the news about their friends. ""Agha and Rishad have entered into business - the swindlers. They are running an agency for Burmah Shell Company and minting a good bit of money. I wish you could see [Agha] Ahmad. He is (sic) grown so fat and bald that you would find it hard to recognise him - signs of prosperity!"" Asaf wrote. Asaf was a pragmatic idealist. He loved cricket, poetry and the mountains and developed a love for contract bridge in his later life. He would sometimes spend his summers with his grandfather on a houseboat on Kashmir's Dal Lake or visit the unspoilt mountains of Swat. He was also hopeful about a brighter future for both nations. Perhaps the biggest movement of people in history, outside war and famine. Two newly-independent states were created - India and Pakistan. About 12 million people became refugees. Between half a million and a million people were killed in religious violence. Tens of thousands of women were abducted. This article is part of a BBC series looking at Partition 70 years on. Read more: Partition 70 years on: The turmoil, trauma - and legacy Special report on partition ""Much suffering has been caused and much bitterness engendered,"" he wrote to Amar. ""But what is done cannot be undone. All we can do now is to make amends for our past mistakes and work wholeheartedly for the restoration of peace and goodwill among the divided sections of the people."" But Amar was less buoyant. Riots had broken out in Lahore - a Muslim-majority city where businesses were dominated by non-Muslims - in the months before partition. Under the smoke-filled skies, Hindus and Muslims had turned on each other, burnt down properties, and looted shops and homes. His father had forbidden the children and women in the house to step outside. When his family finally left Lahore in September in a convoy of cars, led by his father's grey Opel, he hid a .38 calibre revolver in the door lining. ""It was madness, complete madness,"" Amar Kapur, now 94, told me recently. He kept a diary after migrating to Delhi following the blood-drenched summer of 1947 via the border city of Amritsar, where the family spent three months on the veranda of a house. In Delhi, the Kapurs then lived without electricity for three years in three rooms in a disputed house. Amar Kapur left his Lahore home and came to Delhi a month after partition ""On3 June 1947,externalit was decided that India would be partitioned and Pakistan would come into being. On that day was India doomed,"" Amar wrote in his diary. He wrote that violence hadn't stopped since the announcement. ""Religion, which should be a strictly private affair and the concern of the individual, was being used to cover up beastly acts of murder and other inhuman acts,"" he wrote. Asaf, in Lahore, believed none of this would affect their friendship. ""We have common memories and common experiences that bind us so closely together that no adventitious circumstances can wrench us apart,"" he wrote in one of his letters. But separated by distance, experience and time, the four friends did get separated. For three decades, they completely lost touch. Keeping friendships alive in rival, hostile nations was difficult, not least because it was hard to get visas to visit each other's countries. They also lost each other's addresses. A Country Divided How a jacket and a briefcase shaped a partition love story Cyril Radcliffe: The man who drew the partition line A simple twist of fate brought the four together again, however. In the summer of 1980, an uncle of Agha Raza visited Delhi to attend a conference. Before he left, Agha had asked him to try trace Amar and his whereabouts. He told him that his family owned a printing press business in Delhi which bore the Kapur family name. Agha had been the maverick of the quartet. He had worked for an oil company, joined the Pakistani navy as an officer and then worked for the labour department. In his thirties, he retired to the countryside to look after his family farm, some 120km (74 miles) from Lahore. His friends called him the agriculturist. Now, he was on the hunt for his long-lost friend. In Delhi his uncle, a former diplomat, looked up the telephone directory and began calling all the Amar Kapurs. He got lucky with the fourth call, and returned to Pakistan with Amar's address and phone number. Soon the friends reconnected, speaking on the phone and writing to each other. They shared notes about themselves and their families - all of them were now married with children - and work. There was lot of catching up to do. Amar Kapur has many memories of his old friends Agha Raza and his wife visited Amar Kapur in Delhi after partition ...and wrote frequently to Amar Kapur Rishad Haider had become one of Pakistan's most successful banking professionals. Agha was looking after his farm. Asaf continued to work with the Pakistan Times, and chaired Pakistan's National Press Trust until he quit after a run-in with military leader Gen Zia ul-Haq. Amar was ensconced in the family's thriving new printing business in Delhi and Agra. They spoke of their joys and sorrows: the marriages of their children, the death of relatives. When Amar lost his family home in a posh Delhi neighbourhood due to a dispute with his brother, Agha wrote to him: ""I was shocked and greatly distressed to hear about the sale of your house. I felt as if my own house had been sold. How very unfortunate that it had to come to this. But who knows. It might turn out to be good for you and the rest of the family."" In January 1982, Amar returned to Pakistan to attend the wedding of Agha's son, Qasim. Since getting a visa required submitting the wedding card well in advance as proof, Agha got a special card made months in advance and sent it to his friend in Delhi. Since Amar only had a visa to visit Lahore, the others came to visit him from Karachi and Islamabad, where they were working. Over the next decade the Kapurs visited Pakistan three times, once availing of an easier visa given out to Indians to watch a rare cricket Test against their arch rivals. In Lahore, family members remember night-long conversations and days-long marathon contract bridge games when Amar came visiting. ""They were like blood brothers, like a family. I found it interesting that all the four men were dynamic, successful individuals. But when they met they kind of merged into each other and became completely childlike. The intensity of friendship was something,"" Cyma Haider, daughter of Rishad Haider, told me. Amar would often pick up the phone and invite Agha to visit him in Delhi. One day, he wrote to him, saying he hoped to visit him soon. ""Your repeated invitations to visit you all are so full of love and kindness that I feel very guilty in not having been able to make it so far. But sooner or later, Inshallah, we will and I hope in the not too distant future."" Amar Kapur maintained a diary in the days after the partition ...where he wrote that India was ""doomed"" after the traumatic separation As winter approached in 1988, Agha promised Amar that he would see him in Delhi in the new year. But in December, he collapsed in his home and died of a heart attack, aged 67. Rishad was the next to depart, in 1993, also aged 67. Feeling rather unwell, he was admitted to hospital a few days before his death, telling his family, ""I think my time has come."" In June 1996, an unusually despondent Asaf wrote to Amar: ""How saddening is to lose lifelong friends. It is as if a part of you dies. Both Agha Ahmed and Rishad have left a void in my life, a void that can never be filled. I have myself been keeping indifferent health for some time now, and it may not be long before I join my departed friends in their eternal abode."" ""My only wish is that I should die as they died - suddenly and without lingering pain."" Asaf wrote about ""leading a lonely life, with both our children away in the US"". He said they did meet on short visits to each other's countries every two to three years, but these ""short visits only sharpen the sense of loneliness"". ""Sometimes I feel that life has become meaningless."" Amar Kapur took this picture of his wife Minna before they got married in 1955 Asaf contemplated a future where their children would continue the friendships forged by their parents. ""If you and I cannot meet, let our children get together if they can and carry on a friendship which their fathers have been able to retain only flimsily due to a tragic quirk of history,"" Asaf wrote. A month later, on 29 July, Asaf Khwaja woke up in the morning, showered, had his breakfast and began reading the morning papers when he suffered a heart attack and died. He was 71. At 94, Amar Kapur is the only survivor of the brotherhood. He sold off his business some 20 years ago and continues to lead a busy life with his wife, Minna, in his two-storey home that he built in 1986 in Faridabad on the outskirts of Delhi. He is remarkably agile for his age, and lives with his pencil drawings, paintings, photographs and a boxful of memories. He is rather stoic about his past, taking more pride in his wife's work with the Rotary Club, than anything else. I ask whether he misses his old friends. ""I miss them,"" he says. ""I loved them and I love them even more now."" ""They are the only real friends I ever had."" Pictures by Mansi Thapliyal. Archive pictures provided by family members.

"Ethnicity plays a big part in Kenya's elections, with many people voting along communal lines, and occasional outbreaks of political violence in which people are targeted according to their ethnic background. This can make life difficult for mixed ethnicity couples, as the BBC's Dickens Olewe in Nairobi found ahead of next week's election. ""Mommy, do you hate Raila or Uhuru?"" Naomi Wangui and Malaki Samson's young daughter shocked them recently by choosing this way to ask how they felt about the presidential candidates. The question stunned Naomi and, even though she tried to explain to her daughter how political competition works, she was taken aback by her characterisation. ""Hate is a strong word, even for a six-year old. I think it's the perception she has picked from the TV stations who project political competition as a zero sum game, them versus us."" Malaki is a Luhya, a community that chiefly supports the opposition, while Naomi is from the Kikuyu community of President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is seeking re-election. Mr Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga, who is a Luo, have harnessed support from several ethnic communities and it has become part of Kenyan political culture to presume that people from allied ethnic groups automatically back them. These perceptions complicate the lives of mixed ethnicity couples. Malaki and Naomi live in Kinoo in the outskirts of the capital, Nairobi, an area that is dominated by the Kikuyu community. Malaki Samson's family worry about his safety in a Kikuyu-dominated area This set-up worries Malaki's family and they are concerned about his safety during the election. ""His brother called to see if he is planning to move during the election,"" Naomi says. But Malaki has however no plans to relocate. ""We will cast our votes and come back home. We feel safe here,"" he says. "" I don't think the election will be violent as everyone is making it out to be."" Manuel Mikewa and his wife Elizabeth Njeri have different and more elaborate plans for election day. ""We will vote and then relocate with our two children to my mother's house in Kileleshwa [a middle-class estate in Nairobi]."" Manuel Mikewa is a Luo and his wife is Kikuyu, and they live in Muthiga, another area where Kikuyus are dominant. Manuel Mikewa and his family are planning to stay with his mother and other relatives Since post-election violence in 2007-08 in which more than 1,500 Kenyans were killed and an estimated 600,000 displaced, people have tended to be jittery around election time - and it's no different this year. The last election passed without any major disruptive incident but there seems to be palpable fear and anxiety heading to this year's election, despite the government's reassurance on security and top politicians calling for peace. ""I just don't want to be here, especially with my children. I just want to feel safe,"" Manuel says and he has reasons to be worried. More on Kenya's elections: This video can not be played Kenya Election 2017: What you need to know Kenyatta: the digital president Odinga - love him or loathe him First time voters Decoding the elections Full elections coverage His aunt who is married to a Kikuyu man lives in Kibera, Kenya's biggest slum, which has been named as a potential hotspot. In 2013, his uncle slept in a bar in Kibera that he owns for fear that his family's house would be attacked because of his perceived ethnic-political affiliation in an area dominated by the Luo community. ""My aunt and her family have started feeling that their neighbours, some whom they have known for a long time, are showing enmity towards them, so they are planning to be away from the area during the election,"" Manuel says. ""Just like in 2013, she will be moving to my mum's house with my cousins. She has enough space to accommodate us and it's good that way, because we will all feel safe."" Manuel says he plans to stay with his mother for at least a week after the election, ""then we will assess when to go back"". His plans are not unique. There's a silent migration from the city taking place, with people travelling to areas where their ethnic community is dominant. ""I think we will be safe in Kileleshwa because it is far removed from the informal settlement areas, like where my aunt lives, where there is high likelihood of violence to occur."" At the moment, Manuel says, the heightened political environment has ""disrupted his work"", but he adds that he is looking forward to vote. ""As a couple we have been open with each other and we have discussed the candidates we will vote for."" People are already heading out of Nairobi Another couple, George Obiero, a Luo, and Millicent Wanjiru, a Kikuyu, have been married for eight years and have two children. They say the election period is the most challenging part of their relationship. ""This is the most challenging time for mixed ethnicity couples because we suddenly find that our relationships are exposed to the negative effects of ethnic political competition,"" George says. ""There are couples who have separated because they couldn't handle the strain."" Millicent says that she has to deal with the fact that she ""lives in an area where I feel safe but I can't say the same for my husband"". The couple say they have started thinking of contingency plans to move the family somewhere they will feel safe, but it has not been an easy topic to discuss. ""We live in an area where my community is a minority so I'm the one likely to be targeted by violence because of my ethnicity. Some people see me as supporting the opposition, which is not necessarily the case,"" George says. ""Reason would suggest that I move to a place where I will feel safe but I can't leave my family, I just can't. ""It's easy for couples who come from the same community to make quick decisions on what to do in these circumstances, for us it's a bit tricky."" Election time is ""challenging"" for couples from different ethnic backgrounds, says George Obiero pictured his wife Millicent Wanjiru The couples say they feel that the rhetoric in this year's election has been ratcheted up, more than any past election, by an active social media community. ""There's a lot of hate there. People say very hurtful things, and these are people you know, some you call friends,"" Millicent says. But she says they cannot afford to despair. Instead they try to continue showing and preaching tolerance - especially to their children. ""We are sensitising them to be part of a global community and not be confined to an ethnic cocoon that Kenyan politics forces us into every five years,"" Millicent says. ""I'm hopeful because many in our generation are marrying from other cultures and I look forward to a less divisive future."" The Malakis and Obieros live in the same apartment block, which they say is home to ""an incredibly diverse group of Kenyans"". The neighbours are planning a get-together party on election day ""to light a bonfire to celebrate our diversity,"" Samson Malaki says.

"Anthony Scaramucci was the shortest-serving White House communications director in history In the end, the Mooch got stabbed in the back. Before the late-night comedians could hone their impressions of the fast-talking, ""front-stabbing"" man from Long Island, before even his official start date as White House director of communications, Anthony Scaramucci felt the knife go in. John Kelly, President Trump's new White House chief of staff, called Mr Scaramucci into his office on Monday morning and, with the blessing of the president, cut him loose, 10 short days after he was given the job. Mr Scaramucci reportedly tried to phone Mr Trump, but the boss wasn't available. It was all just coming together for Mr Scaramucci. After six months on the outside, blocked by White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, he had finally got the nod - director of communications, reporting directly to the president. A Wall Street hot-shot who graduated straight from Harvard law to Goldman Sachs and went on to start his own hedge fund, Mr Scaramucci was never short on ambition. ""The only kid in high school who read the New York Times every Sunday,"" recalled one former classmate. Earlier this year, to smooth his path to the White House, Mr Scaramucci announced plans to sell his controlling $80m (Â£61m) stake in hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, and two weeks ago he pruned his Twitter history of inconvenient opinions on gun control, gay marriage and climate change. ""Full transparency: I'm deleting my old tweets,"" he wrote, apparently without irony. On the road with the Trump team, including former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski (R) On Friday 21 July, Mr Scaramucci gave his first press conference. He paid tribute to outgoing press secretary Sean Spicer, who elected to resign rather than serve under his new boss. Mr Spicer was Mr Scaramucci's first scalp, and the tribute could not have been more Mooch: ""I wish him well and I hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money,"" he said. The first few days were a whirlwind: a tour of the morning shows on Sunday, warning White House leakers that their days were numbered; a trip aboard Air Force One on Monday, while his estranged wife Deidre Ball gave birth to their second child in New York; a dinner at the White House on Wednesday with the president, Fox News host Sean Hannity and former Fox News executive Bill Shine, the details of which were immediately leaked to the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza. Then early on Thursday morning, Alisyn Camerota and Chris Cuomo, the hosts of CNN's New Day programme, were on the line with Mr Lizza discussing the leak when they got an unexpected call from a listener. ""Ryan, so sorry to interrupt you right now,"" said Ms Camerota. ""If you would stand by for a second that would be great because we actually have Anthony Scaramucci on the line."" The Mooch likes to talk about where he's from. ""One of the things I can't stand about this town is the back-stabbing,"" he told the BBC last week in Washington DC. ""Where I grew up we're front-stabbers."" Front-stabville is Port Washington, a picture-perfect small town on Long Island, home to the very rich - it is the East Egg of F Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby - and to hard-working immigrant families with roots in various corners of Europe - ""The American dream on steroids"", recalled another former classmate who grew up a few streets away from Mr Scaramucci. The son of two Italian immigrants, Mr Scaramucci's father Alexander worked for 42 years in the sand mines of Port Washington, quarrying the sand that went to Manhattan to build the buildings on Wall Street. His mother Mary was a stay-at-home mum. The couple still live in the same, neatly-kept corner house where Mr Scaramucci was raised, just off Main Street. One block up the road, Mr Scaramucci's maternal uncle Sal Defeo, who is 90, sits out most days on the porch of his own ramshackle old house, selling leftover merchandise from his closed-down motorcycle store, Ghost Motorcycles. Few people in Port Washington seemed excited by an old local's sudden celebrity. Only one Trump bumper sticker was visible, and the owner, a lifelong Port Washington resident, had seen only one other locally, on a blue pickup that was occasionally parked around the place. There were signs of the fierce family loyalty that Mr Scaramucci professes to share with President Trump. Sat in his truck, with a glint in his eye and an obvious sense of humour, Mr Defeo switched between singing Mr Scaramucci's praises and pretending not to know who his nephew was. He was more keen to talk about ""Crooked Hillary"", and said he would put a handful of dirt out on the porch table if that's what I was after. When he was told that his nephew had just got the sack, he looked straight ahead and the window began slowly to roll up. A mile down the road, newspaper cuttings and pictures of Mr Scaramucci covered the walls of the auto glass shop owned by Mr Scaramucci's cousin, Augie Defeo. On a large flat screen TV, the sacking was playing out on Fox News. ""Did Sal give you the bit about the dirt on the table?"" he asked, and that was about all he wanted to say. Never a dull moment A little way up Main Street sits PD Schreiber High School, which Mr Scaramucci attended alongside his older brother and younger sister. Former classmates and teachers remembered a driven boy, slick and popular, with a habit of referring to himself in the third person as ""The Mooch"". ""He was always very political, he knew how to get things done with different groups,"" said one former teacher. ""He was a very smooth character."" A fellow 1982 graduate recalled a sharply dressed guy, quarter-back in the football team, who had ""supreme confidence, right through high school"". ""The cool guy then was John Travolta, he was just about the most macho guy there was. And for me that was Anthony. He took on that Travolta, Italian-America swagger."" Elected president of the student government, Mr Scaramucci showed flashes then of the man who would later lean on reporters to reveal their sources and advise CNN to be ""nice to me in this segment"". At one high school government meeting, he singled out the school newspaper editor over a critical editorial, telling him that ""derogatory remarks"" were ""unnecessary"", and demanding that he stand up to defend himself. The meeting descended into chaos, and a letter printed on the front page of the paper afterwards took Mr Scaramucci to task over the incident. ""At a press conference, Ronald Reagan does not get up and defend himself against all editorials and columns written on how ineffective he or his government is,"" it said. Mr Scaramucci went on from Schreiber to study economics at Tufts, then to Harvard to study law. ""He didn't really fit the stereotypical Harvard model,"" said Richard Kahlenberg, a fellow Harvard law student. ""His father was a construction worker and he had this strong New York accent. He made a very positive impression on me, he was a breath of fresh air. If he had the right-wing politics back then, I don't remember them."" He graduated from Harvard in 1989, about the time the Port Washington sand mines closed for good. ""To the victor go the spoils,"" his father Alexander wrote in his yearbook, and Mr Scaramucci headed straight for Wall Street. ""White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci joins us this morning,"" said Chris Cuomo on CNN's New Day. ""Anthony Scaramucci, can you hear us?"" Mr Scaramucci had been in the job less than a week and he was already on the back foot. Live on CNN, he spoke directly to the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza, another Long Island native, whose father knew Mr Scaramucci's father way back when. He alluded to a conversation he'd had with Mr Lizza the night before, in which he had apparently pushed the New Yorker reporter to reveal his sources in the White House. ""I was teasing you and it was sarcastic, it was one Italian to another,"" said Mr Scaramucci. Then the Mooch went on a half-hour tear against leakers, journalists and Washington political culture in general, while singing the president's praises. ""Chris, you're from New York, I'm from New York, the president is from New York. We had dinner last night. I sat next to the First Lady. I love the president."" He used the words ""honour"" and ""respect"" eight times each, and ""dignity"" four. But Mr Scaramucci was taking on water. His phone conversation with Mr Lizza had been more colourful than he was letting on. In an unforgivable lapse for a communications director, he'd forgotten to say ""off the record"". Later on Thursday, Mr Lizza published the full details. The Mooch had demanded the reporter's sources, before launching into a profane tirade in which he called White House chief of staff Reince Priebus a ""paranoid schizophrenic"" and threatened to ""kill all the leakers"". Mr Lizza's account went viral. Mr Scaramucci went on the defensive. ""I sometimes use colorful language,"" he tweeted. ""I will refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for @realDonaldTrump's agenda. #MAGA."" This video can not be played The feud between Priebus and Scaramucci decoded It wasn't the first time Mr Scaramucci had to make a public apology. In 1980, not long after being appointed high school vice-president, he got in a brawl with two fellow students he suspected of vandalising school property, later attacking them again. He published a letter in the school paper, apologising for the assault. Directly above Mr Scaramucci's apology, the paper printed an editorial titled ""A Good Leader Is"". ""A leader is not expected to find solutions through violence or threats. A bully is not a leader,"" it read, before going on to acknowledge that the school's government was made up of ""young leaders, all relatively inexperienced"". ""If a mistake is made, a Schreiber leader should learn from the experience, change his ways, and emerge as a stronger, more confident leader. If a leader does not learn from the experience, he should resign,"" the editorial said. President Trump was reportedly impressed by Mr Scaramucci's colourful phonecall, initially - he values loyalty above all - but later grew angry at the negative press coverage, and gave Mr Kelly the go-ahead to ask for his resignation. A few hours later it leaked to the press, and Mr Scaramucci's fall was complete. The short history of the Trump administration tells us that comebacks are not off the cards. Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, pushed out after appearing to assault a reporter, is now back in the Trump orbit. Reached by the Huffington Post on Tuesday, Mr Scaramucci said he planned to ""go dark"" for a while. ""Then I will re-emerge,"" the Mooch said. ""As me.""

"This video can not be played Turing Pharmaceuticals boss Martin Shkreli had previously defended the price raise Judging by social media, Martin Shkreli, the 32-year-old chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, may be the most hated man in America right now. He's been called a ""morally bankrupt sociopath"", a ""scumbag"" a ""garbage monster"" and ""everything that is wrong with capitalism."" And those are some of the tamer comments. So how did a rap music-loving, former hedge fund manager suddenly become the target of online ridicule and even death threats? His company recently acquired the rights to Daraprim. Developed in the 1950s, the drug is the best treatment for a relatively rare parasitic infection called toxoplasmosis. People with weakened immune systems, such as Aids patients, have come to rely on the drug, which until recently cost about $13.50 (Â£8.80) a dose. But Mr Shkreli announced he was raising the price to $750 a pill. The more than 5,000% increase and his brash defence of the decision has made him a pariah among patients-rights groups, politicians and hundreds of Twitter users. Other drugs companies have made similar moves raising the price of niche products, but few have so publicly and so unapologetically answered critics. The backlash became so pitched on Tuesday that Mr Shkreli agreed to lower the price of Daraprim to an ""affordable level"". Martin Shkreli, seen here in an August Twitter post, has aggressively answered critics Martin Shkreli, the son of Albanian and Croatian immigrants, grew up in a working-class community in Brooklyn, New York. He skipped several grades in school and received a degree in business from New York's Baruch College in 2004. At 17, he began his first internship at Cramer Berkowitz & Co, the hedge fund founded by television personality Jim Cramer. In 2006, Mr Shkreli started his own hedge fund, Elea Capital Management. The fund closed a year later after a $2.3m lawsuit from Lehman Brothers, which collapsed before it could collect on the ruling. After Elea, Mr Shkreli started MSMB Capital Management in 2008. The fund would be his launch pad for founding biotech firms including Turing. Shkreli moved into the pharmaceutical industry after working as a hedge fund manager Turing was not Mr Shkreli's first foray into the pharmaceutical industry. In 2011, he founded biotech firm Retrophin, with the goal of focusing on medicines for rare diseases. He was ousted as head of the company in 2014 amidst allegations he improperly handled legal settlements. A year later the company filed a $65m lawsuit that claimed Mr Shkreli created Retrophin and took it public simply to pay off investors in his old hedge fund, MSMB when the fund went under. Mr Shkreli has denied the accusations. ""They are sort of concocting this wild and crazy and unlikely story to swindle me out of the money,"" he told the New York Times. On August 4, 2017, a jury found Mr Shkreli guilty of three of eight counts, including securities fraud, in a criminal case brought by US prosecutors. But they cleared him of allegations that he had looted Retrophin to make payments for the hedge funds. The civil suit brought by Retrophin remained pending as of 4 August. Turing Pharmaceuticals bought the rights to Daraprim in August Turing Pharmaceuticals was launched in February 2015 after Mr Shkreli was forced out of Retrophin. The business claims its goal is to focus on treatments for serious diseases for which there are limited options. ""We are dedicated to helping patients, who often have no effective treatment options,"" a statement on Turing's website said. The company only has two products on the market Daraprim and Vecamyl, which treats hypertension. Mr Shkreli has argued the Daraprim price increase was warranted because the drug is highly specialised; he likened the Daraprim to an Aston Martin previously being sold at the price of a bicycle. The additional profits he said will be used to make improvements to the 62-year-old drug recipe. One of Shkreli's first tweets about the Dramaprim controversy Mr Shkreli did not take the criticism of his company's actions lightly. On Sunday, he sent out a hostile tweet accusing the media of singling him out.  ""And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me. So I point one back at em, but not the index or pinkie,"" he wrote, quoting an Eminem song. His tone later softened following several TV interviews where he claimed the profits of the drug would be used to create a better product. All of the negative attention may have finally had an effect on Mr Shkreli. His Twitter account, which had sparred with critics for days, went dark and then Mr Shkreli agreed to lower the price. ""We've agreed to lower the price on Daraprim to a point that is more affordable and is able to allow the company to make a profit, but a very small profit,"" he told ABC News. ""We think these changes will be welcomed."" What's a fair price for a drug?

"Tillerson speaks to reporters in May As the Trump administration careened past its first six months in office the swirl of speculation about an imminent ""Rexit"" prompted the Secretary of State to publicly deny that he was about to quit. Personally I don't think he is a quitter, but it's been a rough ride for both Rex Tillerson and the State Department. Every transition between administrations has a bumpy period of adjustment amidst tussles over who's controlling policy. The difference this time is the fear that the State Department's becoming irrelevant. And it's common when secretaries of state first enter the job for career officers to complain that new bosses are aloof and their staff insular. The difference this time is that the former Exxon chief executive actually sold himself well on the shop floor: he was welcomed on day one as the acceptable face of the Trump administration by employees who wanted him to succeed. But many have since grown disillusioned and demoralised. The environment is ""toxic"", says Nancy McEldowney, the director of the Foreign Service Institute, who retired early last month because ""the situation had become untenable"". This week the secretary publicly defended himself in front of the State Department press corps. It was a decent performance. However, in the minds of people who care about US foreign policy, it was way overdue. He declared that his busy schedule responding to the world's conflicts and threats demonstrated the building was ""hardly hollowed out"". But it is definitely much quieter than usual as Tillerson navigates the steep learning curve from corporate executive to top diplomat in a chaotic political climate. He is accustomed to a highly structured, disciplined environment where the buck stops with him. ""I was the ultimate decision maker (at Exxon),"" he said recently, ""that always makes life easier."" But that is never the case in government, and particularly not in this one. US Secretary of Defense James Mattis and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson walk to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee closed briefing President Trump has delegated key foreign policy portfolios to close White House aides. His erratic tweets and statements have at times contradicted and apparently undermined the secretary, reinforcing the impression that Tillerson is not in control of his brief. One of his senior advisers, RC Hammond, told me the president's tweeting can create new levers of diplomatic pressure. But Tillerson himself has likened it to one of the many unexpected elements of his universe to which he adapts. What can the US do about North Korea? What happened to State Dept briefings? Trump's 'climate Brexit' blow to Tillerson ""It's just like dealing with dynamic situations in my old CEO role,"" he's said. ""You try to accommodate what's changing and still move."" This has not, it seems, affected his ""comfortable"" and ""open"" relationship with the president, who calls him any time of the day, night or weekend. Tillerson says they speak candidly about their differences, but the secretary's voice is one among many.  He failed to persuade the president to stay in the Paris Climate Accord, and will struggle to convince him to stick with the Irannuclear agreement,external. When it comes to the State Department, Tillerson's been saddled with a proposed budget cut so draconian that even Congress isn't taking it seriously, from an administration that has demonstrated it values the military over diplomacy. This, combined with anExecutive Order demanding a streamlining of government agencies,external, has created a climate of insecurity and low morale. ""If you have the wheels cut out from under you, and you're competing with a shadow State Department in the White House, it's hard to come into the office in the morning,"" one official here told me. The result is a crisis in human resources that's damaging the department's ability to do its job. Most of the top positions crucial for shaping America's engagement with the world remain unfilled. The slow pace of senior political appointments is a problem across the administration that hasdeeply frustrated Tillerson,external, who's admitted that he has ""a lot of open slots"". At the lower level hiring is largely on hold due to the pending budget cuts and department reorganisation. Tillerson has maintained an indefinite hiring freeze, he's suspended prestigious fellowship programmes that recruittop talent,externaland stopped job transfersbetween bureaux,external. There's also been an exodus of career officers who've served for decades, some of them abruptly dismissed from their assignments with very short notice. ""That's a mistake,"" says Daniel Fried, a veteran ambassador who retired in February. ""Once you start throwing away people, that's the basic capital, you can't replace them."" McEldowney says many of her colleagues were devastated by Tillerson's take on ""America First"": he interpreted it as separating the country's interests from its values. His political aides, she says, don't trust career officers who are asking how budget cuts and staff reductions will affect US policy. This contributes to a centralised and isolated decision making process that is slowing down work. And the secretary, she says, has failed to establish effective lines of dialogue with much of the building. ""Normally after a transition the concepts of us and them blur and give way to a genuine team,"" says McEldowney. ""People are beseeching Tillerson and team to trust and empower the career people and it's falling largely on deaf ears. We were told to get with the programme and quit grousing."" All of which leaves people wondering whether the reorganisation will be a merger that eventually does create a genuine team, or a hostile takeover. Tillerson believes it's the former. He says he's consulting from the ground up and letting the employees lead the effort to redesign the department. And in the end, he vows, whether it takes changes in law or resource allocation, ""I'll darn sure go to bat for you and see what we can do."" About half of the department's 75,000 staff members took part in an initial survey. They offered suggestions for a tune-up such as improving poor technology and eliminating overlapping or redundant functions. But the corporate buzzwords used by the outside consultants conducting the exercise reinforced concerns that Tillerson and company were bringing in bean counters to assess something difficult to quantify. Unlike the economy or the military, it's difficult to apply metrics to foreign policy, to always show a concrete return on investment. ""People question if [the Trump administration and Tillerson's leadership] understand the role the Department of State plays in forwarding the interests of the United States in the world,""one report says,external. Given the timeline, these doubts could grow: the project is expected to run well into 2018. In the business world any new boss who wants to carry out radical change is advised to do so quickly. Drawing out the process fuelsleaks and rumours,externaland stokes uncertainties. People with better prospects drift away. The danger in that scenario is a slow unravelling rather than a dramatic gutting of the institution. In such circumstances, clear communication is crucial. Whatever the reality, the perception is of a State Department adrift, which means the secretary's message is not echoing through the department, never mind the world outside. To some degree that may reflect a lack of coherence in the administration as a whole, but Tillerson and his team could do a better job of selling the man and his mission, says Fried. ""You've got to work to have people internalise your vision, that's how you lead."" The addition of a spokesperson is a step in the right direction. Tillerson has also evolved from an initial aversion to media and begun holding news conferences, showing himself to be comfortable and adept at doing so. This week he gave a round-up of his hands-on, shoe-leather diplomacy aimed at trying to tighten the isolation of North Korea, salvage a relationship with Russia, ease the Qatar crisis, and inject greater US input into shaping a solution to the Ukraine conflict - Fried has called his personnel appointments on this last issue ""A-grade"". Tillerson also made a point of demonstrating that he is relying on expertise in the building, calling out by name a list of career diplomats who've been working closely with him on these issues. But in effect he told employees who are unhappy with the transition to get with the programme and quit complaining, suggesting the problem was that they were unwilling to carry out the policies of the Trump administration. The secretary of state is hopeful there will be an uptick in morale as the redesign moves forward. We shall see. I'm guessing he'll hang on at least until that's done.

"This video can not be played The taoiseach said Brexit was 'the challenge of this generation' Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has called for ""unique solutions"" to preserve the relationship between the UK and the European Union after Brexit. On his first official visit to Northern Ireland, he raised the possibility of a bilateral UK-EU customs union. The taoiseach described Brexit as ""the challenge of this generation"". In response, the UK Government said it wanted a special partnership with the EU, including an ""ambitious free trade agreement and a customs agreement"". Analysis: Varadkar on how to soften Brexit impact The Hardest Border: What happens after Brexit? Leo Varadkar profile: Ireland's youngest PM Speaking to an invited audience at Queen's University, Belfast, Mr Varadkar said: ""Every single aspect of life in Northern Ireland could be affected by Brexit."" Those who favour a hard Brexit have already had 14 months to come up with a plan, he warned. ""If they cannot, and I believe they cannot, we can then talk meaningfully about solutions that might work for all of us,"" he said. ""The Brexit negotiations are well under way in Brussels. And, to quote (EU chief Brexit negotiator) Michel Barnier, the clock is ticking."" Mr Varadkar offered two of his own suggestions: The possibility of an EU-UK customs union if the UK wants to remain in the customs union A ""deep free trade agreement"" with the EU if the UK does not want to stay in the single market, with the possibility of its rejoining EFTA (European Free Trade Association) The taoiseach referred to the lack of input into the Brexit debate from Northern Ireland due to the collapse of the Stormont executive, and urged politicians to do a deal to restore power-sharing. ""We need an answer to the question of who we - and others in Europe - talk to in Belfast,"" he said. ""Who will speak for Northern Ireland and her 1.8 million people?"" Mr Varadkar said: ""It will come as no surprise to anyone here that I do not want there to be an economic border on our island, nor do I want one between Ireland and Britain. This video can not be played A hard Irish border is 'not feasible', outgoing Irish ambassador to the UK  Daniel Mulhall told the Today programme ""By economic border, I am not talking about currency or variation in tax rates. ""I am talking about a barrier to free trade and commerce."" In response, the UK Government said no-one wanted a return to a hard border. ""We are clear that the border must be as seamless and frictionless as possible for trade, and that we must preserve the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland,"" said a government statement. ""That is why we are prioritising this issue in our negotiations."" Former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson said 17.4m people voted to leave the EU and that meant leaving the single market and customs union. ""We know perfectly well that there are heads of member states that did not like the Brexit result,"" the Conservative MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One. ""We know that the political establishment in Dublin is not happy with the fact that the UK voted to leave the EU. ""But all these stories surrounding the border are massively exaggerated when we have modern technology."" On Friday afternoon, the taoiseach met members of Northern Ireland's political parties, including representatives from the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance. Leo Varadkar and DUP Arlene Foster met in Dublin on 16 June His meeting with DUP leader Arlene Foster came days aftera row between the party and the taoiseach over the Irish border post-Brexit. But Mrs Foster told the BBC she had thanked the taoiseach for ""discounting"" the idea of a border along the Irish sea. ""There have been some very unhelpful interventions from some of his party members, but he is very clear he's not in favour of such a border,"" she said. Brexit: All you need to know Irish government will not design 'Brexiter border' Dublin berated for 'megaphone diplomacy' ""Given the amount of trade that flows, not just from from Northern Ireland into Great Britain but also from the Republic of Ireland, to suggest such a border would have been madness from their perspective"". She also hit out at what she described as Sinn FÃ©in's ""very hardline commentary"" in recent months, saying the party had showed no willingness to move from their stated positions. ""If they continue with that, we won't have devolution back, and that's a tragedy for all the people of Northern Ireland,"" said Mrs Foster. For his part, Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams said his party was in ""total agreement with the Irish government"" on the need for the institutions at Stormont to be back in place. ""The majority of people here voted against Brexit,"" he said. ""What this all boils down to is whether unionism is clinging to the remnants of the old order or whether it's prepared to accept that this state has changed utterly."" Leo Varadkar went to Queen's University for his first engagement in Northern Ireland SDLP leader Colum Eastwood criticised both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in for failing to reach a compromise that would see power-sharing restored at Stormont. ""There's an enormous battle going on right now to try to protect Northern Ireland's position in the customs union, the single market and the common travel area and we don't have a voice,"" he said. ""It's a serious dereliction of duty by the parties who got the big mandates in the last election. ""It is up to them to do the job."" Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said that their meeting with the taoiseach had been ""very constructive"" and that the party and Mr Varadkar were both ""reasonably optimistic"" that the assembly could be restored in the autumn. ""We need to come back now with the will to deliver for people, because our focus has to be on the people we represent not on any sacred cows that we set up as individual parties that make it more difficult for us to do that job."" Mr Varadkar had saidhe would not design a border for Brexiteers, butDUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said that ""megaphone diplomacy from Dublin""would not sort out the border issue.

"David Andrew Jeffers admitted possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life A woman was shot in the vagina and left with ""life changing injuries"" in a sex game gone wrong, a court has heard. The 46-year-old had been engaged in sexual activity with David Andrew Jeffers, 47, at a Stockport hotel in January when she was shot. Jeffers admitted possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and was jailed for 10 years. The two had been engaged in a ""sex fantasy"" when the weapon fired, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Greater Manchester Police branded the scene ""shocking"" and ""horrifying"". Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard the shooting happenedat the Britannia Hotelin Dialstone Lane in the early hours of 31 January. When officers arrived at the scene they found the victim in a pool of blood and suffering from serious abdominal injuries. She was taken to hospital and required extensive surgery, police said. The woman, who was too unwell to be fully interviewed at the time, told officers from her hospital bed that Jeffers was a ""bad man"". Police said Jeffers, of Berkley Terrace, Leeds, claimed to have found the gun in a pub toilet in Leeds. He said he took the gun to Manchester to dispose of it. Jeffers was spotted on CCTV leaving the hotel and going to Piccadilly Station to catch a train back to Leeds. Armed officers raided a property on Amberton Grove, Leeds, two days later and arrested Jeffers. A search of the house found a partially scrawled note denying knowledge of the shooting, the court heard. Det Insp Roger Edwards said: ""This was a horrifying incident that has left a woman with life changing injuries that will affect her for the rest of her life."" He said the crime was ""one of the most shocking"" he had encountered, adding: ""Jeffers left the victim badly bleeding in a hotel room, showing no regard for her life.

"Professor Amin Al-Habaibeh (left) and Dylan Knight (right) A simple device to cut the weight of washing machines could save fuel, cut carbon emissions, and reduce back injuries, according to researchers. A typical budget washing machine is weighted by 25kg of concrete to stop it moving while on a spin cycle. The new invention is a sealable plastic container that is filled with water - but only once the machine is in place. The team at Nottingham Trent University says the change makes machines easier - and cheaper - to transport. By replacing the concrete with empty containers, the weight of the machine is cut by a third. If the change became standard, it would cut the weight of trucks carrying the machines which would in turn cut emissions. The research suggests that with around 3.5 million washing machines sold annually in the UK, the new device could save around 44,625 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year. The idea was devised by product design company Tochi Tech Ltd, which works with the university to find innovative solutions to manufacturing common appliances. It was tested by an undergraduate on a project, Dylan Knight, 22. He told BBC News: ""Everyone thinks the idea must have been thought of before. No one can really believe it. But I promise you it definitely works."" Researchers replaced the concrete block (left) with a plastic container that can be filled with water (right) Mr Knight said the average cheaper washing machine has two concrete blocks - one under the drum at the front and one on top. For the test, he replaced the one on top with a water-filled container as proof of concept. As concrete is denser than water, the containers need to be bigger than the blocks, to make up the weight difference. The firm is in discussions with manufacturers, who will want to ensure there is no downside to this ingenious re-think of a familiar product - and maybe to ask why no-one thought of it before.

"Contaminated eggs are destroyed at a farm in the Netherlands Supermarket giant Aldi has withdrawn all eggs from sale from its stores in Germany as they may have been contaminated by insecticide. Tests showed that the chemical fipronil, which can harm people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands, was found in eggs from the Netherlands. Fipronil is used to treat lice and ticks in chickens. One German official said up to 10 million of the contaminated eggs may have been sold in Germany. Christian Meyer, the agriculture minister for Lower Saxony, told German television that there was a risk to children if they ate two of the eggs a day. About 180 poultry farms in the Netherlands have been temporarily shut in recent days while investigations are held. Marieke van der Molen, of the Dutch public prosecutor's office, said a criminal investigation was under way to find the source of the contamination. Meanwhile, European supermarkets have moved to halt the distribution of eggs from the affected batches. However, Aldi - which has close to 4,000 stores in Germany - is the first retailer to stop selling all eggs as a precaution. ""This is merely a precaution, there is no reason to assume there are any health risks,"" Aldi said in a statement. A spokeswoman for Aldi UK told the BBC its eggs were all British and were not affected by the contamination. Reuters reports that investigators believe the chemical may have originated in contaminated detergent used to clean barns. Poultry World reported that fipronil may have been deliberately added to an existing insecticide to improve its effectiveness. The Netherlands is Europe's largest exporter of eggs and egg products, and one of the biggest in the world. It exports an estimated 65% of the 10 billion eggs it produces every year.

"This video can not be played The taoiseach said Brexit was 'the challenge of this generation' Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has called for ""unique solutions"" to preserve the relationship between the UK and the European Union after Brexit. On his first official visit to Northern Ireland, he raised the possibility of a bilateral UK-EU customs union. The taoiseach described Brexit as ""the challenge of this generation"". In response, the UK Government said it wanted a special partnership with the EU, including an ""ambitious free trade agreement and a customs agreement"". Analysis: Varadkar on how to soften Brexit impact The Hardest Border: What happens after Brexit? Leo Varadkar profile: Ireland's youngest PM Speaking to an invited audience at Queen's University, Belfast, Mr Varadkar said: ""Every single aspect of life in Northern Ireland could be affected by Brexit."" Those who favour a hard Brexit have already had 14 months to come up with a plan, he warned. ""If they cannot, and I believe they cannot, we can then talk meaningfully about solutions that might work for all of us,"" he said. ""The Brexit negotiations are well under way in Brussels. And, to quote (EU chief Brexit negotiator) Michel Barnier, the clock is ticking."" Mr Varadkar offered two of his own suggestions: The possibility of an EU-UK customs union if the UK wants to remain in the customs union A ""deep free trade agreement"" with the EU if the UK does not want to stay in the single market, with the possibility of its rejoining EFTA (European Free Trade Association) The taoiseach referred to the lack of input into the Brexit debate from Northern Ireland due to the collapse of the Stormont executive, and urged politicians to do a deal to restore power-sharing. ""We need an answer to the question of who we - and others in Europe - talk to in Belfast,"" he said. ""Who will speak for Northern Ireland and her 1.8 million people?"" Mr Varadkar said: ""It will come as no surprise to anyone here that I do not want there to be an economic border on our island, nor do I want one between Ireland and Britain. This video can not be played A hard Irish border is 'not feasible', outgoing Irish ambassador to the UK  Daniel Mulhall told the Today programme ""By economic border, I am not talking about currency or variation in tax rates. ""I am talking about a barrier to free trade and commerce."" In response, the UK Government said no-one wanted a return to a hard border. ""We are clear that the border must be as seamless and frictionless as possible for trade, and that we must preserve the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland,"" said a government statement. ""That is why we are prioritising this issue in our negotiations."" Former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson said 17.4m people voted to leave the EU and that meant leaving the single market and customs union. ""We know perfectly well that there are heads of member states that did not like the Brexit result,"" the Conservative MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One. ""We know that the political establishment in Dublin is not happy with the fact that the UK voted to leave the EU. ""But all these stories surrounding the border are massively exaggerated when we have modern technology."" On Friday afternoon, the taoiseach met members of Northern Ireland's political parties, including representatives from the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance. Leo Varadkar and DUP Arlene Foster met in Dublin on 16 June His meeting with DUP leader Arlene Foster came days aftera row between the party and the taoiseach over the Irish border post-Brexit. But Mrs Foster told the BBC she had thanked the taoiseach for ""discounting"" the idea of a border along the Irish sea. ""There have been some very unhelpful interventions from some of his party members, but he is very clear he's not in favour of such a border,"" she said. Brexit: All you need to know Irish government will not design 'Brexiter border' Dublin berated for 'megaphone diplomacy' ""Given the amount of trade that flows, not just from from Northern Ireland into Great Britain but also from the Republic of Ireland, to suggest such a border would have been madness from their perspective"". She also hit out at what she described as Sinn FÃ©in's ""very hardline commentary"" in recent months, saying the party had showed no willingness to move from their stated positions. ""If they continue with that, we won't have devolution back, and that's a tragedy for all the people of Northern Ireland,"" said Mrs Foster. For his part, Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams said his party was in ""total agreement with the Irish government"" on the need for the institutions at Stormont to be back in place. ""The majority of people here voted against Brexit,"" he said. ""What this all boils down to is whether unionism is clinging to the remnants of the old order or whether it's prepared to accept that this state has changed utterly."" Leo Varadkar went to Queen's University for his first engagement in Northern Ireland SDLP leader Colum Eastwood criticised both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in for failing to reach a compromise that would see power-sharing restored at Stormont. ""There's an enormous battle going on right now to try to protect Northern Ireland's position in the customs union, the single market and the common travel area and we don't have a voice,"" he said. ""It's a serious dereliction of duty by the parties who got the big mandates in the last election. ""It is up to them to do the job."" Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said that their meeting with the taoiseach had been ""very constructive"" and that the party and Mr Varadkar were both ""reasonably optimistic"" that the assembly could be restored in the autumn. ""We need to come back now with the will to deliver for people, because our focus has to be on the people we represent not on any sacred cows that we set up as individual parties that make it more difficult for us to do that job."" Mr Varadkar had saidhe would not design a border for Brexiteers, butDUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said that ""megaphone diplomacy from Dublin""would not sort out the border issue.

"Australian police have stepped up their presence at the nation's airports A terror suspect in Australia tried to smuggle a bomb on to a plane by planting it on his unsuspecting brother, say Australian police. The plan was one of two alleged terror plots recently uncovered by authorities, who made several arrests across Sydney on Saturday. The suspects were allegedly aided by the so-called Islamic State (IS). The other plot involved building and setting off a device that could release toxic gas in a public enclosed space. Police said the plans had been ""completely disrupted"". Australian Federal Police (AFP) Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said this was ""one of the most sophisticated plots that has ever been attempted on Australian soil"". He said two suspects had built and concealed a ""high-end"" military-grade explosive in a piece of luggage. The plan was for the brother of one of the suspects to take the luggage with him onboard an Etihad Airways plane leaving Sydney airport on 15 July. The brother was not aware of the bomb, said police. But for some reason the plan was aborted at the last minute, and although the piece of luggage was taken to the airport, it was not checked in. The brother then boarded the flight - whose destination has not been specified - without the luggage. ""There is a bit of conjecture [about] why it did not get through the baggage check-in, but I want to make it quite clear - it never got near [security] screening,"" he said. Police say the suspects had assembled the bomb using parts that were sent in one package from Turkey via air cargo, which was arranged by a senior IS figure. One of the suspects had been in contact with that figure since April. Investigators have searched five properties in locations across Sydney Police said that when the bomb plot failed, the two suspects started on a second plot which involved creating an improvised chemical device designed to release hydrogen sulphide, or ""rotten egg gas"". However, Mr Phelan said the plan was not close to fruition when police intervened on Saturday. He said police had recovered components and chemicals. Mr Phelan did not name a possible target for the device. The two suspects - Khaled Khayat, 49, and Mahmoud Khayat, 32 - appeared via video link in a Sydney court on Friday charged with ""preparing for, or planning, a terrorist attack"". The pair did not apply for bail during the brief hearing, which was adjourned until 14 November. If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of life in prison. Does a surge in airport security work? The men were arrested along with two others on Saturday when police raided properties in the Sydney suburbs of Lakemba, Punchbowl, Surry Hills, Wiley Park and Bankstown. One man was released without charge on Tuesday. The fourth man remains in police custody, where he can be held without charge until Saturday. Hywel Griffith, BBC News, Sydney Australia has been touched by the threat of terror several times - most often by so-called home-grown or lone wolf dangers. What makes the latest alleged plots different is that they are believed to have been co-ordinated abroad, with an IS controller giving instructions over the course of three months. Police have repeatedly stressed how sophisticated they believe these plans had become, alleging that IS successfully managed to send military-grade explosives into Australia. That creates a very different dynamic for the intelligence services, who will need to assess whether they can realistically intercept items being flown into the country. While the security forces have been widely praised for their work in disrupting this alleged plot, they will be keenly aware of how the terror threat is continuing to evolve. The nation's official terror warning level remains at ""probable"" - the third level on a scale of five. ""This is the 13th time, because of the excellence of our law enforcement agencies, that we have been able to stop a terrorist attack from occurring on Australian soil in the past three years,"" Justice Minister Michael Keenan said on Friday. Passengers have waited in lengthy queues at airports this week To date, there have been no mass casualty terror attacks on Australian soil. Last year, Australian police said they foiled a major terror attack planned for high-profile locations inMelbourne on Christmas Day.

The brother then boarded the flight - whose destination has not been specified - without the luggage. ""There is a bit of conjecture [about] why it did not get through the baggage check-in, but I want to make it quite clear - it never got near [security] screening,"" he said. Police say the suspects had assembled the bomb using parts that were sent in one package from Turkey via air cargo, which was arranged by a senior IS figure. One of the suspects had been in contact with that figure since April. Investigators have searched five properties in locations across Sydney Police said that when the bomb plot failed, the two suspects started on a second plot which involved creating an improvised chemical device designed to release hydrogen sulphide, or ""rotten egg gas"". However, Mr Phelan said the plan was not close to fruition when police intervened on Saturday. He said police had recovered components and chemicals. Mr Phelan did not name a possible target for the device. The two suspects - Khaled Khayat, 49, and Mahmoud Khayat, 32 - appeared via video link in a Sydney court on Friday charged with ""preparing for, or planning, a terrorist attack"". The pair did not apply for bail during the brief hearing, which was adjourned until 14 November. If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of life in prison. Does a surge in airport security work? The men were arrested along with two others on Saturday when police raided properties in the Sydney suburbs of Lakemba, Punchbowl, Surry Hills, Wiley Park and Bankstown. One man was released without charge on Tuesday. The fourth man remains in police custody, where he can be held without charge until Saturday. Hywel Griffith, BBC News, Sydney Australia has been touched by the threat of terror several times - most often by so-called home-grown or lone wolf dangers. What makes the latest alleged plots different is that they are believed to have been co-ordinated abroad, with an IS controller giving instructions over the course of three months. Police have repeatedly stressed how sophisticated they believe these plans had become, alleging that IS successfully managed to send military-grade explosives into Australia. That creates a very different dynamic for the intelligence services, who will need to assess whether they can realistically intercept items being flown into the country. While the security forces have been widely praised for their work in disrupting this alleged plot, they will be keenly aware of how the terror threat is continuing to evolve. The nation's official terror warning level remains at ""probable"" - the third level on a scale of five. ""This is the 13th time, because of the excellence of our law enforcement agencies, that we have been able to stop a terrorist attack from occurring on Australian soil in the past three years,"" Justice Minister Michael Keenan said on Friday. Passengers have waited in lengthy queues at airports this week To date, there have been no mass casualty terror attacks on Australian soil. Last year, Australian police said they foiled a major terror attack planned for high-profile locations inMelbourne on Christmas Day.

"The cleared men clockwise from top left: Matthew Lucas, Lee Walls, Malcolm Reeves and Matthew Loosemore Four members of a police helicopter crew accused of filming naked sunbathers and a couple having sex have been cleared of misconduct charges. South Yorkshire Police officers Matthew Lucas, 42 and Lee Walls, 47, and pilots Matthew Loosemore, 45 and Malcolm Reeves, 64, were charged after another officer shot the footage. They were acquitted following a three week trial at Sheffield Crown Court. PC Adrian Pogmore, 50, had admitted misconduct in a public office. Helicopter film policeman 'sex-obsessed' During the trial, the court heard a couple sitting naked by a caravan were filmed in July 2008, while the aircraft also filmed a garden where a woman was sunbathing naked with her daughters in 2007. The footage also showed a couple having sex on their patio in July 2008 and at one point, the naked woman waved at the aircraft. Adrian Pogmore had admitted four charges of misconduct The defendants had blamed Pogmore, from Whiston in Rotherham, for the filming. They insisted they were not aware what he was filming and he was the only person who was present on each of the four occasions the recordings were made. Pogmore was described by the prosecution as ""a swinging and sex-obsessed air observer"" who knew the couple he filmed having sex. All of the people filmed by Pogmore, with the exception of the couple having sex, gave statements saying they felt their privacy had been invaded. Mr Reeves, from Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, had denied two counts of misconduct in a public office and Mr Loosemore, of Auckley, Doncaster, denied one count. Mr Walls, from Aston, Sheffield, denied one count while Mr Lucas, from Chapeltown, Sheffield, also denied three counts. Pogmore, who was sacked by the force in 2015 following an internal misconduct investigation, will be sentenced on Tuesday. Following the case, a spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said: ""Notwithstanding today's verdicts concerning the four defendants who were acquitted, we will now continue with misconduct proceedings internally against the other South Yorkshire Police officers.""

"Pastor Gilbert Deya is alleged to have told infertile women they could have ""miracle babies"" The UK has extradited a self-styled Kenyan pastor, who claimed he created miraculous pregnancies, to Kenya to face child-trafficking charges. Gilbert Deya's extradition came after he failed in his decade-long legal battle to remain in the UK. He denied charges of stealing five children between 1999 and 2004 when he appeared in court in Nairobi. Concerns were first raised about the conduct of Mr Deya, who ran a church in London, in a BBC investigation in 2004. Africa Live: More updates on this and other African stories The men who claim to Africa's 'miracle pastors' Infertile or post-menopausal women who attended the Gilbert Deya Ministries church in Peckham, south-east London, were told they could have ""miracle"" babies. But the babies were always ""delivered"" in backstreet clinics in Nairobi, Kenya's capital. Mr Deya later moved to Scotland, and was arrested in Edinburgh in 2006 under an international arrest warrant issued by Kenya. His Gilbert Deya Ministries is being investigated by the UK Charity Commission for alleged mismanagement. ""Our statutory inquiry into Gilbert Deya Ministries is ongoing. We are currently considering the implication of Gilbert Deya's extradition on our investigation,"" the commission said in a statement. Gilbert Deya: 'The Archbishop of Peckham' Mr Deya appeared in court soon after his extradition A former stonemason who moved to London from Kenya in the mid-90s Set up the Gilbert Deya Ministries as a registered charity, with African and Asian branches Known for his blend of charismatic, performance-style preaching Had income of Â£652,800 ($858,000) for the financial year ending December 2015 Spent Â£609,300 Described by UK Labour MP David Lammy as a ""modern-day snake-oil salesman"" Says he was consecrated as an Archbishop by a US evangelist in 1992 When the BBC asked Mr Deya during its 2014 investigation how he explained the births of children with DNA different to that of their alleged parents, the 65-year-old Mr Deya said: ""The miracle babies which are happening in our ministry are beyond human imagination. ""It is not something I can say I can explain because they are of God and things of God cannot be explained by a human being."" Kenya's police spokesman Charles Owino told the BBC that Mr Deya had arrived in Nairobi aboard a Kenya Airways flight following his extradition. Mr Deya had opposed his extradition, saying he feared being tortured and sentenced to death. In 2007, his wife, Mary, was sentenced to two years in prison in Kenya after being convicted of stealing a baby. In 2011, she was sentenced to three years in jail after being convicted of stealing another child. Desperate women, some past the menopause and others who were infertile, were convinced that being prayed for by Mr Deya and travelling to Kenya would result in a child. Once there, they were convinced by Mrs Deya and others that they were experiencing labour and taken to illegal clinics where they believed they had given birth. But they were actually given babies which had been taken from local women.

"Katherine McKenna had her phone snatched by moped thieves in the West End Moped thieves stole a mobile phone out of the hand of a London Ambulance Service (LAS) cycle paramedic while she was on duty, it has emerged. Katherine McKenna, 32, had her phone snatched after the moped thieves mounted a crowded pavement in Store Street, Bloomsbury, on 25 July. She was about to respond to an emergency call to go to the aid of an elderly man who had fallen down stairs. Police said no suspects had been identified over the attack. Ms McKenna was attacked by three muggers on two mopeds who all wore helmets with black visors covering their faces. She said she was ""really shocked. I could not believe that it happened. I was angry I couldn't respond to the patient who needed my help. ""Sadly this type of attack is common. They are hurting people; they are putting other people in danger on the roads and pavements but they are also a danger to themselves."" The mugging took place in Store Street in Bloomsbury Despite the attack Ms McKenna said she was determined to go back to work the next day. ""If I didn't go back to work, they would win. I want to keep doing my job which is caring for and treating people in London,"" the paramedic said. Paul Cook, operations general manager at LAS, said: ""It is appalling for a paramedic to be targeted while on duty and we will work with the police to identify and prosecute those who did this.""

"Police warn the suspects Wyndham Lathem (left) and Andrew Warren are believed to be ""armed and dangerous"" Police in the US say they ""have an idea"" of the whereabouts of an Oxford University college finance officer who is suspected of stabbing a 26-year-old man to death in Chicago. Andrew Warren, 56, and his alleged accomplice, American Prof Wyndham Lathem, 42, have been urged  to turn themselves in by police. Restrictions are in place to prevent the pair leaving the country.

Officers say the victim, a hairdresser who lived in Chicago, was found with multiple stab wounds in the 10th floor apartment.

"Robert Mueller has not given details himself of the investigation The special counsel investigating claims of Russian meddling in the US election has begun using a grand jury in Washington, reports say. The move suggests Robert Mueller may be taking a more aggressive approach to gathering data on possible collusion with Donald Trump's campaign team. Grand juries are used to issue subpoenas to compel people to testify. The president has again poured scorn on the inquiry, telling a rally in West Virginia it was a ""total fabrication"". What is a grand jury? Trump: US-Russia relations are at 'dangerous low' The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House In the US, grand juries are composed of members of the public who hear evidence in secret. Prosecutors use them to gather evidence, as they can compel people to testify or hand over documentation. They consider whether evidence is strong enough to issue indictments for a criminal trial. The juries do not decide the innocence or guilt of a potential defendant. Prosecutors have for months been using a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia, which had issued some subpoenas in the case, reports say. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation Mr Mueller has now opted for one of the several grand juries that sit in Washington, and reportedly began using it several weeks ago. Analysts say it shows Mr Mueller is taking full control of the investigation. He has already replaced most of the prosecutors originally on the case, in favour of his own legal minds. The switch from Virginia to Washington is also more practical. Mr Mueller's office will be closer and he knows the Washington federal courthouse better. As grand juries are secret, there will be no disclosure. Mr Mueller himself has given no details. It is clear Mr Mueller is investigating a meeting in June last year, in which Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met a Russian lawyer. Mr Trump Jr has admitted he was promised damaging material on Mr Trump's rival in the presidential race, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, though he says none was forthcoming. According to Reuters news agency, the special counsel is examining whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign encouraged the Russians to start releasing material about the Clinton campaign. Mr Mueller is reportedly seeking to determine whether Mr Trump knew of his son's meeting before it happened, or if he was briefed on it afterwards. US media have also quoted sources close to the investigation as saying that the special counsel is looking into whether President Trump obstructed justice when he fired FBI chief James Comey, who was leading the previous investigation into Russian interference. Mr Mueller was then appointed in May by the deputy attorney general of the Department of Justice to continue the inquiry. Mr Mueller is also reportedly investigating the financial dealings of former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort as well as those of Michael Flynn, who Mr Trump sacked as national security adviser because he failed to disclose his Russian contacts. Mr Trump was his defiant self at a rally in Huntington, West Virginia, on Thursday evening. Donald Trump in West Virginia: ""We didn't win because of Russia, we won because of you"" Mr Trump said the allegations were a ""hoax"" that were ""demeaning to our country"". ""The Russia story is a total fabrication,"" he said. The crowd went wild as he continued: ""Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign. There never were. We didn't win because of Russia, we won because of you."" Ty Cobb, a lawyer appointed last month as White House special counsel, said he had been unaware a grand jury was being used. But he added: ""Grand jury matters are typically secret. The White House favours anything that accelerates the conclusion of [Mr Mueller's] work fairly. The White House is committed to fully co-operating with Mr Mueller."" Another Trump lawyer, John Dowd, told Associated Press: ""With respect to the news of the federal grand jury, I have no reason to believe that the president is under investigation."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation has always been a concern for the Trump administration. Now it's deadly serious business. With the news that a grand jury has been convened in Washington DC, and that it is looking into the June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr and Russian nationals, it's clear the investigation is focusing on the president's inner circle. This news shouldn't come as a huge shock, given that Mr Mueller has been staffing up with veteran criminal prosecutors and investigators. It is, however, a necessary step that could eventually lead to criminal indictments. At the very least it's a sign that Mr Mueller could be on the trail of something big - expanding the scope beyond former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his questionable lobbying. It also indicates his investigation is not going to go away anytime soon.

"This video can not be played The taoiseach said Brexit was 'the challenge of this generation' Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has called for ""unique solutions"" to preserve the relationship between the UK and the European Union after Brexit. On his first official visit to Northern Ireland, he raised the possibility of a bilateral UK-EU customs union. The taoiseach described Brexit as ""the challenge of this generation"". In response, the UK Government said it wanted a special partnership with the EU, including an ""ambitious free trade agreement and a customs agreement"". Analysis: Varadkar on how to soften Brexit impact The Hardest Border: What happens after Brexit? Leo Varadkar profile: Ireland's youngest PM Speaking to an invited audience at Queen's University, Belfast, Mr Varadkar said: ""Every single aspect of life in Northern Ireland could be affected by Brexit."" Those who favour a hard Brexit have already had 14 months to come up with a plan, he warned. ""If they cannot, and I believe they cannot, we can then talk meaningfully about solutions that might work for all of us,"" he said. ""The Brexit negotiations are well under way in Brussels. And, to quote (EU chief Brexit negotiator) Michel Barnier, the clock is ticking."" Mr Varadkar offered two of his own suggestions: The possibility of an EU-UK customs union if the UK wants to remain in the customs union A ""deep free trade agreement"" with the EU if the UK does not want to stay in the single market, with the possibility of its rejoining EFTA (European Free Trade Association) The taoiseach referred to the lack of input into the Brexit debate from Northern Ireland due to the collapse of the Stormont executive, and urged politicians to do a deal to restore power-sharing. ""We need an answer to the question of who we - and others in Europe - talk to in Belfast,"" he said. ""Who will speak for Northern Ireland and her 1.8 million people?"" Mr Varadkar said: ""It will come as no surprise to anyone here that I do not want there to be an economic border on our island, nor do I want one between Ireland and Britain. This video can not be played A hard Irish border is 'not feasible', outgoing Irish ambassador to the UK  Daniel Mulhall told the Today programme ""By economic border, I am not talking about currency or variation in tax rates. ""I am talking about a barrier to free trade and commerce."" In response, the UK Government said no-one wanted a return to a hard border. ""We are clear that the border must be as seamless and frictionless as possible for trade, and that we must preserve the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland,"" said a government statement. ""That is why we are prioritising this issue in our negotiations."" Former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson said 17.4m people voted to leave the EU and that meant leaving the single market and customs union. ""We know perfectly well that there are heads of member states that did not like the Brexit result,"" the Conservative MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One. ""We know that the political establishment in Dublin is not happy with the fact that the UK voted to leave the EU. ""But all these stories surrounding the border are massively exaggerated when we have modern technology."" On Friday afternoon, the taoiseach met members of Northern Ireland's political parties, including representatives from the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance. Leo Varadkar and DUP Arlene Foster met in Dublin on 16 June His meeting with DUP leader Arlene Foster came days aftera row between the party and the taoiseach over the Irish border post-Brexit. But Mrs Foster told the BBC she had thanked the taoiseach for ""discounting"" the idea of a border along the Irish sea. ""There have been some very unhelpful interventions from some of his party members, but he is very clear he's not in favour of such a border,"" she said. Brexit: All you need to know Irish government will not design 'Brexiter border' Dublin berated for 'megaphone diplomacy' ""Given the amount of trade that flows, not just from from Northern Ireland into Great Britain but also from the Republic of Ireland, to suggest such a border would have been madness from their perspective"". She also hit out at what she described as Sinn FÃ©in's ""very hardline commentary"" in recent months, saying the party had showed no willingness to move from their stated positions. ""If they continue with that, we won't have devolution back, and that's a tragedy for all the people of Northern Ireland,"" said Mrs Foster. For his part, Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams said his party was in ""total agreement with the Irish government"" on the need for the institutions at Stormont to be back in place. ""The majority of people here voted against Brexit,"" he said. ""What this all boils down to is whether unionism is clinging to the remnants of the old order or whether it's prepared to accept that this state has changed utterly."" Leo Varadkar went to Queen's University for his first engagement in Northern Ireland SDLP leader Colum Eastwood criticised both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in for failing to reach a compromise that would see power-sharing restored at Stormont. ""There's an enormous battle going on right now to try to protect Northern Ireland's position in the customs union, the single market and the common travel area and we don't have a voice,"" he said. ""It's a serious dereliction of duty by the parties who got the big mandates in the last election. ""It is up to them to do the job."" Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said that their meeting with the taoiseach had been ""very constructive"" and that the party and Mr Varadkar were both ""reasonably optimistic"" that the assembly could be restored in the autumn. ""We need to come back now with the will to deliver for people, because our focus has to be on the people we represent not on any sacred cows that we set up as individual parties that make it more difficult for us to do that job."" Mr Varadkar had saidhe would not design a border for Brexiteers, butDUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said that ""megaphone diplomacy from Dublin""would not sort out the border issue. On Saturday, Mr Varadkar, who is the Republic of Ireland's first openly gay taoiseach, willattend an event as part of Belfast's gay pride festival.

"Marcus Hutchins wanted to remain anonymous after the WannaCry outbreak, but his identity was revealed British cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins will appear in court in Las Vegas later charged in a US cyber-crime case. The 23-year-old has been accused of involvement with Kronos - a piece of malware used to steal banking logins from victims' computers. Mr Hutchins, from Ilfracombe in Devon, came to prominence after he stalled the WannaCry cyber-attack which hit the NHS in May. The FBI arrested him on Wednesday. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has said it was aware of the situation with fellow cyber-security researchers expressing surprise at the indictment. WannaCry spread rapidly through computer systems around the world, in an unprecedented outbreak that began on 12 May. Shortly afterwards, Mr Hutchins was thrust into the limelight after he found a way to stop it from spreading. He had been in Las Vegas attending the Black Hat and Def Con cyber-security conferences, but activity on his Twitter feed - usually highly active - ceased two days ago. ""Marcus Hutchins... a citizen and resident of the United Kingdom, was arrested in the United States on 2 August, 2017, in Las Vegas, Nevada, after a grand jury in the Eastern District of Wisconsin returned a six-count indictment against Hutchins for his role in creating and distributing the Kronos banking Trojan,"" the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a statement. ""The charges against Hutchins, and for which he was arrested, relate to alleged conduct that occurred between in or around July 2014 and July 2015."" It is not known where Mr Hutchins is being held in custody. Kronos is malware that is designed to steal banking login and other financial data from infected computers. The DoJ's indictment is dated 12 July, before Mr Hutchins arrived in the US. It alleges that he created and sold Kronos on internet forums, including the AlphaBay dark web market,which was recently shut downafter an international law enforcement operation. His mother, Janet Hutchins, said it was ""hugely unlikely"" that her son was involved, saying he had spent ""enormous amounts of time and even his free time"" stopping attacks like these. A second defendant is also included in the indictment, but their name has not been made public. Mr Hutchins tweeted about Kronos shortly after it was reported in the press: ""Anyone got a Kronos sample?"" he wrote. Mr Hutchins tweets under the pseudonym 'MalwareTech' People, who work with Mr Hutchins investigating malware, have said ""it looks like the US justice system has made a huge mistake"". He was arrested while at an airport, his colleagues say, and has not been allowed visitors. Digital rights groups have said they are ""deeply concerned"" by Mr Hutchin's situation. A spokesman for the UK's National Cyber Security Centre said: ""This is a law enforcement matter and it would be inappropriate to comment further."" The DoJ has said Mr Hutchins' case was investigated by the FBI's cyber-crime unit in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The British Consulate in Los Angeles said it is in contact with the local authorities in Las Vegas and was providing support to his family. The AlphaBay dark web market went offline earlier this month US cyber-attorney Tor Ekeland said Mr Hutchins could face ""40 years in jail"" if found guilty but admitted the case had not named any victims. Speaking on Radio 4's Today, he said alleging that writing software of this type is potentially illegal is ""highly problematic"" for the information security industry. ""I can think of a number of examples of legitimate software that would potentially be a felony under this theory of prosecution."" This video can not be played Marcus Hutchins could face ""decades in jail"", computer-crime attorney Tor Ekeland tells Radio 4's Today Kronos is a type of malware known as a Trojan, meaning it disguises itself as legitimate software. It is thought to be named after a mythological creature. Kronos first came tolight in July 2014,external, when it was advertised on a Russian underground forum for $7,000 (Â£5,330) - a relatively high figure at the time. It was marketed as way to steal logins for banking websites and other financial data. Its vendor boasted it could evade existing anti-virus software and said it worked with the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome web browsers. In an unusual step, the developer promised free upgrades and bug fixes and the option of a $1,000 one week trial. After much publicity it faded from view until October 2015, whenIBM researchers reported,externalthat Kronos had been spotted in attacks on UK and Indian bank websites. Kronos then struck again in May 2016, when the cyber-security firm Proofpoint reported it had been used to target customers ofCanadian financial institutions,external. In November Proofpoint reported it hadspotted the Trojan being,externaldistributed via emails sent to organisations involved in the financial services, hospitality, higher education and healthcare industries. The messages contained attachments and links that claimed to be related to Microsoft Sharepoint documents, but in fact led victims' computers to be infected with other malware, including a credit card number-stealing tool.

"Trying a few words on holiday is a great way to start learning a language, says the British Council Over half of Britons who holiday abroad say they have pointed at a restaurant menu to avoid having to pronounce non-English words, a survey suggests. And almost half said they were embarrassed at not being able to speak the local language while away. But 80% of more than 1,700 people questioned for the British Council felt it was important to learn some phrases. ""Trying out a few words is the perfect way to get started,"" said Vicky Gough, British Council schools advisor. The Populus survey found 37% of British holidaymakers always tried to speak a few words in the local language but 29% said they were too scared to try. It also found that 36% felt guilty at asking locals to speak English, while: 56% resorted to pointing at menus 45% relied on the assumption that all locals would speak English 42% spoke English more slowly and loudly 15% even tried speaking English in a foreign accent A minority (15%) admitted to being so unwilling to try pronouncing words from other languages that they would only eat in British or fast food restaurants while overseas, rather than sampling local cuisine. A similar number said they preferred staying in self-contained resorts to avoid local culture. ""It's great that many of us are willing to have a go at speaking the local language while overseas,"" said Ms Gough. ""It's a meaningful gesture that will help you get the most from your holiday. ""But too many of us are still relying too heavily on English alone. And, if this means we're missing out on holiday, imagine the effect that our lack of language skills is having on the UK more widely. ""The reality is that having more of us being able to speak at least a little of a foreign language is good for the UK's long-term competitiveness, particularly as the country comes to reposition itself on the world stage. ""Speaking other languages not only gives you an understanding of other cultures but is good for business and for life too. ""Trying out a few words or phrases on holiday this summer and encouraging our young people to do the same is the perfect way to get started."" Around one in six of those polled said they could speak a foreign language to a high standard and just over a third could hold a basic conversation. Previous research,externalby the British Council, the UK's international culture and education organisation, has found that the UK has a shortage of people able to speak the 10 most important world languages, which is likely to hamper the country's future prosperity and global standing.

"Professor Amin Al-Habaibeh (left) and Dylan Knight (right) A simple device to cut the weight of washing machines could save fuel, cut carbon emissions, and reduce back injuries, according to researchers. A typical budget washing machine is weighted by 25kg of concrete to stop it moving while on a spin cycle. The new invention is a sealable plastic container that is filled with water - but only once the machine is in place. The team at Nottingham Trent University says the change makes machines easier - and cheaper - to transport. By replacing the concrete with empty containers, the weight of the machine is cut by a third. If the change became standard, it would cut the weight of trucks carrying the machines which would in turn cut emissions. The research suggests that with around 3.5 million washing machines sold annually in the UK, the new device could save around 44,625 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year. The idea was devised by product design company Tochi Tech Ltd, which works with the university to find innovative solutions to manufacturing common appliances. It was tested by an undergraduate on a project, Dylan Knight, 22. He told BBC News: ""Everyone thinks the idea must have been thought of before. No one can really believe it. But I promise you it definitely works."" Researchers replaced the concrete block (left) with a plastic container that can be filled with water (right) Mr Knight said the average cheaper washing machine has two concrete blocks - one under the drum at the front and one on top. For the test, he replaced the one on top with a water-filled container as proof of concept. As concrete is denser than water, the containers need to be bigger than the blocks, to make up the weight difference. The firm is in discussions with manufacturers, who will want to ensure there is no downside to this ingenious re-think of a familiar product - and maybe to ask why no-one thought of it before.

"Study finds the age a male first sees porn shapes their attitudes later towards women The age at which a male first sees pornography is associated with certain sexist attitudes later in life, according to a team of researchers from the University of Nebraska. Their survey revealed the younger the first viewing occurred, the more likely a male was to want power over women. While if they were older, they were more likely to be sexually promiscuous. Of the 330 undergraduates surveyed, with a median age of 20, the average age they first saw pornography was 13. The youngest was only five, while the oldest was 26. The unpublished findings were presented at a convention in Washington. Lead researcher Alyssa Bischmann and her team asked the men, the vast majority of whom were heterosexual and white, when they first saw porn and whether it was intentional, accidental or forced. They were then asked 46 questions which measured how they conformed to one of two behavioural traits - seeking power over women or sexually promiscuous behaviour and living a playboy lifestyle. They found those who saw porn young were most likely to agree with statements that asserted male dominance, such as ""things tend to be better when men are in charge"". The researchers were surprised to find that seeing porn later in life was associated with a playboy lifestyle, such as preferring to frequently change sexual partners. Researcher Christina Richardson said this could be because those who were exposed to porn early often did not enjoy sex in real life. ""These men often have a lot of performance anxiety with women in real life. Sexual experiences don't go as planned or the way they do in pornography,"" she said. Alternatively ""those who see porn later, enjoy sex in real life more and therefore might be more likely to live a playboy lifestyle"". The research, which was presented at the American Psychological Association's annual convention, did not take into account how much porn the men watched, the type of porn or other demographic factors, such as their socio-economic background. It could also have been other personality traits that determined when the males were exposed to porn. Peter Saddington, sex therapist at relationship support provider Relate, said: ""Pornography can and does have an impact on many young men's attitudes to sex. ""The result can be that young men develop sexist attitudes and are essentially sexually deskilled."" Either way, Ms Richardson says porn ""is not the healthiest thing for men"". She added that young men needed ""better role models to develop more healthy beliefs about masculinity"".
