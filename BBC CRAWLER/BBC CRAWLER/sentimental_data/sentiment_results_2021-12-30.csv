"NHS workers must be given priority for accessing lateral flow Covid-19 tests, professional health bodies say. The British Medical Association and Royal College of Nursing said health staff should come first for the rapid tests to ease staffing issues. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said ministers expect they will need to ""constrain"" supply for two weeks to manage surging demand. It comes as UKdaily Covid cases,externalreached another record high of 189,213. A further 332 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded - the highest figure since 2 March. However, the number of deaths includes a backlog of hospital deaths reported overnight by NHS England covering the period from 24 to 29 December. The number of daily cases also include figures from Wales for a two-day period. Meanwhile,Wales has loaned four million lateral flow tests to England. And Mr Javid said the supply of lateral flow tests in the UK was being tripled early next year, to 300 million a month. Labour is also calling for key workers to be prioritised for PCR and lateral flow tests, warning that the issue is adding to staff shortages. When should I take a Covid test? Warning over patchy lateral flow Covid test supply Scientists advised post-Christmas lockdown Some NHS staff have told the BBC they cannot get hold of any, as they have to use the same system as everyone else. One cancer care worker from London said she missed several days of work after being unable to order rapid tests online or collect them from a pharmacy - even after identifying as a key worker. Speaking on condition of anonymity, she said: ""This is one of the key reasons why there are absences on the front line. ""I used to pick up two boxes of 40 tests from work, but now I have to access tests in the same queue as the general public."" Another NHS worker, based in Cambridgeshire, also confirmed to the BBC they had been unable to get hold of rapid tests through their hospital ahead of the Christmas period. And a junior doctor based in London said her hospital does on-site testing for staff - but when three of her housemates recently got Covid, she was unable to get lateral flow tests to use at home. ""On the government website you can say if you're an NHS staff member but it takes you to the same page everyone else gets,"" she said. The doctor said it was the same situation with PCR tests, so she paid Â£80 for a private 'Fit to Fly' test just before Christmas - more usually carried out before travelling abroad - so she could return to work and know she was safe to see family. Caroline, a GP nurse in Kent, said she had to return to work after Christmas without taking a test as she could not get hold of any lateral flow tests or book a PCR - but later developed symptoms and tested positive. ""I will have put my patients at risk, including a new born baby coming for their first immunisations, and my colleagues,"" she told the BBC. Are you an NHS worker affected by the unavailability of Covid tests? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk Meanwhile, Covid hospital admissions are also rising, with 2,082 admissions in England on 28 December - up 90% in a week and the highest daily figure since February. The latest figures do not break down data into those who have been admitted because of symptoms directly linked to Covid and those admitted for other conditions who tested positive on arrival. The number of Covid patients in England's hospitals - 11,452 - is still well below the peak of around 34,000 last January. While some struggle to get lateral flow tests online, they are available at some centres like this one in East London Currentgovernment guidance,externalfor NHS workers in England states those who are a contact of a Covid-19 case must test negative via a PCR test and take lateral flow tests for 10 days after the contact - with tests taken before their shift on days they are due to work. The Department for Health and Social Care said the NHS has additional stock of lateral flow tests and stressed people who ""live or work in vulnerable settings have access to dedicated testing order routes"". A government spokesperson said: ""Throughout the pandemic we have prioritised the most vulnerable when it comes to vaccines, boosters, testing and other infection control measures such as PPE."" Issues with accessing tests have been reported in recent weeks, with intermittent online availability of lateral flow and PCR test slots, as well as many pharmacies lacking supplies of the rapid tests. Problems getting hold of them could lead to people mixing over the New Year without knowing if they are infectious, immunologist Prof Peter Openshaw has warned. The UKHSA has said that eight million lateral flow tests would be made available to pharmacies by Friday - New Year's Eve. Cases: 189,213 (weekly total up 45.1%) Deaths: 332 (weekly total down 10.6%) People in hospital: 11,898 Boosters and third doses: 435,293 Source:UK government,external(cases and deaths reported on 30 December, hospital and vaccination figures for 29 December) Dr David Wrigley, the British Medical Association's deputy council chair, said staff absences in the NHS were having an effect on patient care, with cancelled appointments and longer waiting times, and that key workers should be prioritised. General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, Pat Cullen, echoed this call, saying it was vital staff have access to tests to protect themselves and their patients. Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers which represents trusts, said coronavirus absences were having a significant impact on the economy and parts of the health service. Unison, one of the largest unions representing health workers, said NHS trusts need to ""up the pressure"" on the government to distribute the tests needed if stocks are low. Latest data showed 18,829 staff at NHS acute trusts in England were off work due to Covid, either through sickness or self-isolation, on 19 December. Figures for more recent days are due to be released on Friday.

"Wales' first minister urged people last week to use lateral flow tests before mixing with others The Welsh government has ""loaned"" four million lateral flow tests to the UK government for use in England. It brings the total number of tests sent across the border to 10 million, according to the PA News agency. Professional health bodies in England havecalled for NHS staff to be given priorityamid""patchy supply"". Deals such as these are common between the Welsh and UK governments, and have been negotiated previously to address shortages of tests and PPE. It is unclear how the loan will work and how it will be repaid.

"Health secretary Sajid Javid says the government will buy hundreds of millions more lateral flow tests, after days of supply issues There are shortages of the rapid tests and PCR slots in many parts of the UK In a letter to MPs, Javid says supplies of LFTs in January and February will be tripled from pre-Omicron levels to 300 million per month Health officials also say eight million lateral flow kits will be sent to pharmacies before New Year's Eve 855 deaths registered in the UK in the week to 17 December involved Covid-19, new data shows Covid absences are having a significant impact on the NHS and the economy, says the head of NHS Providers Meanwhile, Nightingale surge ""hubs"" are being prepared at hospitals across England Edited by James Clarke We'll be closing our live coverage shortly so here's a reminder of the main stories today: Today's page was written by Becky Morton and Doug Faulkner and edited by James Clarke. Join us again tomorrow and in the meantime you can keep up with the latest updateson the front page of the website. Jim ReedHealth reporter, BBC News A delay to death statistics in England means the
governmentâs coronavirus dashboard is unlikely to be updated before 19:30 this
evening. But NHS England has separately published its latest daily hospital
data. It shows there were 2,082 Covid admissions on 28 December in
England, up 90% in a week and the highest single day figure since February. In
London, still seen as the centre of the Omicron wave, there were another 456
people admitted to hospital. The NHS does not break down that data into those who have
been admitted because of symptoms directly linked to the virus and those
admitted for other conditions who tested positive on arrival. In total there are now 11,452 Covid patients being treated
in English hospitals, up from 7,114 a week earlier but still well below the
peak of about 34,000 last January. The number of the most seriously ill being treated on a
ventilator has risen slightly to 782 patients but is still below the level seen
a fortnight ago. We've got a few charts that illustrate some of the coronavirus trends around the world. Since the start of the pandemic there have now been more than 280 million cases confirmed. Asia and Europe have generally been the two continents where confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been most prevalent - and at the moment Europe is by some distance the region with most cases, as this chart shows. And in Europe case rates are varying. In some countries this could be because of delays in reporting figures over Christmas but the chart does suggest the UK and France have the highest case numbers at the moment. A memorial to the NHS fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore was installed at a Derbyshire nature reserve two days after he died aged 100 in February. Now it's been vandalised. A man said he was left feeling physically sick after it wasdaubed with white paint saying ""IRA"". Anthony Ball - who spotted it while walking at Thistley Place Meadow in Hatton on Wednesday - covered it up within hours. ""I was on a walk around the meadow when I saw it... I had to go back home and fetch a bin bag to put on him. ""I couldn't let people see him with that graffiti on, it's not nice."" Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, has told the BBC new Covid surge hubs could help if there is a wave of Omicron admissions. He says lessons have been learned from the original Nightingale hospital set-ups and these hubs will be located at existing medical centres rather than conference centres. This video can not be played The rules about testing after exposure to a positive Covid case vary depending on where you live in the UK: If you have Covid symptoms or a positive lateral flow result you should book a PCR test - regardless of where you are in the UK. People are also being advised to take a lateral flow test before visiting vulnerable people or high-risk places. You can read more about when you should take a test here. The Welsh government is loaning four million lateral flow tests to England amid a shortage of supplies. First Minister Mark Drakeford says: ""Wales has a significant stock of lateral flow tests, sufficient to meet our needs over the weeks ahead."" Rapid tests have been intermittently unavailable to order online from the government website, while pharmacies have also reported patchy supplies. There has been a surge in demand after the public were urged to take a rapid test before socialising and to enable them to leave isolation after seven days. The coronavirus pandemic has been slowed in developed countries thanks to massive vaccination drives. Countries have bought stocks to cover their populations, and in many cases have far more than they need. However, poorer countries generally haven't been able to reserve and buy the vaccine stock they need. In the video below, three experts explain how we arrived at this point and the challenges now facing everyone involved in the fight against Covid-19. This video can not be played With New Year's Eve now just a day away let us refresh your memoryabout the rules on gatherings. InEnglandthere are no limits affecting the number of people who can spend time with each other but ministers have urged people to be cautious and test before going out. People need to showtheir Covid statusto gain entry to nightclubs and many other venues, while face coverings are compulsory in most indoor public venues, but are not needed in pubs or restaurants. InScotlandnightclubs must close and pubs and other hospitality venues selling alcohol must reintroduce table service. The government is advising people to limit social mixing but if they do they are advised to meet just two other households - and to use lateral flow tests before gathering. All outdoor events are limited to just 500 people for three weeks, while indoor events are limited to 200 seated people, or 100 standing. InWalessocial distancing of 2m (6ft) is required in all premises open to the public and the rule of six applies in premises such as hospitality venues. Licensed premises must take additional measures to protect customers and staff, including table service and collecting contact details, and face coverings are required in hospitality settings, apart from when seated. Large events are not allowed: a maximum of 30 people are allowed at indoor events and 50 at outdoors. InNorthern Irelandnightclubs have closed and dancing is banned in all hospitality venues. All indoor standing events are not allowed while in hospitality venues a maximum of six people, or 10 people from a single household, are allowed at a table (excluding aged 12 and under). Hospitality venues including pubs, cafes and restaurants can provide table service only. A maximum of 30 people from an unlimited number of households can meet indoors in domestic settings. We normally get the latest UK Covid data at 16:00, giving updates on cases, deaths within 28 days of a test, and other stats. The figures have been later over the festive period - and today they are not expected until an estimated 19:30 GMT. The mainUK Covid dashboard,externalsays it's because of delays in receiving deaths data for England. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News As cases of Omicron rise steeply across the UK, all eyes
are on the impact on hospitals. NHS data for England shows thereâs been a sharp increase in
the rate at which older age groups are ending up in hospital with Covid. Infections look like they are now seeping into the over-85s
as well as people in their 60s and 70s. There are signs of a slight uptick in children too,
particularly the under-fives, but at a much lower level. However, itâs difficult to know how many were admitted
because of Covid and how many were admitted for another reason and then tested
positive for coronavirus. This data doesnât differentiate between the two. The vaccines are undoubtedly making a difference â and for
most of those infected, the illness is mild. Yet there is still concern over the impact on hospitals even
if a small proportion of cases become seriously ill. More data is expected later today. A further 19,544 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant have been reported across the UK, the UK Health Security Agency says - taking the total to 229,666. The UKHSA says the daily Omicron variant overview will be reported for the final time tomorrow as data shows that Omicron cases now constitute more than 90% of all community Covid-19 cases in England - meaning the actual number of Omicron cases could be much higher.

Two cross-channel operators say French Covid rules have been tightenedmeaning British people can no longer travel through France by roadto reach their homes within the EU. P&O Ferries and Eurotunnel say changes were made by the French on Tuesday. But the French Interior Minister told news agency AFP there were no new rules and it was only applying restrictions introduced before Christmas. The BBC has been told the UK government is urgently seeking clarification. The UK Foreign Officehas updated its travel advice,externalfor France to state: ""The French government have indicated that UK nationals travelling from the UK who are not resident in France will not be permitted to transit France to return to their country of residence unless they are travelling by air."" Since 18 December, British citizens haveneeded an essential reason to travelto France, with some exemptions in place. The isolation period for people in Wales who test positive for Covidis being cut from 10 days to seven- if people get negative lateral flow results on days six and seven. The change, which will come into force from 31 December, is being made because the ""balance of harms have changed"", Health Minister Eluned Morgan says. From tomorrow, Scotland will be the only part of the UK where people who test positive must definitely continue to isolate for 10 days. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says that, with another record tally of 16,857 Covid cases reported in the country today, the ""likelihood of getting it just now if you mix with others is high"". She says hospital occupancy figures are just as notable as the cases, with ""the largest single day increase in a while"". This is a reminder that even if Omicron causes a lower percentage of people to be hospitalised ""sheer volume will still put acute pressure on NHS - and result in serious illness for many"". She says, as concerning as the numbers are, they would be worse if people were not following the public health guidance and urges people to continue to do so as we approach new year. A total of 435,293 Covid booster vaccines and third doses were reported in the UK on Wednesday, according to the latest figures. This is the highest daily figure since 23 December. More than 33.5 million booster and third doses have now been administered in the UK, with 1.8 million in the past seven days. Around 63% of all adults in the UK have now received a booster or third dose. The home secretary has strongly criticised a group of protesterswho disrupted a testing centre in Milton Keynes yesterday. ""It is completely unacceptable that conspiracy theorists are intimidating and harassing those administering tests or delivering the life-saving vaccine programme,""Priti Patel writes on Twitter,external. Dozens entered the site, with some shouting abuse at staff and appearing to damage equipment. Patel says she is being kept updated on the police investigation. ""The police have my full support to take swift action where necessary,"" she adds. NHS workers must be given priority for accessing lateral flow tests, professional health bodies have said. The British Medical Association and Royal College of Nursing said health workers must come first for rapid tests to ease staffing issues. One cancer care worker from London said she missed several days of work after being unable to get rapid tests by online ordering or collecting from a pharmacy - even after identifying as a key worker. There has been intermittent availability of lateral flow and PCR tests online, while pharmacies have also reported a lack of supplies. The UK Health Security Agency has said availability is refreshed throughout the day so people should keep checking back online. Read more. The UK is still seeing very high Covid hospital admissions, despite early evidence suggesting Omicron may be milder than previous variants, the government's former chief scientific adviser says. Prof Mark Walport tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that it is not yet clear whether the wave will break through to older people in the UK. And with around five million adults in the UK still completely unvaccinated, he says the risk of being admitted to hospital remains for those individuals. He adds that the ""astronomical number of infections"" in the UK also poses ""terrific challenges"" for the workforce, with large numbers isolating. The self-isolation period for people in Northern Ireland who have tested positive for coronavirus will be reduced from 10 days to seven - provided they get negative lateral flow results on day six and seven. The change will come into effect tomorrow. It brings Northern Ireland into line with England but the self-isolation requirement remains 10 days in Scotland and Wales. No further restrictions will be introduced in Northern Ireland, the country's first minister confirmed. Paul Givan said the Northern Ireland Executive would continue to assess the data and meet again on 6 January. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The stretch of the A465 was due to open in 2018 A stretch of a major road in south Wales has opened - three years late and more than Â£110m over budget. The section of the A465 from Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, to Gilwern, Monmouthshire, should have opened in 2018, but has been beset with problems. The road as a whole has seen works for 20 years along different sections. The Welsh government acknowledged the project had caused ""difficulties"" for people, but said the scheme would help deliver on long-term commitments. The initial budget was Â£223m but has skyrocketed to Â£336m, partly due to a legal dispute between the Welsh government and contractors Costain, although the true cost of the project is said to be commercially sensitive. Welsh gov spent Â£45m on road project compensation Drivers frustrated at new Â£336m road's 50mph plan Many hope the road can bring positives, despite the cost. Lee Meredith says he has seen more business since the road opened earlier this month Lee Meredith, of Community Fitness in Brynmawr, said the route appeared to be bringing in more business. He said: ""We did some promotion in the Abergavenny area, Blaenavon, Pontypool... and since the road has reopened, memberships have gone up quite well. Just due to the access to Brynmawr and the local area. It's a positive thing really."" Charlotte Evans, of education and training provider Sgiliau, said she ""can't believe"" it took seven years to finish the work. ""From visiting Brynmawr centre and travelling to Abergavenny, our other centre, it has been a long stretch, especially waiting in traffic and we've had to make up that time at home with the paperwork,"" she said. ""But I love Brynmawr and I hope now with all the roads going back to normal, fingers crossed we'll have a lot more young people and businesses going back to normal."" Charlotte Evans says she cannot believe the work took seven years to complete The work has been part of the Welsh government's Â£800m scheme to turn the whole route from Monmouthshire to Neath Port Talbot into a dual carriageway. Construction is also taking place on the stretch of road between Dowlais Top, Merthyr Tydfil, and Hirwaun, in Rhondda Cynon Taf, meaning more disruption until 2025. The road was originally built in the 1960s, one of five key routes identified by the Ministry of Transport in a post-war economy to link the area to the Midlands. Prof Calvin Jones says the upgrade is likely to be the last major road-building project in Wales Prof Calvin Jones, of Cardiff University's business school, said the road was an important one, which many firms ""depend on and will increasingly depend on as it improves"". But he said the level of investment would not happen again, especially after plans for an M4 relief road at Newport were scrapped because of the cost and impact on the environment. ""I absolutely think that sort of money will not be put into one road project in Wales, probably ever again,"" he said. ""I thinkthe M4 was a watershed- we won't go back. ""Big infrastructure projects are certainly not going away because we absolutely need those to transform the Welsh economy, to make it more sustainable and climate neutral, but I think those big road days are gone. "" Work is ongoing between Dowlais Top and Hirwaun Earlier this year, the Welsh governmentput a freeze on all new road-building projectsmeaning the kind of schemes that get the go-ahead in the future may be different. But others in the area believe alternatives to road travel will not work for people who need to cross the valleys. Neil Gregory, of GOS Tool and Engineering Services in Blaenavon, Blaenau Gwent, which employs 135 people making excavators for the railways, said the new dual carriageway was ""terrific"" and a vital link for many. ""We have people trying to come to us from all of the top of the valley towns every morning,"" Mr Gregory explained. ""There is no way they could get here for 07:30 on public transport. It is essential that we have a strong road network at the heads of the valleys."" The Welsh government said: ""This has been a challenging project and we know that at times it has caused some difficulties for local people and businesses, but the scheme will deliver on our long-term commitment to improve traffic flow, reduce journey time, enhance road safety and improve resilience in this area whilst considering the impact on the environment.""

"Statistics from Halifax have shown that Wales has seen the highest house price rise than any other UK nation over the past year House prices in Wales rose more than any other nation or region of the UK over the past year, according to new figures. Figures for 2021 by mortgage provider Halifax showed prices in Wales increased on average by 14%. That was more than in every region of England, as well as in both Scotland and Northern Ireland. Halifax also ranked UK ""hotspots"", with Swansea at 12 and prices up 15.5%, bringing the city average to Â£211,950. Land registry figures,externalup to October also found that Wales saw the highest rise over the past year, which they put at 15.5% Wales sees highest house price rise in UK Buying a home an 'unachievable dream' for many Dozens queue overnight to snap up new houses The English region with the biggest rise was Yorkshire and the Humber, with 10.3%. In Scotland there was a 8.8% increase and Northern Ireland, 7.6% in the past year. Figures by Halifax showed that Taunton in Somerset topped the UK ""hotspots"" list overall. There price rises went up 21.8%, with the average house costing Â£315,759. London saw a fall in prices by 0.6% taking average house prices to Â£554,684, equating to a fall of Â£3,588. Nowhere in London appeared in the top 20 hotspots list. The London area with the highest growth was Enfield, where the average house price went up by 6.8% to Â£512,135. Westminster in central London recorded the biggest fall of any area, with average house prices there down by 6.9%. Halifax's managing director Russell Galley said: ""It is rare that no London boroughs appear amongst the areas of highest house price growth but that is the case in 2021. ""This shift echoes what we have seen from home-buyers over the last year - less focus on major cities and more demand in the suburbs and further afield."" In August, another poll by the property website Rightmove also showed Wales had the biggest house price rise in the UK. The Rightmove report said there had been a 2.3% rise in the past month alone and a 10.9% increase year-on-year across Wales. Rightmove's director of property data Tim Bannister said the August figures showed ""how the property market in Wales remains robust, seeing the largest monthly and yearly increase in average asking prices for property"". ""This is driven by many factors - including the rise in the number of city buyers inquiring for homes in villages or near the coast, compared to before the pandemic, in the search for sea and space."" Rightmove said in August that people were moving to Wales due to the attractive coastlines and seaside towns such as Tenby He added that Saundersfoot and Tenby in Pembrokeshire were among the most popular seaside locations. ""Wales is filled with beautiful and varied locations to live, and with working from home now a longer-term option for many, this has opened new doors for buyers,"" he said.

"Annie Farmer testified against Maxwell A woman who was groomed by Ghislaine Maxwell and gave key evidence at her sex-trafficking trial hopes the verdict will bring ""solace"" to other survivors. ""I am so relieved and grateful,"" said Annie Farmer, the only witness to use her real name during her testimony. ""I hope this verdict... demonstrates that no one is above the law."" Maxwell was found guilty of grooming underage girls to be abused by Jeffrey Epstein. Her lawyers say they will appeal against the verdict. 'No-one is above the law': Victims react to Maxwell verdict The 60-year-old was convicted on five of the six counts she faced, including the most serious charge - that of sex-trafficking a minor. Prosecutors made the case that Maxwell and Epstein were ""partners in crime"" The verdict, reached after five full days of deliberation by a 12-person jury in New York, means the British socialite could spend the rest of her life behind bars. Ms Farmer, now 42 and a psychologist, testified that she had been lured when she was 16 to a New Mexico ranch owned by Epstein, where Maxwell had given her a nude massage. ""I hope that this verdict brings solace to all who need it,"" she said. ""Even those with great power and privilege will be held accountable when they sexually abuse and exploit the young."" PROFILE:The story of Ghislaine Maxwell's downfall ANALYSIS:The damning testimony that brought Maxwell down SURVIVOR INTERVIEW:'I just can't explain to you the fear' A lawyer representing a victim who used the name Jane as a pseudonym to protect her identity thanked the jury for recognising Maxwell's ""critical role in helping"" Epstein, and praised the victims who had shared their experiences. ""The strong women survivors of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein's abuse can all sleep better tonight knowing that the justice system got it right,"" Robert Glassman said. Another lawyer who represents a number of Epstein accusers, Gloria Allred, told the BBC the outcome sent a ""message to other sex predators"" who took advantage of vulnerable young women. ""Charges may be filed against you, you may be prosecuted and you may end up getting sentenced to prison for the rest of your life,"" she said. Virginia Giuffre, who is one of Maxwell and Epstein's most prominent accusers, said she would ""remember this day always"". ""Having lived with the horrors of Maxwell's abuse, my heart goes out to the many other girls and young women who suffered at her hands and whose lives she destroyed,"" she said. Ms Giuffre has also previously alleged that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times. The Duke of York denies the allegations. Wednesday's verdict followed a month-long trial featuring testimony from four women who described being abused by Epstein between 1994 and 2004. Maxwell showed no visible sign of emotion as the verdict was read out on Wednesday, only pouring herself a glass of water which she sipped from twice. A date for her sentencing has not yet been set. Maxwell, a long-time associate of convicted child sex offender Epstein, has been in jail since July 2020 when she was charged with involvement in the financier's abuse of teenage girls. Some of the victims were as young as 14. Epstein killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. A well-connected socialite, Maxwell is the youngest daughter of the disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell who died in 1991. Soon after her father's death, Maxwell left the UK to settle in America where she worked in real estate and eventually met Epstein. The pair's romantic relationship reportedly lasted only a few years, but she continued to work with him long after and is said to have introduced Epstein to wealthy and powerful figures including Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. During the trial, Maxwell's lawyers repeatedly argued she was a scapegoat for Epstein's crimes. Prosecutors sought to portray the duo as ""partners in crime"" running a ""pyramid scheme of abuse"". Prosecutors cited bank records showing she had received $30m (Â£22m) from Epstein between 1999 and 2007 as evidence she had been motivated by money. All of the women who testified said they had been sexually abused by Epstein before they turned 18, and that Maxwell had urged, facilitated and even participated in the sexual encounters. This video can not be played Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyer said the guilty verdict would be appealed Another accuser, Liz Stein, who did not testify at Maxwell's trial, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One she had met Maxwell when she was 21 - and had been assaulted by her and Epstein the first day they met. In her first broadcast interview, she described how both Epstein and Maxwell ""made you feel like there was nobody else in the world, like you were the most important person in the universe"". Explaining why she had seen the pair repeatedly after being abused, Ms Stein said: ""I absolutely should've gone to the police. I didn't feel like I could. I just can't explain to you the fear and the emotional manipulation. In my mind these are my friends, those were people that said they cared about me."" Asked about the guilty verdict, she said: ""I think that is something that so many of us didn't think would ever happen. And especially for a woman to be charged with these things. I hope this really sets a precedent and it shows people that she was equally complicit in doing these things.""

"Sarah Ransome said the conviction was a ""major step forward in the fight for justice"" Former British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, 60, has been found guilty of recruiting and trafficking young girls to be sexually abused by the late American financier Jeffrey Epstein, her ex-boyfriend. A 12-person jury in New York found her guilty on five of the six counts she faced, including the most serious charge, that of trafficking a minor for sex. Survivors have celebrated the verdict, expressing ""relief"" and calling it a ""major step forward in the fight for justice"". One of the women who testified against Maxwell. She told the court she had a ""dark memory"" of abuse by Maxwell and Epstein. ""I am so relieved and grateful that the jury recognised the pattern of predatory behaviour that Maxwell engaged in for years and found her guilty of these crimes. ""I hope that this verdict brings solace to all who need it and demonstrates that no-one is above the law. Even those with great power and privilege will be held accountable when they sexually abuse and exploit the young."" She accused Maxwell of recruiting her as a masseuse to Epstein at the age of 15. She has also filed a civil case in New York saying she was sexually assaulted by the Duke of York, an accusation he has repeatedly denied. She says the alleged abuse happened at Maxwell's London home and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little St James in the US Virgin Islands. ""My soul yearned for justice for years and today the jury gave me just that. I will remember this day always. Having lived with the horrors of Maxwell's abuse, my heart goes out to the many other girls and young women who suffered at her hands and whose lives she destroyed. ""I hope that today is not the end but rather another step in justice being served. Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable. I have faith that they will be."" Accused Epstein of sexually assaulting her at the age of 22, and previously told the BBC Maxwell was a ""master manipulator"". ""Justice takes the lead today. I am consumed with gratitude for every brave, courageous and justice-driven person that has fought for this outcome. Ghislaine Maxwell will never again have the opportunity to take anything from anyone. She will reside on the other side of freedom. Us, survivors, we go free."" This video can not be played Epstein accuser: Ghislaine Maxwell is a 'master manipulator' One of Epstein and Maxwell's accusers, she had told the BBC's Panorama programme that Maxwell was ""the nuts and bolts of the sex trafficking operation"" and that they worked closely together. ""The jury's conviction... is a major step forward in the fight for justice. Finally, after decades in some cases, survivors of Maxwell's sex trafficking now know that the public heard their testimony, and their voices can no longer be ignored or they be shamed. I think this courage is contagious. ""As one of way too many survivors of the Epstein and Maxwell sex trafficking conspiracy, I feel vindication for myself and for all survivors. I am so proud of all the survivors who came forward, risking their lives and careers to speak truth to power, even when the powerful didn't want to hear it."" Says Maxwell introduced her to Epstein and that the two assaulted her when she was 21.In her first broadcast interview, she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that their relationship lasted for three years, and that she was assaulted multiple timesby both Epstein and Maxwell - with other people participating on some occasions. ""What happened to me that night with them [when she was assaulted for the first time] really shook me... I absolutely should've gone to the police. I didn't feel like I could. I just can't explain to you the fear and the emotional manipulation. In my mind these are my friends, those were people that said they cared about me. ""It was particularly difficult because I was made to feel like I was unsophisticated - because participating in sexual activities with multiple people was something that hadn't even crossed my mind at that age. So I had these friends who were powerful and magnetic and exciting pressuring meâ¦ Nobody asked if they could gang rape me. ""I think that [the verdict] is something that so many of us didn't think would ever happen. And especially for a woman to be charged with these things. I hope this really sets a precedent and it shows people that she was equally complicit in doing these things."" PROFILE:The story of Ghislaine Maxwell's downfall ANALYSIS:The damning testimony that brought Maxwell down CONTEXT:Key moments in the trial Represented a number of accusers ""Moved to tears. This day has finally come. Convicted sex trafficker Maxwell has finally been held to account for bringing girls to Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell got to walk free on this earth for 60 years. May she never walk free again. ""The lesson: you do not have to be perfect to stand up for justice. All four of Ghislaine's accusers endured tough cross examinations about drug use, sexual behaviours, inconsistent statements. The jury saw through it and delivered justice."" She also shared a message she had received from one of her clients, named only asKiki: ""No sentence or punishment will take away the trauma that we all had to endure at their hands, but now she will have to live with what she did, just the way the survivors have to live with it every day of our lives. ""What she and Jeffrey did for their own sadistic pleasures, sentenced all of their victims to their own metaphorical prisons. I fight every day to escape those four walls that entrapped me the day I was abused, and now she will know what that's like for all of the girls she damaged for life."" Represented Jane (a pseudonym to protect her identity), one of Maxwell's accusers who testified at the trial. ""The verdict screams loud and clear - if you make it easier for another to sexually abuse children, you, too, will be held accountable for your role in that abuse. The strong women survivors of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein's abuse can all sleep better tonight knowing that the justice system got it right.""

"The first time I saw Ghislaine Maxwell, I followed her from the door of her luxurious brownstone down the streets of Manhattan, asking her about the horrific allegations against her. Nearly a decade later, I saw her for the final time, in court and no longer able to run away from the truth about her life with Jeffrey Epstein. This is one of the most high-profile convictions of a woman for enabling a sex trafficking ring. And most importantly, it's a major victory for the more than 100 accusers who fought for more than a decade to have Epstein and his co-conspirators face criminal charges. The 60-year-old daughter of a British media tycoon has been found guilty of grooming and trafficking girls as young as 14 years old for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There were several powerful moments inside a packed courtroom in New York City, mainly from the prosecution which kept its case simple to avoid overwhelming the jury. Their aim was to show Maxwell was Epstein's partner in crime, a sexual predator whose modus operandi was clearly illustrated by four victims' experiences. Follow reaction to the verdict The prosecution's opening statement to the jury began with 11 words that sounded like the start of a children's book. ""I want to tell you about a young girl named Jane."" But for these women this was no fairytale. It was a nightmare and it was very real. How real became apparent the following day when Jane took the stand. She testified that Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein approached her when she was 14 years old at a summer arts camp in 1994. Over the next two years, she said she was abused about every other week with Maxwell sometimes taking part. This was one of her key exchanges with prosecutors: Q. What was Maxwell's demeanour like during these incidents? A. I would say that it seemed very casual, like it was - like it was very normal, like it was not a big deal. Q. And when she behaved like that, how did that make you feel? A. Well, it made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me; I'd never seen anything like this or felt any of this, and it was very embarrassing.  You know, it's all these mixed emotions.  When you're 14, you have no idea what's going on. The other accusers would later recount similar experiences. Maxwell argued she was unaware of Epstein's abuse One of the most heart wrenching testimonies came from Carolyn, who testified under her first name. The woman was visibly broken down by years of trauma and addiction to pain killers and cocaine. She had been raped by her grandfather at four years old, dropped out of school in the 7th grade, and was neglected by a mother who abused substances. Carolyn told the court it was one of Epstein's most outspoken accusers Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Giuffre, that first told her at 14 years old that she could make money by massaging a wealthy friend of hers. Carolyn met Ghislaine Maxwell when she showed up at Epstein's mansion in 2001. Maxwell, she said, told Virginia to take her upstairs to the massage room and ""show her what to do."" Prosecutors told jurors that by this time period, Maxwell had devised a pyramid scheme of abuse that no longer required her to personally find young girls for Epstein. Instead, they would reward vulnerable girls who brought someone new with extra cash. Carolyn was paid hundreds of dollars to ""massage"" Epstein on each of the over 100 encounters until she ""became too old."" She brought three other friends to Epstein. Carolyn said Maxwell once told her ""she had a great body for Epstein and his friends"" before touching her breasts. Maxwell was convicted on five counts: conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity conspiracy to commit sex trafficking sex trafficking of minors The teenage girls often came from troubled homes. Their families faced things like bankruptcy, substance abuse or previous sexual assault. And even when they didn't, Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein lured them in with friendship, gifts, and promises to help their careers or to pay for schooling. That ""grooming"" process, prosecutors said, was a key part of Maxwell's ""playbook."" She then used the ruse of massages as an excuse to get the girls to touch Epstein and to normalise sexual contact. Prosecutors said Maxwell would walk the girls into a room to be molested and abused, and sometimes was present ""to make it all feel normal and casual."" The two other accusers in the indictment were at or over the age of consent in the places the abuse took place, and therefore the judge ruled the sex acts weren't illegal. Still, Kate going by a pseudonym, and Annie Farmer who publicly identified herself, were equally compelling on the stand to prove Maxwell's grooming tactics. Key moments from trial Who is Ghislaine Maxwell? Ghislaine Maxwell's family had complained about her treatment in prison, saying it amounted to torture. Nevertheless, in court Maxwell was an extremely engaged and animated defendant. She carefully studied exhibits, looked witnesses in the eye, and often passed notes to her lawyers to convey her thoughts. She appeared to be in good spirits, hugging her defence team and blowing kisses and waving to her family in court. Her steely defiance was best captured when the judge Alison Nathan asked her if she would testify in her own defence. Instead of responding to the judge with a simple yes or no, she stood up and informed the court that there was ""no need"" for her to do so because the prosecution had not proven its case. Her defence case, in contrast, was less assured. Lawyers called on just nine witnesses over two days. Their strategy relied heavily on poking holes in the case brought by prosecutors, who bear the burden of proving the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt. This video can not be played Watch: The secret lives of Maxwell and Epstein The entire foundation of the prosecution's case rested on the four accusers' credibility. It is because their testimony was so convincing to jurors that Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted. Legal experts said attacking the women's memories and motives didn't help the defendant. ""Ghislaine Maxwell had the disadvantage of having to explain this parade of young girls who were coming in and out of the home daily underneath her supervision,"" says Mitchell Epner, a former prosecutor. ""She claimed she knew none of that. And when the jurors concluded that she was a liar, they concluded she was a predator."" Ghislaine Maxwell 'won't get fair trial' - brother One of the only pieces of physical evidence displayed in the courtroom was a green folding massage table taken from a police raid of Epstein's Palm Beach estate in 2005. It was an attempt from the prosecution to almost recreate the scene of the crimes right there in the middle of the courtroom. A retired police officer testified that they also recovered a box of sex toys. A hard drive recovered during a separate raid by the FBI of Epstein's Manhattan mansion contained emails sent by Ghislaine Maxwell to a staff member in which she complains that the house manager, Juan Alessi, did not tidy up Epstein's massage creams. That led the police to Mr Alessi, who provided some of the most damning and X-rated corroborating testimony in the whole trial.  Reporters covering the case had to hurriedly write notes to keep up with his startling revelations about the household. He told the court that Epstein would have three massages a day. When Mr Alessi would clean up after, he would put the sex toys back where they belonged, in a basket in Ghislaine Maxwell's closet, off the master bedroom she shared with Epstein. Mr Alessi said Epstein or Maxwell would sometimes direct him to contact and pick up young women for massages. He recalled seeing two underage girls that appeared to be 14 or 15 years old, Jane and Virginia Roberts. House rules, including in a 59-page manual, Mr Alessi said, told staff to be deaf, dumb and blind and forbade them from making eye contact with Epstein. ""There was a culture of silence. That was by design, the defendant's design, because behind closed doors, the defendant and Epstein were committing heinous crimes,"" Assistant US Attorney Lara Pomerantz said. This video can not be played Epstein accuser: Ghislaine Maxwell is a 'master manipulator' Police raids of Epstein's homes also produced intimate photos showing the duo's jet-setting, luxurious lifestyle and close connection. In one picture, the pair are seen relaxing at the Queen's Balmoral residence - when Prince Andrew reportedly invited the couple to the Scottish estate. In another, Ghislaine Maxwell is on a private plane with Epstein, massaging his foot and rubbing it against her cleavage. The staggering wealth on display from opulent properties in Palm Beach, New York and New Mexico only highlighted the vast power dynamics at play. The pair used wealth to lure and make young girls feel indebted to them. Several witnesses, including the four women, recalled how the duo would name drop their friends in high places, such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump or Prince Andrew, and display photos of them alongside the Pope John Paul II or Fidel Castro in their properties. None alleged any wrongdoing by Epstein and Maxwell's famous friends. These connections proved to be no insulation from justice and the conviction is a significant moment for people who are often found at the other end of the social ladder. ""This guilty verdict is immensely meaningful to sexual abuse victims everywhere,"" said Lisa Bloom, an attorney for eight of Epstein's victims. ""No matter who you are, no matter what kinds of circles you travel in, no matter how much money you have, no matter how many years have passed since the sexual abuse, justice is still possible.""

"Prices paid for home and motor insurance are changing due to new rules coming into effect on 1 January to protect loyal and vulnerable consumers. Anyone renewing their policy will pay no more than they would as a new customer, under regulations set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). That means prices for those who switch regularly will go up, while long-standing customers will pay less. The FCA said the move would save loyal customers Â£4.2bn over 10 years. Brian Brown, consumer finance expert at market analysts Defaqto, said there was no sign of insurers leaving the market as a result, meaning customers still had plenty of choice of products. The policy is designed to end cases of ""price walking"", which is when a customer is charged more year after year, by staying with the same insurance company - even though their risk is no greater. When announcing its plans, the FCA pointed to an example in which a new customer for home insurance typically paid Â£130 for a year's cover. But for the same policy, having stayed with the same insurer for five years, that annual premium rose to Â£238. For motor insurance, new customers paid Â£285 while people who have been with their provider for more than five years paid Â£370, according to the FCA's example. The new rules are being brought in by the FCA in the New Year following a super-complaint from Citizens Advice about the loyalty penalty. Those who switched have received the best deals as new customers. Those who stayed loyal were charged more. Around 10 million policies across home and motor insurance are held by people who have been with their provider for five years or more. Insurer 'made money from my loyalty' Banks told to stop short-changing loyal savers Insurers covering cost of therapy for lonely dogs Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: ""Rip-off renewal prices have seen consumers paying over the odds for far too long. No longer can you be exploited just for staying loyal."" He added that people tended to be at a disadvantage if they were older, on lower incomes, or unable to access the internet. ""We welcome the FCA's bold new rules on home and motor insurance. We now need to see urgent action to protect consumers in the other markets,"" he said. People can still shop around for the best deals, and will need to consider whether the policy matches their requirements. However, premiums charged to all renewing home and private motor insurance customers by their insurance provider cannot be greater than the price they would charge to an equivalent new customer for the equivalent policy. Individual premiums can still be set at different levels depending on factors such as a customer's age, type of vehicle, driving record and history of claims. James Dalton, from the Association of British Insurers, said: ""While the FCA recognises that these changes could lead to price rises for some who shop around regularly, all customers should get fairer outcomes in the UK's competitive home and motor insurance markets."" In October, the FCA introduced new rules requiring insurers to look more closely at how they offer fair value for consumers. It should also be made easier for consumers to cancel automatic policy renewals, and home and motor insurance firms must report more data to the regulator.

"Average house prices in the UK hit a record Â£254,822 in December, according to lender Nationwide. The typical house is now worth Â£23,902 more than it was in January, making it the strongest year for price rises since 2006. But Nationwide predicted the market would slow next year because the stamp duty holiday, which ended in September, saw buyers bring purchases forward. And it warned that slowdown could be made worse by the spread of Omicron. ""The Omicron variant could reinforce the slowdown if it leads to a weaker labour market,"" Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said. He said that even if the economy remains strong, higher interest rates were likely have a ""cooling influence"" on the housing market. It suggests the lender may be expecting further increases to interest rates in the new year. Earlier this month, theBank of England raised ratesto 0.25% from their historic lows of 0.1% in a bid to tackle rising inflation. Further increases in the cost of borrowing would mean fewer people are able to gain a foothold on the property ladder. ""House price growth has outpaced income growth by a significant margin over the past 18 months and, as a result, housing affordability is already less favourable than before the pandemic struck,"" Mr Gardner said. Wales saw the highest growth with prices increasing 15.8% compared to the same time last year. Meanwhile, price increases in London slowed compared to last year, climbing just 4.2%. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Andrew Harvey, a senior economist at Nationwide, said the pandemic had caused a change in the behaviour of buyers who had been looking to leave large cities in favour or suburban and rural areas. ""I think London probably has suffered as a result of that,"" he said. Wales: Up 15.8% to Â£196,759 Northern Ireland: Up 12.1% to Â£167,479 South West: Up 11.5% to Â£294,845 Outer South East: Up 11.3% to Â£329,869 North West: Up 11.2% to Â£196,806 Yorkshire and Humberside: Up 10.8% to Â£190,855 East Anglia: Up 10.4% to Â£268,146 East Midlands: Up 10.4% to Â£221,813 Scotland: Up 10.1% to Â£172,605 West Midlands: Up 9.4% to Â£227,031 Outer metropolitan area of London: Up 8.8% to Â£410,992 North: Up 7.7% to Â£148,105 London: Up 4.2% to Â£507,230 Mr Gardner said it was the first time since 1973, when Nationwide began publishing house price data, that the largest price rises had been seen in Wales. ""Price growth remained elevated in Northern Ireland at 12.1%, the strongest end to the year for the region since 2007,"" he said. ""Annual house price growth in Scotland was 10.1%, in line with the wider UK."" Cities start to attract property buyers again What is behind home price inflation?

"Elon Musk has rejected claims that his Starlink satellite internet project is taking up too much room in space. ""Tens of billions"" of satellites can be accommodated in orbits close to Earth, he told the Financial Times. His comments come after a claim by the head of the European Space Agency (ESA) that Mr Musk was ""making the rules"" for the emerging commercial space industry. This week, China complained that its space station was forced to avoid collisions with Starlink satellites. ""Space is just extremely enormous, and satellites are very tiny,"" Mr Musk said in the interview. Mr Musk pushed back at suggestions that his Starlink Internet Services project was effectively obstructing the entry of competitors to the satellite industry, saying that there is ample room in the Earth's orbit for satellites.

"Prices paid for home and motor insurance are changing due to new rules coming into effect on 1 January to protect loyal and vulnerable consumers. Anyone renewing their policy will pay no more than they would as a new customer, under regulations set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). That means prices for those who switch regularly will go up, while long-standing customers will pay less. The FCA said the move would save loyal customers Â£4.2bn over 10 years. Brian Brown, consumer finance expert at market analysts Defaqto, said there was no sign of insurers leaving the market as a result, meaning customers still had plenty of choice of products. The policy is designed to end cases of ""price walking"", which is when a customer is charged more year after year, by staying with the same insurance company - even though their risk is no greater. When announcing its plans, the FCA pointed to an example in which a new customer for home insurance typically paid Â£130 for a year's cover. But for the same policy, having stayed with the same insurer for five years, that annual premium rose to Â£238. For motor insurance, new customers paid Â£285 while people who have been with their provider for more than five years paid Â£370, according to the FCA's example. The new rules are being brought in by the FCA in the New Year following a super-complaint from Citizens Advice about the loyalty penalty. Those who switched have received the best deals as new customers. Those who stayed loyal were charged more. Around 10 million policies across home and motor insurance are held by people who have been with their provider for five years or more. Insurer 'made money from my loyalty' Banks told to stop short-changing loyal savers Insurers covering cost of therapy for lonely dogs Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: ""Rip-off renewal prices have seen consumers paying over the odds for far too long. No longer can you be exploited just for staying loyal."" He added that people tended to be at a disadvantage if they were older, on lower incomes, or unable to access the internet. ""We welcome the FCA's bold new rules on home and motor insurance. We now need to see urgent action to protect consumers in the other markets,"" he said. People can still shop around for the best deals, and will need to consider whether the policy matches their requirements. However, premiums charged to all renewing home and private motor insurance customers by their insurance provider cannot be greater than the price they would charge to an equivalent new customer for the equivalent policy. Individual premiums can still be set at different levels depending on factors such as a customer's age, type of vehicle, driving record and history of claims. James Dalton, from the Association of British Insurers, said: ""While the FCA recognises that these changes could lead to price rises for some who shop around regularly, all customers should get fairer outcomes in the UK's competitive home and motor insurance markets."" In October, the FCA introduced new rules requiring insurers to look more closely at how they offer fair value for consumers. It should also be made easier for consumers to cancel automatic policy renewals, and home and motor insurance firms must report more data to the regulator.

"She was the toast of high society in London and New York. Now Ghislaine Maxwell has been sentenced to 20 years in jail for grooming and trafficking underage girls. Ghislaine Maxwell was born on Christmas Day 1961. Three days later, a car carrying her 15-year-old brother Michael crashed into a lorry along a foggy Oxfordshire road. Michael Maxwell would spend the remaining seven years of his life in a coma. Although she had been born into material abundance - her father was the publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell - by every account, Ghislaine Maxwell's earliest years were disfigured by emotional neglect. Betty, her mother, later admitted in her memoir that after Michael's accident the baby ""was hardly given a glance"" by her devastated parents. One day in 1965, according to Betty, three-year-old Ghislaine Maxwell stood in front of her and declared: ""Mummy, I exist."" Betty also believed the toddler developed anorexia. To compensate, from this point both parents went to the opposite extreme and began lavishing affection on their youngest child. Robert Maxwell with seven of his nine children. Ghislaine Maxwell is pictured sitting on her mother's knee Though she was never spared the abuse and the rages her father would inflict on every one of his offspring, she would soon emerge as his favourite. And, Betty would later write in her 1994 memoir, that favourite daughter ""became spoiled, the only one of my children I can truly say that about"". The charges against Maxwell are so shocking - grooming and sex trafficking girls for abuse by the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein - it's tempting to look for an explanation in her dysfunctional childhood. But just as her crimes are impossible to excuse, Maxwell is a difficult woman to comprehend. For a life lived in public, the fine details of her biography have always been unusually elusive. Key moments in the sex trafficking trial How accusers' testimony brought Ghislaine Maxwell down What trial means for Prince Andrew Maxwell was raised in Headington Hill Hall, a vast Italianate mansion overlooking Oxford in the UK. Rather than buying it himself, her plutocrat father had somehow persuaded its owner, Oxford City Council, to rent it to him for a minimal sum in return for renovating the property. It was, he said, ""the best council house in the country"". Throughout Ghislaine Maxwell's childhood, lavish parties were thrown at Headington Hill Hall, with politicians, celebrities and media grandees in attendance. But after the VIPs had left the building it was a deeply emotionally austere place to grow up. Robert Maxwell had risen from extreme poverty in a Czechoslovak Jewish settlement - most of his family were murdered in the Holocaust - to become a British Army war hero, then an academic publishing magnate, a Labour MP and eventually owner of the Daily Mirror, one of the UK's biggest-selling newspapers. As a businessman, he was reviled as a bully. At home, meanwhile, he is depicted in Fall, John Preston's biography, as a ""draconian father"" who abused his children both physically and verbally. Robert Maxwell at a party on his yacht with daughter Ghislaine Maxwell and wife Betty, circa 1990 They would be interrogated at the dinner table about geopolitics or their plans for the future and reduced to tears if he considered their answers unsatisfactory. ""He would beat us with a belt - girls as well as boys,"" another of Robert's offspring, Ian, told Preston. Although his favourite, Ghislaine Maxwell wasn't immune from any of this. But while some of her siblings withdrew or rebelled, she was always anxious to please her father - she told Tatler in 2000 he was an ""inspiring"" parent - and dedicated herself to keeping him happy. It must have worked, after a fashion - Maxwell Snr later named his private yacht theLady Ghislaine, rather than after Betty or his three older daughters. And evidently, he had grand hopes for his youngest daughter - he apparently harboured ambitions of marrying her off to the late John F Kennedy Jnr. She was educated at Marlborough College and Oxford University, where she studied modern history and languages. ""It was very clear to me even as an undergraduate that she was interested in power and money,"" says the writer Anna Pasternak, who was a contemporary at Oxford and moved in the same social circles. ""She was one of those people at parties who always looked over your shoulder to see if there was somebody more powerful or more interesting while she was air-kissing you."" Rachel Johnson, the UK prime minister's sister and another Oxford contemporary, recently raised eyebrows when sherecalled,externalspotting Ghislaine Maxwell across the Balliol junior common room - ""a shiny glamazon with naughty eyes holding court astride a table, a high-heeled boot resting on my brother Boris's thigh."" After graduating, Maxwell's father appointed her as a director at Oxford United, the football club he owned and chaired, and also set her up with her own company supplying corporate gifts. But in the pages of Tatler or Nigel Dempster's Daily Mail gossip column, where she was now a regular fixture, she was usually described as a ""socialite"" rather than a businesswoman. She began dating Count Gianfranco Cicogna, an Italian aristocrat. She also founded a kind of private member's club exclusively for women. Pasternak attended on a few occasions and, while the idea seemed innovative at the time, she considered Maxwell an unlikely feminist champion. ""My recollection is that she was kind of breezily charming to other women, but I don't remember her being a very close friend of another woman,"" Pasternak says. ""I think that women weren't really important to her - only as a means to get to another powerful man."" In January 1991, after her father acquired the struggling New York Daily News, she was dispatched to its headquarters as his representative. It was her point of entry into the social scene of Manhattan. But in November that year, her world was upended. Her father vanished from the deck of theLady Ghislaineoff the Canary Islands and his body was later found floating in the sea. Ghislaine Maxwell flew straight to Las Palmas, where the yacht had been taken. By every account, she was inconsolable at the loss of her father. The day after his death, she was deputed to deliver an emotional speech to the world's press, who had gathered at the quayside. Ghislaine Maxwell, holding a framed photograph of her late father in Jerusalem, 1991 Soon enough it came out that Robert Maxwell had raided the Mirror Group's pension fund of Â£440m ($583m) as part of a scheme to artificially inflate the company's share price at the expense of 32,000 of his employees. Now the Maxwell family and the British government were left to pick up the pieces - the latter eventually paying Â£100m ($132m) towards a bailout of the fund. In June 1992, two of Robert's sons, Ian and Kevin, were arrested and charged with fraud. They were eventually acquitted in January 1996. While her father's guilt was obvious to most people, Ghislaine Maxwell continued to defend him. ""He wasn't a crook,""she told Vanity Fair's Edward Klein,externalin early 1992. ""A thief to me is somebody who steals money. Do I think that my father did that? No. I don't know what he did. Obviously, something happened. Did he put it in his own pocket? Did he run off with the money? No. And that's my definition of a crook."" While the rest of her siblings accepted Robert Maxwell's death was either an accident or suicide, his youngest daughter insisted he must have been murdered. Despite her protests, the fall-out from the Mirror pension scandal made the UK a less than welcoming place for her. In November 1992 it was reported that she had bought a $4,000 (Â£3,019) one-way Concorde ticket to New York. In 2005, Harry Mount was feeling lonely in Manhattan. Aged 33, he'd just been appointed as the Daily Telegraph's New York correspondent but, as yet, knew few people in the city. When a friend asked him if he wanted to tag along with him to a party at Ghislaine Maxwell's house, Mount jumped at the chance. She was, after all, well known as a prominent figure in Manhattan society who'd been photographed with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and even Pope John Paul II. Among the great and the good of US society, her cut-glass British accent and friendship with Prince Andrew marked her out as an exotic, alluring figure. When Mount arrived at her five-storey mansion on the Upper East Side, he was astonished when she bounded towards him and began bombarding him with questions. He recalls her listening intently to his replies as though he were the most fascinating person in the world. ""There was no reason why she should have been particularly friendly to me,"" says Mount, now editor of the Oldie magazine, where he haswritten about their encounter,external. ""She could well have frozen me out while being perfectly polite."" Mount assumed her effusiveness and charm were by-products of her troubled childhood. ""You end up with this mixture of great connections and confidence and you move among the great and the good - but fundamentally, you're not that sure of yourself,"" he says. ""And people who aren't sure of themselves are a bit nicer than those who often are."" It was only later that Mount realised there was something he had missed. Ghislaine Maxwell had reportedly been left with an Â£80,000 ($106,000)-a-year income from a trust fund. It should have occurred to him, he later reflected, that this amount wouldn't have been nearly enough to pay for her opulent house. Years later, prosecutors would suggest the property had been funded by Jeffrey Epstein. At that stage Mount didn't know about her connection to the well-known financier. But before long Epstein's relationship with Maxwell would be scrutinised by every journalist in the city. Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell In 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police Epstein had molested their daughter, and three years later he received an 18-month prison sentence. After his release, the allegations against him began to snowball. He was accused of running a ""vast network"" of girls for sex. He was arrested again in 2019 on charges of sex trafficking and died in his prison cell just over a month later. Inevitably the authorities' focus turned to Maxwell. Like her father, Epstein was an enormously wealthy man from humble origins - in his case, a working-class neighbourhood in Brooklyn. Also like Robert Maxwell, he would eventually be disgraced and die of an apparent suicide in disputed circumstances. Ghislaine Maxwell's relationship with Epstein was no doubt mutually beneficial. She could introduce him to her wealthy and powerful friends; he in turn had the capital to fund the kind of lifestyle she had grown up to expect. During the trial, as well as emphasising the pair's closeness, prosecutors noted that Maxwell ""was not a particularly wealthy person when she met Epstein"". Certainly, after she returned to New York in the wake her father's death, it was reported that she was working in real estate and living in a $2,000 (Â£1,500)-a-month apartment - a decent standard of living by any means, not least when the trust fund was taken into account, but nonetheless somewhat less than she might have been accustomed to. But the fine details of the relationship are not easy to pin down. When it began, how long it lasted and how exactly it should be characterised were all issues of contention at the trial, which has just concluded. Four charges in Maxwell's trial related to the period 1994-97, when the indictment stated that she was among Epstein's closest associates and also in an ""intimate relationship"" with him. By the 2000s, she was linked with another businessman, Ted Waitt. But it appeared that she carried on working for Epstein. By the time of a2003 profile,external, Epstein described Maxwell as his ""best friend"" and journalist Vicky Ward noted that much of his life appeared to be organised by her.Intimate photosof Maxwell and Epstein together released by prosecutors suggested they had remained close. In court documents, former employees at the Epstein mansion in Palm Beach described her as the house manager who supervised staff, looked after finances and acted as a social co-ordinator. A housekeeper testified that Maxwell gave staff a 58-page instruction manual and ordered them to speak only when spoken to, avoiding eye contact with Epstein. It's tempting to conclude that just as Maxwell learned to appease the whims of her capricious, bullying father, she applied those same skills on Epstein. Whatever the exact nature of their relationship, the prosecution portrayed their closeness as a crucial factor in their pattern of abuse - with Ghislaine Maxwell seeking out and grooming victims for Epstein. In December 2021, a jury found her guilty of five of six counts - including the most serious charge, that of sex trafficking of a minor. ""Ghislaine controlled the girls,"" Sarah Ransome, who says she was abused by Epstein, told the BBC's Panorama programme. ""She would be the one getting all the girls in check. She knew what Jeffrey likedâ¦ this was very much a joint effort."" In the months following Epstein's death, Maxwell went to ground. Newspapersspeculated as to her whereabouts,external. A photograph of her outside a Los Angeles branch of In-N-Out Burger appeared on front pages around the world. Then, in July 2020, she was arrested at her secluded mansion in the US state of New Hampshire. A few months later, it emerged to general surprise that she had married a tech CEO named Scott Borgerson. Maxwell was held at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn. While she waited for her trial to begin, her brother Ian told the BBC's Today programme that she was being held in a 6ft by 9ft (1.8m by 2.7m) cell with a concrete bed. ""She is under 24-hour, around-the-clock surveillance, with 10 cameras, including one that moves and tracks her movement,"" he said. ""She's not allowed to move into the corners of her cell and she's not allowed to be within two and a half feet of the cell door. That is her existence."" It was an ignominious fate for a woman who had spent most of her life surrounded by material riches. It was left to the prosecution to explain why on earth she would commit the crimes that had put her there. Prosecutors suggested money was an incentive. The journalist John Sweeney, who explored the case in his podcast Hunting Ghislaine and is writing a book about it, suggests a deeper psychological motive was at play. ""You can't understand what happened with Jeffrey Epstein without understanding her relationship with her father,"" he says. ""The truth is that Ghislaine learned to service her father and then had to service a second monster - that's what she's done her entire life."" Another similarity between Robert Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein is that both escaped a full reckoning for their crimes. And defence lawyers argued Ghislaine Maxwell was a scapegoat for Epstein - the age-old story of a woman taking the blame for the misdeeds of her partner. But Pasternak dismisses the idea that Maxwell is in any way less culpable than Epstein. ""There is absolutely no way that he could have had access to that many young girls, whose lives they've obliterated, without Ghislaine,"" says the author. While the trial was under way, Ian Maxwell wrote anarticle for The Spectator,externalputting across his sister's defence. It began with a reprimand to the media corps. They'd been pronouncing her name inaccurately, he said. It wasn't ""Jizlaine"". Instead, he insisted, it was ""Giilen"". For anyone following the case, it seemed remarkable that such a basic detail had been so consistently wrong. This was a woman, after all, who had lived her entire life in the news pages and gossip columns. But as the trial progressed it became apparent that so much that had been assumed about her - her relationship status at any one time, the source of her income, and, quite often, her whereabouts - were likely not as they seemed. Her crimes surely defy explanation, too. And for all that her rise and fall were conducted in public, Ghislaine Maxwell remains unknowable.

Join us again tomorrow and in the meantime you can keep up with the latest updateson the front page of the website. Jim ReedHealth reporter, BBC News A delay to death statistics in England means the
governmentâs coronavirus dashboard is unlikely to be updated before 19:30 this
evening. But NHS England has separately published its latest daily hospital
data. It shows there were 2,082 Covid admissions on 28 December in
England, up 90% in a week and the highest single day figure since February. In
London, still seen as the centre of the Omicron wave, there were another 456
people admitted to hospital. The NHS does not break down that data into those who have
been admitted because of symptoms directly linked to the virus and those
admitted for other conditions who tested positive on arrival. In total there are now 11,452 Covid patients being treated
in English hospitals, up from 7,114 a week earlier but still well below the
peak of about 34,000 last January. The number of the most seriously ill being treated on a
ventilator has risen slightly to 782 patients but is still below the level seen
a fortnight ago. We've got a few charts that illustrate some of the coronavirus trends around the world. Since the start of the pandemic there have now been more than 280 million cases confirmed. Asia and Europe have generally been the two continents where confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been most prevalent - and at the moment Europe is by some distance the region with most cases, as this chart shows. And in Europe case rates are varying. In some countries this could be because of delays in reporting figures over Christmas but the chart does suggest the UK and France have the highest case numbers at the moment. A memorial to the NHS fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore was installed at a Derbyshire nature reserve two days after he died aged 100 in February. Now it's been vandalised. A man said he was left feeling physically sick after it wasdaubed with white paint saying ""IRA"". Anthony Ball - who spotted it while walking at Thistley Place Meadow in Hatton on Wednesday - covered it up within hours. ""I was on a walk around the meadow when I saw it... I had to go back home and fetch a bin bag to put on him. ""I couldn't let people see him with that graffiti on, it's not nice."" Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, has told the BBC new Covid surge hubs could help if there is a wave of Omicron admissions. He says lessons have been learned from the original Nightingale hospital set-ups and these hubs will be located at existing medical centres rather than conference centres. This video can not be played The rules about testing after exposure to a positive Covid case vary depending on where you live in the UK: If you have Covid symptoms or a positive lateral flow result you should book a PCR test - regardless of where you are in the UK. People are also being advised to take a lateral flow test before visiting vulnerable people or high-risk places. You can read more about when you should take a test here. The Welsh government is loaning four million lateral flow tests to England amid a shortage of supplies. First Minister Mark Drakeford says: ""Wales has a significant stock of lateral flow tests, sufficient to meet our needs over the weeks ahead."" Rapid tests have been intermittently unavailable to order online from the government website, while pharmacies have also reported patchy supplies. There has been a surge in demand after the public were urged to take a rapid test before socialising and to enable them to leave isolation after seven days. The coronavirus pandemic has been slowed in developed countries thanks to massive vaccination drives. Countries have bought stocks to cover their populations, and in many cases have far more than they need. However, poorer countries generally haven't been able to reserve and buy the vaccine stock they need. In the video below, three experts explain how we arrived at this point and the challenges now facing everyone involved in the fight against Covid-19. This video can not be played With New Year's Eve now just a day away let us refresh your memoryabout the rules on gatherings. InEnglandthere are no limits affecting the number of people who can spend time with each other but ministers have urged people to be cautious and test before going out. People need to showtheir Covid statusto gain entry to nightclubs and many other venues, while face coverings are compulsory in most indoor public venues, but are not needed in pubs or restaurants. InScotlandnightclubs must close and pubs and other hospitality venues selling alcohol must reintroduce table service. The government is advising people to limit social mixing but if they do they are advised to meet just two other households - and to use lateral flow tests before gathering. All outdoor events are limited to just 500 people for three weeks, while indoor events are limited to 200 seated people, or 100 standing. InWalessocial distancing of 2m (6ft) is required in all premises open to the public and the rule of six applies in premises such as hospitality venues. Licensed premises must take additional measures to protect customers and staff, including table service and collecting contact details, and face coverings are required in hospitality settings, apart from when seated. Large events are not allowed: a maximum of 30 people are allowed at indoor events and 50 at outdoors. InNorthern Irelandnightclubs have closed and dancing is banned in all hospitality venues. All indoor standing events are not allowed while in hospitality venues a maximum of six people, or 10 people from a single household, are allowed at a table (excluding aged 12 and under). Hospitality venues including pubs, cafes and restaurants can provide table service only. A maximum of 30 people from an unlimited number of households can meet indoors in domestic settings. We normally get the latest UK Covid data at 16:00, giving updates on cases, deaths within 28 days of a test, and other stats. The figures have been later over the festive period - and today they are not expected until an estimated 19:30 GMT. The mainUK Covid dashboard,externalsays it's because of delays in receiving deaths data for England. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News As cases of Omicron rise steeply across the UK, all eyes
are on the impact on hospitals. NHS data for England shows thereâs been a sharp increase in
the rate at which older age groups are ending up in hospital with Covid. Infections look like they are now seeping into the over-85s
as well as people in their 60s and 70s. There are signs of a slight uptick in children too,
particularly the under-fives, but at a much lower level. However, itâs difficult to know how many were admitted
because of Covid and how many were admitted for another reason and then tested
positive for coronavirus. This data doesnât differentiate between the two. The vaccines are undoubtedly making a difference â and for
most of those infected, the illness is mild. Yet there is still concern over the impact on hospitals even
if a small proportion of cases become seriously ill. More data is expected later today. A further 19,544 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant have been reported across the UK, the UK Health Security Agency says - taking the total to 229,666. The UKHSA says the daily Omicron variant overview will be reported for the final time tomorrow as data shows that Omicron cases now constitute more than 90% of all community Covid-19 cases in England - meaning the actual number of Omicron cases could be much higher.

Two cross-channel operators say French Covid rules have been tightenedmeaning British people can no longer travel through France by roadto reach their homes within the EU. P&O Ferries and Eurotunnel say changes were made by the French on Tuesday. But the French Interior Minister told news agency AFP there were no new rules and it was only applying restrictions introduced before Christmas. The BBC has been told the UK government is urgently seeking clarification. The UK Foreign Officehas updated its travel advice,externalfor France to state: ""The French government have indicated that UK nationals travelling from the UK who are not resident in France will not be permitted to transit France to return to their country of residence unless they are travelling by air."" Since 18 December, British citizens haveneeded an essential reason to travelto France, with some exemptions in place. The isolation period for people in Wales who test positive for Covidis being cut from 10 days to seven- if people get negative lateral flow results on days six and seven. The change, which will come into force from 31 December, is being made because the ""balance of harms have changed"", Health Minister Eluned Morgan says. From tomorrow, Scotland will be the only part of the UK where people who test positive must definitely continue to isolate for 10 days. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says that, with another record tally of 16,857 Covid cases reported in the country today, the ""likelihood of getting it just now if you mix with others is high"". She says hospital occupancy figures are just as notable as the cases, with ""the largest single day increase in a while"". This is a reminder that even if Omicron causes a lower percentage of people to be hospitalised ""sheer volume will still put acute pressure on NHS - and result in serious illness for many"". She says, as concerning as the numbers are, they would be worse if people were not following the public health guidance and urges people to continue to do so as we approach new year. A total of 435,293 Covid booster vaccines and third doses were reported in the UK on Wednesday, according to the latest figures. This is the highest daily figure since 23 December. More than 33.5 million booster and third doses have now been administered in the UK, with 1.8 million in the past seven days. Around 63% of all adults in the UK have now received a booster or third dose. The home secretary has strongly criticised a group of protesterswho disrupted a testing centre in Milton Keynes yesterday. ""It is completely unacceptable that conspiracy theorists are intimidating and harassing those administering tests or delivering the life-saving vaccine programme,""Priti Patel writes on Twitter,external. Dozens entered the site, with some shouting abuse at staff and appearing to damage equipment. Patel says she is being kept updated on the police investigation. ""The police have my full support to take swift action where necessary,"" she adds. NHS workers must be given priority for accessing lateral flow tests, professional health bodies have said. The British Medical Association and Royal College of Nursing said health workers must come first for rapid tests to ease staffing issues. One cancer care worker from London said she missed several days of work after being unable to get rapid tests by online ordering or collecting from a pharmacy - even after identifying as a key worker. There has been intermittent availability of lateral flow and PCR tests online, while pharmacies have also reported a lack of supplies. The UK Health Security Agency has said availability is refreshed throughout the day so people should keep checking back online. Read more. The UK is still seeing very high Covid hospital admissions, despite early evidence suggesting Omicron may be milder than previous variants, the government's former chief scientific adviser says. Prof Mark Walport tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that it is not yet clear whether the wave will break through to older people in the UK. And with around five million adults in the UK still completely unvaccinated, he says the risk of being admitted to hospital remains for those individuals. He adds that the ""astronomical number of infections"" in the UK also poses ""terrific challenges"" for the workforce, with large numbers isolating. The self-isolation period for people in Northern Ireland who have tested positive for coronavirus will be reduced from 10 days to seven - provided they get negative lateral flow results on day six and seven. The change will come into effect tomorrow. It brings Northern Ireland into line with England but the self-isolation requirement remains 10 days in Scotland and Wales. No further restrictions will be introduced in Northern Ireland, the country's first minister confirmed. Paul Givan said the Northern Ireland Executive would continue to assess the data and meet again on 6 January. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted of grooming and trafficking underage girls for financier Jeffrey Epstein The British socialite showed no emotion, sipping from a glass of water as she learned her fate Four women testified at Maxwell's trial in New York City about the abuse they suffered The 60-year-old had pleaded not guilty to all six charges, arguing she was a scapegoat for Epstein Epstein, a convicted sex offender, was found dead in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial Prosecutors said the former lovers were ""partners in crime"" running a ""pyramid scheme of abuse"" Maxwell is the daughter of disgraced late British media mogul Robert Maxwell She has been in a New York jail since her arrest in July last year Edited by Ritu Prasad Thank you for joining our live coverage of the Ghislaine Maxwell trial verdict in New York City. You can follow further updates to this story here. Today's coverage was provided by Bernd Debusmann, Max Matza, George Wright, Patrick Jackson, Jude Sheerin and Ritu Prasad. While Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted of five of
the six charges she faced, she is far from done with the legal process. She now faces up to 65 years behind bars. Judge Alison
Nathan, however, has yet to set a sentencing date. Her final sentence will be
up to the judge, who will also decide whether her sentences for each count are to be served
consecutively or concurrently. Maxwellâs defence team has said they will appeal the verdict. A successful appeal would require that they show that the
judge violated federal rules that somehow impacted the jurors as they came to a
verdict. While she waits for her sentencing date, Maxwell will remain
incarcerated in the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in the borough of
Brooklyn, where Maxwell has previously complained about conditions. Sarah Krissoff, a former prosecutor with the Southern District of New York, tells the BBC she expects ""a very significant prison sentence"" for Maxwell. ""Given the involvement of minors, the judge has really great discretion to impose a significant sentence, and based on the evidence that was presented at trial, frankly, I expect the judge to impose a very severe sentence upon her."" Nada TawfikBBC News, New York City A court sketch of Ghislaine Maxwell during her trial. This is one of the most high-profile convictions of a woman for enabling a sex trafficking ring. And most importantly, it's a major victory for the more than 100 accusers who fought for over a decade to have Epstein and his co-conspirators face criminal charges. Maxwell, the 60-year-old daughter of a British media tycoon, has been found guilty of grooming and trafficking girls as young as 14 years old for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There were several powerful moments inside a packed courtroom in New York City, mainly from the prosecution which kept its case simple to avoid overwhelming the jury. The entire foundation of the case rested on the four accusers' credibility. It is because their testimony was so convincing that Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted. Read Nada's full analysishere. Carolyn said she had been to Epstein's home hundreds of times Four women took the stand at Maxwellâs trial, testifying that they had been sexually abused by Epstein before they turned 18 and that Maxwell had urged, facilitated and participated in the abuse. Annie Farmerwas the only one who used her real name in her testimony. In court, she pointed at the defendant and accused her of groping her in a topless massage at age 16. Farmer also said Maxwell had neither said nor done anything as Epstein had groped her at a cinema. Janewas the first accuser to take the stand. She said she had been molested by Epstein from the age of 14, and that Maxwell had âinstructedâ her on how to massage Epstein, being ""casual"" about the abuse. Katewas another accuser - a British woman who said Maxwell had asked her if she knew any other ""cute, young pretty girls"" who could ""have sex with Epstein"". Kate alleged that the socialite had often called her a âgood girlâ and had even laid out a schoolgirl dress for her to wear for Epstein. Carolynsaid she had been to Epsteinâs Florida home âhundreds of timesâ between the ages of 14 to 18, with Maxwell calling to set up the massage appointments and then paying her afterwards. An ex-boyfriend of Carolyn corroborated the testimony, saying he had driven her to and from the home, and had seen the money. Ghislaine
Maxwell was one considered the toast of high society in London and New York. Born into a
life of opulence and privilege to publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell in 1961, Ghislaine
became anxious to please her overbearing father even as her siblings rebelled or withdrew
from family life. She later
defended him even after news that he had raided the Mirror Groupâs pension fund
of Â£440m ($583m) as part of a scheme to artificially inflate the company's
share price at the expense of 32,000 of his employees. âHe wasnât a crook,â she
told Vanity Fair in 1992. After learning
to appease her fatherâs whims, she did the same for Jeffrey Epstein. Read morehere. Ghislaine Maxwell sitting on her mother's lap in a family photo. Ghislaine Maxwell, holding a framed photograph of her late father, Jerusalem, Israel, 1991 Maxwell's lawyer, Bobbi Sternheim, has just emerged from court and delivered this brief statement. ""We firmly believe in Ghislaine's innocence. Obviously we are very disappointed with the verdict. ""We have already started working on the appeal and we are confident she will be vindicated."" Ghislaine
Maxwellâs legal troubles are not over. She still faces perjury charges for
allegedly lying under oath about her role in Jeffrey Epsteinâs abuses. The perjury
charges stem from accusations that she lied during a 2016 deposition for a
lawsuit filed against Epstein by one of the accusers, Virginia Giuffre. During the
deposition, Maxwell repeatedly said she was largely unaware of Epsteinâs abuses.
Federal prosecutors accused her of making âfalse declarationsâ. While the charges
were originally included in an indictment against Maxwell released after she
was arrested in July 2020, in April Judge Alison Nathan granted a request from Maxwellâs
attorneys to separate the charges from the rest of the counts. The perjury charges
each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Giuffreâs 2015
lawsuit against Maxwell alleged that Maxwell recruited her when she was still a
teenager and of trafficking her for sexual abuse between 1999 and 2002. Tara Palmeri, a journalist who spoke to witnesses and accusers in this trial, tells the BBC she thinks this conviction could be the ""tip of the iceberg"". Palmeri says Jeffrey Epstein used vulnerable women to recruit other victims, who may not have realised they were being manipulated. Watch the interview in full below. This video can not be played Maxwell case could be the 'tip of the iceberg' If you're just joining us, here's what you need to know: A large crowd of journalists is waiting outside the court from any further comment from the lawyers in the trial. Earlier, the federal prosecutors who tried the case were seen leaving the court. They gave no comment to reporters and showed no outward display of emotion. There has been some suggestion that one of Maxwell's lawyers may address the journalists on this chilly New York City evening. Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as family members, have repeatedly complained about her conditions in jail and her legal team has made several applications for bail, which so far have all been denied. Her siblings even filed a legal complaint to the United Nations calling her detention âarbitraryâ and her jail conditions âinhumaneâ. Earlier this year her brother Ian told the BBC the way she was being treated in jail was  ""degrading"" and ""amounts to torture"". He said she was being held under constant surveillance in a 6x9ft (1.8x2.7m) cell with no natural light, and the food was ""basically inedible"". Following her conviction, Maxwell faces the possibility of spending the rest of her life behind bars. This video can not be played Ghislaine Maxwell 'is losing her hair' in prison, says her brother One of Jeffrey
Epsteinâs accusers has said that the jury in the Maxwell trial has finally
given her justice after years of waiting. Virginia Giuffre,
38, claims that she was brought to the UK at the age of 17 to have sex with Prince
Andrew and has filed a civil case against him in New York claiming he abused her
â including once at Maxwellâs London home. He has denied
the charges. In a statement
following the news of the verdict against Maxwell, Giuffre said that her âsoul
yearned for justice for years and today the jury gave me just thatâ. âI will remember
this day always. Having lived with the horrors of Maxwellâs abuse, my heart
goes out to the many girls and young women who suffered at her hands and whose
lives she destroyed,â she said. Giuffre added
that she hopes the verdict is ânot the end but rather another step in justice
being servedâ. âMaxwell did
not act alone. Others must be held accountable,â she said. âI have faith that
they will be.â Ghislaine Maxwellâs relationship to Jeffrey Epstein - the disgraced US financier who took his own life in 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial  - came into the spotlight after his death. A well-connected socialite, she is said to have introduced Epstein to wealthy and powerful figures, including Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. According to reports, Maxwell and Epstein's romantic relationship lasted only a few years, but she continued to work with him long afterwards. ""She had an upbringing and taste,externaland knew how to run a house and a boat and how to entertain,"" an acquaintance was quoted by the UK's Daily Telegraph as saying. ""You can't buy that. You can't buy access, either."" In a Vanity Fair profile published in 2003,Epstein said Ms Maxwell was not a paid employee, but rather his ""best friend"",external. She is accused of having assisted Epstein's abuse of minors by helping to recruit and groom victims known to be underage. Ms Maxwell denies any wrongdoing and has previously denied any involvement in or knowledge of Epstein's abuse. Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein in a photograph released by the US Attorney's Office Ghislaine Maxwellâs father, Robert Maxwell, was a controversial and ruthless newspaper baron, football club owner and onetime Labour MP. He became an outsized figure in British life but rose from very different circumstances. Born in a humble village in what was then Czechoslovakia,  he escaped poverty and Nazi persecution in Eastern Europe, fought alongside the British Army across Europe and eventually became one of the most powerful men in British publishing. In 1991, at age 68,  his body was found in the sea off the Canary Islands near his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine - named after his daughter. Although a verdict of accidental drowning was recorded, the mystery surrounding the circumstances of his death was never cleared up. He had succeeded in building a global publishing empire, but after his death, it emerged that he had taken money from the pension funds of his Mirror Group Newspapers. Of Ghislaineâs siblings, her brother Ian has been one of her more vocal defenders, recently telling the BBC he doubted his sister would get a fair hearing.

The prosecutionâs evidence against Ghislaine Maxwell was âoverwhelmingâ,
says Mark Richards, the trial attorney who successfully defended US teenager
Kyle Rittenhouse, who fatally shot two people during unrest in Wisconsin in 2020. âThey had Epsteinâs history. Most of the people in the US
know about some part of the history, so the defence had to overcome that, along
with I think a lot of evidence,â Richards told the BBC. âTheyâre salacious
charges.â Richards said that while the incidents detailed in court by
Maxwellâs accusers took place at various times and locations, there was âa certain
consistencyâ to them. âIf itâs one accuser, a jury is going to say she could be mistaken or could be lying,â he said. âBut when you start having four accusers with
corroborating evidence such as the pilots, some of the household staff, it
becomes overwhelming.â The duty of the defence team, Richards added, would have been to âcome
up with a narrative that at least equals the governmentâs.â âI donât think in this case they were able to put together a
narrative that runs counter sufficiently enough to cast reasonable doubt,â he
said. This video can not be played Ghislaine Maxwell: Attorney who represented Espstein victims analyses Maxwell trial US lawyer Lisa Bloom, who has represented eight accusers of Jeffrey Epstein, has called the women who testified against Ghislaine Maxwell ""tremendously inspiring"". ""Nobody wants to go to court and testify in a sexual assault trial. Most people won't even call an attorneyâ¦ it takes extraordinary courage,"" she told the BBC. ""They did it because they wanted to get justice against Ghislaine Maxwell - convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, I can now say,"" she added. ""Itâs tremendously inspiring and it lifts up all survivors of sexual abuse."" She said survivors have reached out to her. ""Some of them have already reached out to me and said: 'Maybe I can really win in my case because now I see this is what has happened in Ghislaine Maxwell's case."" The Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in New York City During the monthlong trial, Maxwell's lawyers argued she was a scapegoat for Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, while prosecutors sought to link the duo as ""partners in crime"" running a ""pyramid scheme of abuse"". As more reaction pours in post-verdict, here's a look back at the key moments from this high-profile court case: You can read the full story here.  Teresa Helm, one of Jeffrey Epsteinâs accusers has just sent us this statement, praising the women that testified during the trial. ""Justice takes the lead today,"" she says. ""I am consumed with gratitude for every brave, courageous and justice driven person that has fought for this outcome. ""Ghislaine Maxwell will never again have the opportunity to take anything from anyone. She will reside on the other side of freedom. ""Us survivors, we go free."" The BBC spoke to Helm, who accused Epstein of sexually assaulting her at the age of 22, and described Maxwell as a ""master manipulator"", earlier in the trial. Watch the interview here:  This video can not be played Epstein accuser: Ghislaine Maxwell is a 'master manipulator' Alan Dershowitz, a lawyer who made his name defending high-profile celebrity clients like OJ Simpson, says the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell has weakened the case against Prince Andrew. One of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre, says she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York on three occasions. He has denied the accusations. Dershowitz himself was accused by Giuffre of participating in Epstein's sex ring. He has denied the allegations. The government ""didn't use as a witness the woman who accused Prince Andrew, accused me, accused many others, because the government didn't believe she was telling the truth"", Dershowitz told BBC News, in reference to Giuffre. ""This case does nothing at all to strengthen in any way the case against Prince Andrew. Indeed it weakens the case against Prince Andrew considerably."" Â© 2025 BBC.
