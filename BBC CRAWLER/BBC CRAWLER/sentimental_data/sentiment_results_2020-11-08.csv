"The world according to President Trump has been one of ""America First"" nationalism, ditching international agreements that he believed gave the US a raw deal. It was transactional, disruptive and unilateralist. It was also personal and erratic, shaped by his gut feelings and relationships with leaders, and driven by his Twitter feed. The world according to Joe Biden is a much more traditional take on America's role and interests, grounded in international institutions established after World War Two, and based on shared western democratic values. It is one of global alliances in which America leads free nations in combating transnational threats. How Trump can still win the election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? What could change under Biden? A few things stand out - the approach to allies, to climate change, and to the Middle East. DEALING WITH ALLIES President Trump has praised autocrats and insulted allies. At the top of Joe Biden's to-do list is repairing strained relationships, especially in Nato, and rejoining global alliances. A Biden administration would also return to the World Health Organization and seek to lead an international coronavirus response. Democratic challenger Joe Biden is expected to reach out to global institutions Mr Biden's campaign framed this as a major reset to rescue America's damaged image and to rally democracies against what it sees as a rising tide of authoritarianism. Why US election matters so much to Germans But it might be more style than substance, counters Danielle Pletka of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. She argues that the Trump administration has achieved a lot on the global stage, just with sharp elbows. ""Have we lost friends to go to parties with? You bet,"" she says. ""Nobody wants to go to parties with Donald Trump. Have we lost power and influence on the metrics that actually have mattered for the last 70 years? No."" CLIMATE CHANGE Speaking of substance, Joe Biden says he will make fighting climate change a priority and rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, which is one of the international accords that Donald Trump dumped. President Donald Trump has used ""sharp elbows"" on the global stage On this issue the two men are polar opposites. Mr Trump sees tackling global warming as a threat to the economy. He has promoted fossil fuels and rolled back scores of environmental protections and climate regulations. Five things Trump has said about the environment What does Trump actually believe on climate change? Mr Biden is promoting an ambitious $2 trillion dollar plan to achieve goals for cutting emissions. He says he would do this by building a clean energy economy, creating millions of jobs in the process. IRAN Joe Biden says he's prepared to rejoin another international accord abandoned by President Trump - the deal that gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for scaling down its nuclear programme. The Trump administration withdrew in 2018, saying the arms control agreement was too narrow to cope with the threats posed by Iran, and too weak in its limits on nuclear activity, which expire over time. It re-imposed sanctions and continues to pile on economic pressure, recently blacklisting almost all of Iran's financial sector. In response Iran has stopped observing some of the restrictions on its nuclear activity. Iran nuclear deal: Dead or just dying? Mr Biden says this ""maximum pressure"" policy has failed, emphasising that it led to a significant escalation in tensions, that allies have rejected it, and that Iran is now closer to a nuclear weapon than it was when Trump came to office. He says he will rejoin the nuclear accord if Iran returns to strict compliance - but he wouldn't lift sanctions until then. Mr Biden would then negotiate to address concerns he shares with the president. YEMEN Mr Biden would also end US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The high civilian death toll has built strong opposition to US involvement from the left wing of the party and a growing number of lawmakers in Congress. Saudi Arabia is a close US ally Saudi Arabia is President Trump's closest Arab ally, a cornerstone of the anti-Iran alliance. Analysts see Mr Biden stepping back from Mr Trump's largely uncritical embrace of the Gulf monarchy. Yemen crisis: Why is there a war? ""I do think that on the Middle East, there will be a sea change,"" says Ms Pletka, ""a more pro-Iran policy and a less pro-Saudi policy, for sure."" ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT Joe Biden welcomed President Trump's agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Like the Democratic old guard, Mr Biden is a staunch supporter and long-time defender of Israel - the word occupation is not included in the party's foreign policy platform. But he is unlikely to adopt the Trump administration's policies towards the occupied West Bank. These include a declaration that Israeli settlements do not violate international law, and tolerance of - if not enthusiasm for - Israeli plans to unilaterally annex parts of the territory. Israel's borders explained in maps The Democratic Party's left wing, which has a much more developed and assertive foreign policy coalition than in previous years, is pushing for greater action on Palestinian rights. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is a defender of Israel, but his policy on the West Bank is likely to differ from the current one ""I think we've had much stronger engagement from Palestinian rights advocates, Palestinian Americans, Arab Americans,"" says Matt Duss, a foreign policy adviser to Mr Biden's one-time rival, Bernie Sanders, ""but also a number of Jewish American groups who understand that ending the occupation is a key issue for United States foreign policy."" So that's something to watch. A simple guide to the US election Who will be the next US president? You decide Why we might not get a result on election night Has Trump delivered on his promises? Full coverage of the US election Like President Trump, Mr Biden wants to end the forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, although he would keep a small troop presence in both to help battle terrorism. Nor would he slash the Pentagon budget or suspend drone strikes, despite pressure from the left. And when it comes to geopolitical adversaries, there may be less of a difference than you'd expect. RUSSIA The relationship at the top would certainly change. President Trump often seemed ready to personally forgive Vladimir Putin for behaviour that violated international norms. But the Trump administration has been pretty tough on Russia, punishing it with sanctions. That would probably continue under a Biden presidency, without the mixed messaging. There could be little change in America's nation-to-nation relationship with Russia The former vice-president bluntly told CNN he believed Russia was ""an opponent."" He's promised a forceful response for election interference, and for alleged bounty payments to the Taliban to target American troops in Afghanistan, something Mr Trump hasn't addressed. At the same time Mr Biden has made clear that he wants to work with Moscow to preserve what's left of the arms control treaties constraining their nuclear arsenals. President Trump has pulled out of two, accusing Russia of cheating, and is trying to negotiate the extension of a third  which expires in February. Biden has committed to extending it without conditions if he's elected. CHINA In 2017, Mr Trump described how he and Xi Jinping bonded over chocolate cake. But since then MR Trump has traded his friendship with the Chinese president for accusations about spreading the coronavirus, for harsh measures and a new Cold War rhetoric. In fact there is rare cross-party agreement on getting tough with China over trade and other issues. The question is about tactics. Mr Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices,"" but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals. Who Russia, China and Iran want to win US election The sharp elbows of the Trump administration have been successful in winning global support for a boycott of Chinese communications technology. That's part of a serious escalation in US efforts to push back against Beijing on many fronts, which has brought relations to their lowest point in decades. This campaign is led by Trump's China hawks - strategic competition they call it, but strategic confrontation is how some analysts describe it. Joe Biden would more actively seek areas of cooperation with a rising China. He says he wants to revive American leadership. But the world has also changed in the past four years, with the robust return of great power competition and recent polls showing America's reputation has plummeted even amongst staunch allies, those Mr Biden would aspire to lead.

"Freight drivers who are not UK citizens and have been through Denmark in the last fortnight are warned they will be turned away from the British border. It follows concern over a new coronavirus strain that has spread from mink to humans. Returning drivers who are UK citizens will have to self-isolate for 14 days along with their households. It comes as further 156 people in the UK were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. It brings the overall UK death toll to 49,044,according to government data,external. Both the number of UK deaths and the daily cases - 20,572 in the past 24 hours - mark a significant drop on previous days, but Sunday figures are often lower due to a lag in weekend reporting. The new rules,externalfor hauliers returning from Denmark began at 04:00 GMT on Sunday - and follow a ban on all non-UK citizens coming to the UK from Denmark. Any UK citizens who have travelled to Denmark must isolate for 14 days, along with their household. Passenger planes and ships carrying freight (as well as passengers) from Denmark will also not be allowed to dock at English ports. Cabin crew are also no longer exempt from the quarantine rules - which Ryanair described on Saturday as a ""bizarre and baseless"" move. The airline said it had cancelled all flights to and from Denmark while the rules remain in place, and urged Mr Shapps to reverse the decision. Scottish airline Loganair saidit has suspended flights between Scotland and Denmark,externalfrom 9 to 22 November. UK bans Denmark visitors over mink Covid-19 fears What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? Coronavirus: Can I still go on holiday? The Department for Transport (DfT) said the latest rules followed the release of ""further information"" from health officials in Denmark, where 12 people have been found to have mink-related mutations of virus, most of them connected to farms in the North Jutland region. The travel ban and extra requirements will be reviewed after a week, the DfT has said. Asked about the restrictions by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab denied the suggestion they were ""draconian"", insisting the government had taken ""safe and responsible steps"" in light of the ""new and evolving"" science on the mutated virus strain. He told the Andrew Marr show: ""I wouldn't describe it as draconian taking a precautionary measure that if and when we come up with a vaccine it can't be sidestepped by a mutation in the virus that the Danes have found through their mink population. ""I think that's a common sense measure that the public would expect us to take."" John Littleton, who returned from a business trip in Denmark on Friday, says he would have done things differently if he had known how rules would have affected his family. ""I was in Denmark on business. My flight back was Friday afternoon. On Friday morning a colleague told me that Denmark had been put back on the restricted list. I assumed I would have to self isolate for two weeks. There was no official contact. Once home I started self-isolating. On Saturday morning I missed a call from the tracing service who said they would ring me on Sunday. Last evening, two police officers arrived at my home. They read out a statement recommending the whole household self-isolate for two weeks. It was rather ambiguous - but the police said we would be fined if we didn't. Both my son and his partner now can't go to work. She is a teacher, he manages an electrical retailer. Not being at work causes real problems. When the announcement about Denmark was made, there was no that the entire household would have to self-isolate. If it had said that, I would have done things differently - perhaps I would have stayed out there or isolated somewhere else upon my return. I just don't understand why such extreme measures are being taken. I was not in the north of Denmark and followed all social distancing guidelines while there. Denmark are only imposing local restrictions. Why can I not simply be tested, so that the rest of the household can carry on with work? As usual, the whole situation is being handled in a haphazard way with little thought."" Denmark is the UK'slargest source of imported pork- including bacon - with machinery among the other major import items. Rod McKenzie, managing director of policy at the Road Haulage Association, said the latest restrictions were ""significant and unique"" because lorry drivers working in supply chains have been ""exempt"" fromtravel quarantine rules,external. He suggested that whilst different organisations, such as supermarkets, may have their own plans to address any supply issues, he warned that if the restrictions continue for a ""long time"" there could be ""a potential disruption to bacon supplies in the UK"". Meanwhile, Logistics UK, a freight trade body, said the industry was ""agile"" so ""importers can switch between transport modes to ensure that products still arrive"". In a statement it added: ""Much of the ferry transport between the UK and Denmark is sent in unaccompanied trailers, so drivers simply collect their loads from ports, with no need to travel across the border. ""The industry will continue to maintain high levels of vigilance and follow all necessary health protocols to protect the UK."" In England, where a new national lockdown came into force on Thursday, people are still allowed to travel overseas for work or education trips. Leaving home to go on holiday is currently banned for most people in the UK. Denmark's Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod called Mr Shapps' travel announcement a ""very drastic step"" and said he had discussed it with UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Saturday. Denmark had been taken off theUK coronavirus travel corridors list,externalon Friday after it first became apparent the mutated form of coronavirus was present in the country. It meant any passengers arriving in the UK from Denmark would need to self-isolate after their arrival. The Department for Health and Social Care estimates that between 300 and 500 people have arrived in the UK from Denmark in the last 14 days. Officials will contact anyone in the UK who has been in Denmark in the last fortnight to make sure they also self-isolate.

"This video can not be played 'We are getting territory back by force' Azerbaijan has taken a key town in the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh region, according to the country's president. Ilham Aliyev announced in a televised address on Sunday that Azerbaijani forces had gained control of Shusha, known as Shushi in Armenian. Armenia, however, denied the town's loss and said fighting was ongoing. Taking the strategically important town would be a major victory for Azerbaijan in the ongoing conflict over the disputed territory. Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but is governed by ethnic Armenians backed by the Armenian government. A war between the two countries over the region ended in 1994 with a truce but no peace deal. What are Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over? Human cost of two nations fighting for 'Motherland' 'We raise them in basements, then send them to fight' Fresh fighting erupted in September, with each side blaming the other for the outbreak in violence. Shusha sits on hills above the territory's capital Stepanakert (known as Khankendi in Azerbaijan) and lies on the road linking the city with Armenian territory. If taken, it could serve as a staging post for an assault on the capital. President Aliyev said the ""liberation"" of Shusha would ""go down in the history of the Azerbaijani people"". ""There is no force in the world that can stop us,"" he said, pledging to retake Nagorno-Karabakh for his country. In an interview made before the latest developments from Shusha, Mr Aliyev told the BBC's Orla Guerin said Armenia was running out of time. ""Their opportunities to compromise are shrinking because we are getting those territories back by force,"" he said. Azerbaijan has been steadily advancing into Nagorno-Karabakh in recent weeks, as a BBC map from 27 October shows. Armenia, however, has denied the town has been taken by Azerbaijan. ""The battles in Shushi continue - wait and believe in our troops,"" Armenian defence ministry official Artsrun Hovhannisyan wrote on Facebook. And David Babayan, a foreign policy adviser to Nagorno-Karabakh's self-declared president Arayik Harutyunyan, told the BBC: ""We can say that Shushi is a battlefield and there are Azeri troops and Karabakh troops there, fighting each other for every building."" Before Azerbaijan's announcement, Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan wrote that ""the most ferocious combat"" had taken place around Shusha overnight. She said a number of Azerbaijani soldiers, tanks and other vehicles had been destroyed in the fighting. Disinformation spreads amid Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict 'Execution' video prompts Karabakh war crime probe Shusha has cultural significance for both sides. Its population was predominantly Azerbaijani before the war in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which forced hundreds of thousands to flee. For Armenians it is the home of the Ghazanchetsots (Holy Saviour) Cathedral, an iconic site for the Armenian Apostolic Church.Armenia accused Azerbaijan of targeting the buildinglast month. Both sides deny targeting civilians but accuse the other of doing so. This video can not be played Armenians on the front line in Nagorno-Karabakh It is unclear exactly how many have died. Nagorno-Karabakh's authorities say nearly 1,200 of its defence forces have died in the fighting, and civilians have also been killed or injured. Azerbaijan has not released its military casualty figures but has said more than 80 civilians have been killed in the fighting - including 21 ina missile strike on the town of Bardalast month. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month thatalmost 5,000 people had been killed in the fighting. People poured onto the streets of the Azerbaijani capital Baku in celebration, honking car horns, chanting slogans and waving the national flag. Allow Twitter content?

Reuters news agency reports that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has congratulated ""my Azeri brothers"", telling a crowd in Turkey's Kocaeli province that he thought what was happening in Shusha was ""a sign that the rest of the occupied lands will be liberated soon too"". Azerbaijan is an ally of Turkey's, and Mr Erdogan has pledged his nation's total support for Azerbaijan in the conflict. On Saturday the Turkish president told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that Armenia must withdraw from Azerbaijan's land and ""must be convinced to sit down at the negotiating table"". A statement from the Kremlin said Mr Putin had told Mr Erdogan that he had spoken to leaders from both Armenia and Azerbaijan, focusing on ""finding options for a swift cessation of hostilities and a political and diplomatic settlement"". International powers have made repeated attempts to broker a ceasefire in recent weeks. Russia - which is allied to Armenia but has close ties to Azerbaijan - negotiated two truces last month which were both broken almost immediately, whileboth sides accused the other of violating a US-brokered ceasefireannounced on 25 October within minutes of it coming into force.

Denmark are only imposing local restrictions. Why can I not simply be tested, so that the rest of the household can carry on with work? As usual, the whole situation is being handled in a haphazard way with little thought."" Denmark is the UK'slargest source of imported pork- including bacon - with machinery among the other major import items. Rod McKenzie, managing director of policy at the Road Haulage Association, said the latest restrictions were ""significant and unique"" because lorry drivers working in supply chains have been ""exempt"" fromtravel quarantine rules,external. He suggested that whilst different organisations, such as supermarkets, may have their own plans to address any supply issues, he warned that if the restrictions continue for a ""long time"" there could be ""a potential disruption to bacon supplies in the UK"". Meanwhile, Logistics UK, a freight trade body, said the industry was ""agile"" so ""importers can switch between transport modes to ensure that products still arrive"". In a statement it added: ""Much of the ferry transport between the UK and Denmark is sent in unaccompanied trailers, so drivers simply collect their loads from ports, with no need to travel across the border. ""The industry will continue to maintain high levels of vigilance and follow all necessary health protocols to protect the UK."" In England, where a new national lockdown came into force on Thursday, people are still allowed to travel overseas for work or education trips. Leaving home to go on holiday is currently banned for most people in the UK. Denmark's Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod called Mr Shapps' travel announcement a ""very drastic step"" and said he had discussed it with UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Saturday. Denmark had been taken off theUK coronavirus travel corridors list,externalon Friday after it first became apparent the mutated form of coronavirus was present in the country. It meant any passengers arriving in the UK from Denmark would need to self-isolate after their arrival. The Department for Health and Social Care estimates that between 300 and 500 people have arrived in the UK from Denmark in the last 14 days. Officials will contact anyone in the UK who has been in Denmark in the last fortnight to make sure they also self-isolate.

"There has been a sharp rise in the number of migrants arriving in the Canary Islands More than 1,600 African migrants have been rescued at sea or reached Spain's Canary Islands over the weekend, Spanish emergency services said. About 1,000 arrived on Saturday alone, setting out on about 20 barely seaworthy boats. One person was flown to hospital by helicopter. There has been a sharp increase in the number of migrants from West Africa attempting to reach the Canary Islands in recent months. The island chain is just 100km (60 miles) off the coast of North Africa. Canary Islands see new influx of African migrants 140 migrants drown in year's deadliest shipwreck According to the Spanish government, more than 11,000 arrivals have been recorded in the Canary Islands this year compared with 2,557 during the same period last year. A spokeswoman for Canary services told AFP news agency the migrants had arrived on the islands of Gran Canaria, Tenerife and El Hierro. The body of one person who died during the perilous journey was recovered by rescuers on El Hierro, the spokeswoman said. Images taken from Arguineguin port in Gran Canarias this weekend show migrants queuing up to receive assistance. According to the Spanish government, more than 11,000 arrivals have been recorded in the Canary Islands this year Last month at least 140 migrants bound for Europe drowned after a boat carrying around 200 people sank off the coast of Senegal. The boat caught fire andcapsized shortly after leaving the town of Mbour, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. About 60 people were rescued, according to reports. It is believed the migrants were attempting to reach mainland Europe via the Canary Islands. At least 414 people are known to have died along this route so far this year according to the IOM.

"The world's biggest jeweller, Pandora, has no plans for the permanent closure of any of its thousands of stores despite the coronavirus pandemic. Chief executive Alexander Lacik told the BBC he also intended to continue paying all staff in full. The firm could ""withstand a big drop in sales"" before he would even start considering store closures, he said. At the height of the pandemic, 80% of the company's 2,700 stores around the world were closed. However, Pandora ""kept its staff on the payroll"". Even those among the 28,000 employees who were unable to work because stores were closed by government restrictions were paid in full. Mr Lacik is proud of that and said that as well as this being ""a very good decision"" for the business, it was the ""ethical thing to do"" and the loyalty to staff was now being rewarded. He said: ""Looking at how people have kind of returned that when stores reopen, I think it was a fantastic thing to do."" This month, he reckons 18% of the stores will be closed as a second wave of coronavirus sweeps across Europe. That is likely to hurt sales in the run-up to Christmas, which is traditionally one of the busiest times of the year. Alexander Lacik says his stores are ""incredibly profitable"" As with many other companies, there has been a huge growth in online sales. They almost doubled, growing 89% in the three months to the end of September and accounting for 21% of the company's $648m (Â£493m) of sales. Mr Lacik says that despite the huge growth in online, physical retail will ""continue being an important part of the industry at large"", because consumers want a ""seamless"" experience between the virtual world and the physical world. Just over a year ago, the company invested heavily in a big relaunch to allow customers a more hands-on experience in-store. The stores are ""incredibly profitable"" and Mr Lacik said his company would not close any for good, because it was ""not an average retailer"". LVMH and Tiffany make up over takeover dispute Whether they are buying rings, bracelets or earrings, Mr Lacik concedes that digital does not have all the answers. Customers ""want to see it,   they want to touch it, they want to feel it"", he said. However, they increasingly have an initial look online, then go into a store for advice before making a purchase, either in-store or online. ""The most successful players now, they are good at integrating all of this,"" he said. On average, Pandora says, it sells three pieces of jewellery a second. It is perhaps best known for its charm bracelets, which let customers choose different symbols to personalise their pieces. They are seen as critical to its profits, which started to fall a few years ago, but have improved after a turnaround plan was launched by Mr Lacik. Frans Hoyer, an analyst at Swedish bank Handelsbanken, said the company ""lost focus on its core products and its messaging to customers, which led sales to fall"". Pandora, however, was ""always profitable"". This underlying strength, combined with fewer promotions and raising money from investors, meant the company could keep paying its staff during lockdowns, Mr Hoyer added. ""Keeping staff on the payroll so they were ready to go when stores reopened, and a continued spend on advertising when others weren't, has helped the jeweller through the pandemic."" Known for its charm bracelets, Pandora is the world's largest jeweller by production volume Mr Lacik said recent collaborations with brands such as Harry Potter and Star Wars had definitely broadened the appeal of the jewellery, but were ""never going to be the core of Pandora"". Having the option to dangle Darth Vader or R2-D2 from your wrist ""keeps the brand interesting and keeps it fresh"", he added. Celebrity tie-ups have also helped, but Mr Lacik said it was important these partnerships had authenticity, or customers would not be convinced to part with their cash. The new face of Pandora is Stranger Things and Enola Holmes star Millie Bobbie Brown, who Mr Lacik says ""was a Pandora fan even before we started that collaboration"". It doesn't hurt that she also has 31 million Instagram followers and is hugely influential amongst the young women who are Pandora's core market. Analysts say these tie-ups have helped keep the company's finances healthy.  In the first nine months of this year, sales are down only 2% on the same period a year ago, at almost $1.8bn. Mr Lacik said: ""I could lose half the sales and I'd still be profitable in most of my stores."" Store closures had a broader impact too, he said, adding: ""What we see, for instance, in places where we have closed down physical retail, my ecommerce retail also goes down. So it's a combination of the two. That seems to be the sweet spot, at least now.""

"This video can not be played Biden and Harris call for unity in victory speeches Joe Biden has said it is ""time to heal"" the US in his first speech as president-elect, vowing ""not to divide but to unify"" the country. ""Let's give each other a chance,"" he said at an event in Delaware addressing those who did not vote for him. Mr Biden defeated incumbent President Donald Trump following a cliff-hanger vote count after Tuesday's election. Mr Trump has yet to concede and has not spoken publicly since his defeat was announced while he was playing golf. Follow all the latest live updates Being with Trump the day he lost the election Joe Biden and a life in politics Election results in maps and charts The result makes Mr Trump the first one-term president since the 1990s. His campaign has filed a barrage of lawsuits in various states but election officials say there is no evidence that the vote was rigged against him, as he has said. Spontaneous celebrations erupted in major cities after media outlets announced Mr Biden's victory on Saturday. Disappointed Trump supporters demonstrated in some cities but there were no reports of incidents. Addressing cheering supporters in a car park in his hometown of Wilmington, Mr Biden said: ""I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but to unify; who doesn't see red states and blue states, only sees the United States."" Mr Biden - who has won more than 74 million votes so far, the most ever for a US presidential candidate - hailed the ""diverse"" support he gathered during the campaign, and thanked African-American voters in particular. But he also reached out to Trump supporters directly. ""It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again,"" Mr Biden said, without mentioning his rival in the election. ""And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies."" Supporters gathered in Wilmington for Mr Biden's speech The president-elect, who arrived on stage wearing a face mask, announced that he would form his coronavirus response committee to ensure it is ready to implement decisions from his inauguration day in January, because ""that's the only way we can get back to living"". The Trump administration's response to the pandemic was at the centre of the presidential campaign, and drew heavy criticism from Mr Biden, who said his plan would be ""built on bedrock science"". The US has reported more than 237,000 deaths, the most of any country. Mr Biden was introduced by his running mate, Kamala Harris, who is about to become the first female vice-president in the country's history. She will also be the first black and first Asian-American vice-president when she takes office, following a year that has seen nationwide protests on the issue of racial injustice. Ms Harris paid tribute to her late mother, an Indian immigrant to the US, and the other generations of black, Asian, white, Latina, and native women who had ""paved the way for this moment tonight"". This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? ""While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,"" she added. Reflecting on the election campaign, she told supporters: ""When our very democracy was on the ballot in this election, the very soul of America at stake and with the whole world watching, you ushered in a new day for America."" She added: ""You chose hope and unity, decency, science and yes, truth - you chose Joe Biden as the next president of the United States. And the road ahead will not be easy but America is ready, and so are Joe and I."" In an earlier time, Joe Biden's victory speech would have seemed fairly routine. The president-elect spoke of unity, of ending acrimony, of the potential and power of the American people. Those are sentiments many a winning politician have touched on in the past. Coming on the heels of Donald Trump's presidency, however, they mark a sharp contrast. The president Mr Biden will replace was one who was often criticised for stoking cultural divisions and doing little to tamp down the unrest that broke out in many US cities earlier this year. Mr Biden spoke of his election being an ""inflection point"" that would allow the American people to make a decision about ""who we are and who we want to be"". As Saturday night's speech demonstrated, at the very least, the Biden presidency will mark a change in presidential rhetoric. The American people have a president-elect who talks about bringing the country together; about being a leader for all the people. Saying it is the easy part; now he has to do it. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" The BBC projected Mr Biden's victory on Saturday, after gains in the key battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Nevada propelled him over the 270 electoral college vote threshold required to clinch the White House. This prediction is based on the unofficial results from states that have already finished counting their votes, and the expected results from states like Wisconsin where the count is continuing. Mr Trump has not spoken in public since the numbers were announced, but he repeated previous claims of voter fraud in a tweet, which Twitter soon marked as a ""disputed"" claim. The Trump campaign has indicated their candidate does not plan to concede. President Trump appeared subdued as he returned to the White House on Saturday After Mr Biden was projected to win Mr Trump remained defiant, saying Mr Biden was ""falsely posing as the winner"" and insisting the election was ""far from over"". The president took more than 70 million votes, the second-highest tally in history. The response from senior Republicans has been muted. Republican Party Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted that ""the media doesn't decide who wins elections, voters do"". But Senator Mitt Romney, a critic of Mr Trump, congratulated Mr Biden and Ms Harris. He said he and his wife ""know both of them as people of good will and admirable character"". Mr Trump has vowed to contest the election results on several fronts. A recount will be held in Georgia, where the margins are tight, and Mr Trump wants the same in Wisconsin. He has also vowed to take legal action to the Supreme Court, alleging voting fraud without evidence. If the election result is challenged, it would require legal teams to challenge this in the state courts. State judges would then need to uphold the challenge and order a recount, and Supreme Court justices could then be asked to overturn a ruling. On Saturday, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit over ballots cast on election day in Arizona that it claims were incorrectly rejected. Arizona's secretary of state, however, said in a statement that the case was ""grasping at straws"". Read more: Could the election be decided in courts?

Meanwhile, votes in some states are continuing to be counted and results are never official until final certification, which occurs in each state in the weeks following the election. This must be done before 538 chosen officials (electors) from the Electoral College - which officially decides who wins the election - meet in their state capitals to vote on 14 December. The electors' votes usually mirror the popular vote in each state. However, in some states this is not a formal requirement. The president's supporters have continued to hold rallies The new president is officially sworn into office on 20 January after a transition period to give them time to appoint cabinet ministers and make plans. The handover of power takes place at a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC. After the ceremony, the new president makes their way to the White House to begin their four-year term in office. Mr Biden, who will be 78 when he takes office, making him the oldest first-term president in American history, ran for the White House twice before. In 1988 he withdrew from the race after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British Labour Party, Neil Kinnock. In 2008, he tried again to get the Democratic nomination before dropping out and joining Barack Obama's ticket. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career His eight years as vice-president allowed him to lay claim to much of Mr Obama's legacy, including passage of the Affordable Care Act. The six-term senator from Delaware was first elected in 1972. Early in his career, he sided with southern segregationists in opposing court-ordered school bussing to racially integrate public schools. He was also a fierce advocate of a 1994 anti-crime bill that many on the left now say encouraged lengthy sentences and mass incarceration. Most Americans know that Joe Biden's life has been marked by personal tragedy - experiences he often refers to. In 1972, he lost his first wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, in a car accident. He famously took the oath of office for his first Senate term from the hospital room of his toddler sons Beau and Hunter, who both survived the accident. In 2015, Beau died of brain cancer at the age of 46, and Joe Biden said this played a role in his decision not to run for president in 2016.

"This video can not be played Biden and Harris call for unity in victory speeches US President-elect Joe Biden is to make tackling the coronavirus pandemic his top priority following his win over Donald Trump, his team says. Announcing the first steps in his transition plan, his team said there would be more testing and Americans would be asked to wear masks. On Monday, Mr Biden is expected to name a 12-member coronavirus task force. His win remains a projection as key states still count votes. Mr Trump does not plan to concede, his campaign says. Mr Trump is launching legal challenges to the results in several key states. He has made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud, but election officials say there is no evidence that the vote was rigged against him. Mr Biden is forging ahead with his plans for assuming power in January after major US networks called the election in his favour on Saturday. Follow all the latest live updates Five US voters who changed the race Being with Trump the day he lost the election Election results in maps and charts That reportedly also includes a slew of executive orders -written orders issued by the presidentto the federal government that do not require congressional approval - aimed at reversing controversial Trump policies. According to US media: Mr Biden will rejoin the Paris climate agreement, which the US officially left on Wednesday He will reverse the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization He will end thetravel ban on citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries He will reinstate an Obama-era policy of granting immigration status to undocumented migrants who entered the US as children In his first speech as president-elect on Saturday, Mr Biden said it was ""time to heal"" the US and vowed ""not to divide but to unify"" the country. Addressing Trump supporters directly, he said: ""We have to stop treating our opponents as enemies."" He and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris have launcheda website for the transition,external, saying the team will also focus on the economy, tackling racism and climate change. The projected election result means Mr Trump becomes the first one-term president since the 1990s. Meanwhile, the General Services Administration, a government agency tasked with recognising the president-elect and beginning the transition process, has so far not done so. Its administrator Emily Murphy, who was appointed by Mr Trump, has given no indication when this could happen. Until then, Mr Biden's transition team cannot access government funds or communicate with the federal agencies it will be staffing. Media reports suggested senior Republicans remained divided over how to react to Mr Biden's victory, with some refusing to publicly acknowledge the result of the ballot. The Republican leader in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, told Fox News that all recounts and legal challenges should be completed, adding: ""Then and only then, America will decide who won the race."" But former Republican President George W Bush congratulated Mr Biden on his victory, saying the American people could have confidence that the election had been fundamentally fair and that its outcome was clear. He also congratulated Mr Trump on a hard-fought campaign. The president-elect is vowing a major shift in the way the White House approaches coronavirus after Mr Trump repeatedly downplayed its gravity and resisted public health measures including wearing masks and social distancing. The US election took place in the shadow of the virus, which has killed more than 237,000 people in the country The Biden team has said it will ensure all Americans had access to regular and free testing and provide ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"". The task force will be led by former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy and a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, David Kessler. Mr Biden also wants rules mandating the wearing of masks across the country, which he says would save thousands of lives. He plans to call on every American to wear a mask when they are around people outside their own household and wants state governors and local authorities to make this obligatory. The president-elect has regularly appeared in public wearing a mask while Mr Trump has largely avoided doing so. Read more: Could the election be decided in courts? 'Let's work together!' - How world reacted to Biden win 'We in Africa are proud of her success' Five questions for Biden on the economy Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? US cases rose by more than 100,000 on Sunday for the fifth day in a row while more than 237,000 people have died. Earlier this month top US virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci said the US ""could not possibly be positioned more poorly"" as the country approached winter and people spent more time congregating indoors. Mr Biden also announced plans to reboot the virus-hit US economy, which has seen millions more people become unemployed, by boosting manufacturing, investing in infrastructure, making childcare more affordable and reducing the wealth gap between different ethnic groups. In another break with the Trump era - which saw Mr Trump accused of stoking of racial tensions and failing to condemn white supremacist groups - Mr Biden aims to make addressing racism a central pillar of his administration. He wants measures including better access to affordable housing for black and minority communities, fair treatment and pay for workers and enabling the Federal Reserve - the US central bank, which sets monetary policy - to do more to reduce racial wealth disparities. Mr Biden also wants to transform US policing by banning the use of chokeholds that have been involved in high-profile deaths at the hands of police, stopping the transfer of ""weapons of war"" to police forces and creating a national police oversight commission. He further plans to reduce the US prison population, which at more than two million people is the biggest in the world and includes a disproportionate number of black and minority inmates, and focus more on ""redemption and rehabilitation"". This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" ""Our criminal justice system cannot be just unless we root out the racial, gender, and income-based disparities in the system,"" his plan says. The US has been roiled by protests against police brutality in the run-up to the election. Footage ofthe death of George Floyd in police custodyin Minneapolis in May sparked outrage around the world, and exit poll showed that racial inequality was the second-biggest factor determining how people voted after the economy. President Trump will hold a series of campaign-style rallies across the country to build support for the legal fights challenging the outcome, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. The BBC projected Mr Biden's victory on Saturday after gains in the key battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Nevada propelled him over the 270 electoral college vote threshold required to clinch the White House. Mr Trump has not spoken in public since the numbers were announced, but he has repeated previous claims of voter fraud in tweets, which have been marked by Twitter as a ""disputed"" claim. The president played golf at the Trump National Golf course in Virginia on Sunday but did not talk to reporters After Mr Biden was projected to win Mr Trump remained defiant, saying Mr Biden was ""falsely posing as the winner"" and insisting the election was ""far from over"".

"Just Park is an app that allows land owners to rent out their driveways as parking spaces A parking website has apologised after scammers exploited it by listing spaces on driveways which they do not own. Just Park is one of several websites which allow people to make money by advertising parking spaces for hire on their own land. But some homeowners have been surprised to discover their driveways have been listed without their permission. Just Park says it has stringent checks in place to prevent fraud and cases are ""extremely rare"". Simon Gallagher started getting complaints from tenants at the flat he owns at Bexleyheath in Greater London. Strangers were leaving cars in their dedicated parking bays, leaving them with nowhere to park. ""This was going on for about a month or so"", says Simon, ""until one day somebody had left a note in the window of one of the cars that was parked there with a booking reference for Just Park"". ""I looked it up on the website and to my surprise, found a photograph of the flat advertised out for rent"". Someone was charging Â£8 a day for the use of his tenants' parking spaces. To prevent them from being used by anyone else, he has now had bollards installed. Simon Gallagher, a landlord, had to install bollards in the driveway of a flat he owns after scammers rented out his tenants' driveway to commuters to park in In Edinburgh, Barbara Oliver was alerted by a neighbour to a similar problem outside her property. She was away on holiday when mystery vehicles began parking right in front of her garage door. ""It appeared that these people had used Just Park and had information to say that they could park there, which, as the property's owner, I knew was not true"", Barbara says. Just Park removed the unauthorised adverts after Barbara Oliver and Simon Gallagher complained. Speaking on Radio 4's You & Yours programme, the company's founder and chief executive officer, Anthony Eskinazi, said ""I'd like to apologise to Mrs Oliver and Mr Gallagher for their experiences. 'We do have stringent checks in place to prevent spaces from being listed fraudulently. On rare occasions where they are added, we immediately remove them once notified and ensure that our community is not adversely affected"". Just Park says its policies and procedures have successfully reduced instances of fraud to ""less than two listings per month, which represents less than one out of every 1000 new listings"". It says that new space owners cannot withdraw funds for at least 48 hours after the first booking. The company was launched in 2006, matching drivers with spare parking spaces outside people's homes through its website and app. It says over 45,000 people have earned a combined total of more than Â£50m by listing spare parking spaces on its platform.

"Ms O'Neill said the executive was looking at reopening some areas of the hospitality industry Cafes and restaurants could be allowed to reopen from Friday but not bars, the deputy first minister has suggested. Michelle O'Neill said it was ""something we are considering"" ahead of the executive meeting to discuss easing some Covid-19 restrictions. Current measures are due to end on Friday, and ministers have been advised pubs and restaurants should remain closed for another two weeks. Ms O'Neill said there could be some ""flexibility"" for easing restrictions. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday Politics, she said any decisions would be taken in a ""graduated"" manner. Meanwhile, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has confirmed it has closed its training college at Garnerville in Belfast for two days for a deep clean. Four student officers have tested positive for coronavirus and 15 more have been advised to self-isolate. Ch Supt Emma Bond wished those affected a speedy recovery and said it was the first confirmed positive cases of Covid 19 concerning student officers since the beginning of the pandemic. Speaking on Thursday, First Minister Arlene Foster said the restrictions imposed on 16 Octoberhad helped bring the R-rate - or reproduction number - down to 0.7. However, Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Ms O'Neill said that number did not take into account the reopening of schools last week, and the impact of that may not be known until next week. On Sunday, there were seven further coronavirus-related deaths reported by the Department of Health in the previous 24-hour period. It brings the total number of deaths reported by the department to 781. There were also an additional 420 cases of coronavirus confirmed. There are 55 people being treated in intensive care units and 41 of them are on ventilators. Belfast Chamber chief executive Simon Hamilton said footfall across city businesses was down by 50% In the Republic of Ireland, there have been two further coronavirus-related deaths and 542 new cases confirmed in the past 24 hours. It brings the total confirmed cases to 65,394, while the death toll stands at 1,947. The number of people in ICU is 39, down one since Saturday. Ms O'Neill said the executive would not keep any measure in place ""longer than necessary"" and they were looking at reopening some areas. ""For example, close- contact services, is there space for us to open those things up again from next Friday, in a very regulated way of course, on an appointment-by-appointment basis, a one-in one-out basis?"" she said. ""The restrictions very much focus on the hospitality sector right now so we're looking at that wide family. ""Across hospitality, you've everything from a cafe or a coffee shop, right through to a nightclub and they're two very different scenarios. ""We're looking at whether there is any space or scope there to lift some of those things in a graduated way over the course of the next number of weeks."" The executive is looking at whether the hospitality industry can reopen but without alcohol Hospitality business have called for clarity as soon as possible, but the deputy first minister said the sale of alcohol was a factor to consider in coming to a decision. ""We have to be very mindful of the fact that perhaps people's defences come down when there is alcohol taken. ""So what we're looking at is - are there ways that we can open things up perhaps without alcohol? ""If we can find a way to get ourselves into the new year with the restrictions that we bring in now, then that's the prize that we're going for here. ""We don't want to have to intervene again before Christmas, we want to be able to allow some flexibility to allow people to move around as much as possible, to allow as much of our economy to open up as possible."" Belfast Chamber chief executive Simon Hamilton said footfall across businesses in the city was down by 50% and many firms were facing the ""real prospect of closure and a serious number of job losses"". ""If at least some life isn't breathed back into the city centre later this week, then I worry not only for those forced to remain closed but also those who can still trade but have decreasing numbers of people to trade to,"" he said. ""What I seriously see is a city centre that is on the edge with many businesses and their staff facing a dire future. ""What the executive decides this week will either kill off city and town centres or give them a fighting chance."" He has called on executive ministers to find a way to allow businesses to reopen for the traditionally busy Christmas period. A Department of Health proposal, seen by BBC News NI, indicates that a two-week extension of the restrictions on hospitality until the end of November could mean the possibility of avoiding further interventions before Christmas.

"Many people who were shielding earlier in the pandemic continue to take extra care Shielding alone earlier in the Covid pandemic felt like ""a slippery slope to the grave"" for 60-year-old Margaret. New figures show that, of the 121,000 households shielding in Wales in July, more than half consisted of one person living alone like her. Age Cymru said older people had endured a particularly hard time and a ""concerted effort"" was needed to ensure support was in place for the winter. The Welsh Government has been asked to comment. From the start of the pandemic to16 August, tens of thousands of people in Wales with underlying health conditions were advised to stay indoors to protect themselves. And while Wales is set to exit a 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown on Monday, many vulnerable people will continue to isolate or take extra care in order to avoid contracting Covid-19. 'I felt excluded' As people began to return to normal after the first lockdown, Margaret, from Pembrokeshire, was left feeling more shut out than ever. She initially started shielding because she had lupus - a long-term autoimmune condition that causes joint pain, skin rashes and tiredness which can lead to the breakdown of cells. ""Some of the community spirit dropped away as people went back to their normal lives after the first lockdown ended. I felt excluded then,"" she said. Is Wales coming out of lockdown too early? Do people still have to shield? Shielding ends but hugging child 'could kill dad' ""Sometimes on social media, or out on a walk, I would see that people I knew had been somewhere together and I hadn't been invited. ""They would say things like, 'we know you like to keep away from people' - which is not true, but I suppose they thought I was excluding myself."" She has not seen her son for more than a year and worries the young children in the family will not remember her. ""I feel as though I have been in limbo for a year. I was 60 at the end of 2019 and planned to have a year of celebration with road trips to see my family and a summer party,"" she said. ""Sixty is not old but staying at home all the time on my own, talking to myself and not going out, especially as the winter is coming on, feels like a slippery slope to the grave."" Margaret said she felt there was even negativity among some people who believed those isolating after the shielding had paused were causing an impact on the economy. Age Cymru's chief executive Victoria Lloyd said many older people were already suffering with loneliness and isolation before, but the pandemic had ""compounded the situation"". ""With winter coming we need a concerted effort to make sure that we have the right systems and support in place for older people, particularly those who may find themselves shielding for a period of time."" She said protected shopping slots, prescription deliveries and full access to health and social care were all issues that need to be resolved if there were further lockdowns. ""We would also urge local communities to continue to look after their older families and neighbours by keeping in touch with them and offering support and reassurance during difficult times,"" she added. ""We very much welcomed the support of volunteers during the first lockdown."" Shielding guidance,externalhas not changed since it was paused on 16 August, despite the rise in coronavirus cases since the autumn. The Welsh Government has said it did not want those most at risk to go back to measures expected of them earlier in the summer because of the potential negative effects on people's mental health. The chief medical officer for Wales wrote to those on the shielding patients list to say ""you do not need to restart shielding but you should take extra care"". This means people should follow the same rules as everyone else, but take extra care in regularly washing hands, keeping contacts to a minimum and shopping online. Welsh Government data shows there were about 44,000 more people above 50 shielding than 18 to 29-year-olds. But Lucy Dixon, from Newcastle Emlyn in Carmarthenshire, said she too felt the impact of loneliness when shielding alone. The 28-year-old said: ""I'm really sociable, so it's really lonely. ""I said to myself all along that this [coronavirus] is at least for the next year, if not a couple of years. ""I told myself that because I thought if I set myself up to believe that it would be shorter than that, I would be really upset and disappointed."" Lucy Dixon has chosen to continue shielding alone Ms Dixon has Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), a rare disease which often leads to permanent lung damage, which means she is ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" and was advised to shield by the government. She has chosen to continue shielding alone due to the seriousness of her condition. But she started shielding at her parents' home in mid-March before she received any guidance. ""My parents put a bookcase in this archway that leads from one room to another, so I was fortunate to have a self-contained space,"" she said. ""It was tough. I cooked for the first couple of months on an electric, portable hob - it was just pasta and rice - and we ended up getting government food boxes for a while because it was so hard to get delivery slots."" Shielding advice in Wales 'has not changed' Coronavirus: What effect has lockdown had on loneliness? 'Living on my own has been a very lonely time' Despite being on the other side of the wall from her parents, the only time Ms Dixon saw them for the first couple of months was through a window, until the weather got better. She said she wasn't working at the time, because of her health, so ""all I was doing was just reading these horrific stories thinking 'I'm going to die if I get this'"". ""I don't feel like that now, but I did at the time,"" Ms Dixon said. She added she is taking things day-by-day and making the most of her ""new life"" for now.

"The council said the sinkhole had been caused by surface water running onto the road from farmland A main road has reopened after a sinkhole the ""width of three houses"" was repaired. South Gower Road in Swansea was closed on 1 Octoberafter the sinkhole was found and deemed to be at ""risk of imminent collapse"". Swansea council closed the A4118 between Penmaen and the turn-off to Oxwich for emergency repairs. The authority said the sinkhole had been caused by surface water running onto the road from farmland. In a statement the council said this was complicated by the ""presence of voids in the rock beneath the road"". This video can not be played Sinkholes are often caused by an abnormal amount of water seeping into the ground, but they are difficult to predict Repairs included the creation of a new drainage system to help direct water away from the road surface to stop it happening again, the statement reads. Cabinet Member for Environment Enhancement and Infrastructure Management Mark Thomas said: ""Early fears that the subsidence has been caused by the large voids deep in the ground were fortunately not the case. ""However, running water had created some smaller voids much nearer the road surface and it was this issue that had caused the problem."" He added: ""I'd like to thank motorists for the patience they have shown while we have completed these works and also thank our highways staff for the hard work and effort put in to get the road open again.""

"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are projected to win Pennsylvania, sealing their bid for the White House The world is reacting to the projected victory of Joe Biden over Donald Trump in the US presidential election. For days, people around the world have been glued to the White House race. It is not just the US that the election of a new president affects - a new leader in the White House can transform the country's foreign policy and its approach to its friends and foes alike. Here is how some of the world's leaders have reacted, and where they stand with the US. 'We in Africa are proud of her success' ""Congratulations Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Joe, we've had a long & warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great friend of Israel. I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special alliance between the US and Israel. ""Thank you Donald Trump for the friendship you have shown the state of Israel and me personally, for recognizing Jerusalem and the Golan, for standing up to Iran, for the historic peace accords and for bringing the American-Israeli alliance to unprecedented heights."" US policy in the Middle East shifted massively during Donald Trump's presidency. He heightened tensions with Iran while recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and helped establish ties between Israel and several Arab states. Mr Biden's suggestion he may rejoin the Iran nuclear deal will deeply concern Israeli policymakers. His likely objections to further Israeli settlement building in the occupied West Bank will also mark a shift from his predecessor. What Biden's victory means for rest of world ""Congratulations to Joe Biden on his election... and to Kamala Harris on her historic achievement. The US is our most important ally and I look forward to working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security"" With Brexit looming, the UK will soon have a very different transatlantic partner in Joe Biden. The UK currently trades with the US on terms set by the EU, but this will change on 1 January 2021 when the transition period ends - and the US and UK are trying to negotiate a new post-Brexit trade deal. Mr Biden - who often speaks of his Irish background - has said said he would not allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a ""casualty of Brexit"" if elected. One of the most complicated issues as the UK leaves the EU is the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which Mr Biden does not want to become a ""hard border"". Currently there are no passport or customs controls on the border, and politicians on all sides fear a return to checks which existed during the decades of deadly civil unrest in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles. Four ways the US election affects people in UK ""Congratulations Joe Biden on your spectacular victory! As the VP, your contribution to strengthening Indo-US relations was critical and invaluable. I look forward to working closely together once again... ""Heartiest congratulations Kamala Harris! Your success is path-breaking, and a matter of immense pride not just for your chittis [aunts], but also for all Indian-Americans. I am confident that the vibrant India-US ties will get even stronger with your support and leadership."" Kamala Harris is the daughter of an Indian biologist, and there have been celebrations in India after her victory. But both she and Mr Biden have criticised the Hindu nationalist policies of Mr Modi's government, something Donald Trump did not do during his time in office. What did the Trump-Modi âbromanceâ achieve? ""Congratulating Mr Joseph Biden on his victory in the presidential elections in the United States of America."" Saudi Arabia's reaction to Mr Biden's win has been rather delayed compared with other Arab nations. President Trump's Middle East policies and opposition to Iran boosted relations between Washington and Riyadh. However the two countries clashed over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Khashoggi fiancee sues Saudi crown prince ""America will have its first female Vice President in the person of Kamala Harris, and we are proud that she bears Jamaican heritage. ""Her ascension to this role is a monumental accomplishment for women all over the world and I salute her."" While Ms Harris's mother was Indian, her father is Jamaican by birth - sparking similar joy in the Caribbean country. The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris ""Congratulations, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Our two countries are close friends, partners, and allies. We share a relationship that's unique on the world stage. I'm really looking forward to working together and building on that with you both."" Mr Trudeau and Mr Trump did not have the smoothest relationship. The Canadian liberal leader had noticeably different politics to his US counterpart, and will likely have a warmer partnership with Mr Biden who shares his views on climate change and international affairs. George Floyd protests: Trudeau's epic pause when asked about Trump's response ""Our transatlantic friendship is indispensable if we are to deal with the major challenges of our times"" Donald Trump is deeply unpopular in Germany. He and Chancellor Merkel clashed repeatedly on Nato funding, global diplomacy and even the coronavirus, in sharp contrast to Ms Merkel's close relationship with his predecessor Barack Obama. Issues like military spending will remain but the US will likely renew its ties with Germany under Mr Biden. Why US election matters so much to Germans ""The Americans have chosen their President... We have a lot to do to overcome today's challenges. Let's work together!"" Mr Macron tried repeatedly to develop a good relationship with Mr Trump -including inviting him to the Bastille Day military parade in 2017- but has more political similarities to Mr Biden, who like him favours international cooperation on climate change and diplomacy. Joe Biden met members of the Kearney clan at a Louth restaurant in 2016 ""Joe Biden has been a true friend of this nation throughout his life and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead. I also look forward to welcoming him back home when the circumstances allow!"" The president-elect can trace his roots back to County Mayo and County Louth. He has spoken many times about his pride in his heritage and frequently quotes the works of Irish poets. The Irish relatives celebrating Joe Biden's win The leader of Africa's most populous nation and biggest economy said Mr Biden's victory came at a ""time of uncertainty and fear in world affairs"". ""His election is a reminder that democracy is the best form of government because it offers the people the opportunity to change their government by peaceful means,"" Mr Buhari said. He looked forward to greater co-operation with the US ""especially at economic, diplomatic and political levels, including the war against terrorism"", and he urged greater US engagement with Africa as a whole. Describing Mr Biden as ""a friend to our country"", President Kenyatta said his election showed ""Americans' confidence in the leadership credentials of the former vice-president"". Kamala Harris would be a role model who would ""help inspire and embolden millions of young girls across the world to chase and achieve their dreams of greatness and success"". African leaders congratulate Joe Biden ""I congratulate Joe Biden on his election as the next US President & Kamala Harris as Vice President. I know Joe Biden as a strong supporter of our Alliance & look forward to working closely with him. A strong NATO is good for both North America & Europe"" ""We don't want to be suckers anymore,"" Donald Trump once said of the Nato alliance. Throughout his presidency he demanded other members pay their fair share and even considered withdrawing the US. Joe Biden will support a return to defence co-operation, although US requests for greater contributions from allies will likely continue. What does the US do for Nato? ""Together, we have a planet to save from a Climate Emergency and a global economy to build back better from Covid-19. ""Now, more than ever, we need the USA at the helm of these multilateral efforts (and back in the Paris Agreement - ASAP!)"" The Fijian leader congratulated Mr Biden before the White House race had even been called. The reason why is best explained by the reference to ""a climate emergency"" - Fiji is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and while Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accords aimed at limiting global temperature rises, Joe Biden has vowed to bring the country back into the agreement on day one of his presidency. What US election results will mean for climate change ""The situation in the US & what they themselves say about their elections is a spectacle! This is an example of the ugly face of liberal democracy in the US. Regardless of the outcome, one thing is absolutely clear, the definite political, civil, & moral decline of the US regime."" Barack Obama's administration negotiateda landmark nuclear deal with Iran in 2015while Mr Biden served as his vice-president. Mr Trump unilaterally abandoned the agreement, but Mr Biden has said he is considering rejoining it.

"This video can not be played 'The families deserve the U-turn' - Rashford The government is to spend more than Â£400m to support poor children and their families in England, following a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford. A winter grant scheme, to be run by councils, will provide support with food and bills, and a holiday food and activities programme is to be expanded. Rashford said it would improve the lives of almost 1.7 million children. The move represents a climbdown for the government, which had said Universal Credit was the best way to help. From the package of support, a Â£170m ring-fenced fund will be distributed through councils, with at least 80% earmarked for help with food and bills. This will receive funding from the beginning of December until the end of March. The holiday food and activities programme will be expanded with a Â£220m investment to cover Easter, summer and Christmas in 2021. On top of that, there will be a Â£16m cash boost for the nation's food banks. Rashford renews call for an end to child hunger Government changes its mind after Rashford campaign Rashford becomes MBE in birthday honours Rashford: 'No child should be going to bed hungry' Prime Minister Boris Johnson telephoned the Manchester United and England player on Saturday to tell him of the new plans. Speaking after he took part in United's 3-1 Premier League win against Everton, Rashford said: ""Following the game today, I had a good conversation with the prime minister to better understand the proposed plan, and I very much welcome the steps that have been taken to combat child food poverty in the UK."" Rashford said he remained concerned about the children who would miss out on help ""because their family income isn't quite low enough"". However, he added: ""The intent the government have shown today is nothing but positive and they should be recognised for that. ""The steps made today will improve the lives of near 1.7 million children in the UK over the next 12 months, and that can only be celebrated."" Rashford also told the BBC Mr Johnson had agreed to speak with the footballer's child food poverty taskforce. ""I am fully committed to this cause, and I will fight for the rest of my life for it, because in my mind, no child should ever go hungry in the United Kingdom,"" the player said. Seeing the role everyone had played in supporting the most vulnerable children had been ""the greatest moment of my life,"" he added. Rashford's campaign began in June, after the government insisted it would not provide vouchers over the summer holidays for the 1.3 million children in England who were receiving free school meals in term time. The government had previously given this support during the first coronavirus lockdown in April. Rashford's campaignled to the government changing its policyto allow children to claim free meals during the summer holidays. The footballer then called for free meals to be provided over the October half-term, with more than a million people signing a petition he set up. But the government refused, saying enough support was being provided through the benefit system. Last month, it whipped Conservative MPs to vote against a Labour motion in the House of Commons that called for the extension of free school meal provision. This prompted a number of local authorities to say they would continue offering free school meals throughout the week's holiday in spite of that. In October, a Downing Street spokesman said it was ""not for schools to regularly provide food to pupils during the school holidays."" They added: ""We believe the best way to support families outside of term time is through Universal Credit rather than government subsidising meals."" Marcus Rashford has prompted the government to act before. Now he's done it again. It is the second time the prime minister has picked up the phone to the 23-year-old footballer, whose campaign has struck a chord with many, and left many Conservatives acknowledging privately for some time they would have to change tack. Strikingly, Rashford insists this isn't about politics, or criticising Boris Johnson, it's about helping poor families. ""We're not against him. That's the main reason I was happy to talk to him,"" he told BBC Breakfast. But what also stands out is he's moving onto the next strand of his campaign - arguing that more families should get help. Given his success so far, don't bet against him pursuing this pretty doggedly in the months ahead. Announcing the support package, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the government knew it was a challenging time for many, and insisted it had consistently supported the lowest paid families by boosting welfare support. ""We want to make sure vulnerable people are cared for throughout this difficult time and, above all, no one should go hungry or be unable to pay their bills this winter,"" she added. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said Labour had been campaigning for such a change, adding: ""This should have been announced weeks ago to help the children at risk of going hungry over half term."" She added that ministers needed to bring forward a long-term plan to child poverty. England's children's commissioner Anne Longfield welcomed the move but called on ministers to ""go further"" with Universal Credit support by retaining a Â£20 increase. ""Hunger does not take a holiday when schools close and a long-term solution to the growing number of children in poverty is urgently needed,"" she said. Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, who also chairs the End Child Poverty Coalition, said Rashford deserved ""enormous credit for pushing the issue of poverty to the top of the public's agenda"", adding that the government should be acknowledged for ""listening"". James Toop, chief executive, of food charity Bite Back 2030, said: ""It's great that Boris has listened to the voices of our young people who have been campaigning for meal provision through the holidays to be a priority through this crisis."" Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said the scheme was particularly welcome. ""Christmas will not be the same this year - and it is therefore even more important that we ensure that children have food and are kept warm."" Head teachers also welcomed the scheme but questioned why it could not have been in place for October's half term. Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders' union the NAHT, said while the expansion of the activities programme was a positive move, it ""falls short in addressing fully the issue of holiday hunger"". He added: ""We would question whether provision of food to those going hungry should be dependent upon them attending an activity, which for a whole host of reasons might not be suitable, available or accessible for particular groups."" The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the winter grant would help them find the best way to help families and individuals most in need, but called on the government to ""adequately fund councils so they can provide wider long-term preventative support to all households who need it"".

"This video can not be played UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""There's far more that unites us than divides us"" Boris Johnson has said there is ""more that unites than divides"" him and Joe Biden as he pledged to work together to defend ""common values and interests"". The UK prime minister told broadcasters he and the US president-elect shared a belief in democracy, human rights, free speech and free trade. He also welcomed the ""real prospect"" of the US now showing ""global leadership"" on climate change. Mr Biden's allies have meanwhile sought to smooth over Brexit differences. Senator Chris Coons, who is tipped to become secretary of state in the Biden administration, said the election was an opportunity ""to jump start a new chapter"" in transatlantic relations. Asked about Mr Biden's opposition to Brexit when he was Barack Obama's vice-president and his subsequent criticism of Mr Johnson, he said he expected there to be some ""reconsideration of whatever comments may have been made about the moment of Brexit"" in the coming weeks and months. Following Mr Biden's victory, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would ""listen carefully"" to US concerns about the impact of the UK's departure from the EU on stability on the island of Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement. Johnson congratulates Biden on US election win Biden vows to 'unify' country in victory speech 'Let's work together!' World reacts to Biden win Mr Biden has vowed to unify the US after he was declared the winner of the presidential election on Saturday. The Republican incumbent, President Donald Trump, who is a strong supporter of Brexit, has yet to concede defeat and is taking legal action in a number of states, alleging voting irregularities. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the UK had always had faith in the integrity of the US electoral system to produce a ""clear"" outcome, which he said it had now done. ""We want to avoid getting sucked into domestic American politics but it is very clear now, in our view, that there is a definitive result,"" he said. He said the British embassy in Washington had been in touch with the Biden campaign and he believed the president-elect and Mr Johnson, who have never met before, would speak in ""due course"". This video can not be played Dominic Raab said the UK government is ""excited"" to collaborate with the US, following comments from Senator Chris Coons Mr Johnson used his interview to reaffirm the importance of the relationship between the two countries, saying he and the new president had ""crucial stuff"" to get on with. ""The United States is our closest and most important ally, and that has been the case president after president, prime minister after prime minister - it won't change,"" he said. ""I think there is far more that unites the government of this country and governments in Washington at any time and any stage than divides us. ""We have common values, we have common interests, we have common global perspective. There is a huge amount of work we need to do together to protect those values."" Mr Johnson signalled that he hoped Mr Biden's victory would mark a big shift in US policy on climate change, Mr Trump having taken the country out of the Paris Climate Accord. ""I think now with President Biden in the White House in Washington we have the real prospect of American global leadership in tackling climate change,"" he said. The UK and US are currently seeking to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement, against a backdrop of historic tensions with senior Democrats in Congress over Brexit and its impact on Northern Ireland. Mr Biden has warned that the 1998 Good Friday Agreement must ""not be a casualty"" of Brexit and expressed concerns about the UK government's attempt to pass legislation that would give it the power to override aspects of the EU Withdrawal Agreement with regard to Northern Ireland. The election of Joe Biden leaves Boris Johnson facing a substantial diplomatic repair job. The two men have never met. Last December the president-elect described the prime minister as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Donald Trump. There are people around Mr Biden who remember bitterly how Mr Johnson once suggested President Obama harboured anti-British sentiment because of his part-Kenyan ancestry. Mr Biden and his team think Brexit is a historic mistake. They would not want Britain to leave the EU without a trade deal, particularly if it involved breaking commitments made in the Northern Ireland protocol. Read James' full analysis Mr Johnson has expressed his belief that the UK will be able to secure mutually beneficial trade agreements with both the US and the EU, its two largest partners. But he has also signalled that he will now bow to pressure from the EU to re-write the Internal Market Bill, which is due to be voted on in the Lords on Monday, to take out controversial clauses ""The whole point of the Internal Market Bill... is to protect and uphold the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""That is one of the things that we're united on with our friends in the White House."" Asked about Mr Trump's continued claims that he had won the election, the foreign secretary said the UK and other foreign countries must be careful not to be seen to be seeking to interfere in the election or its aftermath. He added: ""I am sure Donald Trump and his team will reflect on where they lie."" California's fire death toll doubles as chaos grips LA What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Wales has seen almost 7,000 new Covid cases in the last seven days Wales is starting to see a ""levelling off"" of Covid-19 case rates, the country's health minister has said on the final day of its 17-day lockdown. Vaughan Gething also saidmass testing, as beingtrialled in Liverpool, will be considered in Wales' high case rate areas likeMerthyr and the valleys. He said the full impact of the lockdown would not be seen for two weeks yet. Opposition parties have suggested high case rate areas should have stricter local rules. Wales' lockdown- which the Welsh Government said would help stop the health service in Wales becoming ""overwhelmed"" - ends on Monday just a few days afterEngland's four-week lockdownstarted. The number of patients in Welsh hospitals with coronavirus is now the highest since the height of the pandemic in April. Latest NHS Wales figures show 1,344 people are being treated in hospital for Covid-19 while 54 of the 163 critical care patients have the virus - with the intensive care occupancy rate beyond Wales' usual 152-bed capacity. Mr Gething warned cancer, heart and stroke ""treatments"" could be affected if Covid infection rates surge again. But he said: ""We think we're starting to see a plateauing, a levelling off, in the rates of coronavirus across the country. ""It's still at a high rate which means that there's still a reservoir of coronavirus within our communities."" What can you do after Wales' firebreak ends? Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? How many Covid-19 deaths and cases in Wales? The Welsh Conservatives want ""local measures"" to help slow down Covid-19 cases in communities to avoid ""such draconian measures as a firebreak lockdown or just a straight lockdown"". ""We would also then have targeted testing in areas where we know there's high infection rates to suppress the virus,"" their health spokesperson Andrew RT Daviestold BBC Radio Wales. And Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government should show it ""has a plan in place"" to deal with areas of high infection rates. ""I doubt whether it is right to treat those areas in the same way as we treat some of the areas with very low incidence,"" said the party's health spokesperson Rhun ap Iorwerth. But Mr Gething said: ""If we breach trust with the public and extend the end of the firebreak, having been clear it would come to an end, I don't think people would be prepared to trust the government again and go along with what we want people to do."" He thanked the people of Wales for their sacrifice during the lockdown, saying: ""We have seen significant reductions in movement, we're confident there's been a reduction in household contact and all of those things will make a difference. ""What I can't do is rule out what we will have to do in the future because that is down to the choices we make."" Whilepubs, bars and restaurants, gyms, and other non-essential businesseswill be allowed to reopen on Monday, Mr Gething urged people toreduce contact and time spent with peopleoutside their household bubble. ""We don't want to throw away what we think we have gained in the firebreak,"" said Mr Gething. ""If we go back to the way the things were before the firebreak, we'd have thrown away all of the  sacrifice put together to make the firebreak successful and that would be heart-breaking for so many people who have done the right thing."" This video can not be played Watch how cases of Covid-19 have changed across Wales during the firebreak Mr Gething warned that if infections surge again ""hospitals will become full"" then elective surgeries and other ""non-Covid care"" which was relatively unaffected during this latest lockdown, may be hit. ""It will mean people will be treated in an undignified way, it's about saving as many lives as possible,"" he said. ""It's to make sure the NHS isn't overwhelmed because, if that happens, then non-Covid care like cancer care, heart, stroke and all of those other treatments will be affected."" Wales has seen almost 7,000 coronavirus cases in the last seven days and thedeath toll is now more than 2,000 peoplesince the pandemic began. While Office for National Statistics data suggestsCovid-19 cases are ""stabilising"" across Wales and the UK, Mr Gething has said the effectiveness of the lockdown may not be known for another few weeks. ""The infection rates we see reported today reflect behaviour from two to three weeks ago,"" he said. ""That's how long it takes to feed through. We think we will see a dip in the next two to three weeks but we're cautious as we need to see what the evidence is."" Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent have some of the worst Covid-19 infection rates in the UK and, amid calls from Plaid Cymru for widespread testing in high case rate areas, Mr Gething says the Welsh Government was ""considering"" mass testing. ""Liverpool is a test pilot for the UK,"" he said. ""We are looking at what might be possible here in Wales to go alongside how we can use our testing resources here."" Mr Gething said the Welsh Government would ""formally review"" the coronavirus data from across Wales in two weeks' time. The people of Wales have beenwarned to expect another lockdown in the new yearas First Minister Mark Drakeford has said there was a ""path through to Christmas"" without needing another ""firebreak"". ""If we avoid contact with other people and we travel only when we need to, work from home wherever we can, we will build on what has been achieved here over the last 17 days,"" Mark Drakeford told Sky News. ""That will give us a path through to Christmas without needing to go back into this extraordinary period of restriction."" Mr Drakeford has called on the UK government to make good on its promise for the four nations to meet this week and discuss a single approach to ""pool ideas, plan together and have a common approach to the Christmas period"". ""The restrictions people have had to live with are incredibly difficult and demanding, and everybody is tired and fatigued of coronavirus,"" he said.

"Just Park is an app that allows land owners to rent out their driveways as parking spaces A parking website has apologised after scammers exploited it by listing spaces on driveways which they do not own. Just Park is one of several websites which allow people to make money by advertising parking spaces for hire on their own land. But some homeowners have been surprised to discover their driveways have been listed without their permission. Just Park says it has stringent checks in place to prevent fraud and cases are ""extremely rare"". Simon Gallagher started getting complaints from tenants at the flat he owns at Bexleyheath in Greater London. Strangers were leaving cars in their dedicated parking bays, leaving them with nowhere to park. ""This was going on for about a month or so"", says Simon, ""until one day somebody had left a note in the window of one of the cars that was parked there with a booking reference for Just Park"". ""I looked it up on the website and to my surprise, found a photograph of the flat advertised out for rent"". Someone was charging Â£8 a day for the use of his tenants' parking spaces. To prevent them from being used by anyone else, he has now had bollards installed. Simon Gallagher, a landlord, had to install bollards in the driveway of a flat he owns after scammers rented out his tenants' driveway to commuters to park in In Edinburgh, Barbara Oliver was alerted by a neighbour to a similar problem outside her property. She was away on holiday when mystery vehicles began parking right in front of her garage door. ""It appeared that these people had used Just Park and had information to say that they could park there, which, as the property's owner, I knew was not true"", Barbara says. Just Park removed the unauthorised adverts after Barbara Oliver and Simon Gallagher complained. Speaking on Radio 4's You & Yours programme, the company's founder and chief executive officer, Anthony Eskinazi, said ""I'd like to apologise to Mrs Oliver and Mr Gallagher for their experiences. 'We do have stringent checks in place to prevent spaces from being listed fraudulently. On rare occasions where they are added, we immediately remove them once notified and ensure that our community is not adversely affected"". Just Park says its policies and procedures have successfully reduced instances of fraud to ""less than two listings per month, which represents less than one out of every 1000 new listings"". It says that new space owners cannot withdraw funds for at least 48 hours after the first booking. The company was launched in 2006, matching drivers with spare parking spaces outside people's homes through its website and app. It says over 45,000 people have earned a combined total of more than Â£50m by listing spare parking spaces on its platform.

"This video can not be played UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""There's far more that unites us than divides us"" Boris Johnson has said there is ""more that unites than divides"" him and Joe Biden as he pledged to work together to defend ""common values and interests"". The UK prime minister told broadcasters he and the US president-elect shared a belief in democracy, human rights, free speech and free trade. He also welcomed the ""real prospect"" of the US now showing ""global leadership"" on climate change. Mr Biden's allies have meanwhile sought to smooth over Brexit differences. Senator Chris Coons, who is tipped to become secretary of state in the Biden administration, said the election was an opportunity ""to jump start a new chapter"" in transatlantic relations. Asked about Mr Biden's opposition to Brexit when he was Barack Obama's vice-president and his subsequent criticism of Mr Johnson, he said he expected there to be some ""reconsideration of whatever comments may have been made about the moment of Brexit"" in the coming weeks and months. Following Mr Biden's victory, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would ""listen carefully"" to US concerns about the impact of the UK's departure from the EU on stability on the island of Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement. Johnson congratulates Biden on US election win Biden vows to 'unify' country in victory speech 'Let's work together!' World reacts to Biden win Mr Biden has vowed to unify the US after he was declared the winner of the presidential election on Saturday. The Republican incumbent, President Donald Trump, who is a strong supporter of Brexit, has yet to concede defeat and is taking legal action in a number of states, alleging voting irregularities. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the UK had always had faith in the integrity of the US electoral system to produce a ""clear"" outcome, which he said it had now done. ""We want to avoid getting sucked into domestic American politics but it is very clear now, in our view, that there is a definitive result,"" he said. He said the British embassy in Washington had been in touch with the Biden campaign and he believed the president-elect and Mr Johnson, who have never met before, would speak in ""due course"". This video can not be played Dominic Raab said the UK government is ""excited"" to collaborate with the US, following comments from Senator Chris Coons Mr Johnson used his interview to reaffirm the importance of the relationship between the two countries, saying he and the new president had ""crucial stuff"" to get on with. ""The United States is our closest and most important ally, and that has been the case president after president, prime minister after prime minister - it won't change,"" he said. ""I think there is far more that unites the government of this country and governments in Washington at any time and any stage than divides us. ""We have common values, we have common interests, we have common global perspective. There is a huge amount of work we need to do together to protect those values."" Mr Johnson signalled that he hoped Mr Biden's victory would mark a big shift in US policy on climate change, Mr Trump having taken the country out of the Paris Climate Accord. ""I think now with President Biden in the White House in Washington we have the real prospect of American global leadership in tackling climate change,"" he said. The UK and US are currently seeking to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement, against a backdrop of historic tensions with senior Democrats in Congress over Brexit and its impact on Northern Ireland. Mr Biden has warned that the 1998 Good Friday Agreement must ""not be a casualty"" of Brexit and expressed concerns about the UK government's attempt to pass legislation that would give it the power to override aspects of the EU Withdrawal Agreement with regard to Northern Ireland. The election of Joe Biden leaves Boris Johnson facing a substantial diplomatic repair job. The two men have never met. Last December the president-elect described the prime minister as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Donald Trump. There are people around Mr Biden who remember bitterly how Mr Johnson once suggested President Obama harboured anti-British sentiment because of his part-Kenyan ancestry. Mr Biden and his team think Brexit is a historic mistake. They would not want Britain to leave the EU without a trade deal, particularly if it involved breaking commitments made in the Northern Ireland protocol. Read James' full analysis Mr Johnson has expressed his belief that the UK will be able to secure mutually beneficial trade agreements with both the US and the EU, its two largest partners. But he has also signalled that he will now bow to pressure from the EU to re-write the Internal Market Bill, which is due to be voted on in the Lords on Monday, to take out controversial clauses ""The whole point of the Internal Market Bill... is to protect and uphold the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""That is one of the things that we're united on with our friends in the White House."" Asked about Mr Trump's continued claims that he had won the election, the foreign secretary said the UK and other foreign countries must be careful not to be seen to be seeking to interfere in the election or its aftermath. He added: ""I am sure Donald Trump and his team will reflect on where they lie."" California's fire death toll doubles as chaos grips LA What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader. ""He wants to bring people together, both within the United States of America where he's already talking about unifying the country,"" he says. ""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

"This video can not be played Socially-distanced events have taken place across the UK, including at the Cenotaph in London The Queen has led the nation in marking Remembrance Sunday, as people around the UK privately paid their respects at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. She was joined by family members and the PM at the scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed off to the public for the first time. Following a two-minute silence, wreaths were laid by Prince Charles, Prince William and the PM, among others. The commemorations remember the armed forces community, British and Commonwealth veterans, the allies who fought alongside the UK and the civilian servicemen and women involved in the two world wars and later conflicts. Normally, Whitehall is packed with thousands of veterans and members of the military for the commemorations, but on Sunday less than 30 veterans were in attendance. The Queen, dressed in a black hat and coat, looked on from a balcony at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office building, as her son, the Prince of Wales, laid a wreath on her behalf. Others who took part in the wreath laying included the Duke of Cambridge, the Princess Royal and Earl of Wessex, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer. Also present at the service were former UK prime ministers Theresa May, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Sir John Major. In pictures: How the UK marked Remembrance Sunday The Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge attended the service Prime Minister Boris Johnson was joined by former leaders Theresa May, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Sir John Major Prince Charles laid a wreath on behalf of the Queen Prince William was also among those who laid a wreath It felt the same on Whitehall this year, but also really quite different. At the heart of the ceremony, as ever, was the Cenotaph - the simple stone memorial to the dead of so many conflicts, unveiled a century ago by George V, overlooked on Sunday by the Queen on a Foreign Office balcony. There was the familiar and always-moving grandeur of the two-minute silence, the wreath laying, the solemn contemplation of so much sacrifice and loss. But missing were the members of the public who normally travel from all over the country to be here, who stand three or four-deep along the barriers that line either side of Whitehall. Missing too were the great number of military veterans who march past the Cenotaph after the wreath-laying. The public and the veterans bring life to this commemoration of loss - they ground this remembrance and make it more personal, more sharply felt. Remembrance Sunday belongs to those who gave - their lives, their health, their loved ones. Everyone here in Whitehall will hope that next year will see the public and military veterans return. Members of the Royal Navy marched down Whitehall ahead of the Remembrance Sunday service The Duke of Sussex, who stepped down as a working member of the Royal Family and now lives in California, was not at the ceremony but spoke about what serving his country means to him. In a podcast to mark Remembrance Sunday, Harry, who spent 10 years in the armed forces, said: ""Being able to wear my uniform, being able to stand up in service of one's country, these are amongst the greatest honours there are in life. ""To me, the uniform is a symbol of something much bigger, it's symbolic of our commitment to protecting our country, as well as protecting our values. ""These values are put in action through service, and service is what happens in the quiet and in the chaos."" General Sir Nick Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, said some veterans might find Remembrance Sunday a lonely experience this year due to the Covid-19 restrictions. Sir Nick told the BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the guidelines would be ""particularly tough on our veterans"", adding: ""They traditionally have had the opportunity to get together and talk about their memories and their reflections, but equally to strut their stuff."" Usually, about 10,000 people gather at the Cenotaph in Whitehall for the remembrance service. But with the event being closed to the public, the Royal British Legion and Legion Scotland advised people to observe the silence in honour of those who lost their lives in conflicts from their doorsteps. The public was also encouraged to share family histories and messages of remembrance online using the hashtag #WeWillRememberThem.

Speaking at Saturday's annual Festival of Remembrance at London's Royal Albert Hall, which was pre-recorded and filmed without an audience, the Prince of Wales said the country had endured ""anxiety and grief not previously experienced in peacetime"". ""In this challenging year, we have perhaps come to realise that the freedoms for which they fought are more precious than we knew, and that the debt we owe them is even greater than we imagined,"" he said.

"Traditional remembrance events at local war memorials are held across Scotland every Remembrance Sunday. Many of those taking part will be wearing poppies - more than 100 years after the tradition started. They're not all the same, though. So what's different about the Scottish poppy? The Scottish poppy, left, has four-lobed petals and no leaf, while the poppy used in the rest of the UK has two and sometimes a leaf The Scottish poppy has the same recognisable blood red colour, but it has four-lobed petals and no leaf. That is in contrast to the poppy used in the rest of the UK, which has two petals and sometimes sports a green leaf. Poppies sold in Scotland are made at Lady Haig's poppy factory in Edinburgh. When it was founded back in 1926, it introduced a different style of poppy - designed by Lady Haig - and has stuck to it ever since. Poppyscotland, which raises money to support armed forces north of the border, also said it would be ""botanically incorrect"" to add a leaf. Davy Adamson, who served for 23 years with the Royal Highland Fusiliers, works at Lady Haig's factory making wreaths They were traditionally made by veterans. A team of 33 veterans - all with disabilities and vulnerabilities - are still working at the poppy factory. They have served in conflicts from Northern Ireland in the 1970s to the war in Afghanistan and subsequent operations. But this year they have been performing tasks other than making poppies, including assembling wreaths. That's because, for the second year, all the poppies are now plastic-free and are made with a machine. Poppyscotland has produced two million for this year's appeal, and 50% of the material used is made from recycled coffee cups. The green plastic stem and black button in the centre of the poppy have been done away with to reduce plastic waste. By 2026, these new-style poppies will have completely replaced the plastic and paper ones that we've been used to in the past. The poppy as a symbol of remembrance was started by the American humanitarian Moina Michael, who was inspired by Lt Colonel John McCrae's poemIn Flanders Fields,externaldescribing the small plants growing on the graves of soldiers buried in northern France and Belgium during World War One. She began the poppy wearing and others soon followed. However, after the first Poppy Appeal in 1921, demand for the simple symbol could not be fulfilled north of the border. So, in 1926, Lady Haig - wife of Field Marshal Earl Haig - decided to open apoppy-making factory in Edinburgh,externalwhich would be staffed by a team of disabled war veterans. Volunteers sell the poppies for charity The poppies made at the Lady Haig poppy factory are distributed across the country. This year, that includes: Two million new-style poppies (there are also a surplus of the old-style poppy still in circulation) 38,000 wreaths For the rest of the UK, the Royal British Legion produces about 40 million poppies annually. No, fundraisers produce all kinds of poppy-related merchandise, including wreaths, brooches, umbrellas, diaries and T-shirts. The idea to branch out came in the very early days. In 1928 Lady Haig decided the Edinburgh factory should expand into hand-crafted goods, including stuffed toys and jigsaw puzzles. Today, fundraisers raise money in similar ways to other charities - everything from bake sales to bungee jumps are undertaken. Poppyscotland is part of the Royal British Legion group of charities. The British Legion operates across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Poppyscotland operates as a distinct charity north of the border - and all money raised in Scotland is spent here.

"This video can not be played Socially-distanced events have taken place across the UK, including at the Cenotaph in London The Queen has led the nation in marking Remembrance Sunday, as people around the UK privately paid their respects at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. She was joined by family members and the PM at the scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed off to the public for the first time. Following a two-minute silence, wreaths were laid by Prince Charles, Prince William and the PM, among others. The commemorations remember the armed forces community, British and Commonwealth veterans, the allies who fought alongside the UK and the civilian servicemen and women involved in the two world wars and later conflicts. Normally, Whitehall is packed with thousands of veterans and members of the military for the commemorations, but on Sunday less than 30 veterans were in attendance. The Queen, dressed in a black hat and coat, looked on from a balcony at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office building, as her son, the Prince of Wales, laid a wreath on her behalf. Others who took part in the wreath laying included the Duke of Cambridge, the Princess Royal and Earl of Wessex, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer. Also present at the service were former UK prime ministers Theresa May, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Sir John Major. In pictures: How the UK marked Remembrance Sunday The Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge attended the service Prime Minister Boris Johnson was joined by former leaders Theresa May, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Sir John Major Prince Charles laid a wreath on behalf of the Queen Prince William was also among those who laid a wreath It felt the same on Whitehall this year, but also really quite different. At the heart of the ceremony, as ever, was the Cenotaph - the simple stone memorial to the dead of so many conflicts, unveiled a century ago by George V, overlooked on Sunday by the Queen on a Foreign Office balcony. There was the familiar and always-moving grandeur of the two-minute silence, the wreath laying, the solemn contemplation of so much sacrifice and loss. But missing were the members of the public who normally travel from all over the country to be here, who stand three or four-deep along the barriers that line either side of Whitehall. Missing too were the great number of military veterans who march past the Cenotaph after the wreath-laying. The public and the veterans bring life to this commemoration of loss - they ground this remembrance and make it more personal, more sharply felt. Remembrance Sunday belongs to those who gave - their lives, their health, their loved ones. Everyone here in Whitehall will hope that next year will see the public and military veterans return. Members of the Royal Navy marched down Whitehall ahead of the Remembrance Sunday service The Duke of Sussex, who stepped down as a working member of the Royal Family and now lives in California, was not at the ceremony but spoke about what serving his country means to him. In a podcast to mark Remembrance Sunday, Harry, who spent 10 years in the armed forces, said: ""Being able to wear my uniform, being able to stand up in service of one's country, these are amongst the greatest honours there are in life. ""To me, the uniform is a symbol of something much bigger, it's symbolic of our commitment to protecting our country, as well as protecting our values. ""These values are put in action through service, and service is what happens in the quiet and in the chaos."" General Sir Nick Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, said some veterans might find Remembrance Sunday a lonely experience this year due to the Covid-19 restrictions. Sir Nick told the BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the guidelines would be ""particularly tough on our veterans"", adding: ""They traditionally have had the opportunity to get together and talk about their memories and their reflections, but equally to strut their stuff."" Usually, about 10,000 people gather at the Cenotaph in Whitehall for the remembrance service. But with the event being closed to the public, the Royal British Legion and Legion Scotland advised people to observe the silence in honour of those who lost their lives in conflicts from their doorsteps. The public was also encouraged to share family histories and messages of remembrance online using the hashtag #WeWillRememberThem.

Speaking at Saturday's annual Festival of Remembrance at London's Royal Albert Hall, which was pre-recorded and filmed without an audience, the Prince of Wales said the country had endured ""anxiety and grief not previously experienced in peacetime"". ""In this challenging year, we have perhaps come to realise that the freedoms for which they fought are more precious than we knew, and that the debt we owe them is even greater than we imagined,"" he said.

She was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time during the visit. The 94-year-old monarch had requested the private pilgrimage after she was advised not to attend the warrior's centenary service next week.

"This video can not be played Biden and Harris call for unity in victory speeches Joe Biden has said it is ""time to heal"" the US in his first speech as president-elect, vowing ""not to divide but to unify"" the country. ""Let's give each other a chance,"" he said at an event in Delaware addressing those who did not vote for him. Mr Biden defeated incumbent President Donald Trump following a cliff-hanger vote count after Tuesday's election. Mr Trump has yet to concede and has not spoken publicly since his defeat was announced while he was playing golf. Follow all the latest live updates Being with Trump the day he lost the election Joe Biden and a life in politics Election results in maps and charts The result makes Mr Trump the first one-term president since the 1990s. His campaign has filed a barrage of lawsuits in various states but election officials say there is no evidence that the vote was rigged against him, as he has said. Spontaneous celebrations erupted in major cities after media outlets announced Mr Biden's victory on Saturday. Disappointed Trump supporters demonstrated in some cities but there were no reports of incidents. Addressing cheering supporters in a car park in his hometown of Wilmington, Mr Biden said: ""I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but to unify; who doesn't see red states and blue states, only sees the United States."" Mr Biden - who has won more than 74 million votes so far, the most ever for a US presidential candidate - hailed the ""diverse"" support he gathered during the campaign, and thanked African-American voters in particular. But he also reached out to Trump supporters directly. ""It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again,"" Mr Biden said, without mentioning his rival in the election. ""And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies."" Supporters gathered in Wilmington for Mr Biden's speech The president-elect, who arrived on stage wearing a face mask, announced that he would form his coronavirus response committee to ensure it is ready to implement decisions from his inauguration day in January, because ""that's the only way we can get back to living"". The Trump administration's response to the pandemic was at the centre of the presidential campaign, and drew heavy criticism from Mr Biden, who said his plan would be ""built on bedrock science"". The US has reported more than 237,000 deaths, the most of any country. Mr Biden was introduced by his running mate, Kamala Harris, who is about to become the first female vice-president in the country's history. She will also be the first black and first Asian-American vice-president when she takes office, following a year that has seen nationwide protests on the issue of racial injustice. Ms Harris paid tribute to her late mother, an Indian immigrant to the US, and the other generations of black, Asian, white, Latina, and native women who had ""paved the way for this moment tonight"". This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? ""While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,"" she added. Reflecting on the election campaign, she told supporters: ""When our very democracy was on the ballot in this election, the very soul of America at stake and with the whole world watching, you ushered in a new day for America."" She added: ""You chose hope and unity, decency, science and yes, truth - you chose Joe Biden as the next president of the United States. And the road ahead will not be easy but America is ready, and so are Joe and I."" In an earlier time, Joe Biden's victory speech would have seemed fairly routine. The president-elect spoke of unity, of ending acrimony, of the potential and power of the American people. Those are sentiments many a winning politician have touched on in the past. Coming on the heels of Donald Trump's presidency, however, they mark a sharp contrast. The president Mr Biden will replace was one who was often criticised for stoking cultural divisions and doing little to tamp down the unrest that broke out in many US cities earlier this year. Mr Biden spoke of his election being an ""inflection point"" that would allow the American people to make a decision about ""who we are and who we want to be"". As Saturday night's speech demonstrated, at the very least, the Biden presidency will mark a change in presidential rhetoric. The American people have a president-elect who talks about bringing the country together; about being a leader for all the people. Saying it is the easy part; now he has to do it. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" The BBC projected Mr Biden's victory on Saturday, after gains in the key battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Nevada propelled him over the 270 electoral college vote threshold required to clinch the White House. This prediction is based on the unofficial results from states that have already finished counting their votes, and the expected results from states like Wisconsin where the count is continuing. Mr Trump has not spoken in public since the numbers were announced, but he repeated previous claims of voter fraud in a tweet, which Twitter soon marked as a ""disputed"" claim. The Trump campaign has indicated their candidate does not plan to concede. President Trump appeared subdued as he returned to the White House on Saturday After Mr Biden was projected to win Mr Trump remained defiant, saying Mr Biden was ""falsely posing as the winner"" and insisting the election was ""far from over"". The president took more than 70 million votes, the second-highest tally in history. The response from senior Republicans has been muted. Republican Party Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted that ""the media doesn't decide who wins elections, voters do"". But Senator Mitt Romney, a critic of Mr Trump, congratulated Mr Biden and Ms Harris. He said he and his wife ""know both of them as people of good will and admirable character"". Mr Trump has vowed to contest the election results on several fronts. A recount will be held in Georgia, where the margins are tight, and Mr Trump wants the same in Wisconsin. He has also vowed to take legal action to the Supreme Court, alleging voting fraud without evidence. If the election result is challenged, it would require legal teams to challenge this in the state courts. State judges would then need to uphold the challenge and order a recount, and Supreme Court justices could then be asked to overturn a ruling. On Saturday, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit over ballots cast on election day in Arizona that it claims were incorrectly rejected. Arizona's secretary of state, however, said in a statement that the case was ""grasping at straws"". Read more: Could the election be decided in courts? 'Let's work together!' - How world reacted to Biden win 'We in Africa are proud of her success' Five questions for Biden on the economy Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? Meanwhile, votes in some states are continuing to be counted and results are never official until final certification, which occurs in each state in the weeks following the election. This must be done before 538 chosen officials (electors) from the Electoral College - which officially decides who wins the election - meet in their state capitals to vote on 14 December. The electors' votes usually mirror the popular vote in each state. However, in some states this is not a formal requirement. The president's supporters have continued to hold rallies The new president is officially sworn into office on 20 January after a transition period to give them time to appoint cabinet ministers and make plans. The handover of power takes place at a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC. After the ceremony, the new president makes their way to the White House to begin their four-year term in office. Mr Biden, who will be 78 when he takes office, making him the oldest first-term president in American history, ran for the White House twice before. In 1988 he withdrew from the race after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British Labour Party, Neil Kinnock. In 2008, he tried again to get the Democratic nomination before dropping out and joining Barack Obama's ticket. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career His eight years as vice-president allowed him to lay claim to much of Mr Obama's legacy, including passage of the Affordable Care Act. The six-term senator from Delaware was first elected in 1972. Early in his career, he sided with southern segregationists in opposing court-ordered school bussing to racially integrate public schools. He was also a fierce advocate of a 1994 anti-crime bill that many on the left now say encouraged lengthy sentences and mass incarceration. Most Americans know that Joe Biden's life has been marked by personal tragedy - experiences he often refers to. In 1972, he lost his first wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, in a car accident. He famously took the oath of office for his first Senate term from the hospital room of his toddler sons Beau and Hunter, who both survived the accident. In 2015, Beau died of brain cancer at the age of 46, and Joe Biden said this played a role in his decision not to run for president in 2016.

"Many people who were shielding earlier in the pandemic continue to take extra care Shielding alone earlier in the Covid pandemic felt like ""a slippery slope to the grave"" for 60-year-old Margaret. New figures show that, of the 121,000 households shielding in Wales in July, more than half consisted of one person living alone like her. Age Cymru said older people had endured a particularly hard time and a ""concerted effort"" was needed to ensure support was in place for the winter. The Welsh Government has been asked to comment. From the start of the pandemic to16 August, tens of thousands of people in Wales with underlying health conditions were advised to stay indoors to protect themselves. And while Wales is set to exit a 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown on Monday, many vulnerable people will continue to isolate or take extra care in order to avoid contracting Covid-19. 'I felt excluded' As people began to return to normal after the first lockdown, Margaret, from Pembrokeshire, was left feeling more shut out than ever. She initially started shielding because she had lupus - a long-term autoimmune condition that causes joint pain, skin rashes and tiredness which can lead to the breakdown of cells. ""Some of the community spirit dropped away as people went back to their normal lives after the first lockdown ended. I felt excluded then,"" she said. Is Wales coming out of lockdown too early? Do people still have to shield? Shielding ends but hugging child 'could kill dad' ""Sometimes on social media, or out on a walk, I would see that people I knew had been somewhere together and I hadn't been invited. ""They would say things like, 'we know you like to keep away from people' - which is not true, but I suppose they thought I was excluding myself."" She has not seen her son for more than a year and worries the young children in the family will not remember her. ""I feel as though I have been in limbo for a year. I was 60 at the end of 2019 and planned to have a year of celebration with road trips to see my family and a summer party,"" she said. ""Sixty is not old but staying at home all the time on my own, talking to myself and not going out, especially as the winter is coming on, feels like a slippery slope to the grave."" Margaret said she felt there was even negativity among some people who believed those isolating after the shielding had paused were causing an impact on the economy. Age Cymru's chief executive Victoria Lloyd said many older people were already suffering with loneliness and isolation before, but the pandemic had ""compounded the situation"". ""With winter coming we need a concerted effort to make sure that we have the right systems and support in place for older people, particularly those who may find themselves shielding for a period of time."" She said protected shopping slots, prescription deliveries and full access to health and social care were all issues that need to be resolved if there were further lockdowns. ""We would also urge local communities to continue to look after their older families and neighbours by keeping in touch with them and offering support and reassurance during difficult times,"" she added. ""We very much welcomed the support of volunteers during the first lockdown."" Shielding guidance,externalhas not changed since it was paused on 16 August, despite the rise in coronavirus cases since the autumn. The Welsh Government has said it did not want those most at risk to go back to measures expected of them earlier in the summer because of the potential negative effects on people's mental health. The chief medical officer for Wales wrote to those on the shielding patients list to say ""you do not need to restart shielding but you should take extra care"". This means people should follow the same rules as everyone else, but take extra care in regularly washing hands, keeping contacts to a minimum and shopping online. Welsh Government data shows there were about 44,000 more people above 50 shielding than 18 to 29-year-olds. But Lucy Dixon, from Newcastle Emlyn in Carmarthenshire, said she too felt the impact of loneliness when shielding alone. The 28-year-old said: ""I'm really sociable, so it's really lonely. ""I said to myself all along that this [coronavirus] is at least for the next year, if not a couple of years. ""I told myself that because I thought if I set myself up to believe that it would be shorter than that, I would be really upset and disappointed."" Lucy Dixon has chosen to continue shielding alone Ms Dixon has Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), a rare disease which often leads to permanent lung damage, which means she is ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" and was advised to shield by the government. She has chosen to continue shielding alone due to the seriousness of her condition. But she started shielding at her parents' home in mid-March before she received any guidance. ""My parents put a bookcase in this archway that leads from one room to another, so I was fortunate to have a self-contained space,"" she said. ""It was tough. I cooked for the first couple of months on an electric, portable hob - it was just pasta and rice - and we ended up getting government food boxes for a while because it was so hard to get delivery slots."" Shielding advice in Wales 'has not changed' Coronavirus: What effect has lockdown had on loneliness? 'Living on my own has been a very lonely time' Despite being on the other side of the wall from her parents, the only time Ms Dixon saw them for the first couple of months was through a window, until the weather got better. She said she wasn't working at the time, because of her health, so ""all I was doing was just reading these horrific stories thinking 'I'm going to die if I get this'"". ""I don't feel like that now, but I did at the time,"" Ms Dixon said. She added she is taking things day-by-day and making the most of her ""new life"" for now.

"This video can not be played UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""There's far more that unites us than divides us"" Boris Johnson has said there is ""more that unites than divides"" him and Joe Biden as he pledged to work together to defend ""common values and interests"". The UK prime minister told broadcasters he and the US president-elect shared a belief in democracy, human rights, free speech and free trade. He also welcomed the ""real prospect"" of the US now showing ""global leadership"" on climate change. Mr Biden's allies have meanwhile sought to smooth over Brexit differences. Senator Chris Coons, who is tipped to become secretary of state in the Biden administration, said the election was an opportunity ""to jump start a new chapter"" in transatlantic relations. Asked about Mr Biden's opposition to Brexit when he was Barack Obama's vice-president and his subsequent criticism of Mr Johnson, he said he expected there to be some ""reconsideration of whatever comments may have been made about the moment of Brexit"" in the coming weeks and months. Following Mr Biden's victory, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would ""listen carefully"" to US concerns about the impact of the UK's departure from the EU on stability on the island of Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement. Johnson congratulates Biden on US election win Biden vows to 'unify' country in victory speech 'Let's work together!' World reacts to Biden win Mr Biden has vowed to unify the US after he was declared the winner of the presidential election on Saturday. The Republican incumbent, President Donald Trump, who is a strong supporter of Brexit, has yet to concede defeat and is taking legal action in a number of states, alleging voting irregularities. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the UK had always had faith in the integrity of the US electoral system to produce a ""clear"" outcome, which he said it had now done. ""We want to avoid getting sucked into domestic American politics but it is very clear now, in our view, that there is a definitive result,"" he said. He said the British embassy in Washington had been in touch with the Biden campaign and he believed the president-elect and Mr Johnson, who have never met before, would speak in ""due course"". This video can not be played Dominic Raab said the UK government is ""excited"" to collaborate with the US, following comments from Senator Chris Coons Mr Johnson used his interview to reaffirm the importance of the relationship between the two countries, saying he and the new president had ""crucial stuff"" to get on with. ""The United States is our closest and most important ally, and that has been the case president after president, prime minister after prime minister - it won't change,"" he said. ""I think there is far more that unites the government of this country and governments in Washington at any time and any stage than divides us. ""We have common values, we have common interests, we have common global perspective. There is a huge amount of work we need to do together to protect those values."" Mr Johnson signalled that he hoped Mr Biden's victory would mark a big shift in US policy on climate change, Mr Trump having taken the country out of the Paris Climate Accord. ""I think now with President Biden in the White House in Washington we have the real prospect of American global leadership in tackling climate change,"" he said. The UK and US are currently seeking to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement, against a backdrop of historic tensions with senior Democrats in Congress over Brexit and its impact on Northern Ireland. Mr Biden has warned that the 1998 Good Friday Agreement must ""not be a casualty"" of Brexit and expressed concerns about the UK government's attempt to pass legislation that would give it the power to override aspects of the EU Withdrawal Agreement with regard to Northern Ireland. The election of Joe Biden leaves Boris Johnson facing a substantial diplomatic repair job. The two men have never met. Last December the president-elect described the prime minister as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Donald Trump. There are people around Mr Biden who remember bitterly how Mr Johnson once suggested President Obama harboured anti-British sentiment because of his part-Kenyan ancestry. Mr Biden and his team think Brexit is a historic mistake. They would not want Britain to leave the EU without a trade deal, particularly if it involved breaking commitments made in the Northern Ireland protocol. Read James' full analysis Mr Johnson has expressed his belief that the UK will be able to secure mutually beneficial trade agreements with both the US and the EU, its two largest partners. But he has also signalled that he will now bow to pressure from the EU to re-write the Internal Market Bill, which is due to be voted on in the Lords on Monday, to take out controversial clauses ""The whole point of the Internal Market Bill... is to protect and uphold the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""That is one of the things that we're united on with our friends in the White House."" Asked about Mr Trump's continued claims that he had won the election, the foreign secretary said the UK and other foreign countries must be careful not to be seen to be seeking to interfere in the election or its aftermath.

"The election of Joe Biden leaves Boris Johnson facing a substantial diplomatic repair job. The two men have never met. Last December the president-elect described the prime minister as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Donald Trump. There are people around Mr Biden who remember bitterly how Mr Johnson once suggested President Obama harboured anti-British sentiment because of his part-Kenyan ancestry. Mr Biden and his team think Brexit is an historic mistake. They would not want Britain to leave the EU without a trade deal, particularly if it involved breaking commitments made in the Northern Ireland protocol. Last month Mr Biden warned publicly in a tweet that a future UK-US trade deal was contingent on the UK not unravelling the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland. There is an expectation among many observers that when President Biden seeks to repair transatlantic relationships, he may focus more of his attention on Paris and Berlin than London. And when Mr Biden does turn his attention to the UK, he may put pressure on Mr Johnson to repair its relations with the EU just when the prime minister wants to focus his ""global Britain"" foreign policy elsewhere, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. Joe Biden and a life in politics What Biden's victory means for rest of world How will Biden change US foreign policy? So the government has a lot of work to do to in improving its relations with the incoming administration. That has not been made easier by a reluctance of Conservatives in recent years to meet Democrats when visiting Washington. ""We just couldn't persuade ministers ever to go and see Democrats on the Hill,"" one diplomatic source told me. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, did meet the influential Democratic senator Chris Coons in September. The prime minister's foreign affairs adviser, John Bew, has also been cultivating links with those close to Mr Biden. But they are both playing catch-up. Joe Biden's camp see Boris Johnson as very similar to Donald Trump That said, sometimes too much can be made of past comments and personal animus. Mr Biden is considered a pragmatist and under him the United States may well prove a more stable and predictable ally to the UK than was the case in the last four years. Mr Trump's America First policy will be replaced by one that recognises America's place in a multilateral, international system from which the UK benefits. A Biden presidency would renew US support for Nato the World Health Organisation and the World Trade Organisation, all of which are priorities for the UK. And there are issues where Mr Biden's views align significantly with the UK's: being tough on Russia; reviving the Iran nuclear deal; combatting human rights abuses in China and elsewhere; agreeing new carbon emission reduction targets. Next year's COP26 summit, delayed because of Covid, will attempt to agree coordinated action on climate change This last issue is, perhaps, the most important. The UK will want to use its chairmanship next year of the United Nations COP26 climate change summit to forge a bond with the Biden administration, hoping to act as a broker between the US and other countries, especially China, in agreeing a deal. The UK will still, of course, come under pressure to support America's confrontation with China, which is held as strongly by Democrats as Republicans. Johnson congratulates Biden on US election win 'Let's work together!' World reacts to Biden win Has US election slowed down Brexit negotiations? But British policymakers hope that under Biden, the US will share a closer position with the UK, one that challenges malign behaviour by China - such as in Hong Kong and Xinjiang - but also engages on global issues such as climate change. They also hope to forge a new alliance of liberal democratic countries to counter the influence of autocratic governments around the world. The truth, though, is that Mr Biden's priorities will be overwhelmingly domestic - namely fixing America's economy and the Covid crisis. Relations with the UK - including a possible free trade deal - will not be a top priority. And for all Mr Biden's internationalist instincts, there will be no return to America's global interventionism of the past. That means that despite Mr Biden's arrival in the White House, the UK post-Brexit may still have to forge a new role in the world, one that does not automatically slipstream behind US foreign policy.

"The world's biggest jeweller, Pandora, has no plans for the permanent closure of any of its thousands of stores despite the coronavirus pandemic. Chief executive Alexander Lacik told the BBC he also intended to continue paying all staff in full. The firm could ""withstand a big drop in sales"" before he would even start considering store closures, he said. At the height of the pandemic, 80% of the company's 2,700 stores around the world were closed. However, Pandora ""kept its staff on the payroll"". Even those among the 28,000 employees who were unable to work because stores were closed by government restrictions were paid in full. Mr Lacik is proud of that and said that as well as this being ""a very good decision"" for the business, it was the ""ethical thing to do"" and the loyalty to staff was now being rewarded. He said: ""Looking at how people have kind of returned that when stores reopen, I think it was a fantastic thing to do."" This month, he reckons 18% of the stores will be closed as a second wave of coronavirus sweeps across Europe. That is likely to hurt sales in the run-up to Christmas, which is traditionally one of the busiest times of the year. Alexander Lacik says his stores are ""incredibly profitable"" As with many other companies, there has been a huge growth in online sales. They almost doubled, growing 89% in the three months to the end of September and accounting for 21% of the company's $648m (Â£493m) of sales. Mr Lacik says that despite the huge growth in online, physical retail will ""continue being an important part of the industry at large"", because consumers want a ""seamless"" experience between the virtual world and the physical world. Just over a year ago, the company invested heavily in a big relaunch to allow customers a more hands-on experience in-store. The stores are ""incredibly profitable"" and Mr Lacik said his company would not close any for good, because it was ""not an average retailer"". LVMH and Tiffany make up over takeover dispute Whether they are buying rings, bracelets or earrings, Mr Lacik concedes that digital does not have all the answers. Customers ""want to see it,   they want to touch it, they want to feel it"", he said. However, they increasingly have an initial look online, then go into a store for advice before making a purchase, either in-store or online. ""The most successful players now, they are good at integrating all of this,"" he said. On average, Pandora says, it sells three pieces of jewellery a second. It is perhaps best known for its charm bracelets, which let customers choose different symbols to personalise their pieces. They are seen as critical to its profits, which started to fall a few years ago, but have improved after a turnaround plan was launched by Mr Lacik. Frans Hoyer, an analyst at Swedish bank Handelsbanken, said the company ""lost focus on its core products and its messaging to customers, which led sales to fall"". Pandora, however, was ""always profitable"". This underlying strength, combined with fewer promotions and raising money from investors, meant the company could keep paying its staff during lockdowns, Mr Hoyer added. ""Keeping staff on the payroll so they were ready to go when stores reopened, and a continued spend on advertising when others weren't, has helped the jeweller through the pandemic."" Known for its charm bracelets, Pandora is the world's largest jeweller by production volume Mr Lacik said recent collaborations with brands such as Harry Potter and Star Wars had definitely broadened the appeal of the jewellery, but were ""never going to be the core of Pandora"". Having the option to dangle Darth Vader or R2-D2 from your wrist ""keeps the brand interesting and keeps it fresh"", he added. Celebrity tie-ups have also helped, but Mr Lacik said it was important these partnerships had authenticity, or customers would not be convinced to part with their cash. The new face of Pandora is Stranger Things and Enola Holmes star Millie Bobbie Brown, who Mr Lacik says ""was a Pandora fan even before we started that collaboration"". It doesn't hurt that she also has 31 million Instagram followers and is hugely influential amongst the young women who are Pandora's core market. Analysts say these tie-ups have helped keep the company's finances healthy.  In the first nine months of this year, sales are down only 2% on the same period a year ago, at almost $1.8bn. Mr Lacik said: ""I could lose half the sales and I'd still be profitable in most of my stores."" Store closures had a broader impact too, he said, adding: ""What we see, for instance, in places where we have closed down physical retail, my ecommerce retail also goes down. So it's a combination of the two. That seems to be the sweet spot, at least now.""

"This video can not be played 'The families deserve the U-turn' - Rashford The government is to spend more than Â£400m to support poor children and their families in England, following a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford. A winter grant scheme, to be run by councils, will provide support with food and bills, and a holiday food and activities programme is to be expanded. Rashford said it would improve the lives of almost 1.7 million children. The move represents a climbdown for the government, which had said Universal Credit was the best way to help. From the package of support, a Â£170m ring-fenced fund will be distributed through councils, with at least 80% earmarked for help with food and bills. This will receive funding from the beginning of December until the end of March. The holiday food and activities programme will be expanded with a Â£220m investment to cover Easter, summer and Christmas in 2021. On top of that, there will be a Â£16m cash boost for the nation's food banks. Rashford renews call for an end to child hunger Government changes its mind after Rashford campaign Rashford becomes MBE in birthday honours Rashford: 'No child should be going to bed hungry' Prime Minister Boris Johnson telephoned the Manchester United and England player on Saturday to tell him of the new plans. Speaking after he took part in United's 3-1 Premier League win against Everton, Rashford said: ""Following the game today, I had a good conversation with the prime minister to better understand the proposed plan, and I very much welcome the steps that have been taken to combat child food poverty in the UK."" Rashford said he remained concerned about the children who would miss out on help ""because their family income isn't quite low enough"". However, he added: ""The intent the government have shown today is nothing but positive and they should be recognised for that. ""The steps made today will improve the lives of near 1.7 million children in the UK over the next 12 months, and that can only be celebrated."" Rashford also told the BBC Mr Johnson had agreed to speak with the footballer's child food poverty taskforce. ""I am fully committed to this cause, and I will fight for the rest of my life for it, because in my mind, no child should ever go hungry in the United Kingdom,"" the player said. Seeing the role everyone had played in supporting the most vulnerable children had been ""the greatest moment of my life,"" he added. Rashford's campaign began in June, after the government insisted it would not provide vouchers over the summer holidays for the 1.3 million children in England who were receiving free school meals in term time. The government had previously given this support during the first coronavirus lockdown in April. Rashford's campaignled to the government changing its policyto allow children to claim free meals during the summer holidays. The footballer then called for free meals to be provided over the October half-term, with more than a million people signing a petition he set up. But the government refused, saying enough support was being provided through the benefit system. Last month, it whipped Conservative MPs to vote against a Labour motion in the House of Commons that called for the extension of free school meal provision. This prompted a number of local authorities to say they would continue offering free school meals throughout the week's holiday in spite of that. In October, a Downing Street spokesman said it was ""not for schools to regularly provide food to pupils during the school holidays."" They added: ""We believe the best way to support families outside of term time is through Universal Credit rather than government subsidising meals."" Marcus Rashford has prompted the government to act before. Now he's done it again. It is the second time the prime minister has picked up the phone to the 23-year-old footballer, whose campaign has struck a chord with many, and left many Conservatives acknowledging privately for some time they would have to change tack. Strikingly, Rashford insists this isn't about politics, or criticising Boris Johnson, it's about helping poor families. ""We're not against him. That's the main reason I was happy to talk to him,"" he told BBC Breakfast. But what also stands out is he's moving onto the next strand of his campaign - arguing that more families should get help. Given his success so far, don't bet against him pursuing this pretty doggedly in the months ahead. Announcing the support package, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the government knew it was a challenging time for many, and insisted it had consistently supported the lowest paid families by boosting welfare support. ""We want to make sure vulnerable people are cared for throughout this difficult time and, above all, no one should go hungry or be unable to pay their bills this winter,"" she added. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said Labour had been campaigning for such a change, adding: ""This should have been announced weeks ago to help the children at risk of going hungry over half term."" She added that ministers needed to bring forward a long-term plan to child poverty. England's children's commissioner Anne Longfield welcomed the move but called on ministers to ""go further"" with Universal Credit support by retaining a Â£20 increase. ""Hunger does not take a holiday when schools close and a long-term solution to the growing number of children in poverty is urgently needed,"" she said. Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, who also chairs the End Child Poverty Coalition, said Rashford deserved ""enormous credit for pushing the issue of poverty to the top of the public's agenda"", adding that the government should be acknowledged for ""listening"". James Toop, chief executive, of food charity Bite Back 2030, said: ""It's great that Boris has listened to the voices of our young people who have been campaigning for meal provision through the holidays to be a priority through this crisis."" Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said the scheme was particularly welcome. ""Christmas will not be the same this year - and it is therefore even more important that we ensure that children have food and are kept warm."" Head teachers also welcomed the scheme but questioned why it could not have been in place for October's half term. Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders' union the NAHT, said while the expansion of the activities programme was a positive move, it ""falls short in addressing fully the issue of holiday hunger"". He added: ""We would question whether provision of food to those going hungry should be dependent upon them attending an activity, which for a whole host of reasons might not be suitable, available or accessible for particular groups."" The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the winter grant would help them find the best way to help families and individuals most in need, but called on the government to ""adequately fund councils so they can provide wider long-term preventative support to all households who need it"".

"This video can not be played Socially-distanced events have taken place across the UK, including at the Cenotaph in London The Queen has led the nation in marking Remembrance Sunday, as people around the UK privately paid their respects at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. She was joined by family members and the PM at the scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed off to the public for the first time. Following a two-minute silence, wreaths were laid by Prince Charles, Prince William and the PM, among others. The commemorations remember the armed forces community, British and Commonwealth veterans, the allies who fought alongside the UK and the civilian servicemen and women involved in the two world wars and later conflicts. Normally, Whitehall is packed with thousands of veterans and members of the military for the commemorations, but on Sunday less than 30 veterans were in attendance. The Queen, dressed in a black hat and coat, looked on from a balcony at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office building, as her son, the Prince of Wales, laid a wreath on her behalf. Others who took part in the wreath laying included the Duke of Cambridge, the Princess Royal and Earl of Wessex, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer. Also present at the service were former UK prime ministers Theresa May, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Sir John Major. In pictures: How the UK marked Remembrance Sunday The Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge attended the service Prime Minister Boris Johnson was joined by former leaders Theresa May, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Sir John Major Prince Charles laid a wreath on behalf of the Queen Prince William was also among those who laid a wreath It felt the same on Whitehall this year, but also really quite different. At the heart of the ceremony, as ever, was the Cenotaph - the simple stone memorial to the dead of so many conflicts, unveiled a century ago by George V, overlooked on Sunday by the Queen on a Foreign Office balcony. There was the familiar and always-moving grandeur of the two-minute silence, the wreath laying, the solemn contemplation of so much sacrifice and loss. But missing were the members of the public who normally travel from all over the country to be here, who stand three or four-deep along the barriers that line either side of Whitehall. Missing too were the great number of military veterans who march past the Cenotaph after the wreath-laying. The public and the veterans bring life to this commemoration of loss - they ground this remembrance and make it more personal, more sharply felt. Remembrance Sunday belongs to those who gave - their lives, their health, their loved ones. Everyone here in Whitehall will hope that next year will see the public and military veterans return. Members of the Royal Navy marched down Whitehall ahead of the Remembrance Sunday service The Duke of Sussex, who stepped down as a working member of the Royal Family and now lives in California, was not at the ceremony but spoke about what serving his country means to him. In a podcast to mark Remembrance Sunday, Harry, who spent 10 years in the armed forces, said: ""Being able to wear my uniform, being able to stand up in service of one's country, these are amongst the greatest honours there are in life. ""To me, the uniform is a symbol of something much bigger, it's symbolic of our commitment to protecting our country, as well as protecting our values. ""These values are put in action through service, and service is what happens in the quiet and in the chaos."" General Sir Nick Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, said some veterans might find Remembrance Sunday a lonely experience this year due to the Covid-19 restrictions. Sir Nick told the BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the guidelines would be ""particularly tough on our veterans"", adding: ""They traditionally have had the opportunity to get together and talk about their memories and their reflections, but equally to strut their stuff."" Usually, about 10,000 people gather at the Cenotaph in Whitehall for the remembrance service. But with the event being closed to the public, the Royal British Legion and Legion Scotland advised people to observe the silence in honour of those who lost their lives in conflicts from their doorsteps. The public was also encouraged to share family histories and messages of remembrance online using the hashtag #WeWillRememberThem.

Speaking at Saturday's annual Festival of Remembrance at London's Royal Albert Hall, which was pre-recorded and filmed without an audience, the Prince of Wales said the country had endured ""anxiety and grief not previously experienced in peacetime"". ""In this challenging year, we have perhaps come to realise that the freedoms for which they fought are more precious than we knew, and that the debt we owe them is even greater than we imagined,"" he said. This video can not be played The Queen was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time as she laid the wreath On Wednesday at Westminster Abbey, the Queen commemorated the 100th anniversary of the interment of the Unknown Warrior, who represents World War One soldiers whose place of death is not known or whose remains are unidentified. She was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time during the visit. The 94-year-old monarch had requested the private pilgrimage after she was advised not to attend the warrior's centenary service next week. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are expected to join this service on 11 November, Armistice Day. How will you be marking Remembrance Sunday?

"The installation has been set up to raise funds for the Royal British Legion Life-size silhouettes of 200 soldiers have been set up at Blenheim Palace to mark Remembrance Sunday. The installation, set up to raise funds for the Royal British Legion, is laid out by the Column of Victory and also features 75 poppy wreaths. The ""Standing with Giants"" figures were made from recycled building materials by Witney-based artist Dan Barton. Heather Carter, the palace's operations director, called it a ""fitting tribute"". She said: ""As a result of the coronavirus, many of the planned parades and services to mark Remembrance Day have had to be cancelled. ""We wanted to do something that would still mark the occasion and help raise awareness of the ongoing need to support our veterans and the amazing work being carried out by the Royal British Legion. ""Now, more than ever, the assistance they can provide is sorely needed and we hope Dan's extraordinary figures will serve as a fitting tribute to all the fallen and a reminder of the terrible cost of conflict."" The 200 silhouettes were made from recycled building materials The figures are joined by 75 poppy wreaths The palace in Oxfordshire is a World Heritage Site and the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill. It was used as a rehabilitation hospital for World War One soldiers, anda secret testing ground for landing craftin the run up to D-Day in World War Two.

"Traditional remembrance events at local war memorials are held across Scotland every Remembrance Sunday. Many of those taking part will be wearing poppies - more than 100 years after the tradition started. They're not all the same, though. So what's different about the Scottish poppy? The Scottish poppy, left, has four-lobed petals and no leaf, while the poppy used in the rest of the UK has two and sometimes a leaf The Scottish poppy has the same recognisable blood red colour, but it has four-lobed petals and no leaf. That is in contrast to the poppy used in the rest of the UK, which has two petals and sometimes sports a green leaf. Poppies sold in Scotland are made at Lady Haig's poppy factory in Edinburgh. When it was founded back in 1926, it introduced a different style of poppy - designed by Lady Haig - and has stuck to it ever since. Poppyscotland, which raises money to support armed forces north of the border, also said it would be ""botanically incorrect"" to add a leaf. Davy Adamson, who served for 23 years with the Royal Highland Fusiliers, works at Lady Haig's factory making wreaths They were traditionally made by veterans. A team of 33 veterans - all with disabilities and vulnerabilities - are still working at the poppy factory. They have served in conflicts from Northern Ireland in the 1970s to the war in Afghanistan and subsequent operations. But this year they have been performing tasks other than making poppies, including assembling wreaths. That's because, for the second year, all the poppies are now plastic-free and are made with a machine. Poppyscotland has produced two million for this year's appeal, and 50% of the material used is made from recycled coffee cups. The green plastic stem and black button in the centre of the poppy have been done away with to reduce plastic waste. By 2026, these new-style poppies will have completely replaced the plastic and paper ones that we've been used to in the past. The poppy as a symbol of remembrance was started by the American humanitarian Moina Michael, who was inspired by Lt Colonel John McCrae's poemIn Flanders Fields,externaldescribing the small plants growing on the graves of soldiers buried in northern France and Belgium during World War One. She began the poppy wearing and others soon followed. However, after the first Poppy Appeal in 1921, demand for the simple symbol could not be fulfilled north of the border. So, in 1926, Lady Haig - wife of Field Marshal Earl Haig - decided to open apoppy-making factory in Edinburgh,externalwhich would be staffed by a team of disabled war veterans. Volunteers sell the poppies for charity The poppies made at the Lady Haig poppy factory are distributed across the country. This year, that includes: Two million new-style poppies (there are also a surplus of the old-style poppy still in circulation) 38,000 wreaths For the rest of the UK, the Royal British Legion produces about 40 million poppies annually. No, fundraisers produce all kinds of poppy-related merchandise, including wreaths, brooches, umbrellas, diaries and T-shirts. The idea to branch out came in the very early days. In 1928 Lady Haig decided the Edinburgh factory should expand into hand-crafted goods, including stuffed toys and jigsaw puzzles. Today, fundraisers raise money in similar ways to other charities - everything from bake sales to bungee jumps are undertaken. Poppyscotland is part of the Royal British Legion group of charities. The British Legion operates across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Poppyscotland operates as a distinct charity north of the border - and all money raised in Scotland is spent here.

"Freight drivers who are not UK citizens and have been through Denmark in the last fortnight are warned they will be turned away from the British border. It follows concern over a new coronavirus strain that has spread from mink to humans. Returning drivers who are UK citizens will have to self-isolate for 14 days along with their households. It comes as further 156 people in the UK were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. It brings the overall UK death toll to 49,044,according to government data,external. Both the number of UK deaths and the daily cases - 20,572 in the past 24 hours - mark a significant drop on previous days, but Sunday figures are often lower due to a lag in weekend reporting. The new rules,externalfor hauliers returning from Denmark began at 04:00 GMT on Sunday - and follow a ban on all non-UK citizens coming to the UK from Denmark. Any UK citizens who have travelled to Denmark must isolate for 14 days, along with their household. Passenger planes and ships carrying freight (as well as passengers) from Denmark will also not be allowed to dock at English ports. Cabin crew are also no longer exempt from the quarantine rules - which Ryanair described on Saturday as a ""bizarre and baseless"" move. The airline said it had cancelled all flights to and from Denmark while the rules remain in place, and urged Mr Shapps to reverse the decision. Scottish airline Loganair saidit has suspended flights between Scotland and Denmark,externalfrom 9 to 22 November. UK bans Denmark visitors over mink Covid-19 fears What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? Coronavirus: Can I still go on holiday? The Department for Transport (DfT) said the latest rules followed the release of ""further information"" from health officials in Denmark, where 12 people have been found to have mink-related mutations of virus, most of them connected to farms in the North Jutland region. The travel ban and extra requirements will be reviewed after a week, the DfT has said. Asked about the restrictions by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab denied the suggestion they were ""draconian"", insisting the government had taken ""safe and responsible steps"" in light of the ""new and evolving"" science on the mutated virus strain. He told the Andrew Marr show: ""I wouldn't describe it as draconian taking a precautionary measure that if and when we come up with a vaccine it can't be sidestepped by a mutation in the virus that the Danes have found through their mink population. ""I think that's a common sense measure that the public would expect us to take."" John Littleton, who returned from a business trip in Denmark on Friday, says he would have done things differently if he had known how rules would have affected his family. ""I was in Denmark on business. My flight back was Friday afternoon. On Friday morning a colleague told me that Denmark had been put back on the restricted list. I assumed I would have to self isolate for two weeks. There was no official contact. Once home I started self-isolating. On Saturday morning I missed a call from the tracing service who said they would ring me on Sunday. Last evening, two police officers arrived at my home. They read out a statement recommending the whole household self-isolate for two weeks. It was rather ambiguous - but the police said we would be fined if we didn't. Both my son and his partner now can't go to work. She is a teacher, he manages an electrical retailer. Not being at work causes real problems. When the announcement about Denmark was made, there was no that the entire household would have to self-isolate. If it had said that, I would have done things differently - perhaps I would have stayed out there or isolated somewhere else upon my return. I just don't understand why such extreme measures are being taken. I was not in the north of Denmark and followed all social distancing guidelines while there. Denmark are only imposing local restrictions. Why can I not simply be tested, so that the rest of the household can carry on with work? As usual, the whole situation is being handled in a haphazard way with little thought."" Denmark is the UK'slargest source of imported pork- including bacon - with machinery among the other major import items. Rod McKenzie, managing director of policy at the Road Haulage Association, said the latest restrictions were ""significant and unique"" because lorry drivers working in supply chains have been ""exempt"" fromtravel quarantine rules,external. He suggested that whilst different organisations, such as supermarkets, may have their own plans to address any supply issues, he warned that if the restrictions continue for a ""long time"" there could be ""a potential disruption to bacon supplies in the UK"". Meanwhile, Logistics UK, a freight trade body, said the industry was ""agile"" so ""importers can switch between transport modes to ensure that products still arrive"". In a statement it added: ""Much of the ferry transport between the UK and Denmark is sent in unaccompanied trailers, so drivers simply collect their loads from ports, with no need to travel across the border. ""The industry will continue to maintain high levels of vigilance and follow all necessary health protocols to protect the UK."" In England, where a new national lockdown came into force on Thursday, people are still allowed to travel overseas for work or education trips. Leaving home to go on holiday is currently banned for most people in the UK. Denmark's Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod called Mr Shapps' travel announcement a ""very drastic step"" and said he had discussed it with UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Saturday. Denmark had been taken off theUK coronavirus travel corridors list,externalon Friday after it first became apparent the mutated form of coronavirus was present in the country. It meant any passengers arriving in the UK from Denmark would need to self-isolate after their arrival. The Department for Health and Social Care estimates that between 300 and 500 people have arrived in the UK from Denmark in the last 14 days. Officials will contact anyone in the UK who has been in Denmark in the last fortnight to make sure they also self-isolate.

"This video can not be played Socially-distanced events have taken place across the UK, including at the Cenotaph in London The Queen has led the nation in marking Remembrance Sunday, as people around the UK privately paid their respects at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. She was joined by family members and the PM at the scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed off to the public for the first time. Following a two-minute silence, wreaths were laid by Prince Charles, Prince William and the PM, among others. The commemorations remember the armed forces community, British and Commonwealth veterans, the allies who fought alongside the UK and the civilian servicemen and women involved in the two world wars and later conflicts. Normally, Whitehall is packed with thousands of veterans and members of the military for the commemorations, but on Sunday less than 30 veterans were in attendance. The Queen, dressed in a black hat and coat, looked on from a balcony at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office building, as her son, the Prince of Wales, laid a wreath on her behalf. Others who took part in the wreath laying included the Duke of Cambridge, the Princess Royal and Earl of Wessex, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer. Also present at the service were former UK prime ministers Theresa May, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Sir John Major. In pictures: How the UK marked Remembrance Sunday The Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge attended the service Prime Minister Boris Johnson was joined by former leaders Theresa May, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Sir John Major Prince Charles laid a wreath on behalf of the Queen Prince William was also among those who laid a wreath It felt the same on Whitehall this year, but also really quite different. At the heart of the ceremony, as ever, was the Cenotaph - the simple stone memorial to the dead of so many conflicts, unveiled a century ago by George V, overlooked on Sunday by the Queen on a Foreign Office balcony. There was the familiar and always-moving grandeur of the two-minute silence, the wreath laying, the solemn contemplation of so much sacrifice and loss. But missing were the members of the public who normally travel from all over the country to be here, who stand three or four-deep along the barriers that line either side of Whitehall. Missing too were the great number of military veterans who march past the Cenotaph after the wreath-laying. The public and the veterans bring life to this commemoration of loss - they ground this remembrance and make it more personal, more sharply felt. Remembrance Sunday belongs to those who gave - their lives, their health, their loved ones. Everyone here in Whitehall will hope that next year will see the public and military veterans return. Members of the Royal Navy marched down Whitehall ahead of the Remembrance Sunday service The Duke of Sussex, who stepped down as a working member of the Royal Family and now lives in California, was not at the ceremony but spoke about what serving his country means to him. In a podcast to mark Remembrance Sunday, Harry, who spent 10 years in the armed forces, said: ""Being able to wear my uniform, being able to stand up in service of one's country, these are amongst the greatest honours there are in life. ""To me, the uniform is a symbol of something much bigger, it's symbolic of our commitment to protecting our country, as well as protecting our values. ""These values are put in action through service, and service is what happens in the quiet and in the chaos."" General Sir Nick Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, said some veterans might find Remembrance Sunday a lonely experience this year due to the Covid-19 restrictions. Sir Nick told the BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the guidelines would be ""particularly tough on our veterans"", adding: ""They traditionally have had the opportunity to get together and talk about their memories and their reflections, but equally to strut their stuff."" Usually, about 10,000 people gather at the Cenotaph in Whitehall for the remembrance service. But with the event being closed to the public, the Royal British Legion and Legion Scotland advised people to observe the silence in honour of those who lost their lives in conflicts from their doorsteps. The public was also encouraged to share family histories and messages of remembrance online using the hashtag #WeWillRememberThem.

However,thousands of people observed the two-minute silence on their doorsteps. Restrictions were also in place in Belfast, with members of the public unable to attend the event at City Hall.

Speaking at Saturday's annual Festival of Remembrance at London's Royal Albert Hall, which was pre-recorded and filmed without an audience, the Prince of Wales said the country had endured ""anxiety and grief not previously experienced in peacetime"". ""In this challenging year, we have perhaps come to realise that the freedoms for which they fought are more precious than we knew, and that the debt we owe them is even greater than we imagined,"" he said.

She was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time during the visit. The 94-year-old monarch had requested the private pilgrimage after she was advised not to attend the warrior's centenary service next week. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are expected to join this service on 11 November, Armistice Day. How will you be marking Remembrance Sunday?

"This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" Minutes after Joe Biden had been declared the next president of the United States, people in Washington, DC began to flood the streets. Streams of people - banging pans, honking horns, clutching signs - moved to the city's Black Lives Matter Plaza, swarming the barricaded border of the White House to celebrate. For hours after the announcement, masked Biden supporters remained to cheer, dance and sing. ""Everyone is just joyous,"" said DC resident Andrew Jackson, dressed in a shirt covered with photos of Kamala Harris, now the vice-president-elect. ""Look at the atmosphere, it's crazy."" The collective jubilation makes sense here: 93% of voters in Washington this year cast their ballot for the Democratic ticket. Just beneath the excitement was palpable relief. Every person I spoke to mentioned the anxiety and stress of the past week, and now the exhale knowing that Mr Biden will be president. ""All the anxiety is gone,"" Mr Jackson said. ""The last four years it felt like we were just stuck under a dark cloud, but that cloud's been lifted."" As much as this relief is a response to the Democrats' win, it seemed to be just as much a reaction to the last four years of President Donald Trump - who still has two months left in office. Why Donald Trump lost The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris How will Biden change US foreign policy? For every sign or t-shirt celebrating Mr Biden or Ms Harris, there was one directed at Mr Trump - mocking the current president and applauding his looming departure. And just as often as a voter would reference Mr Biden, they would mention Mr Trump, and what they described as his divisive, damaging agenda. ""Everybody's excited to see the back of Trump,"" said Margaret O'Gorman, 54.  ""We are in a complete U-turn from where we were."" Repairing that division has been an animating theme of Mr Biden's candidacy. He has vowed to be a president for all Americans, to restore the ""soul of America"" and fix the national discord he blames on Mr Trump. It might be a tough sell for some 70 million Americans who cast their ballot for Mr Trump this year - roughly eight million more than sent him to the White House in 2016. But for those gathered outside the White House on Saturday, it is a welcome message. For some in Washington DC the elation was unconfined Brandishing a ""Former Republicans for Biden"" sign, Ken Wright said he is confident that the next president will reach across the aisle, and embrace Republican voters. ""Biden is about compromise, Trump was not. I'm very optimistic that Biden's going to do what he's always done."" ""I think this atmosphere proves that the country can ease now back into some regularity,"" said Vincent Moten, holding the hand of his partner, Derrick Petit. ""Now that we're here, the idea is what can we do to come together. Let's agree on some baseline stuff - I'm a human, so I should have the rights that you have and then start from there. For Anisley Valdas, 32, the key to moving forward is to understand where Trump voters are coming from, ""why people feel angry, why people feel disenfranchised"". Anisley Valdas said she thinks Joe Biden will be a president for all Americans ""I think trying to understand people's pain and their suffering is a way to start to get us on the right track,"" she said. Born in Cuba, America's political divides cut through her family. In this year's election, Ms Valdas voted for Mr Biden - splitting from her sister, cousins and the majority of Cuban immigrants in her hometown of Miami. Ms Valdas said she was ""angry and disappointed"" that her own family had voted for a candidate who, she said, ""demonstrated such hatred and bigotry"", for people of colour. She hasn't spoken to her sister since learning the results, she said, after an argument this week about the election. When she does, she said, she will tell her that ""Biden is the president for everyone. You just don't know it yet."" What happens now?

"A new set of stamps features the artwork of Alfred Bestall, who wrote and illustrated more than 270 Rupert stories A little bear is celebrating a very big birthday: Rupert has turned 100. To commemorate the milestone, the anthropomorphic adventurer has been honoured by the Royal Mail in a set of eight stamps. Rupert first appeared in the Daily Express on 8 November 1920, as Little Lost Bear - the work of illustrator Mary Tourtel. The character, whose famous red jumper was originally blue, was part of the newspaper's push to attract new readers. Alfred Bestall took over from Tourtel in 1935 as Rupert's illustrator, remaining with him until the early 1970s, and it's his distinctive style that appears in the new stamps. But a century on from his first appearance, can Rupert stay relevant to young readers? Ian Dodds remembers Rupert from his childhood but his son Charlie isn't familiar with the bear At Seven Stories, the National Centre for Children's Books in Newcastle, an imaginative world of colourful characters has been brought to life but there's little sign of the scarf-wearing bear. ""Charlie? Would you like a Rupert the Bear teddy for Christmas?"" Ian Dodds asks his three-year-old son, who beams ""Yes!"" when he's shown a picture. Ian, from Tynemouth, remembers the character fondly from his childhood, but the bear is not a familiar figure to his son. ""I think there are old characters who have been modernised; Charlie loves Thomas the Tank Engine, even Bob the Builder, so I think if they modernised him he would be well into him,"" he says. Rupert lives in the village of Nutwood and originally had a blue jumper Nicholas Tucker, former senior lecturer in children's literature at Sussex University, believes Rupert's popularity was about being able to get into children's imaginations. ""With Rupert you can fly in a plane, you can look at the roots of tree and suddenly find a passage down to another world entirely, and you get back in the evening,"" he says. ""He's never in too much danger and although there are some malign figures, Rupert is a good person and nobody ever gets too angry with him."" The 2021 Rupert annual celebrates the character's centenary with a new adventure about his birthday The Rupert Bear Annual has been published ahead of Christmas every year since 1936. Rare copies have fetched more than Â£20,000. Stuart Trotter can still remember receiving his first copy as a four-year-old. He coloured in a picture for a competition but changed his mind about sending it off as he didn't want to tear the page out. Six decades later and he's just as meticulous over Rupert - this time as the annual's illustrator. Stuart Trotter is an established illustrator who has also worked on Postman Pat and Kipper the Dog Stuart, from County Durham, has illustrated the annual's cover and created a story for it since 2008. It's a process that can take up to six months. ""I lived in Ferryhill, it was a mining town, everything was very black and white - the TV was black and white, the newspaper was black and white, and then on Christmas Day I got my first annual and there was this amazing blaze of colour and imaginative stories, and I was just hooked from then on,"" says Stuart, who has also illustrated Postman Pat and Kipper the Dog. The picture Stuart coloured in as a four-year-old when he received his first Rupert annual on Christmas Day The centenary edition includes a time-travelling adventure about Rupert's birthday. ""I never drew him when I was a kid, I just used to like reading the stories. And the opportunity came later on in life and I took it,"" he says. Stuart says he would like to continue to draw Rupert until he can ""draw no more"". ""I'm not in a job where you retire. I work very long hours and enjoy it; it's never a chore,"" he adds. ""The Rupert I remember was illustrated by Alfred Bestall. I just loved his style of artwork and Rupert is an iconic character; he's very much in his time, and so there's no mobile phones, there are no computers - I did introduce a television in one story, but it was a Bakelite television. ""I like to keep him in that era as it's an era I remember fondly and I just don't think he should be modernised - I think he should stay in that period."" Rupert's story is told through a series of panels, which along with a front cover, can take six months to create Gill Rennie, curator at Seven Stories, believes there still is a place for Rupert, despite today's hi-tech world being a far cry from the quaintness of Nutwood. ""The world he lives in is like a nostalgic adventuring world but it's probably not the most accessible for children getting into reading today,"" she says. ""The annuals are a big thing in British Christmas culture, and it's lovely that Rupert has been kept alive in that way. That goes back to classic children's book characters or children's cartoon characters; they become part of culture, whether or not you have read every story."" She said although most people knew who Alice from Alice's Adventures In Wonderland was, few would have read the whole of the Lewis Carroll book. ""That doesn't really matter because she lives on and she can be adapted and that's good, that's creative, and I think that's the same for Rupert,"" Ms Rennie adds. Rupert, with his familiar checked trousers, first appeared in the Daily Express on 8 November 1920 Rupert and his friends did receive a makeover more than a decade ago when they appeared in a new series on Channel 5, aimed at younger children. So are his older fans worried about the latest version of their beloved bear? The Followers of Rupert, who meet every year, are very protective of the character ""We have an open mind as long as it keeps the original ethos,"" says John Swan, chairman of the Followers of Rupert, which has about 600 members. The society was formed in 1984 and takes its name from the slogan: ""Follow Rupert every day in the Daily Express"". Illustrator Bestall even attended the society's first meeting. The group meets each year, although the long-awaited centenary event has had to be postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Many of the fans appreciate the artwork, the illustrations, and we talk about that,"" says John, who lives in Whitley Bay. ""We don't all wear yellow trousers,"" he explains.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader. ""He wants to bring people together, both within the United States of America where he's already talking about unifying the country,"" he says. ""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

"This video can not be played 'The families deserve the U-turn' - Rashford The government is to spend more than Â£400m to support poor children and their families in England, following a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford. A winter grant scheme, to be run by councils, will provide support with food and bills, and a holiday food and activities programme is to be expanded. Rashford said it would improve the lives of almost 1.7 million children. The move represents a climbdown for the government, which had said Universal Credit was the best way to help. From the package of support, a Â£170m ring-fenced fund will be distributed through councils, with at least 80% earmarked for help with food and bills. This will receive funding from the beginning of December until the end of March. The holiday food and activities programme will be expanded with a Â£220m investment to cover Easter, summer and Christmas in 2021. On top of that, there will be a Â£16m cash boost for the nation's food banks. Rashford renews call for an end to child hunger Government changes its mind after Rashford campaign Rashford becomes MBE in birthday honours Rashford: 'No child should be going to bed hungry' Prime Minister Boris Johnson telephoned the Manchester United and England player on Saturday to tell him of the new plans. Speaking after he took part in United's 3-1 Premier League win against Everton, Rashford said: ""Following the game today, I had a good conversation with the prime minister to better understand the proposed plan, and I very much welcome the steps that have been taken to combat child food poverty in the UK."" Rashford said he remained concerned about the children who would miss out on help ""because their family income isn't quite low enough"". However, he added: ""The intent the government have shown today is nothing but positive and they should be recognised for that. ""The steps made today will improve the lives of near 1.7 million children in the UK over the next 12 months, and that can only be celebrated."" Rashford also told the BBC Mr Johnson had agreed to speak with the footballer's child food poverty taskforce. ""I am fully committed to this cause, and I will fight for the rest of my life for it, because in my mind, no child should ever go hungry in the United Kingdom,"" the player said. Seeing the role everyone had played in supporting the most vulnerable children had been ""the greatest moment of my life,"" he added. Rashford's campaign began in June, after the government insisted it would not provide vouchers over the summer holidays for the 1.3 million children in England who were receiving free school meals in term time. The government had previously given this support during the first coronavirus lockdown in April. Rashford's campaignled to the government changing its policyto allow children to claim free meals during the summer holidays. The footballer then called for free meals to be provided over the October half-term, with more than a million people signing a petition he set up. But the government refused, saying enough support was being provided through the benefit system. Last month, it whipped Conservative MPs to vote against a Labour motion in the House of Commons that called for the extension of free school meal provision. This prompted a number of local authorities to say they would continue offering free school meals throughout the week's holiday in spite of that. In October, a Downing Street spokesman said it was ""not for schools to regularly provide food to pupils during the school holidays."" They added: ""We believe the best way to support families outside of term time is through Universal Credit rather than government subsidising meals."" Marcus Rashford has prompted the government to act before. Now he's done it again. It is the second time the prime minister has picked up the phone to the 23-year-old footballer, whose campaign has struck a chord with many, and left many Conservatives acknowledging privately for some time they would have to change tack. Strikingly, Rashford insists this isn't about politics, or criticising Boris Johnson, it's about helping poor families. ""We're not against him. That's the main reason I was happy to talk to him,"" he told BBC Breakfast. But what also stands out is he's moving onto the next strand of his campaign - arguing that more families should get help. Given his success so far, don't bet against him pursuing this pretty doggedly in the months ahead. Announcing the support package, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the government knew it was a challenging time for many, and insisted it had consistently supported the lowest paid families by boosting welfare support. ""We want to make sure vulnerable people are cared for throughout this difficult time and, above all, no one should go hungry or be unable to pay their bills this winter,"" she added. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said Labour had been campaigning for such a change, adding: ""This should have been announced weeks ago to help the children at risk of going hungry over half term."" She added that ministers needed to bring forward a long-term plan to child poverty. England's children's commissioner Anne Longfield welcomed the move but called on ministers to ""go further"" with Universal Credit support by retaining a Â£20 increase. ""Hunger does not take a holiday when schools close and a long-term solution to the growing number of children in poverty is urgently needed,"" she said. Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, who also chairs the End Child Poverty Coalition, said Rashford deserved ""enormous credit for pushing the issue of poverty to the top of the public's agenda"", adding that the government should be acknowledged for ""listening"". James Toop, chief executive, of food charity Bite Back 2030, said: ""It's great that Boris has listened to the voices of our young people who have been campaigning for meal provision through the holidays to be a priority through this crisis."" Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said the scheme was particularly welcome. ""Christmas will not be the same this year - and it is therefore even more important that we ensure that children have food and are kept warm."" Head teachers also welcomed the scheme but questioned why it could not have been in place for October's half term. Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders' union the NAHT, said while the expansion of the activities programme was a positive move, it ""falls short in addressing fully the issue of holiday hunger"". He added: ""We would question whether provision of food to those going hungry should be dependent upon them attending an activity, which for a whole host of reasons might not be suitable, available or accessible for particular groups."" The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the winter grant would help them find the best way to help families and individuals most in need, but called on the government to ""adequately fund councils so they can provide wider long-term preventative support to all households who need it"".

"President-elect Joe Biden made his first appointments, naming a group of scientists and experts who will lead his administration's response to Covid-19 However, President Donald Trump is still planning legal challenges to the results in some key states Biden says it will take time to develop a vaccine, and urges Americans to wear a mask to reduce Covid-19 transmissions Biden and President Trump both welcome news that a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech is 90% effective Biden advisers are discussing who can fill key posts after the Democrat pledged the most diverse cabinet in history Results from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding Edited by Helier Cheung Thank you for joining us for our ongoing coverage of the 2020 US presidential election. It's been nearly a week since the 3 November election day, and there are another 10 weeks to go until Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th US president. This live page was brought to you by our teams in the UK and US. The writers included Max Matza, Holly Honderich, Ritu Prasad, Alice Cuddy, Georgina Rannard, Ashitha Nagesh, Sophie Williams, George Wright, Joseph Lee, Toby Luckhurst, Joshua Nevett, Mal Siret and Vicky Bisset.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader. ""He wants to bring people together, both within the United States of America where he's already talking about unifying the country,"" he says. ""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

"A new set of stamps features the artwork of Alfred Bestall, who wrote and illustrated more than 270 Rupert stories A little bear is celebrating a very big birthday: Rupert has turned 100. To commemorate the milestone, the anthropomorphic adventurer has been honoured by the Royal Mail in a set of eight stamps. Rupert first appeared in the Daily Express on 8 November 1920, as Little Lost Bear - the work of illustrator Mary Tourtel. The character, whose famous red jumper was originally blue, was part of the newspaper's push to attract new readers. Alfred Bestall took over from Tourtel in 1935 as Rupert's illustrator, remaining with him until the early 1970s, and it's his distinctive style that appears in the new stamps. But a century on from his first appearance, can Rupert stay relevant to young readers? Ian Dodds remembers Rupert from his childhood but his son Charlie isn't familiar with the bear At Seven Stories, the National Centre for Children's Books in Newcastle, an imaginative world of colourful characters has been brought to life but there's little sign of the scarf-wearing bear. ""Charlie? Would you like a Rupert the Bear teddy for Christmas?"" Ian Dodds asks his three-year-old son, who beams ""Yes!"" when he's shown a picture. Ian, from Tynemouth, remembers the character fondly from his childhood, but the bear is not a familiar figure to his son. ""I think there are old characters who have been modernised; Charlie loves Thomas the Tank Engine, even Bob the Builder, so I think if they modernised him he would be well into him,"" he says. Rupert lives in the village of Nutwood and originally had a blue jumper Nicholas Tucker, former senior lecturer in children's literature at Sussex University, believes Rupert's popularity was about being able to get into children's imaginations. ""With Rupert you can fly in a plane, you can look at the roots of tree and suddenly find a passage down to another world entirely, and you get back in the evening,"" he says. ""He's never in too much danger and although there are some malign figures, Rupert is a good person and nobody ever gets too angry with him."" The 2021 Rupert annual celebrates the character's centenary with a new adventure about his birthday The Rupert Bear Annual has been published ahead of Christmas every year since 1936. Rare copies have fetched more than Â£20,000. Stuart Trotter can still remember receiving his first copy as a four-year-old. He coloured in a picture for a competition but changed his mind about sending it off as he didn't want to tear the page out. Six decades later and he's just as meticulous over Rupert - this time as the annual's illustrator. Stuart Trotter is an established illustrator who has also worked on Postman Pat and Kipper the Dog Stuart, from County Durham, has illustrated the annual's cover and created a story for it since 2008. It's a process that can take up to six months. ""I lived in Ferryhill, it was a mining town, everything was very black and white - the TV was black and white, the newspaper was black and white, and then on Christmas Day I got my first annual and there was this amazing blaze of colour and imaginative stories, and I was just hooked from then on,"" says Stuart, who has also illustrated Postman Pat and Kipper the Dog. The picture Stuart coloured in as a four-year-old when he received his first Rupert annual on Christmas Day The centenary edition includes a time-travelling adventure about Rupert's birthday. ""I never drew him when I was a kid, I just used to like reading the stories. And the opportunity came later on in life and I took it,"" he says. Stuart says he would like to continue to draw Rupert until he can ""draw no more"". ""I'm not in a job where you retire. I work very long hours and enjoy it; it's never a chore,"" he adds. ""The Rupert I remember was illustrated by Alfred Bestall. I just loved his style of artwork and Rupert is an iconic character; he's very much in his time, and so there's no mobile phones, there are no computers - I did introduce a television in one story, but it was a Bakelite television. ""I like to keep him in that era as it's an era I remember fondly and I just don't think he should be modernised - I think he should stay in that period."" Rupert's story is told through a series of panels, which along with a front cover, can take six months to create Gill Rennie, curator at Seven Stories, believes there still is a place for Rupert, despite today's hi-tech world being a far cry from the quaintness of Nutwood. ""The world he lives in is like a nostalgic adventuring world but it's probably not the most accessible for children getting into reading today,"" she says. ""The annuals are a big thing in British Christmas culture, and it's lovely that Rupert has been kept alive in that way. That goes back to classic children's book characters or children's cartoon characters; they become part of culture, whether or not you have read every story."" She said although most people knew who Alice from Alice's Adventures In Wonderland was, few would have read the whole of the Lewis Carroll book. ""That doesn't really matter because she lives on and she can be adapted and that's good, that's creative, and I think that's the same for Rupert,"" Ms Rennie adds. Rupert, with his familiar checked trousers, first appeared in the Daily Express on 8 November 1920 Rupert and his friends did receive a makeover more than a decade ago when they appeared in a new series on Channel 5, aimed at younger children. So are his older fans worried about the latest version of their beloved bear? The Followers of Rupert, who meet every year, are very protective of the character ""We have an open mind as long as it keeps the original ethos,"" says John Swan, chairman of the Followers of Rupert, which has about 600 members. The society was formed in 1984 and takes its name from the slogan: ""Follow Rupert every day in the Daily Express"". Illustrator Bestall even attended the society's first meeting. The group meets each year, although the long-awaited centenary event has had to be postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Many of the fans appreciate the artwork, the illustrations, and we talk about that,"" says John, who lives in Whitley Bay. ""We don't all wear yellow trousers,"" he explains.

"Kamala Harris savoured the moment she became the first woman, and the first black and Asian American, to be vice-president-elect, with a very hearty laugh. In a video posted to her social media she shares the news with President-elect Joe Biden: ""We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!"" Her words are about him but the history of the moment is hers. Just over a year ago, as the senator from California hoping to win the Democratic nomination for presidency, she launched a potent attack on Joe Biden over race during a debate. Many thought it inflicted a serious blow on his ambitions. But by the end of the year her campaign was dead and it was Mr Biden who returned the 56-year-old to the national spotlight by putting her on his ticket. What happens now? What Biden's victory means for rest of world US election results in maps and charts Election results in full ""It is a big reversal of fortune for Kamala Harris,"" says Gil Duran, a communications director for Ms Harris in 2013 and who has critiqued her run for the presidential nomination. ""Many people didn't think she had the discipline and focus to ascend to a position in the White House so quickly... although people knew she had ambition and star potential. It was always clear that she had the raw talent."" What she has demonstrated from the moment she took the national stage with her pitch for the presidency - is grit. Born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents - an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father - her parents divorced when she was five and she was primarily raised by her Hindu single mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist. Kamala as child with her mother and younger sister Maya She grew up engaged with her Indian heritage, joining her mother on visits to India, but Ms Harris has said that her mother adopted Oakland's black culture, immersing her two daughters - Kamala and her younger sister Maya - within it. ""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she wrote in her autobiography The Truths We Hold. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women."" This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Her biracial roots and upbringing mean she embodies and can engage with and appeal to many American identities. Those parts of the country which have seen rapid demographic change, enough change to alter a region's politics, see an aspirational symbol in her. But it was her time at Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities, which she has described as among the most formative experiences of her life. Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Americast: Kamala Harris makes history Profile: Kamala Harris (audio) Lita Rosario-Richardson met Kamala Harris while at Howard in the 1980s when students would gather in the Yard area of the campus to hang out and discuss politics, fashion and gossip. ""I noticed she had a keen sense of argumentation."" They bonded over an aptitude for energetic debate with campus Republicans, their experience growing up with single mothers, even just both being the Libra star sign. It was a formative era politically too. ""Reagan was president at the time and it was the apartheid era and there was a lot of talk about divestiture with 'trans Africa"" and the Martin Luther King  holiday issue,"" Ms Rosario-Richardson says. ""We know that, being descendants of enslaved people and people of colour coming out of colonisation, that we have a special role and having an education gives us a special position in society to help effect change,"" she explains - it was a philosophy and a call to action that was part of the university experience Ms Harris lived. She returned to address students at Howard in 2017 and  took them on a journey from the Ferguson race protests of 2014 to the halls of Capitol Hill in just one sentence: ""You students have joined the fight for justice - you protested. From the streets of Ferguson to the halls of the United States Congress, you have lived the words of James Baldwin, 'There is never a time in the future in which we will work out our salvation. The challenge is in the moment, the time is always now.'"" But Ms Harris also operates with ease in predominantly white communities. Her early years included a brief period in Canada. When Ms Gopalan Harris took a job teaching at McGill University, Ms Harris and her younger sister Maya went with her, attending school in Montreal for five years. Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as an ""American"". Shetold the Washington Post,externalin 2019, that politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. ""My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,"" she said. In 2014, Senator Harris married lawyer Doug Emhoff - now a fixture at her campaign stops - and became stepmother to his two children. Last year shewrote an article for Elle magazine,externalabout the experience of becoming a stepmother and unveiled the name that would then come to dominate many headlines that followed. ""When Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom'. Instead they came up with the name 'Momala'."" They were portrayed as the epitome of modern American ""blended"" family, an image the media took to and one that occupied many column inches about how we talk about female politicians. On becoming vice-president-elect, she is unlikely to lose this nickname but many argue she should also be seen and recognised as the descendant of another kind of family and that is the inheritor of generations of black female activists. ""She is heir to a legacy of grassroots organisers, elected officials, and unsuccessful candidates who paved this path to the White House. Black women are seen as a political force of nature in democratic politics and the Democratic party,"" Nadia Brown, associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, told the BBC. Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Septima Clark are some of the names she follows in the footsteps of, Ms Brown argues. ""Her win is historic but it is not hers alone. It is shared with countless black women who made this day possible."" But from the very earliest, as her friend Ms Rosario-Richardson attests, she showed the skills that allowed her to be one of few women to break through barriers. ""That is what attracted me to get her to join debate team [at Howard University], a fearlessness."" Wit and humour is part of that armoury. The laugh she greeted the president-elect with, when making that first momentous phone call, was one her friend recognised immediately and intimately. ""It clearly shows her personality, even in the short time she has been on the campaign trail."" ""She has always had that laugh, she has always had a sense of humour too, she had a sense of wit - even in the context of a university debate -  to get those points across."" The ability to deliver zingers to her opponents in live debate was very much part of the momentum behind the start of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.  She wasn't afraid of confrontation as in this Twitter exchange with Donald Trump Jr last October. ""Why is @KamalaHarris the only person that laughs at her jokes... always way to long and way too hard?"" Mr Trump's son asked. ""You wouldn't know a joke if one raised you,"" she wrote back. A simple burn on social media, but a popular shorthand for the kind of skills that meant a career in law and politics was a natural fit. Although her career as a prosecutor is what made her a politician, it brought with it political benefits and risks. She began work in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office and became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first black person to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. She gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her election as California's junior US senator in 2017. Harris began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office in Oakland, California. But straddling the line between pleasing left-leaning California Democrats and being a politician for a nation where the left does not decide who gets to be president has been hard. She gained favour among progressives for her acerbic questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, but as a presidential candidate for the Democratic Party her adept debate performances were not enough to compensate for poorly articulated policies. Where did it go wrong for Kamala Harris? When Harris could draw a crowd of 20,000 Walking the fine line between the progressive and moderate wings of her party, she ended up appealing to neither. Despite leftward leanings on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty, she faced repeated attacks for not really being progressive enough. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record ""Kamala is a cop"" became a common refrain on the campaign trail. But those same law enforcement credentials proved beneficial on the national stage when Democrats needed to win over more moderate voters and independents. She was ""someone with a law enforcement background, and perceived in her own state as being insufficiently progressive... and trying to project an inauthentic self"", Mr Duran says, but adds ""that looks very different in a vice-presidential slot"". As the US grapples with an ongoing racial reckoning and there is scrutiny over police brutality, Ms Harris has taken a front row seat, using her sizable microphone. Kamala Harris endorsed Joe Biden two months after quitting the race Majority of Americans don't support 'defunding' the police On talk shows she calls for changes to police practices across the US, on Twitter she calls for the arrests of the police officers who killed Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African-American woman from Kentucky, and she speaks frequently about the need to dismantle systemic racism. She has the law enforcement background but she has often said that her identity makes her uniquely suited to represent those on the margins. Now she has the chance to do just that and from inside the White House. The US state looking to take down Trump Where did it go wrong for Kamala Harris?

"Trump arrives back at the White House after playing golf Over the past four years, I have seen President Donald Trump on good days and bad days. But 7 November, the day he lost the election, was a day like no other. Dressed in a black windbreaker, dark trousers and a white MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat the president left the White House a few minutes before 10:00.He had spent the early part of his day tweeting,externalabout election fraud. Now he leaned forward slightly, as if he were pushing into the wind. He climbed into a dark vehicle and headed to his golf club, Trump National in Sterling, Virginia, about 25 miles (40km) from the White House. In that moment, he projected an air of confidence. It was a lovely day, perfect for golf, and he was going to spend the day at the club. But the people who worked for him seemed on edge. ""How are you doing?"" I asked one of the junior staffers. ""Fine,"" she said. She smiled, but her eyes narrowed. She looked down at her phone. The White House has been through some trauma in the days since the election. It was only on Tuesday, but it feels like a lifetime ago. Many of the desks in the West Wing were empty when I walked through the building on Saturday morning. Several staffers have been infected with the coronavirus, and they were out of the office. Others were in quarantine. Then, starting at about 11:30, while the president was at his golf club, the BBC and the US networks began calling the election for Joe Biden, his Democratic rival. This video can not be played How US networks reported the Biden win I was sitting in an Italian restaurant about a mile from the club when I heard the news. I'm a member of the White House press pool, a small group of journalists who travel with the president. We were all waiting for him to emerge from the club. ""He's toxic,"" said one woman outside the restaurant, who had, like most of her neighbours in this Democratic-leaning area, voted for his rival. Others wondered aloud when the president would leave the club and go back to the White House. The minutes passed, then hours. ""He's taking his time,"" said a law-enforcement officer, quietly, to a colleague. The president was in no hurry to leave. At the club, he was surrounded by friends. Outside the gates, supporters shouted at me and the other reporters: ""Defund the media!"" This video can not be played Donald Trump is seen playing golf as Joe Biden's win is announced A woman in sturdy heels and a red-white-and-blue bandana carried a sign reading ""Stop the steal."" A man drove his truck up and down the road in front of the club flying several flags, including one depicting the president standing on a tank, as if he were commander of the world. It showed how his supporters see him and how Mr Trump has seen himself for the past four years. Finally, he headed out of the club and began his journey home. His critics were waiting - in the thousands. The president's motorcade roared through Virginia, with me riding in the motorcade in a van that narrowly avoided a crash on Fairfax County Parkway. Sirens blared. The closer we got to the White House, the bigger the crowds became: people were out to celebrate his defeat. Someone held up a sign: ""You lose and we all win."" People honked and jeered. Critics of the president were seen carrying placards on Saturday Then we got back at the White House, the president went in through a side door, an entrance that presidents rarely use. His shoulders were slumped, and his head down. He glanced over and saw me and the others in the press pool and gave us a thumbs-up. It was a half-hearted gesture; he did not raise his hand high or shake a fist, the way he often does. Whether at the White House or at the golf club, the president has never wavered: he makes unsubstantiated claims about election fraud and insists he will be vindicated. He tweeted in the morning about ""illegally received"" votes and by late afternoon he was declaring defiantly in all caps. ""I WON THE ELECTION."" Allow Twitter content?

"The council said the sinkhole had been caused by surface water running onto the road from farmland A main road has reopened after a sinkhole the ""width of three houses"" was repaired. South Gower Road in Swansea was closed on 1 Octoberafter the sinkhole was found and deemed to be at ""risk of imminent collapse"". Swansea council closed the A4118 between Penmaen and the turn-off to Oxwich for emergency repairs. The authority said the sinkhole had been caused by surface water running onto the road from farmland. In a statement the council said this was complicated by the ""presence of voids in the rock beneath the road"".

Cabinet Member for Environment Enhancement and Infrastructure Management Mark Thomas said: ""Early fears that the subsidence has been caused by the large voids deep in the ground were fortunately not the case. ""However, running water had created some smaller voids much nearer the road surface and it was this issue that had caused the problem.""

"This video can not be played Socially-distanced events have taken place across the UK, including at the Cenotaph in London The Queen has led the nation in marking Remembrance Sunday, as people around the UK privately paid their respects at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. She was joined by family members and the PM at the scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed off to the public for the first time. Following a two-minute silence, wreaths were laid by Prince Charles, Prince William and the PM, among others. The commemorations remember the armed forces community, British and Commonwealth veterans, the allies who fought alongside the UK and the civilian servicemen and women involved in the two world wars and later conflicts. Normally, Whitehall is packed with thousands of veterans and members of the military for the commemorations, but on Sunday less than 30 veterans were in attendance. The Queen, dressed in a black hat and coat, looked on from a balcony at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office building, as her son, the Prince of Wales, laid a wreath on her behalf. Others who took part in the wreath laying included the Duke of Cambridge, the Princess Royal and Earl of Wessex, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer. Also present at the service were former UK prime ministers Theresa May, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Sir John Major. In pictures: How the UK marked Remembrance Sunday The Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge attended the service Prime Minister Boris Johnson was joined by former leaders Theresa May, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Sir John Major Prince Charles laid a wreath on behalf of the Queen Prince William was also among those who laid a wreath It felt the same on Whitehall this year, but also really quite different. At the heart of the ceremony, as ever, was the Cenotaph - the simple stone memorial to the dead of so many conflicts, unveiled a century ago by George V, overlooked on Sunday by the Queen on a Foreign Office balcony. There was the familiar and always-moving grandeur of the two-minute silence, the wreath laying, the solemn contemplation of so much sacrifice and loss. But missing were the members of the public who normally travel from all over the country to be here, who stand three or four-deep along the barriers that line either side of Whitehall. Missing too were the great number of military veterans who march past the Cenotaph after the wreath-laying. The public and the veterans bring life to this commemoration of loss - they ground this remembrance and make it more personal, more sharply felt. Remembrance Sunday belongs to those who gave - their lives, their health, their loved ones. Everyone here in Whitehall will hope that next year will see the public and military veterans return. Members of the Royal Navy marched down Whitehall ahead of the Remembrance Sunday service The Duke of Sussex, who stepped down as a working member of the Royal Family and now lives in California, was not at the ceremony but spoke about what serving his country means to him. In a podcast to mark Remembrance Sunday, Harry, who spent 10 years in the armed forces, said: ""Being able to wear my uniform, being able to stand up in service of one's country, these are amongst the greatest honours there are in life. ""To me, the uniform is a symbol of something much bigger, it's symbolic of our commitment to protecting our country, as well as protecting our values. ""These values are put in action through service, and service is what happens in the quiet and in the chaos."" General Sir Nick Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, said some veterans might find Remembrance Sunday a lonely experience this year due to the Covid-19 restrictions. Sir Nick told the BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the guidelines would be ""particularly tough on our veterans"", adding: ""They traditionally have had the opportunity to get together and talk about their memories and their reflections, but equally to strut their stuff."" Usually, about 10,000 people gather at the Cenotaph in Whitehall for the remembrance service. But with the event being closed to the public, the Royal British Legion and Legion Scotland advised people to observe the silence in honour of those who lost their lives in conflicts from their doorsteps. The public was also encouraged to share family histories and messages of remembrance online using the hashtag #WeWillRememberThem.

Speaking at Saturday's annual Festival of Remembrance at London's Royal Albert Hall, which was pre-recorded and filmed without an audience, the Prince of Wales said the country had endured ""anxiety and grief not previously experienced in peacetime"". ""In this challenging year, we have perhaps come to realise that the freedoms for which they fought are more precious than we knew, and that the debt we owe them is even greater than we imagined,"" he said.

She was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time during the visit. The 94-year-old monarch had requested the private pilgrimage after she was advised not to attend the warrior's centenary service next week.

"This video can not be played 'The families deserve the U-turn' - Rashford The government is to spend more than Â£400m to support poor children and their families in England, following a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford. A winter grant scheme, to be run by councils, will provide support with food and bills, and a holiday food and activities programme is to be expanded. Rashford said it would improve the lives of almost 1.7 million children. The move represents a climbdown for the government, which had said Universal Credit was the best way to help. From the package of support, a Â£170m ring-fenced fund will be distributed through councils, with at least 80% earmarked for help with food and bills. This will receive funding from the beginning of December until the end of March. The holiday food and activities programme will be expanded with a Â£220m investment to cover Easter, summer and Christmas in 2021. On top of that, there will be a Â£16m cash boost for the nation's food banks. Rashford renews call for an end to child hunger Government changes its mind after Rashford campaign Rashford becomes MBE in birthday honours Rashford: 'No child should be going to bed hungry' Prime Minister Boris Johnson telephoned the Manchester United and England player on Saturday to tell him of the new plans. Speaking after he took part in United's 3-1 Premier League win against Everton, Rashford said: ""Following the game today, I had a good conversation with the prime minister to better understand the proposed plan, and I very much welcome the steps that have been taken to combat child food poverty in the UK."" Rashford said he remained concerned about the children who would miss out on help ""because their family income isn't quite low enough"". However, he added: ""The intent the government have shown today is nothing but positive and they should be recognised for that. ""The steps made today will improve the lives of near 1.7 million children in the UK over the next 12 months, and that can only be celebrated."" Rashford also told the BBC Mr Johnson had agreed to speak with the footballer's child food poverty taskforce. ""I am fully committed to this cause, and I will fight for the rest of my life for it, because in my mind, no child should ever go hungry in the United Kingdom,"" the player said. Seeing the role everyone had played in supporting the most vulnerable children had been ""the greatest moment of my life,"" he added. Rashford's campaign began in June, after the government insisted it would not provide vouchers over the summer holidays for the 1.3 million children in England who were receiving free school meals in term time. The government had previously given this support during the first coronavirus lockdown in April. Rashford's campaignled to the government changing its policyto allow children to claim free meals during the summer holidays. The footballer then called for free meals to be provided over the October half-term, with more than a million people signing a petition he set up. But the government refused, saying enough support was being provided through the benefit system. Last month, it whipped Conservative MPs to vote against a Labour motion in the House of Commons that called for the extension of free school meal provision. This prompted a number of local authorities to say they would continue offering free school meals throughout the week's holiday in spite of that. In October, a Downing Street spokesman said it was ""not for schools to regularly provide food to pupils during the school holidays."" They added: ""We believe the best way to support families outside of term time is through Universal Credit rather than government subsidising meals."" Marcus Rashford has prompted the government to act before. Now he's done it again. It is the second time the prime minister has picked up the phone to the 23-year-old footballer, whose campaign has struck a chord with many, and left many Conservatives acknowledging privately for some time they would have to change tack. Strikingly, Rashford insists this isn't about politics, or criticising Boris Johnson, it's about helping poor families. ""We're not against him. That's the main reason I was happy to talk to him,"" he told BBC Breakfast. But what also stands out is he's moving onto the next strand of his campaign - arguing that more families should get help. Given his success so far, don't bet against him pursuing this pretty doggedly in the months ahead. Announcing the support package, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the government knew it was a challenging time for many, and insisted it had consistently supported the lowest paid families by boosting welfare support. ""We want to make sure vulnerable people are cared for throughout this difficult time and, above all, no one should go hungry or be unable to pay their bills this winter,"" she added. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said Labour had been campaigning for such a change, adding: ""This should have been announced weeks ago to help the children at risk of going hungry over half term."" She added that ministers needed to bring forward a long-term plan to child poverty. England's children's commissioner Anne Longfield welcomed the move but called on ministers to ""go further"" with Universal Credit support by retaining a Â£20 increase. ""Hunger does not take a holiday when schools close and a long-term solution to the growing number of children in poverty is urgently needed,"" she said. Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, who also chairs the End Child Poverty Coalition, said Rashford deserved ""enormous credit for pushing the issue of poverty to the top of the public's agenda"", adding that the government should be acknowledged for ""listening"". James Toop, chief executive, of food charity Bite Back 2030, said: ""It's great that Boris has listened to the voices of our young people who have been campaigning for meal provision through the holidays to be a priority through this crisis."" Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said the scheme was particularly welcome. ""Christmas will not be the same this year - and it is therefore even more important that we ensure that children have food and are kept warm."" Head teachers also welcomed the scheme but questioned why it could not have been in place for October's half term. Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders' union the NAHT, said while the expansion of the activities programme was a positive move, it ""falls short in addressing fully the issue of holiday hunger"". He added: ""We would question whether provision of food to those going hungry should be dependent upon them attending an activity, which for a whole host of reasons might not be suitable, available or accessible for particular groups."" The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the winter grant would help them find the best way to help families and individuals most in need, but called on the government to ""adequately fund councils so they can provide wider long-term preventative support to all households who need it"".

Marcus Rashford has prompted the government to act before. Now he's done it again. It is the second time the prime minister has picked up the phone to the 23-year-old footballer, whose campaign has struck a chord with many, and left many Conservatives acknowledging privately for some time they would have to change tack. Strikingly, Rashford insists this isn't about politics, or criticising Boris Johnson, it's about helping poor families. ""We're not against him. That's the main reason I was happy to talk to him,"" he told BBC Breakfast. But what also stands out is he's moving onto the next strand of his campaign - arguing that more families should get help. Given his success so far, don't bet against him pursuing this pretty doggedly in the months ahead. Announcing the support package, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the government knew it was a challenging time for many, and insisted it had consistently supported the lowest paid families by boosting welfare support. ""We want to make sure vulnerable people are cared for throughout this difficult time and, above all, no one should go hungry or be unable to pay their bills this winter,"" she added. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said Labour had been campaigning for such a change, adding: ""This should have been announced weeks ago to help the children at risk of going hungry over half term."" She added that ministers needed to bring forward a long-term plan to child poverty. England's children's commissioner Anne Longfield welcomed the move but called on ministers to ""go further"" with Universal Credit support by retaining a Â£20 increase. ""Hunger does not take a holiday when schools close and a long-term solution to the growing number of children in poverty is urgently needed,"" she said. Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, who also chairs the End Child Poverty Coalition, said Rashford deserved ""enormous credit for pushing the issue of poverty to the top of the public's agenda"", adding that the government should be acknowledged for ""listening"". James Toop, chief executive, of food charity Bite Back 2030, said: ""It's great that Boris has listened to the voices of our young people who have been campaigning for meal provision through the holidays to be a priority through this crisis."" Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said the scheme was particularly welcome. ""Christmas will not be the same this year - and it is therefore even more important that we ensure that children have food and are kept warm."" Head teachers also welcomed the scheme but questioned why it could not have been in place for October's half term. Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders' union the NAHT, said while the expansion of the activities programme was a positive move, it ""falls short in addressing fully the issue of holiday hunger"". He added: ""We would question whether provision of food to those going hungry should be dependent upon them attending an activity, which for a whole host of reasons might not be suitable, available or accessible for particular groups."" The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the winter grant would help them find the best way to help families and individuals most in need, but called on the government to ""adequately fund councils so they can provide wider long-term preventative support to all households who need it"".

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader. ""He wants to bring people together, both within the United States of America where he's already talking about unifying the country,"" he says. ""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

The BBC projects that Mr Biden has won the key battleground of Pennsylvania, propelling him over the 270 electoral college vote threshold required to clinch the White House. The Trump campaign has indicated their candidate does not plan to concede. Mr Biden said it was now time for America to ""unite and heal"". ""With the campaign over, it's time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation,"" he said.

Five questions for Biden on the economy Follow all the latest live updates Joe Biden and a life in politics US election results in maps and charts Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? The BBC's projection of Mr Biden's victory is based on the unofficial results from states that have already finished counting their votes, and the expected results from states like Wisconsin where the count is continuing. His projected wins in Pennsylvania and now also Nevada take him to 279 electoral college votes. The election has seen the highest turnout since 1900. Mr Biden has won more than 74 million votes so far, the most ever for a US presidential candidate. Mr Trump returning to the White House after Mr Biden was projected to win Offering his congratulations, former President Barack Obama, with whom Mr Biden served two terms as vice-president, said: ""I know he'll do the job with the best interests of every American at heart, whether or not he had their vote."" Biden supporters have been gathering in the streets on New York and other cities to celebrate victory. Mr Trump has drawn more than 70 million, the second-highest tally in history. President Trump had falsely declared himself the winner of the election when vote counting was unfinished. He has since alleged irregularities in counting, but has not presented any evidence of election fraud. After Mr Biden was projected to win he remained defiant, saying Mr Biden was ""falsely posing as the winner"" and insisting the election was ""far from over"". His campaign has filed a barrage of lawsuits in various states. This video can not be played Donald Trump is seen playing golf as Joe Biden's win was announced The response from senior Republicans has been muted. Republican Party Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted that ""the media doesn't decide who wins elections, voters do"". But Senator Mitt Romney, a critic of Mr Trump, congratulated Mr Biden and Ms Harris. He said he and his wife ""know both of them as people of good will and admirable character"". 'Let's work together!' - How world reacted to Biden win The election was fought as coronavirus cases and deaths continued to rise across the United States, with President Trump arguing a Biden presidency would result in lockdowns and economic gloom. Joe Biden accused the president of failing to impose sufficient measures to control the spread of Covid-19. At the age of 78, Mr Biden will be the oldest president in American history. Joe Biden's projected victory after four days of painstaking vote-counting is the denouement of an extraordinary campaign, conducted during a devastating pandemic and widespread social unrest, and against a most unconventional of incumbents. In his third try for the presidency, Mr Biden found a way to navigate the political obstacles and claim a win that, while perhaps narrow in the electoral college tally, is projected to surpass Mr Trump's overall national total by at least four million votes. With his projected victory, Joe Biden becomes the oldest man ever elected to the White House. He brings with him the first woman vice-president, whose multi-ethnic heritage carries with it numerous other firsts. Mr Biden can now begin the arduous task of planning the transition to his new administration. He will have just under three months to assemble a cabinet, determine policy priorities and prepare to govern a nation facing numerous crises and sharply divided along partisan lines. Joe Biden has been dreaming of the White House for most of his 50 years in the public arena. With this prize of a lifetime, however, come the challenges of a lifetime. Usually the losing candidate concedes but Mr Trump has vowed to contest the election results on several fronts. A recount will be held in Georgia, where the margins are tight, and Mr Trump wants the same in Wisconsin. He has also vowed to take legal action to the Supreme Court, alleging voting fraud without evidence. If the election result is challenged, it would require legal teams to challenge this in the state courts. State judges would then need to uphold the challenge and order a recount, and Supreme Court justices could then be asked to overturn a ruling. Read more: Could the election be decided in courts? Meanwhile, votes in some states are continuing to be counted and results are never official until final certification, which occurs in each state in the weeks following the election. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? This must be done before 538 chosen officials (electors) from the Electoral College - which officially decides who wins the election - meet in their state capitals to vote on 14 December. The electors' votes usually mirror the popular vote in each state. However, in some states this is not a formal requirement. The new president is officially sworn into office on 20 January after a transition period to give them time to appoint cabinet ministers and make plans. The handover of power takes place at a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC. After the ceremony, the new president makes their way to the White House to begin their four-year term in office. Mr Biden ran for the White House twice before. In 1988 he withdrew from the race after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British Labour Party, Neil Kinnock. In 2008, he tried again to get the Democratic nomination before dropping out and joining Barack Obama's ticket. His eight years as vice-president allowed him to lay claim to much of Mr Obama's legacy, including passage of the Affordable Care Act. In 1974, Biden was the youngest US senator The six-term senator from Delaware was first elected in 1972. Early in his career, he sided with southern segregationists in opposing court-ordered school bussing to racially integrate public schools. He was also a fierce advocate of a 1994 anti-crime bill that many on the left now say encouraged lengthy sentences and mass incarceration. Joe Biden lost his son Beau (left) in 2015 Most Americans know that Joe Biden's life has been marked by personal tragedy - experiences he often refers to. In 1972, he lost his first wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, in a car accident. He famously took the oath of office for his first Senate term from the hospital room of his toddler sons Beau and Hunter, who both survived the accident. In 2015, Beau died of brain cancer at the age of 46, and Joe Biden said this played a role in his decision not run for president in 2016. Watch the moment BBC projects Biden victory What happens now?

"Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as a running mate, helped keep centrist voters on-side After nearly 50 years in public office, and a lifetime of presidential ambitions, Joe Biden has captured the White House. It was not the campaign anyone predicted. It took place amidst a once-in-a-century pandemic and unprecedented social unrest. He was running against an unconventional, precedent-defying incumbent. But in his third try for the presidency, Biden and his team found a way to navigate the political obstacles and claim a victory that, while narrow in the electoral college tally, is projected to surpass Trump's overall national total by millions of votes. Latest updates and analysis US election results in maps and charts Why Donald Trump lost These are the five reasons the son of a car salesman from Delaware finally won the presidency. Perhaps the biggest reason Biden won the presidency was something entirely out of his control. The coronavirus pandemic, as well as claiming more than 230,000 lives, also transformed American life and politics in 2020. And in the final days of the general election campaign, Donald Trump himself seemed to acknowledge this. ""With the fake news, everything is Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid,"" the president said at a rally last week in Wisconsin, where cases have spiked in recent days. The media focus on Covid, however, was a reflection rather than a driver of the public's concern about the pandemic - which translated into unfavourable polling on the president's handling of the crisis. A poll last month by Pew Research, suggested Biden held a 17 percentage point lead over Trump when it came to confidence about their handling of the Covid outbreak. This video can not be played How much is Covid-19 an election issue? The pandemic and the subsequent economic decline knocked Trump off his preferred campaign message of growth and prosperity. It also highlighted concerns that many Americans had about his presidency, over its occasional lack of focus, penchant for questioning science, haphazard handling of policies large and small, and prioritisation of the partisan. The pandemic was a lead weight on Trump's approval ratings, which,according to Gallup, dipped to 38% at one point,externalin the summer - one that the Biden campaign exploited. Over the course of his political career, Biden established a well-earned reputation for talking himself into trouble. His propensity for gaffes derailed his first presidential campaign in 1987, and helped ensure that he never had much of a shot when he ran again in 2007. Joe Biden - 40 years of political ambition In his third try for the Oval Office, Biden still had his share of verbal stumbles, but they were sufficiently infrequent that they never became more than a short-term issue. Part of the explanation for this, of course, is that the president himself was an unrelenting source of news cycle churn. Another factor was that there were bigger stories - the coronavirus pandemic, protests after the death of George Floyd and economic disruption - dominating national attention. This video can not be played A tale of two rallies: Trump and Biden stage duelling events in Florida But at least some credit should be given to a concerted strategy by the Biden campaign to limit their candidate's exposure, keeping a measured pace in the campaign, and minimising the chances that fatigue or carelessness could create problems. Perhaps in a normal election, when most Americans weren't worried about limiting their own exposure to a virus, this strategy would have backfired. Maybe then Trump's derisive ""hidin' Biden"" jabs would have taken their toll. The campaign sought to stay out of the way and let Trump be the one whose mouth betrayed him - and, in the end, it paid off. The week before election day, the Biden campaign unveiled its final television adverts with a message that was remarkably similar to the one offered in his campaign kickoff last year, and his nomination acceptance speech in August. The election was a ""battle for the soul of America"", he said, and a chance for the national to put what he characterised as the divisiveness and chaos of the past four years behind it. The election became a referendum on Trump Beneath that slogan, however, was a simple calculation. Biden bet his political fortunes on the contention that Trump was too polarising and too inflammatory, and what the American people wanted was calmer, steadier leadership. ""I'm just exhausted by Trump's attitude as a person,"" says Thierry Adams, a native of France who after 18 years living in Florida cast his first vote in a presidential election in Miami last week. Democrats succeeded in making this election a referendum on Trump, not a binary choice between the two candidates. Biden's winning message was simply that he was ""not Trump"". A common refrain from Democrats was that a Biden victory meant Americans could go for weeks without thinking about politics. It was meant as a joke, but it contained a kernel of truth. During the campaign to be the Democratic candidate, Biden's competition came from his left, with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who ran well-financed and organised campaigns that generated rock-concert sized crowds. Despite this pressure from his liberal flank, Biden stuck with a centrist strategy, refusing to back universal government-run healthcare, free college education, or a wealth tax. This allowed him maximise his appeal to moderates and disaffected Republicans during the general election campaign. This strategy was reflected in Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as his running mate when he could have opted for someone with stronger support from the party's left wing. This video can not be played Biden was not first choice for most young Democrats, but he listened to their priorities The one place where Biden moved closer to Sanders and Warren was on the environment and climate-change - perhaps calculating that the benefits of appealing to younger voters for whom the issue is a priority was worth the risk of alienating voters in energy-dependent swing-state industries. It was the exception, however, that proved the rule. ""It's no secret that we've been critical of Vice-President's Biden's plans and commitments in the past,"" said Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the environmental activist group the Sunrise Movement in July. ""He's responded to many of those criticisms: dramatically increasing the scale and urgency of investments, filling in details on how he'd achieve environmental justice and create good union jobs, and promising immediate action."" Earlier this year, Biden's campaign coffers were running on empty. He entered the general election campaign at a decided disadvantage to Trump, who had spent virtually his entire presidency amassing a campaign war chest that approached a billion dollars. From April onward, however, the Biden campaign transformed itself into a fundraising juggernaut, and - in part because of profligacy on the part of the Trump campaign - ended up in a much stronger financial position than his opponent. At the beginning of October, the Biden campaign had $144m more cash on hand than the Trump operation, allowing it to bury the Republicans in a torrent of television advertising in almost every key battleground state. A Biden supporter in Texas, where a cash advantage enabled him to spend campaign money Money isn't everything, of course. Four years ago, the Clinton campaign had a sizeable monetary lead over Trump's shoestring operation. But in 2020, when in-person campaigning was curtailed by coronavirus and Americans across the country spent considerably more time consuming media in their homes, Biden's cash advantage let him reach voters and push his message out until the very end. It allowed him to expand the electoral map, putting money into what once seemed to be longshot states like Texas, Georgia, Ohio and Iowa. Most of those bets didn't pay off, but he put Trump on the defence, flipping what was once reliably conservative Arizona and staying highly competitive in Georgia. Money gives a campaign options and initiative - and Biden put his advantage to good use. What happens now?

"Let the 2020 election bury the mistaken notion once and for all that the 2016 election was a historical accident, an American aberration. Donald Trump won more than 70 million votes, the second highest total in American history. Nationally, he has more than a 47% share of his vote, and looks to have won 24 states, including his beloved Florida and Texas. He has an extraordinary hold over large swathes of this country, a visceral connection that among thousands of supporters has brought a near cult-like devotion. After four years in the White House, his supporters studied the fine print of his presidency and clicked enthusiastically on the terms and conditions. Any analysis of his political weakness in 2020 also has to acknowledge his political strength. However, he was defeated, becoming one of only four incumbents in the modern era not to get another four years. Also he has become the first president to lose the popular vote in consecutive elections. Live updates with reaction and analysis Five reasons Biden won the election Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 partly because he was a norm-busting political outsider who was prepared to say what had previously been unsayable. But Donald Trump also lost the presidency in 2020 partly because he was a norm-busting political outsider who was prepared to say what had previously been unsayable. Though much of the Trump base might well have voted for him if he had shot someone on Fifth Avenue, his infamous boast from four years ago, others who supported him four years ago were put off by his aggressive behaviour. This was especially true in the suburbs. Joe Biden improved on Hillary Clinton's performance in 373 suburban counties, helping him claw back the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, and enabling him to gain Georgia and Arizona. Donald Trump has a particular problem with suburban women. We witnessed again in the 2020 presidential election what we had seen in the 2018 mid-term election - more highly-educated Republicans, some of whom had voted for Trump four years ago prepared to give him a chance, thought his presidency was too unpresidential. Though they understood he would be unconventional, many found the manner in which he defied so many customs and behavioural norms off-putting and often offensive. This video can not be played How US networks reported the Biden win They were put off by his aggressiveness. His stoking of racial tensions. His use of racist language in tweets maligning people of colour. His failure, on occasions, to adequately condemn white supremacy. His trashing of America's traditional allies and his admiration for authoritarian strongmen, such as Vladimir Putin. His strange boasts about being ""a very stable genius"" and the like. His promotion of conspiracy theories. His use of a lingua franca that sometimes made him sound more like a crime boss, such as when he described his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors, as ""a rat"". What happens now? Making history - the first woman vice-president What Biden's victory means for rest of world US election results in maps and charts Election results in full Then there was what critics derided as his creeping authoritarianism, seen after the election in his refusal to accept the result. A telling moment for me during this campaign came in Pittsburgh, when I chatted with Chuck Howenstein on the stoop of his terraced home. A Trump supporter in 2016, he voted for Joe Biden. ""People are tired,"" he told me. ""They want to see normalcy back in this country. They want to see decency. They want to see this hatred stop. They want to see this country united. And that together is going to bring Joe Biden the presidency."" A political problem for Trump was that he failed to expand his support beyond his core Trump base. Nor did he try hard to do so. In 2016, he won 30 states and often governed as if he was the president solely of conservative, red America. The most deliberately divisive president of the past 100 years, he made little attempt to woo blue America, the 20 states that voted for Hillary Clinton. After four exhausting years, many voters simply wanted a presidency they could have on in the background - an occupant of the White House who would behave in a more conventional manner. They had tired of the infantile name-calling, the ugly language and the ceaseless confrontation. They wanted a return to some kind of normalcy. But the 2020 election was not a re-run of the 2016 election. This time he was the incumbent, not the insurgent. He had a record to defend, including his mishandling of a coronavirus outbreak which by Election Day had killed more than 230,000 Americans. In this age of negative partisanship, where politics is often driven by loathing of the opposition, he was not pitted against a hate figure like Hillary Clinton. The defining moment of the Trump presidency The night American democracy hit rock bottom A letter to our newborn American daughter The time when America stopped being great Joe Biden was hard to demonise, which is partly why the Democratic establishment was so keen to have him as its presidential nominee. This 77-year-old centrist also did the job he was hired to do, which was to claw back white working class voters in the Rust Belt. The question of why Trump lost the presidency turns also on a more interesting and arguable question - when did he lose the presidency? Was it in the immediate aftermath of his victory in 2016, when people who had voted for Trump partly as a protest vote against the Washington political establishment instantly had misgivings? After all, many of those voters never expected him to win. Was it in the first 24 hours of his presidency, when he delivered his ""American Carnage"" inaugural address - which portrayed the country as a near dystopia of shuttered factories, left-behind workers and wealth ""ripped"" from middle class homes - before he ranted about the crowd size and vowed to continue using Twitter? By sundown of his first full day in charge, it had become clear that Donald Trump would seek to change the presidency more than the presidency changed him. Was it more cumulative, the snowball effect of so many scandals, so many slurs, so much staff turn-over, and so much chaos? Or was it as a result of the coronavirus, the biggest crisis that engulfed his presidency? Before the virus arrived on these shores, Trump's political vital signs were strong. He had survived his impeachment trial. His approval ratings matched the highest level it had been - 49%. He could boast a strong economy and the advantage of incumbency: the twin factors that usually secure a sitting president a second term. Often presidential elections turn on a simple question: is the country better off now than it was four years ago? After Covid hit, and the economic crisis that followed, it became almost impossible to make that case. This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus But it is wrong to say that the Trump presidency was inevitably doomed by the coronavirus. Presidents often emerge from national convulsions stronger. Crises can often bring out greatness. That was true for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose rescuing of America from the Great Depression made him politically unassailable. George W Bush's initial response to the attacks of September 11th also boosted his popularity, and helped him win a second term. So it was by no means preordained that Covid would finish Donald Trump. It was his botched handling of the crisis that contributed to his fall. Still, again it is worth remembering that Donald Trump remained politically viable up until the end, despite the country experiencing its worst public health crisis in more than a 100 years, its biggest economic crisis since the 1930s and also its most widespread racial turbulence since the late 1960s. Much of red America, and much of a conservative movement he came to dominate, will yearn for his return. He will continue to be the dominant figure in the conservative movement for years to come. Trumpism could end up having the same transformative effect on American conservatism as Reaganism. The outgoing president will remain a deeply polarizing figure, and could run again in 2024. These disunited states have not suddenly become united again, not least because so many Americans will harbour such different emotions about Trump, ranging from devotion to abject hate. The country surely has not heard or seen the last of the most unorthodox president in its history. Follow Nick on Twitter,external Eat your way to power!Can a bacon sandwich affect your chances?

"The police's role in the coronavirus pandemic is simple: to ensure we follow national lockdown restrictions. But in practice, that is a huge challenge for officers who are being asked to monitor behaviour that, until March last year, was perfectly legal. Police chiefs have followed a system called ""The Four Es"". Before fines are issued to rule-breakers, police will first: Engage with people, to ask why they appear to be breaking the rules Explain the law, stressing the risks to public health and the NHS Encourage them to change their behaviour The fourth ""E"" is ""Enforce"" by issuing penalty notices, as a last resort. Covid rule-breakers are now ""increasingly likely"" to be finedby officers, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said. The police have a legal duty to make sure the rules are enforced, alongside council, environmental health and trading standards officers. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live If you break coronavirus regulations, you could get a fixed penalty notice , the Covid equivalent of a traffic offence like speeding. Since March, 32,000 have been issued in England and Wales. Penalties rose sharply during England's November lockdown. Almost 6,500 penalty tickets were handed out as police moved more quickly to enforcement. In England and Northern Ireland fines start at Â£200. Fines start at Â£60in Wales,external, andin Scotland,external, although this is reduced to Â£30 if paid within 28 days. Large parties can also be shut down by the police - with fines of up to Â£10,000. In extreme circumstances, you could be prosecuted and face an even greater fine imposed by a court. Hundreds of people were caught on a drone camera at an illegal party by West Midlands Police Yes. All of England is now in a ""tier four"" national lockdown, with similar measures in place across the rest of the UK. Under the new lockdown law, you must stay at home unless you have a ""reasonable excuse"" to be outside. Your home includes property such as a garden, shed or garage - and also access to it. The government's lockdown guidance sets outexamples of reasonable excuses,external. Police won't fine you for leaving home to go shopping for essential goods, or to use a business that can remain open, or for going to work or education, training or childcare. There are other reasonable excuses - such as helping other people in their moment of need. Police chiefs are telling frontline officers to use their judgement if they come across a situation not defined in the regulations. If you want to take part in a protest, the law does not define that as a reasonable excuse to leave home. There is, however, an exception for joining a picket as part of lawful industrial action. Exercise is one of the reasonable excuses for being outside in a public space. You cannot be fined for exercising. But there has been enormous confusion since last March over how long people could exercise for. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove pronounced that spring that he thought half an hour was enough. There are also questions over how far you can go to exercise. Boris Johnson has beencriticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Streetto go cycling during lockdown. There are no restrictions in law in England on how you exercise and for how long. You cannot exercise in groups, but you can run or go on a wander with someone else from your household, support bubble or one person you don't live with. The government's Covid guidance for exercise explains that law - andmixes it with a non-legal recommendation,externalto only go out once a day - and to stay local. It says local ""means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live"", but that has no legal force. Derbyshire Police have been taking the ""stay local"" principle seriously. Officers have issued tickets to people who drive five miles to their local beauty spot - includingtwo women accused of an illegal picnicbecause they were carrying takeaway cups of tea. They might. This refers to the ban on ""gatherings"". The last-but-one version of the restrictions made it a potential crime to ""mingle"". That language has now gone from the law - but the rules are far stricter. While the law in England doesn't criminalise bumping into someone in the street, you can no longer meet anyone socially - other than those in your household, support bubble or people you care for. The Home Office has given the police an extra Â£30m to pay for Covid patrols in England and Wales. Over Christmas there were more than 800 fines for what Home Secretary Priti Patel says were ""egregious"" breaches of the rules. The National Police Chiefs' Council hasn't abandoned the Four Es - but expect more fines and more officers asking people what they are doing. Leicester woman fined for Wales trip to see horse Group fined for playing dominoes in restaurant Border police patrols to double after travel ban Police patrols were stepped up around the Scotland-England border around Christmas For instance, the Metropolitan Police has told officers to issue fines ""more quickly"" to anyone committing obvious, wilful and serious breaches. Derbyshire Police, who famouslyput a drone up over hikersin the first lockdown, has issued a similar warning. Yes - while in shops and on public transport. You could face a fixed penalty notice if you don't. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? If you have returned from an overseas Covid hotspot, or have been told by the NHS Test and Trace system to stay at home, you must quarantine for 10 days. The police can now check the NHS Test and Trace database to investigate a tip-off about a quarantine-breaker. Police won't get to see your personal health records.
